1. what is bias words vs. framing?
2. can we get more student data (better quality)
3. why make the classifier better if it's being trained on bad data
4. can we remove blank sets of data
5. do we remove individual instances of "the, and, or", etc
6. can we take out the samples with too many instances of words "the, and, or"
7. 


sugggestions:
1. find places where the classifier gets it wrong, find patterns
2. any more features to include?
3. find patterns where gut feeling for validity is off
