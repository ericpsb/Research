MaineHealth Remains Completely Unaccountable for False Vaccine Claims.  So I Wrote a Bill.
" "
 
 
In our last installment of, \"Ginger goes bitchcakes about all the Pharma lies being proffered in Maine,\" we learned that  Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth had lied about vaccine safety , claiming that there were several vaxxed/unvaxxed studies and they all showed no increased autism rates in vaccinated kids.  Research that is as imaginary as the Power Puff Girls. 
 
I called her out on it and she only dug a deeper hole, and then said she would not talk to me anymore.  
 
So four months ago I decided to go on the fools errand of actually filing complaints against MaineHealth to get the false claims retracted and the company held accountable, just to prove that no one gives a damn... Wanna know what happened? 
 
 TL;DR: I filed complaints with every private, public, state and federal authority that might have oversight and no one gives a damn. 
 
Complaints were filed with: 
MaineHealth 
Maine Public Broadcasting Network 
Maine CDC, Maine Immunization Program 
Maine Bureau of Insurance 
Maine Immunization Coalition 
Maine DHHS Fraud Prevention, Maine Attorney General 
US Food and Drug Administration 
US Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics, Evaluation and Research 
US Federal Trade Comission 
... and the ONLY response I received was from FDA who said they didn't have jurisdiction.  No one is manning the gate. 
 
So in short... there you have it.  In Maine you can make ANY CLAIM YOU WANT ABOUT VACCINES and no one will do anything about it.  Precedent set. 
 
Below are all the letters, for your edification. 
 
So  I wrote a bill  to try to put a band-aid on the disaster that is the current vaccine program and a very conscientious State Representative, Beth O'Connor, has introduced it into the Maine Legislature.  I revived the  Maine Coalition for Vaccine Choice  and we are coming together to try to... do something... fix this... a bit... but honestly, until the 1986 act is repealed, our kids are going to continue to get sick and die and remain untreated at the hands of this screwed up program and all we will be able to do is stem the tide and keep our rights to opt out of it. 
 
Robert F. Kennedy, Jr is going to come to Maine on May 11th and help us get these legislators to understand how badly the vaccine program is broken and that parents need to retain the rights to choose.  Perhaps it will get enough people to understand the real problem that they will not put up with the corruption any more.  Cross fingers. 
 
The complaints: 
 
 
 To
the Maine Bureau of Insurance 
 
 
 
 
 I
would like to file a complaint against MaineHealth for making
fraudulent statements concerning one of their product lines. 
 
 
 
 MaineHealth,
both on the VaxMaineKids.org web site and during an interview on MPBN
on December 1, have made false vaccine safety claims.  I have
contacted VaxMaineKids, MaineHealth and MPBN to ask for a retraction
and correction of the false marketing messages that they are issuing
to the public, but none of the organizations will properly address
the issue. 
 
 
 
 VaxMaineKids.org
makes the false claims on their web site that: “ THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM.”  And that, “No
other medical study anywhere in the world has ever found a link
between vaccines and autism. Not one.”
(http://www.vaxmainekids.org/mythbuster-series-autism/) During
an email exchange last summer with Cassandra Grantham, Program
Director of Child Health at MaineHealth, initiated by Ms. Grantham
after I had written about her work, I corrected the misinformation,
sending VaxMaineKids a list with dozens of studies that link vaccines
and autism. 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/220807175/86-Research-Papers-Supporting-the-Vaccine-Autism-Link
 Ms. Grantham failed to correct the false claims on the MaineHealth
web site, and wrote that she was no longer interested in discussing
the matter any further with me. Ms. Grantham, representing
Maine Health, made further false claims on December 1 st 
on MPBN's Maine Calling, when she claimed that there were multiple
studies compairing populations of unvaccinated children to children
fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule that have found no
increased risk in autism among fully vaccinated children.   In
fact, no such research exists, as testified to by  Dr.
Coleen Boyle ,
Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental
Disabilities during the House Oversight & Government Reform
Committee hearing  1
in 88 Children: A Look Into the Federal Response to Rising Rates of
Autism  on
November 29, 2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism
risk had been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr.
Boyle stated, \"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\"
 I wrote to Ms. Grantham to ask that she cite her sources or
retract her false claim.  In her response, she referred to three
publications as sources for her information, none of which referenced
a vaccinated. v. unvaccinated autism study.  In fact, one of her
references, a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine on the current
US vaccine program, addressed the lack vaccinated v. unvaccinated
research as a whole, and specifically in regard to autism and other
developmental disabilities, and notes that parents and the public
have been asking for this research for some time.  The IOM report
recommends against performing such research, because, although they
admit it can be accomplished and would be informative, it would also
be costly, time consuming and difficult.   Ms. Grantham
actually replied to me with information that confirms my allegations
against her false claim by MaineHealth. 
 
 
 
 I
have further contacted several staff members at MaineHealth to ask
for a retraction and for clarification of their stance on a public
policy.  I have received no reply. Further, I have contacted
both Maine Calling hosts and producers, as well as MPBN management,
to ask for a retraction of these fraudulent claims, but none have
replied.   I have attached the email chains below. As
MaineHealth is receiving both insurance payments and tax dollars for
delivering vaccines, I believe it may be under the purview of the
Bureau of Insurance to exercise authority over the false claims being
made to the public about product line that MaineHealth is providing
to the public.   Further, it is imperative that the State of
Maine provide oversight in this matter, as the federal 1986 National
Childhood Injury Act has removed the rights of families to sue
corporations like MaineHealth when members are harmed or killed by a
vaccine.  The result of this blanket liability protection which has
been in place for decades is that physicians, medical care providers,
health corporations and even government agencies routinely put out
false safety and efficacy information, because there is no mechanism
by which the public may directly hold them accountable for fraudulent
claims.  The public's right to take these entities into a civil
court, force them testify under oath, have judgments rendered by a
jury and have remedies be enforced by a judge has been removed.  As a
result, misinformation can be circulated by both malicious and merely
uninformed parties, including doctors providing recommendations to
patients in their offices.  Bad faith parties and organizations who
wish to make outright fraudulent claims are free to do so with out
fear of legal reprisal from their customers, even if the worst
possible outcome happens and the vaccination that was delivered under
false information and/or coercion results in the death of a
child. This complaint does not represent the total number of
false statements made by Ms. Grantham and MaineHealth, but is a short
complaint on the easily corrected fraud currently taking place.  In
light of their refusal to correct even these extremely obvious false
statements, I believe that a full accounting of their vaccine safety
claims is appropriate. 
 
 
 
 Further,
Ms. Grantham in her professional, role has been quoted in the
Portland Press Herald as advocating the elimination of the
philosophical vaccine exemption in Maine.  This would remove the
right of children to a free and appropriate education if their
parents did not choose to vaccinated as the state requests.  As
vaccines are legally classified by the federal government as
“Unavoidably Unsafe” (which means they cannot be made safe for
their intended use) and can result in serious diseases, disorders,
disability, brain damage and death, it a civil rights matter that
parents and individuals be free to exercise their right to informed
consent, and to reject one or more vaccines ones self or ones child. 
It is also a civil rights matter that children be allowed equal
access to a free and appropriate public education with out being
impeded by discriminatory policies.  In their actions in the last 6
months, I assert that MaineHealth has demonstrated a willingness
commit fraud in order to achieve their goal of removing either
families right to medical informed consent or the right to a public
education for their children to increase vaccine sales. In no
other area of medicine are these types of false claims on
pharmaceutical products allowed.  I hope that The Bureau of Insurance
will take this matter seriously and exercise their authority here to
protect Maine consumers against false vaccine safety
claims. Attachment:

Ms. Grantham, 
 
This week on MPBN's Maine Calling, in
response to a question about vaccine safety, you made the following
claim: 
 
 MPBN:
“Cassandra what kind of research is out there about the safety of
vaccines?” Cassandra Grantham: “So what's really great is
that is that many different organizations have put a lot of time and
effort into understanding the safety and efficacy behind vaccines and
there have been several recent studies that have actually come out
looking at associations between vaccinations and different situations
that kids may find themselves in, autism being one of them, but many
others. And of course we can't do studies that actually force
families not to immunize their children so that we can look at what
we would call it a randomized controlled trial, it's just not fair.
So what we have been able to do is look back over time at different
populations of children and we've actually found that kids who are
immunized, completely immunized with all of the vaccines according to
the the schedule that Dr.  Blaisdell 
 was
mentioning the one that recommended by the CDC, that they have no
higher risk of getting autism and some of these other developmental
challenges that families face than those kids that delayed or did not
receive any immunizations at all. So we're finding that there is
research that is now delving deeper into this topic and actually
proving that the CDC's recommended schedule is safe and it does work
and it doesn't increase risks of other situations for kids.” 
 
To the best of my knowledge,
this is a false claim, as no such research exists.  This as
testified to by  Dr.
Coleen Boyle , Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects
and Developmental Disabilities during the House Oversight &
Government Reform Committee hearing  1 in 88 Children: A Look Into
the Federal Response to Rising Rates of Autism  on November 29,
2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism risk had
been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr. Boyle stated,
\"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\" 
 http://youtu.be/O_GrCAzpA_0?t=9m20s 
(please see the notes in the video that addresses the claims made by
Dr. Koren Boggs that such research exists in further detail.) 
 
My
understanding of the history of this topic is that the first such
request for a study was made by the FDA in 1981 after they removed
mercury from over the counter products.  FDA declined to ban it
from vaccines, asking CDC to first do a vaccinated v. unvaccinated
study to see if it increased health risks, however CDC declined to
perform the study. 
 
The autism and vaccine injury communities
have been asking for such a retrospective study to be done for more
than a decade now, and health authorities have continued to refuse. 
Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced the  Comprehensive
Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of
2007 
( http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.2832 :)
to force NIH to do such a study, and reintroduced such legislation in
the years since.  In response to what he learned from Dr. Boyle
during the 2012 hearings, Rep Bill Posey (R-FL) joined with Maloney
and introduced H.R. 1757, The Vaccine Safety Study Act
( https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/26/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E576-1 )
that would again compel HHS to perform the study that you claim
already exists.   
 
The bill was not passed, nor to my
knowledge has any vaccinated v. unvaccinated research on autism or
any other developmental disabilities been published since Dr. Boyle
offered her testimony before Congress. 
 
 As such it is
appropriate for you to either produce the citation for this research
that the vaccine injury community has been lobbying for, or to
retract your false safety claims on MPBN for the product line you are
representing. 
 
Your false claims are only made more
egregious by the fact that you have publicly stated in the Portland
Press Herald that, \"Eliminating the philosophic [vaccine]
exemption is the ultimate goal.\"  It is my belief that you
are purposely lying to the public in order to remove parental rights
and deny Maine children a Free And Appropriate Education in order to
promote sales of a product line whose lack of safety is thoroughly
documented both by the federal government and the product packaging
itself.  This type of propaganda sales campaign should not be
tolerated by any responsible medical professional, health
organization, media outlet or legislator.

 Hello
Ginger ~ 
 Thank you
for listening to MPBN’s Maine Calling Show – it is great to know
that we have reached such a wide audience with important vaccine
messages.  I want to clarify that I do not represent any product
line or company other than MaineHealth, which is a health system
which supports on-time childhood immunizations.  I have never
been paid by or consulted for a pharmaceutical or medical
intervention company or agency. Please see below for MaineHealth’s
official statement regarding childhood immunizations.    
 
 MaineHealth supports the
health, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and
young adults.  We believe that vaccinating children on-time, as
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family
Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and
Gynecology (ACOG), is one of the best ways to reduce
vaccine-preventable diseases in our communities and keep children
safe and healthy. 
 
 In regards
to my statements about vaccine safety, I based those on these
studies.

 Ms. 
Grantham, None of the citations you offer contain any research
on autism risk, or any other developmental disabilities, in
vaccinated v. unvaccinated children, which is the claim you made on
Maine Calling.  Again, no such publish research exists in any
form.   I therefore demand a retraction of the fraudulent
safety claim by yourself, MaineHealth and MPBN. I will not
cease using your image, as this is a very newsworthy story and the
professional headshot of a medical corporation employee making false
claims about the product safety of the pharmaceuticals that it sells
is fair use of this image.

 Ms. Rooks,
Mr. Smith and Mr. Vogelzang, On your December 1 episode of
Maine Calling, Cassandra Grantham, a representative of MaineHealth,
made a fraudulent safety claim on your show.  I have copied you
on the my email exchange with her, which details the false claim, my
correction of the false information as supported by the Congressional
testimony of the head of the CDC's Director of the National Center on
Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, and my request to Ms.
Grantham for her to cite the multiple studies that she claim exist or
retract her claim. As you can see, she has failed to produce
any research comparing autism rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated
populations and failed to retract her claim. I there for
request that Maine Calling retract Ms. Grantham's claim in the same
format which it was offered, noting the false claim on the archived
version of the interview if MPBN chooses to leave it online. I
further strongly encourage Maine Calling to perform an honest
evaluation on why vaccine rates are low in Maine and falling
nationally.  As the educated mother of a vaccine injured child,
I can attest to the real reason.  It is because the liability
protection given to the entire vaccine industry in 1986 has resulted
in massive corruption in the vaccine program.  Ms. Graham's
behavior on your show is case in point.  Medical providers and
medical industry representatives can make any safety claims that they
choose, even completely false claims, because there is no
accountability mechanism in place for the public to hold them
accountable for false claims.  Even when a child is killed by a
vaccine after a false claim like this is made to a parent coercing
them into administering a vaccine that they would not have otherwise
agreed to have delivered to their child, there is no recourse to hold
anyone accountable, or even force them to stop making these false
claims.  So false claims like this one, once spoken by someone
claiming to hold authority in vaccinated, simply continue to
circulate and be repeated.   No doubt Ms. Grantham's
false claim will now be circulated by those who have heard your
program, even medical professionals who administer vaccines to
children. The vaccine show you did with these three women on
December 1, was not just about vaccine rejection, it is the REASON
for vaccine rejection.  It is a real time example of how and why
vaccine interests are alienating and loosing the public trust by
abusing the public trust.  Your guests correctly reported that
the exodus from the vaccine program is being lead by educated parents
who have serious misgivings of the safety and trustworthyness of the
vaccine program, while they themselves were making false claims about
the safety of the vaccine program, thereby proving the untrustworthy
of the vaccine program.  And MPBN is participating in this
corruption by allowing false claims to made on your platform with out
challenge or correction. I hope that the irony that a show you
aired to raise confidence in the vaccination is actually destroying
trust in the vaccination is not lost on you.   Now this
claim of Ms. Grantham is merely one of many problematic statements
made by herself, MaineHealth, VaxMaineKids.org and Dr. Blaisdell, and
I would be happy to go over the false information that they are
sharing with the public under the guise of serving the public if you
decide to do a proper investigation of the fraud taking place in the
vaccine program both in Maine and at the federal level. But
for now, I await a response on your retraction of this particular
false statement.   I cannot imagine that MPBN would allow
any medical professional, industry representative or government
official to make such false claims about any other medical product
line or medical program.  I don't expect Maine Calling to allow
this to stand either. 
 
Thank you for your consideration, Ginger

 Dear
MaineHealth, This past week, Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth
appeared on MPBN's Maine Calling and made a fraudulent vaccine safety
claim. She reported to the public that there are several studies
comparing vaccinated v. unvaccinated children that find no increase
risk of autism and other developmental disabilities in children
vaccinated according to the CDC's recommended schedule.   In
fact, no such research has ever been published.   I
contacted Ms. Grantham and asked that she cite the research she
claims has been undertaken, or retract her statement.  She not
only failed to cite such studies, she actually cited a 2013 IOM
report that confirmed that no such research exists in the medical
literature, and that recommended against undertaking such research
because of cost, time and difficulty.  She has also failed to
retract her fraudulent claim and says she will not be responding to
me on this matter again. This is just the latest of several
false vaccine safety research claims that Ms. Grantham has made on
behalf of MaineHealth both in public and on the VaxMaineKids.org web
site, a MaineHealth Childhood Immunizations Program project. 
Several of these false statements have been brought to her attention
over the last five months, and she has failed to properly address
them.  I can therefore only assume that Ms. Grantham is a bad
faith player and is purposefully misleading of Mainers on vaccine
safety matters This is made all the more egregious as Ms.
Grantham has been quoted in the  Portland
Press Herald  as stating that, “Eliminating the philosophic
[vaccine] exemption is the ultimate goal,” of the work your
organization is undertaking.  It is unconscionable that
MaineHealth would make fraudulent safety claims in order to advance
the agenda of removing parental rights and depriving children of a
free and appropriate public education if their families decline to
participate in a medical program that presents severe adverse health
risks including disability, brain damage and death. I wish to
file a formal complaint against Ms. Grantham with MaineHealth. 
I believe that it is the duty of MaineHealth to review and retract
Ms. Grantham's false vaccine safety claims and to exercise
disciplinary action against Ms. Grantham, as well as clarify the
organization's position on the rights of parents to receive full and
accurate vaccine safety and efficacy information, and practice
uncoerced informed consent in vaccination. I have forwarded
the email exchanges with Ms. Grantham and MPBN below for your
review. I am publicly documenting this process  here . Please
direct me to appropriate contact on this matter so I may offer a full
account of the problem and offer MaineHealth my support in assuring
that it is offering accurate, evidence based information on vaccine
safety to the public. Thank you, Ginger Taylor Brunswick,
Maine

both on the VaxMaineKids.org web site and during an interview on MPBN
on December 1, have made false vaccine safety claims.  I have
contacted VaxMaineKids, MaineHealth and MPBN to ask for a retraction
and correction of the false marketing messages that they are issuing
to the public, but none of the organizations will properly address
the issue. 
 
 
 
 VaxMaineKids.org
makes the false claims on their web site that: “ THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM.”  And that, “No
other medical study anywhere in the world has ever found a link
between vaccines and autism. Not one.”
(http://www.vaxmainekids.org/mythbuster-series-autism/) During
an email exchange last summer with Cassandra Grantham, Program
Director of Child Health at MaineHealth, initiated by Ms. Grantham
after I had written about her work, I corrected the misinformation,
sending VaxMaineKids a list with dozens of studies that link vaccines
and autism. 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/220807175/86-Research-Papers-Supporting-the-Vaccine-Autism-Link
 Ms. Grantham failed to correct the false claims on the MaineHealth
web site, and wrote that she was no longer interested in discussing
the matter any further with me. Ms. Grantham, representing
Maine Health, made further false claims on December 1 st 
on MPBN's Maine Calling, when she claimed that there were multiple
studies comparing populations of unvaccinated children to children
fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule that have found no
increased risk in autism among fully vaccinated children.   In
fact, no such research exists, as testified to by  Dr.
Col l een
Boyle ,
Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental
Disabilities during the House Oversight & Government Reform
Committee hearing  1
in 88 Children: A Look Into the Federal Response to Rising Rates of
Autism  on
November 29, 2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism
risk had been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr.
Boyle stated, \"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\"
 I wrote to Ms. Grantham to ask that she cite her sources or
retract her false claim.  In her response, she referred to three
publications as sources for her information, none of which referenced
a vaccinated v.. unvaccinated autism study.  In fact, one of her
references, a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine on the current
US vaccine program, addressed the lack vaccinated v. unvaccinated
research as a whole, and specifically in regard to autism and other
developmental disabilities, and notes that parents and the public
have been asking for this research for some time.  The IOM report
recommends against performing such research, because, although they
admit it can be accomplished and would be informative, it would also
be costly, time consuming and difficult.   Ms. Grantham
actually replied to me with information that confirms my allegations
against her false claim by MaineHealth. 
 
 
 
 I
have further contacted several staff members at MaineHealth to ask
for a retraction and for clarification of their stance on a public
policy.  I have received no reply. Further, I have contacted
both Maine Calling hosts and producers, as well as MPBN management,
to ask for a retraction of these fraudulent claims, but none have
replied.   I have attached the email chains below. Further,
it is imperative that the State of Maine provide oversight in this
matter, as the federal 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has
removed the rights of families to sue corporations like MaineHealth
when members are harmed or killed by a vaccine.  The result of this
blanket liability protection which has been in place for decades is
that physicians, medical care providers, health corporations and even
government agencies routinely put out false safety and efficacy
information, because there is no mechanism by which the public may
directly hold them accountable for fraudulent claims.  The public's
right to take these entities into a civil court, force them to
testify under oath, have judgments rendered by a jury and have
remedies be enforced by a judge has been removed.  As a result,
misinformation can be circulated by both malicious and merely
uninformed parties, including doctors providing recommendations to
patients in their offices.  Bad faith parties and organizations who
wish to make outright fraudulent claims are free to do so without
fear of legal reprisal from their customers, even if the worst
possible outcome happens and the vaccination that was delivered under
false information or coercion results in the death of a child. This
complaint does not represent the total number of false statements
made by Ms. Grantham and MaineHealth but is a short complaint on the
easily corrected fraud currently taking place.  In light of their
refusal to correct even these extremely obvious false statements, I
believe that a full accounting of their vaccine safety claims is
appropriate. 
 
 
 
 Further,
Ms. Grantham in her professional, role has been quoted in the
Portland Press Herald as advocating the elimination of the
philosophical vaccine exemption in Maine.  This would remove the
right of children to a free and appropriate education if their
parents did not choose to vaccinate as the state requests.  As
vaccines are legally classified by the federal government as
“Unavoidably Unsafe” (which means they cannot be made safe for
their intended use) and can result in serious diseases, disorders,
disability, brain damage and death, it a civil rights matter that
parents and individuals be free to exercise their right to informed
consent, and to reject one or more vaccines for one’s self or one’s
child.  It is also a civil rights matter that children be allowed
equal access to a free and appropriate public education without being
impeded by discriminatory policies.  In their actions in the last 6
months, I assert that MaineHealth has demonstrated a willingness
commit fraud in order to achieve their goal of removing either
families’ rights to medical informed consent or the right to a
public education for their children to increase vaccine sales. In
no other area of medicine are these types of false claims on
pharmaceutical products tolerated.  I hope that Maine DHHS will take
this matter seriously and exercise its authority here to protect
Maine consumers against false vaccine safety claims. Attachment:

Ms. Grantham, 
 
This week on MPBN's Maine Calling, in
response to a question about vaccine safety, you made the following
claim: 
 
 MPBN:
“Cassandra what kind of research is out there about the safety of
vaccines?” Cassandra Grantham: “So what's really great is
that is that many different organizations have put a lot of time and
effort into understanding the safety and efficacy behind vaccines and
there have been several recent studies that have actually come out
looking at associations between vaccinations and different situations
that kids may find themselves in, autism being one of them, but many
others. And of course we can't do studies that actually force
families not to immunize their children so that we can look at what
we would call it a randomized controlled trial, it's just not fair.
So what we have been able to do is look back over time at different
populations of children and we've actually found that kids who are
immunized, completely immunized with all of the vaccines according to
the the schedule that Dr.  Blaisdell 
 was
mentioning the one that recommended by the CDC, that they have no
higher risk of getting autism and some of these other developmental
challenges that families face than those kids that delayed or did not
receive any immunizations at all. So we're finding that there is
research that is now delving deeper into this topic and actually
proving that the CDC's recommended schedule is safe and it does work
and it doesn't increase risks of other situations for kids.” 
 
To the best of my knowledge, this is a
false claim, as no such research exists.  This as testified to
by  Dr.
Coleen Boyle , Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects
and Developmental Disabilities during the House Oversight &
Government Reform Committee hearing  1 in 88 Children: A Look Into
the Federal Response to Rising Rates of Autism  on November 29,
2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism risk had
been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr. Boyle stated,
\"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\" 
 http://youtu.be/O_GrCAzpA_0?t=9m20s 
(please see the notes in the video that addresses the claims made by
Dr. Koren Boggs that such research exists in further detail.) 
 
My
understanding of the history of this topic is that the first such
request for a study was made by the FDA in 1981 after they removed
mercury from over the counter products.  FDA declined to ban it
from vaccines, asking CDC to first do a vaccinated v. unvaccinated
study to see if it increased health risks, however CDC declined to
perform the study. 
 
The autism and vaccine injury communities
have been asking for such a retrospective study to be done for more
than a decade now, and health authorities have continued to refuse. 
Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced the  Comprehensive
Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of
2007 
( http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.2832 :)
to force NIH to do such a study, and reintroduced such legislation in
the years since.  In response to what he learned from Dr. Boyle
during the 2012 hearings, Rep Bill Posey (R-FL) joined with Maloney
and introduced H.R. 1757, The Vaccine Safety Study Act
( https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/26/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E576-1 )
that would again compel HHS to perform the study that you claim
already exists.   
 
The bill was not passed, nor to my
knowledge has any vaccinated v. unvaccinated research on autism or
any other developmental disabilities been published since Dr. Boyle
offered her testimony before Congress. 
 
 As such it is
appropriate for you to either produce the citation for this research
that the vaccine injury community has been lobbying for, or to
retract your false safety claims on MPBN for the product line you are
representing. 
 
Your false claims are only made more
egregious by the fact that you have publicly stated in the Portland
Press Herald that, \"Eliminating the philosophic [vaccine]
exemption is the ultimate goal.\"  It is my belief that you
are purposely lying to the public in order to remove parental rights
and deny Maine children a Free And Appropriate Education in order to
promote sales of a product line whose lack of safety is thoroughly
documented both by the federal government and the product packaging
itself.  This type of propaganda sales campaign should not be
tolerated by any responsible medical professional, health
organization, media outlet or legislator.

 Hello
Ginger ~ 
 Thank you
for listening to MPBN’s Maine Calling Show – it is great to know
that we have reached such a wide audience with important vaccine
messages.  I want to clarify that I do not represent any product
line or company other than MaineHealth, which is a health system
which supports on-time childhood immunizations.  I have never
been paid by or consulted for a pharmaceutical or medical
intervention company or agency. Please see below for MaineHealth’s
official statement regarding childhood immunizations.    
 
 MaineHealth supports the
health, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and
young adults.  We believe that vaccinating children on-time, as
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family
Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and
Gynecology (ACOG), is one of the best ways to reduce
vaccine-preventable diseases in our communities and keep children
safe and healthy. 
 
 In regards
to my statements about vaccine safety, I based those on these
studies.

 Ms. 
Grantham, None of the citations you offer contain any research

vaccinated v. unvaccinated children, which is the claim you made on
Maine Calling.  Again, no such publish research exists in any
form.   I therefore demand a retraction of the fraudulent
safety claim by yourself, MaineHealth and MPBN. I will not
cease using your image, as this is a very newsworthy story and the
professional headshot of a medical corporation employee making false
claims about the product safety of the pharmaceuticals that it sells
is fair use of this image.

 Ms.
Rooks, Mr. Smith and Mr. Vogelzang, On your December 1 episode
of Maine Calling, Cassandra Grantham, a representative of
MaineHealth, made a fraudulent safety claim on your show.  I
have copied you on the my email exchange with her, which details the
false claim, my correction of the false information as supported by
the Congressional testimony of the head of the CDC's Director of the
National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, and
my request to Ms. Grantham for her to cite the multiple studies that
she claim exist or retract her claim. As you can see, she has
failed to produce any research comparing autism rates in vaccinated
and unvaccinated populations and failed to retract her claim. I
there for request that Maine Calling retract Ms. Grantham's claim in
the same format which it was offered, noting the false claim on the
archived version of the interview if MPBN chooses to leave it
online. I further strongly encourage Maine Calling to perform
an honest evaluation on why vaccine rates are low in Maine and
falling nationally.  As the educated mother of a vaccine injured
child, I can attest to the real reason.  It is because the
liability protection given to the entire vaccine industry in 1986 has
resulted in massive corruption in the vaccine program.  Ms.
Graham's behavior on your show is case in point.  Medical
providers and medical industry representatives can make any safety
claims that they choose, even completely false claims, because there
is no accountability mechanism in place for the public to hold them
accountable for false claims.  Even when a child is killed by a
vaccine after a false claim like this is made to a parent coercing
them into administering a vaccine that they would not have otherwise
agreed to have delivered to their child, there is no recourse to hold
anyone accountable, or even force them to stop making these false
claims.  So false claims like this one, once spoken by someone
claiming to hold authority in vaccinated, simply continue to
circulate and be repeated.   No doubt Ms. Grantham's
false claim will now be circulated by those who have heard your
program, even medical professionals who administer vaccines to
children. The vaccine show you did with these three women on
December 1, was not just about vaccine rejection, it is the REASON
for vaccine rejection.  It is a real time example of how and why
vaccine interests are alienating and loosing the public trust by
abusing the public trust.  Your guests correctly reported that
the exodus from the vaccine program is being lead by educated parents
who have serious misgivings of the safety and trustworthyness of the
vaccine program, while they themselves were making false claims about
the safety of the vaccine program, thereby proving the untrustworthy
of the vaccine program.  And MPBN is participating in this
corruption by allowing false claims to made on your platform with out
challenge or correction. I hope that the irony that a show you
aired to raise confidence in the vaccination is actually destroying
trust in the vaccination is not lost on you.   Now this
claim of Ms. Grantham is merely one of many problematic statements
made by herself, MaineHealth, VaxMaineKids.org and Dr. Blaisdell, and
I would be happy to go over the false information that they are
sharing with the public under the guise of serving the public if you
decide to do a proper investigation of the fraud taking place in the
vaccine program both in Maine and at the federal level. But
for now, I await a response on your retraction of this particular
false statement.   I cannot imagine that MPBN would allow
any medical professional, industry representative or government
official to make such false claims about any other medical product
line or medical program.  I don't expect Maine Calling to allow
this to stand either.

 Dear
MaineHealth, This past week, Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth
appeared on MPBN's Maine Calling and made a fraudulent vaccine safety
claim. She reported to the public that there are several studies
comparing vaccinated v. unvaccinated children that find no increase
risk of autism and other developmental disabilities in children
vaccinated according to the CDC's recommended schedule.   In
fact, no such research has ever been published.   I
contacted Ms. Grantham and asked that she cite the research she
claims has been undertaken, or retract her statement.  She not
only failed to cite such studies, she actually cited a 2013 IOM
report that confirmed that no such research exists in the medical
literature, and that recommended against undertaking such research
because of cost, time and difficulty.  She has also failed to
retract her fraudulent claim and says she will not be responding to
me on this matter again. This is just the latest of several
false vaccine safety research claims that Ms. Grantham has made on
behalf of MaineHealth both in public and on the VaxMaineKids.org web
site, a MaineHealth Childhood Immunizations Program project. 
Several of these false statements have been brought to her attention
over the last five months, and she has failed to properly address
them.  I can therefore only assume that Ms. Grantham is a bad
faith player and is purposefully misleading of Mainers on vaccine
safety matters This is made all the more egregious as Ms.
Grantham has been quoted in the  Portland
Press Herald  as stating that, “Eliminating the philosophic
[vaccine] exemption is the ultimate goal,” of the work your
organization is undertaking.  It is unconscionable that
MaineHealth would make fraudulent safety claims in order to advance
the agenda of removing parental rights and depriving children of a
free and appropriate public education if their families decline to
participate in a medical program that presents severe adverse health
risks including disability, brain damage and death. I wish to
file a formal complaint against Ms. Grantham with MaineHealth. 
I believe that it is the duty of MaineHealth to review and retract
Ms. Grantham's false vaccine safety claims and to exercise
disciplinary action against Ms. Grantham, as well as clarify the
organization's position on the rights of parents to receive full and
accurate vaccine safety and efficacy information, and practice
uncoerced informed consent in vaccination. I have forwarded
the email exchanges with Ms. Grantham and MPBN below for your
review. I am publicly documenting this process  here . Please
direct me to appropriate contact on this matter so I may offer a full
account of the problem and offer MaineHealth my support in assuring
that it is offering accurate, evidence based information on vaccine
safety to the public. Thank you, Ginger Taylor Brunswick,
Maine

 I would
like to file a complaint against MaineHealth for making fraudulent
statements concerning one of their product lines. 
 
 
 
 MaineHealth,
both on the VaxMaineKids.org web site and during an interview on MPBN
on December 1, have made false vaccine safety claims.  I have
contacted VaxMaineKids, MaineHealth and MPBN to ask for a retraction
and correction of the false marketing messages that they are issuing
to the public, but none of the organizations will properly address
the issue. 
 
 
 
 VaxMaineKids.org
makes the false claims on their web site that: “ THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM.”  And that, “No
other medical study anywhere in the world has ever found a link
between vaccines and autism. Not one.”
(http://www.vaxmainekids.org/mythbuster-series-autism/) During
an email exchange last summer with Cassandra Grantham, Program
Director of Child Health at MaineHealth, initiated by Ms. Grantham
after I had written about her work, I corrected the misinformation,
sending VaxMaineKids a list with dozens of studies that link vaccines
and autism. 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/220807175/86-Research-Papers-Supporting-the-Vaccine-Autism-Link
 Ms. Grantham failed to correct the false claims on the MaineHealth
web site, and wrote that she was no longer interested in discussing
the matter any further with me. Ms. Grantham, representing
Maine Health, made further false claims on December 1 st 
on MPBN's Maine Calling, when she claimed that there were multiple
studies comparing populations of unvaccinated children to children
fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule that have found no
increased risk in autism among fully vaccinated children.   In
fact, no such research exists, as testified to by  Dr.
Col l een
Boyle ,
Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental
Disabilities during the House Oversight & Government Reform
Committee hearing  1
in 88 Children: A Look Into the Federal Response to Rising Rates of
Autism  on
November 29, 2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism
risk had been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr.
Boyle stated, \"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\"
 I wrote to Ms. Grantham to ask that she cite her sources or
retract her false claim.  In her response, she referred to three
publications as sources for her information, none of which referenced
a vaccinated v.. unvaccinated autism study.  In fact, one of her
references, a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine on the current
US vaccine program, addressed the lack vaccinated v. unvaccinated
research as a whole, and specifically in regard to autism and other
developmental disabilities, and notes that parents and the public
have been asking for this research for some time.  The IOM report
recommends against performing such research, because, although they
admit it can be accomplished and would be informative, it would also
be costly, time consuming and difficult.   Ms. Grantham
actually replied to me with information that confirms my allegations
against her false claim by MaineHealth. 
 
 
 
 I
have further contacted several staff members at MaineHealth to ask
for a retraction and for clarification of their stance on a public
policy.  I have received no reply. Further, I have contacted
both Maine Calling hosts and producers, as well as MPBN management,
to ask for a retraction of these fraudulent claims, but none have
replied.   I have attached the email chains below. Further,
it is imperative that the State of Maine provide oversight in this
matter, as the federal 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has
removed the rights of families to sue corporations like MaineHealth
when members are harmed or killed by a vaccine.  The result of this
blanket liability protection which has been in place for decades is
that physicians, medical care providers, health corporations and even
government agencies routinely put out false safety and efficacy
information, because there is no mechanism by which the public may
directly hold them accountable for fraudulent claims.  The public's
right to take these entities into a civil court, force them to
testify under oath, have judgments rendered by a jury and have
remedies be enforced by a judge has been removed.  As a result,
misinformation can be circulated by both malicious and merely
uninformed parties, including doctors providing recommendations to
patients in their offices.  Bad faith parties and organizations who
wish to make outright fraudulent claims are free to do so without
fear of legal reprisal from their customers, even if the worst
possible outcome happens and the vaccination that was delivered under
false information or coercion results in the death of a child. This
complaint does not represent the total number of false statements
made by Ms. Grantham and MaineHealth but is a short complaint on the
easily corrected fraud currently taking place.  In light of their
refusal to correct even these extremely obvious false statements, I
believe that a full accounting of their vaccine safety claims is
appropriate. 
 
 
 
 Further,
Ms. Grantham in her professional, role has been quoted in the
Portland Press Herald as advocating the elimination of the
philosophical vaccine exemption in Maine.  This would remove the
right of children to a free and appropriate education if their
parents did not choose to vaccinate as the state requests.  As
vaccines are legally classified by the federal government as
“Unavoidably Unsafe” (which means they cannot be made safe for
their intended use) and can result in serious diseases, disorders,
disability, brain damage and death, it a civil rights matter that
parents and individuals be free to exercise their right to informed
consent, and to reject one or more vaccines for one’s self or one’s
child.  It is also a civil rights matter that children be allowed
equal access to a free and appropriate public education without being
impeded by discriminatory policies.  In their actions in the last 6
months, I assert that MaineHealth has demonstrated a willingness
commit fraud in order to achieve their goal of removing either
families’ rights to medical informed consent or the right to a
public education for their children to increase vaccine sales. In
no other area of medicine are these types of false claims on
pharmaceutical products tolerated.  I hope that the Maine
Immunization Program will take this matter seriously and perform its
duty in this case to protect Maine consumers against false vaccine
safety claims. Attachment:

Ms. Grantham, 
 
This week on MPBN's Maine Calling, in
response to a question about vaccine safety, you made the following
claim: 
 
 MPBN:
“Cassandra what kind of research is out there about the safety of
vaccines?” Cassandra Grantham: “So what's really great is
that is that many different organizations have put a lot of time and
effort into understanding the safety and efficacy behind vaccines and
there have been several recent studies that have actually come out
looking at associations between vaccinations and different situations
that kids may find themselves in, autism being one of them, but many
others. And of course we can't do studies that actually force
families not to immunize their children so that we can look at what
we would call it a randomized controlled trial, it's just not fair.
So what we have been able to do is look back over time at different
populations of children and we've actually found that kids who are
immunized, completely immunized with all of the vaccines according to
the the schedule that Dr.  Blaisdell 
 was
mentioning the one that recommended by the CDC, that they have no
higher risk of getting autism and some of these other developmental
challenges that families face than those kids that delayed or did not
receive any immunizations at all. So we're finding that there is
research that is now delving deeper into this topic and actually
proving that the CDC's recommended schedule is safe and it does work
and it doesn't increase risks of other situations for kids.” 
 
To the best of my knowledge, this is a
false claim, as no such research exists.  This as testified to
by  Dr.
Coleen Boyle , Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects
and Developmental Disabilities during the House Oversight &
Government Reform Committee hearing  1 in 88 Children: A Look Into
the Federal Response to Rising Rates of Autism  on November 29,
2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism risk had
been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr. Boyle stated,
\"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\" 
 http://youtu.be/O_GrCAzpA_0?t=9m20s 
(please see the notes in the video that addresses the claims made by
Dr. Koren Boggs that such research exists in further detail.) 
 
My
understanding of the history of this topic is that the first such
request for a study was made by the FDA in 1981 after they removed
mercury from over the counter products.  FDA declined to ban it
from vaccines, asking CDC to first do a vaccinated v. unvaccinated
study to see if it increased health risks, however CDC declined to
perform the study. 
 
The autism and vaccine injury communities
have been asking for such a retrospective study to be done for more
than a decade now, and health authorities have continued to refuse. 
Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced the  Comprehensive
Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of
2007 
( http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.2832 :)
to force NIH to do such a study, and reintroduced such legislation in
the years since.  In response to what he learned from Dr. Boyle
during the 2012 hearings, Rep Bill Posey (R-FL) joined with Maloney
and introduced H.R. 1757, The Vaccine Safety Study Act
( https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/26/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E576-1 )
that would again compel HHS to perform the study that you claim
already exists.   
 
The bill was not passed, nor to my
knowledge has any vaccinated v. unvaccinated research on autism or
any other developmental disabilities been published since Dr. Boyle
offered her testimony before Congress. 
 
 As such it is
appropriate for you to either produce the citation for this research
that the vaccine injury community has been lobbying for, or to
retract your false safety claims on MPBN for the product line you are
representing. 
 
Your false claims are only made more
egregious by the fact that you have publicly stated in the Portland
Press Herald that, \"Eliminating the philosophic [vaccine]
exemption is the ultimate goal.\"  It is my belief that you
are purposely lying to the public in order to remove parental rights
and deny Maine children a Free And Appropriate Education in order to
promote sales of a product line whose lack of safety is thoroughly
documented both by the federal government and the product packaging
itself.  This type of propaganda sales campaign should not be
tolerated by any responsible medical professional, health
organization, media outlet or legislator.

 Hello
Ginger ~ 
 Thank you
for listening to MPBN’s Maine Calling Show – it is great to know
that we have reached such a wide audience with important vaccine
messages.  I want to clarify that I do not represent any product
line or company other than MaineHealth, which is a health system
which supports on-time childhood immunizations.  I have never
been paid by or consulted for a pharmaceutical or medical
intervention company or agency. Please see below for MaineHealth’s
official statement regarding childhood immunizations.    
 
 MaineHealth supports the
health, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and
young adults.  We believe that vaccinating children on-time, as
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family
Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and
Gynecology (ACOG), is one of the best ways to reduce
vaccine-preventable diseases in our communities and keep children
safe and healthy. 
 
 In regards
to my statements about vaccine safety, I based those on these
studies.

 Ms. 
Grantham, None of the citations you offer contain any research
on autism risk, or any other developmental disabilities, in
vaccinated v. unvaccinated children, which is the claim you made on
Maine Calling.  Again, no such publish research exists in any
form.   I therefore demand a retraction of the fraudulent
safety claim by yourself, MaineHealth and MPBN. I will not
cease using your image, as this is a very newsworthy story and the
professional headshot of a medical corporation employee making false
claims about the product safety of the pharmaceuticals that it sells
is fair use of this image.

 Ms.
Rooks, Mr. Smith and Mr. Vogelzang, On your December 1 episode
of Maine Calling, Cassandra Grantham, a representative of
MaineHealth, made a fraudulent safety claim on your show.  I
have copied you on the my email exchange with her, which details the
false claim, my correction of the false information as supported by
the Congressional testimony of the head of the CDC's Director of the
National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, and
my request to Ms. Grantham for her to cite the multiple studies that
she claim exist or retract her claim. As you can see, she has
failed to produce any research comparing autism rates in vaccinated
and unvaccinated populations and failed to retract her claim. I
there for request that Maine Calling retract Ms. Grantham's claim in
the same format which it was offered, noting the false claim on the
archived version of the interview if MPBN chooses to leave it
online. I further strongly encourage Maine Calling to perform
an honest evaluation on why vaccine rates are low in Maine and
falling nationally.  As the educated mother of a vaccine injured
child, I can attest to the real reason.  It is because the
liability protection given to the entire vaccine industry in 1986 has
resulted in massive corruption in the vaccine program.  Ms.
Graham's behavior on your show is case in point.  Medical
providers and medical industry representatives can make any safety
claims that they choose, even completely false claims, because there
is no accountability mechanism in place for the public to hold them
accountable for false claims.  Even when a child is killed by a
vaccine after a false claim like this is made to a parent coercing
them into administering a vaccine that they would not have otherwise
agreed to have delivered to their child, there is no recourse to hold
anyone accountable, or even force them to stop making these false
claims.  So false claims like this one, once spoken by someone
claiming to hold authority in vaccinated, simply continue to
circulate and be repeated.   No doubt Ms. Grantham's
false claim will now be circulated by those who have heard your
program, even medical professionals who administer vaccines to
children. The vaccine show you did with these three women on
December 1, was not just about vaccine rejection, it is the REASON
for vaccine rejection.  It is a real time example of how and why
vaccine interests are alienating and loosing the public trust by
abusing the public trust.  Your guests correctly reported that
the exodus from the vaccine program is being lead by educated parents
who have serious misgivings of the safety and trustworthyness of the
vaccine program, while they themselves were making false claims about
the safety of the vaccine program, thereby proving the untrustworthy
of the vaccine program.  And MPBN is participating in this
corruption by allowing false claims to made on your platform with out
challenge or correction. I hope that the irony that a show you
aired to raise confidence in the vaccination is actually destroying
trust in the vaccination is not lost on you.   Now this
claim of Ms. Grantham is merely one of many problematic statements
made by herself, MaineHealth, VaxMaineKids.org and Dr. Blaisdell, and
I would be happy to go over the false information that they are
sharing with the public under the guise of serving the public if you
decide to do a proper investigation of the fraud taking place in the
vaccine program both in Maine and at the federal level. But
for now, I await a response on your retraction of this particular
false statement.   I cannot imagine that MPBN would allow
any medical professional, industry representative or government
official to make such false claims about any other medical product
line or medical program.  I don't expect Maine Calling to allow
this to stand either. 
 
Thank you for your consideration, Ginger

 Dear
MaineHealth, This past week, Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth
appeared on MPBN's Maine Calling and made a fraudulent vaccine safety
claim. She reported to the public that there are several studies
comparing vaccinated v. unvaccinated children that find no increase
risk of autism and other developmental disabilities in children
vaccinated according to the CDC's recommended schedule.   In
fact, no such research has ever been published.   I
contacted Ms. Grantham and asked that she cite the research she
claims has been undertaken, or retract her statement.  She not
only failed to cite such studies, she actually cited a 2013 IOM
report that confirmed that no such research exists in the medical
literature, and that recommended against undertaking such research
because of cost, time and difficulty.  She has also failed to
retract her fraudulent claim and says she will not be responding to
me on this matter again. This is just the latest of several
false vaccine safety research claims that Ms. Grantham has made on
behalf of MaineHealth both in public and on the VaxMaineKids.org web
site, a MaineHealth Childhood Immunizations Program project. 
Several of these false statements have been brought to her attention
over the last five months, and she has failed to properly address
them.  I can therefore only assume that Ms. Grantham is a bad
faith player and is purposefully misleading of Mainers on vaccine
safety matters This is made all the more egregious as Ms.
Grantham has been quoted in the  Portland
Press Herald  as stating that, “Eliminating the philosophic
[vaccine] exemption is the ultimate goal,” of the work your
organization is undertaking.  It is unconscionable that
MaineHealth would make fraudulent safety claims in order to advance
the agenda of removing parental rights and depriving children of a
free and appropriate public education if their families decline to
participate in a medical program that presents severe adverse health
risks including disability, brain damage and death. I wish to
file a formal complaint against Ms. Grantham with MaineHealth. 
I believe that it is the duty of MaineHealth to review and retract
Ms. Grantham's false vaccine safety claims and to exercise
disciplinary action against Ms. Grantham, as well as clarify the
organization's position on the rights of parents to receive full and
accurate vaccine safety and efficacy information, and practice
uncoerced informed consent in vaccination. I have forwarded
the email exchanges with Ms. Grantham and MPBN below for your
review. I am publicly documenting this process  here . Please
direct me to appropriate contact on this matter so I may offer a full
account of the problem and offer MaineHealth my support in assuring
that it is offering accurate, evidence based information on vaccine
safety to the public. Thank you, Ginger Taylor Brunswick,
Maine 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Letter
also forwarded to  patientrelations@mmc.org ,
no response as of this filing. 
 
 
 
 
 To
the Maine Immunization Coalition 
 
 
 
 I would
like to file a complaint against MaineHealth, which I believe is a
member of the Maine Immunization Coalition and whose web site,
VaxMaineKids.org is supported by your coalition, for making
fraudulent statements concerning one of their product lines. 
 
 
 
 MaineHealth,
both on the VaxMaineKids.org web site and during an interview on MPBN
on December 1, have made false vaccine safety claims.  I have
contacted VaxMaineKids, MaineHealth and MPBN to ask for a retraction
and correction of the false marketing messages that they are issuing
to the public, but none of the organizations will properly address
the issue. 
 
 
 
 VaxMaineKids.org
makes the false claims on their web site that: “ THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM.”  And that, “No
other medical study anywhere in the world has ever found a link
between vaccines and autism. Not one.”
(http://www.vaxmainekids.org/mythbuster-series-autism/) During
an email exchange last summer with Cassandra Grantham, Program
Director of Child Health at MaineHealth, initiated by Ms. Grantham
after I had written about her work, I corrected the misinformation,
sending VaxMaineKids a list with dozens of studies that link vaccines
and autism. 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/220807175/86-Research-Papers-Supporting-the-Vaccine-Autism-Link
 Ms. Grantham failed to correct the false claims on the MaineHealth
web site, and wrote that she was no longer interested in discussing
the matter any further with me. Ms. Grantham, representing
Maine Health, made further false claims on December 1 st 
on MPBN's Maine Calling, when she claimed that there were multiple
studies comparing populations of unvaccinated children to children
fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule that have found no
increased risk in autism among fully vaccinated children.   In
fact, no such research exists, as testified to by  Dr.
Col l een
Boyle ,
Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental
Disabilities during the House Oversight & Government Reform
Committee hearing  1
in 88 Children: A Look Into the Federal Response to Rising Rates of
Autism  on
November 29, 2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism
risk had been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr.
Boyle stated, \"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\"
 I wrote to Ms. Grantham to ask that she cite her sources or
retract her false claim.  In her response, she referred to three
publications as sources for her information, none of which referenced
a vaccinated v.. unvaccinated autism study.  In fact, one of her
references, a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine on the current
US vaccine program, addressed the lack vaccinated v. unvaccinated
research as a whole, and specifically in regard to autism and other
developmental disabilities, and notes that parents and the public
have been asking for this research for some time.  The IOM report
recommends against performing such research, because, although they
admit it can be accomplished and would be informative, it would also
be costly, time consuming and difficult.   Ms. Grantham
actually replied to me with information that confirms my allegations
against her false claim by MaineHealth. 
 
 
 
 I
have further contacted several staff members at MaineHealth to ask
for a retraction and for clarification of their stance on a public
policy.  I have received no reply. Further, I have contacted
both Maine Calling hosts and producers, as well as MPBN management,
to ask for a retraction of these fraudulent claims, but none have
replied.   I have attached the email chains below. It
is imperative that vaccine promotional programs are accurate in their
claims, as the federal 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has
removed the rights of families to sue corporations like MaineHealth
when members are harmed or killed by a vaccine.  The result of this
blanket liability protection which has been in place for decades is
that physicians, medical care providers, health corporations and even
government agencies routinely put out false safety and efficacy
information, because there is no mechanism by which the public may
directly hold them accountable for fraudulent claims.  The public's
right to take these entities into a civil court, force them to
testify under oath, have judgments rendered by a jury and have
remedies be enforced by a judge has been removed.  As a result,
misinformation can be circulated by both malicious and merely
uninformed parties, including doctors providing recommendations to
patients in their offices.  Bad faith parties and organizations who
wish to make outright fraudulent claims are free to do so without
fear of legal reprisal from their customers, even if the worst
possible outcome happens and the vaccination that was delivered under
false information or coercion results in the death of a child. This
complaint does not represent the total number of false statements
made by Ms. Grantham and MaineHealth but is a short complaint on the
easily corrected fraud currently taking place.  In light of their
refusal to correct even these extremely obvious false statements, I
believe that a full accounting of their vaccine safety claims is
appropriate. 
 
 
 
 Further,
Ms. Grantham in her professional, role has been quoted in the
Portland Press Herald as advocating the elimination of the
philosophical vaccine exemption in Maine.  This would remove the
right of children to a free and appropriate education if their
parents did not choose to vaccinate as the state requests.  As
vaccines are legally classified by the federal government as
“Unavoidably Unsafe” (which means they cannot be made safe for
their intended use) and can result in serious diseases, disorders,
disability, brain damage and death, it a civil rights matter that
parents and individuals be free to exercise their right to informed
consent, and to reject one or more vaccines for one’s self or one’s
child.  It is also a civil rights matter that children be allowed
equal access to a free and appropriate public education without being
impeded by discriminatory policies.  In their actions in the last 6
months, I assert that MaineHealth has demonstrated a willingness
commit fraud in order to achieve their goal of removing either
families’ rights to medical informed consent or the right to a
public education for their children to increase vaccine sales. 
 
 I
would hope that the Maine Immunization Coalition's work to increase
vaccine uptake rates would not include offering disinformation to the
public to obtain their consent to vaccinate, and that you will
correct your member's false safety claims, insisting they retract
these fraudulent statements, which only further erode trust in the
vaccine program you are promoting.

Ms. Grantham, 
 
This week on MPBN's Maine Calling, in
response to a question about vaccine safety, you made the following
claim: 
 
 MPBN:
“Cassandra what kind of research is out there about the safety of
vaccines?” Cassandra Grantham: “So what's really great is
that is that many different organizations have put a lot of time and
effort into understanding the safety and efficacy behind vaccines and
there have been several recent studies that have actually come out
looking at associations between vaccinations and different situations
that kids may find themselves in, autism being one of them, but many
others. And of course we can't do studies that actually force
families not to immunize their children so that we can look at what
we would call it a randomized controlled trial, it's just not fair.
So what we have been able to do is look back over time at different
populations of children and we've actually found that kids who are
immunized, completely immunized with all of the vaccines according to
the the schedule that Dr.  Blaisdell 
 was
mentioning the one that recommended by the CDC, that they have no
higher risk of getting autism and some of these other developmental
challenges that families face than those kids that delayed or did not
receive any immunizations at all. So we're finding that there is
research that is now delving deeper into this topic and actually
proving that the CDC's recommended schedule is safe and it does work
and it doesn't increase risks of other situations for kids.” 
 
To the best of my knowledge, this is a
false claim, as no such research exists.  This as testified to
by  Dr.
Coleen Boyle , Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects
and Developmental Disabilities during the House Oversight &
Government Reform Committee hearing  1 in 88 Children: A Look Into
the Federal Response to Rising Rates of Autism  on November 29,
2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism risk had
been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr. Boyle stated,
\"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\" 
 http://youtu.be/O_GrCAzpA_0?t=9m20s 
(please see the notes in the video that addresses the claims made by
Dr. Koren Boggs that such research exists in further detail.) 
 
My
understanding of the history of this topic is that the first such
request for a study was made by the FDA in 1981 after they removed
mercury from over the counter products.  FDA declined to ban it
from vaccines, asking CDC to first do a vaccinated v. unvaccinated
study to see if it increased health risks, however CDC declined to
perform the study. 
 
The autism and vaccine injury communities
have been asking for such a retrospective study to be done for more
than a decade now, and health authorities have continued to refuse. 
Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced the  Comprehensive
Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of

 Hello
Ginger ~ 
 Thank you
for listening to MPBN’s Maine Calling Show – it is great to know
that we have reached such a wide audience with important vaccine
messages.  I want to clarify that I do not represent any product
line or company other than MaineHealth, which is a health system
which supports on-time childhood immunizations.  I have never
been paid by or consulted for a pharmaceutical or medical
intervention company or agency. Please see below for MaineHealth’s
official statement regarding childhood immunizations.    
 
 MaineHealth supports the
health, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and
young adults.  We believe that vaccinating children on-time, as
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family
Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and
Gynecology (ACOG), is one of the best ways to reduce
vaccine-preventable diseases in our communities and keep children
safe and healthy. 
 
 In regards
to my statements about vaccine safety, I based those on these
studies.

 Ms. 
Grantham, None of the citations you offer contain any research
on autism risk, or any other developmental disabilities, in
vaccinated v. unvaccinated children, which is the claim you made on
Maine Calling.  Again, no such publish research exists in any
form.   I therefore demand a retraction of the fraudulent
safety claim by yourself, MaineHealth and MPBN. I will not
cease using your image, as this is a very newsworthy story and the
professional headshot of a medical corporation employee making false
claims about the product safety of the pharmaceuticals that it sells
is fair use of this image.

 Ms.
Rooks, Mr. Smith and Mr. Vogelzang, On your December 1 episode
of Maine Calling, Cassandra Grantham, a representative of
MaineHealth, made a fraudulent safety claim on your show.  I
have copied you on the my email exchange with her, which details the
false claim, my correction of the false information as supported by
the Congressional testimony of the head of the CDC's Director of the
National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, and
my request to Ms. Grantham for her to cite the multiple studies that
she claim exist or retract her claim. As you can see, she has
failed to produce any research comparing autism rates in vaccinated
and unvaccinated populations and failed to retract her claim. I
there for request that Maine Calling retract Ms. Grantham's claim in
the same format which it was offered, noting the false claim on the
archived version of the interview if MPBN chooses to leave it
online. I further strongly encourage Maine Calling to perform
an honest evaluation on why vaccine rates are low in Maine and
falling nationally.  As the educated mother of a vaccine injured
child, I can attest to the real reason.  It is because the
liability protection given to the entire vaccine industry in 1986 has
resulted in massive corruption in the vaccine program.  Ms.
Graham's behavior on your show is case in point.  Medical
providers and medical industry representatives can make any safety
claims that they choose, even completely false claims, because there
is no accountability mechanism in place for the public to hold them
accountable for false claims.  Even when a child is killed by a
vaccine after a false claim like this is made to a parent coercing
them into administering a vaccine that they would not have otherwise
agreed to have delivered to their child, there is no recourse to hold
anyone accountable, or even force them to stop making these false
claims.  So false claims like this one, once spoken by someone
claiming to hold authority in vaccinated, simply continue to
circulate and be repeated.   No doubt Ms. Grantham's
false claim will now be circulated by those who have heard your
program, even medical professionals who administer vaccines to
children. The vaccine show you did with these three women on
December 1, was not just about vaccine rejection, it is the REASON
for vaccine rejection.  It is a real time example of how and why
vaccine interests are alienating and loosing the public trust by
abusing the public trust.  Your guests correctly reported that
the exodus from the vaccine program is being lead by educated parents
who have serious misgivings of the safety and trustworthyness of the
vaccine program, while they themselves were making false claims about
the safety of the vaccine program, thereby proving the untrustworthy
of the vaccine program.  And MPBN is participating in this
corruption by allowing false claims to made on your platform with out
challenge or correction. I hope that the irony that a show you
aired to raise confidence in the vaccination is actually destroying
trust in the vaccination is not lost on you.   Now this
claim of Ms. Grantham is merely one of many problematic statements
made by herself, MaineHealth, VaxMaineKids.org and Dr. Blaisdell, and
I would be happy to go over the false information that they are
sharing with the public under the guise of serving the public if you
decide to do a proper investigation of the fraud taking place in the
vaccine program both in Maine and at the federal level. But
for now, I await a response on your retraction of this particular
false statement.   I cannot imagine that MPBN would allow
any medical professional, industry representative or government
official to make such false claims about any other medical product
line or medical program.  I don't expect Maine Calling to allow
this to stand either.

 Dear
MaineHealth, This past week, Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth
appeared on MPBN's Maine Calling and made a fraudulent vaccine safety
claim. She reported to the public that there are several studies
comparing vaccinated v. unvaccinated children that find no increase
risk of autism and other developmental disabilities in children
vaccinated according to the CDC's recommended schedule.   In
fact, no such research has ever been published.   I
contacted Ms. Grantham and asked that she cite the research she
claims has been undertaken, or retract her statement.  She not
only failed to cite such studies, she actually cited a 2013 IOM
report that confirmed that no such research exists in the medical
literature, and that recommended against undertaking such research
because of cost, time and difficulty.  She has also failed to
retract her fraudulent claim and says she will not be responding to
me on this matter again. This is just the latest of several
false vaccine safety research claims that Ms. Grantham has made on
behalf of MaineHealth both in public and on the VaxMaineKids.org web
site, a MaineHealth Childhood Immunizations Program project. 
Several of these false statements have been brought to her attention
over the last five months, and she has failed to properly address
them.  I can therefore only assume that Ms. Grantham is a bad
faith player and is purposefully misleading of Mainers on vaccine
safety matters This is made all the more egregious as Ms.
Grantham has been quoted in the  Portland
Press Herald  as stating that, “Eliminating the philosophic
[vaccine] exemption is the ultimate goal,” of the work your
organization is undertaking.  It is unconscionable that
MaineHealth would make fraudulent safety claims in order to advance
the agenda of removing parental rights and depriving children of a
free and appropriate public education if their families decline to
participate in a medical program that presents severe adverse health
risks including disability, brain damage and death. I wish to
file a formal complaint against Ms. Grantham with MaineHealth. 
I believe that it is the duty of MaineHealth to review and retract
Ms. Grantham's false vaccine safety claims and to exercise
disciplinary action against Ms. Grantham, as well as clarify the
organization's position on the rights of parents to receive full and
accurate vaccine safety and efficacy information, and practice
uncoerced informed consent in vaccination. I have forwarded
the email exchanges with Ms. Grantham and MPBN below for your
review. I am publicly documenting this process  here . Please
direct me to appropriate contact on this matter so I may offer a full
account of the problem and offer MaineHealth my support in assuring
that it is offering accurate, evidence based information on vaccine
safety to the public. Thank you, Ginger Taylor Brunswick,
Maine 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Letter
also forwarded to  patientrelations@mmc.org ,
no response as of this filing. 
 
 
 
 
 To
the Maine Department of Health and Human Services 
 
 
 
 I would
like to file a complaint against MaineHealth for making fraudulent
statements concerning one of their product lines. 
 
 
 
 MaineHealth,
both on the VaxMaineKids.org web site and during an interview on MPBN
on December 1, have made false vaccine safety claims.  I have
contacted VaxMaineKids, MaineHealth and MPBN to ask for a retraction
and correction of the false marketing messages that they are issuing
to the public, but none of the organizations will properly address
the issue. 
 
 
 
 VaxMaineKids.org
makes the false claims on their web site that: “ THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM.”  And that, “No
other medical study anywhere in the world has ever found a link
between vaccines and autism. Not one.”
(http://www.vaxmainekids.org/mythbuster-series-autism/) During
an email exchange last summer with Cassandra Grantham, Program
Director of Child Health at MaineHealth, initiated by Ms. Grantham
after I had written about her work, I corrected the misinformation,
sending VaxMaineKids a list with dozens of studies that link vaccines
and autism. 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/220807175/86-Research-Papers-Supporting-the-Vaccine-Autism-Link
 Ms. Grantham failed to correct the false claims on the MaineHealth
web site, and wrote that she was no longer interested in discussing
the matter any further with me. Ms. Grantham, representing
Maine Health, made further false claims on December 1 st 
on MPBN's Maine Calling, when she claimed that there were multiple
studies comparing populations of unvaccinated children to children
fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule that have found no
increased risk in autism among fully vaccinated children.   In
fact, no such research exists, as testified to by  Dr.
Col l een
Boyle ,
Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental
Disabilities during the House Oversight & Government Reform
Committee hearing  1
in 88 Children: A Look Into the Federal Response to Rising Rates of
Autism  on
November 29, 2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism
risk had been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr.
Boyle stated, \"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\"
 I wrote to Ms. Grantham to ask that she cite her sources or
retract her false claim.  In her response, she referred to three
publications as sources for her information, none of which referenced
a vaccinated v.. unvaccinated autism study.  In fact, one of her
references, a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine on the current
US vaccine program, addressed the lack vaccinated v. unvaccinated
research as a whole, and specifically in regard to autism and other
developmental disabilities, and notes that parents and the public
have been asking for this research for some time.  The IOM report
recommends against performing such research, because, although they
admit it can be accomplished and would be informative, it would also
be costly, time consuming and difficult.   Ms. Grantham
actually replied to me with information that confirms my allegations
against her false claim by MaineHealth. 
 
 
 
 I
have further contacted several staff members at MaineHealth to ask
for a retraction and for clarification of their stance on a public
policy.  I have received no reply. Further, I have contacted
both Maine Calling hosts and producers, as well as MPBN management,
to ask for a retraction of these fraudulent claims, but none have
replied.   I have attached the email chains below. Further,
it is imperative that the State of Maine provide oversight in this
matter, as the federal 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has
removed the rights of families to sue corporations like MaineHealth
when members are harmed or killed by a vaccine.  The result of this
blanket liability protection which has been in place for decades is
that physicians, medical care providers, health corporations and even
government agencies routinely put out false safety and efficacy
information, because there is no mechanism by which the public may
directly hold them accountable for fraudulent claims.  The public's
right to take these entities into a civil court, force them to
testify under oath, have judgments rendered by a jury and have
remedies be enforced by a judge has been removed.  As a result,
misinformation can be circulated by both malicious and merely
uninformed parties, including doctors providing recommendations to
patients in their offices.  Bad faith parties and organizations who
wish to make outright fraudulent claims are free to do so without
fear of legal reprisal from their customers, even if the worst
possible outcome happens and the vaccination that was delivered under
false information or coercion results in the death of a child. This
complaint does not represent the total number of false statements
made by Ms. Grantham and MaineHealth but is a short complaint on the
easily corrected fraud currently taking place.  In light of their
refusal to correct even these extremely obvious false statements, I
believe that a full accounting of their vaccine safety claims is
appropriate. 
 
 
 
 Further,
Ms. Grantham in her professional, role has been quoted in the
Portland Press Herald as advocating the elimination of the
philosophical vaccine exemption in Maine.  This would remove the
right of children to a free and appropriate education if their
parents did not choose to vaccinate as the state requests.  As
vaccines are legally classified by the federal government as
“Unavoidably Unsafe” (which means they cannot be made safe for
their intended use) and can result in serious diseases, disorders,
disability, brain damage and death, it a civil rights matter that
parents and individuals be free to exercise their right to informed
consent, and to reject one or more vaccines for one’s self or one’s
child.  It is also a civil rights matter that children be allowed
equal access to a free and appropriate public education without being
impeded by discriminatory policies.  In their actions in the last 6
months, I assert that MaineHealth has demonstrated a willingness
commit fraud in order to achieve their goal of removing either
families’ rights to medical informed consent or the right to a
public education for their children to increase vaccine sales. In
no other area of medicine are these types of false claims on
pharmaceutical products tolerated.  I hope that Maine DHHS will take
this matter seriously and exercise its authority here to protect
Maine consumers against false vaccine safety claims. Attachment:

Ms. Grantham, 
 
This week on MPBN's Maine Calling, in
response to a question about vaccine safety, you made the following
claim: 
 
 MPBN:
“Cassandra what kind of research is out there about the safety of
vaccines?” Cassandra Grantham: “So what's really great is
that is that many different organizations have put a lot of time and
effort into understanding the safety and efficacy behind vaccines and
there have been several recent studies that have actually come out
looking at associations between vaccinations and different situations
that kids may find themselves in, autism being one of them, but many
others. And of course we can't do studies that actually force
families not to immunize their children so that we can look at what
we would call it a randomized controlled trial, it's just not fair.
So what we have been able to do is look back over time at different
populations of children and we've actually found that kids who are
immunized, completely immunized with all of the vaccines according to
the the schedule that Dr.  Blaisdell 
 was
mentioning the one that recommended by the CDC, that they have no
higher risk of getting autism and some of these other developmental
challenges that families face than those kids that delayed or did not
receive any immunizations at all. So we're finding that there is
research that is now delving deeper into this topic and actually
proving that the CDC's recommended schedule is safe and it does work
and it doesn't increase risks of other situations for kids.” 
 
To the best of my knowledge, this is a
false claim, as no such research exists.  This as testified to
by  Dr.
Coleen Boyle , Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects
and Developmental Disabilities during the House Oversight &
Government Reform Committee hearing  1 in 88 Children: A Look Into
the Federal Response to Rising Rates of Autism  on November 29,
2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism risk had
been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr. Boyle stated,
\"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\" 
 http://youtu.be/O_GrCAzpA_0?t=9m20s 
(please see the notes in the video that addresses the claims made by
Dr. Koren Boggs that such research exists in further detail.) 
 
My
understanding of the history of this topic is that the first such
request for a study was made by the FDA in 1981 after they removed
mercury from over the counter products.  FDA declined to ban it
from vaccines, asking CDC to first do a vaccinated v. unvaccinated
study to see if it increased health risks, however CDC declined to
perform the study. 
 
The autism and vaccine injury communities
have been asking for such a retrospective study to be done for more
than a decade now, and health authorities have continued to refuse. 
Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced the  Comprehensive
Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of
2007 
( http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.2832 :)
to force NIH to do such a study, and reintroduced such legislation in
the years since.  In response to what he learned from Dr. Boyle
during the 2012 hearings, Rep Bill Posey (R-FL) joined with Maloney
and introduced H.R. 1757, The Vaccine Safety Study Act
( https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/26/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E576-1 )
that would again compel HHS to perform the study that you claim
already exists.   
 
The bill was not passed, nor to my
knowledge has any vaccinated v. unvaccinated research on autism or
any other developmental disabilities been published since Dr. Boyle
offered her testimony before Congress. 
 
 As such it is
appropriate for you to either produce the citation for this research
that the vaccine injury community has been lobbying for, or to
retract your false safety claims on MPBN for the product line you are
representing. 
 
Your false claims are only made more
egregious by the fact that you have publicly stated in the Portland

are purposely lying to the public in order to remove parental rights

 Ms. 
Grantham, None of the citations you offer contain any research
on autism risk, or any other developmental disabilities, in
vaccinated v. unvaccinated children, which is the claim you made on
Maine Calling.  Again, no such publish research exists in any
form.   I therefore demand a retraction of the fraudulent
safety claim by yourself, MaineHealth and MPBN. I will not
cease using your image, as this is a very newsworthy story and the
professional headshot of a medical corporation employee making false
claims about the product safety of the pharmaceuticals that it sells
is fair use of this image.

 Ms.
Rooks, Mr. Smith and Mr. Vogelzang, On your December 1 episode
of Maine Calling, Cassandra Grantham, a representative of
MaineHealth, made a fraudulent safety claim on your show.  I
have copied you on the my email exchange with her, which details the
false claim, my correction of the false information as supported by
the Congressional testimony of the head of the CDC's Director of the
National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, and
my request to Ms. Grantham for her to cite the multiple studies that
she claim exist or retract her claim. As you can see, she has
failed to produce any research comparing autism rates in vaccinated
and unvaccinated populations and failed to retract her claim. I
there for request that Maine Calling retract Ms. Grantham's claim in
the same format which it was offered, noting the false claim on the
archived version of the interview if MPBN chooses to leave it
online. I further strongly encourage Maine Calling to perform
an honest evaluation on why vaccine rates are low in Maine and
falling nationally.  As the educated mother of a vaccine injured
child, I can attest to the real reason.  It is because the
liability protection given to the entire vaccine industry in 1986 has
resulted in massive corruption in the vaccine program.  Ms.
Graham's behavior on your show is case in point.  Medical
providers and medical industry representatives can make any safety
claims that they choose, even completely false claims, because there
is no accountability mechanism in place for the public to hold them
accountable for false claims.  Even when a child is killed by a
vaccine after a false claim like this is made to a parent coercing
them into administering a vaccine that they would not have otherwise
agreed to have delivered to their child, there is no recourse to hold
anyone accountable, or even force them to stop making these false
claims.  So false claims like this one, once spoken by someone
claiming to hold authority in vaccinated, simply continue to
circulate and be repeated.   No doubt Ms. Grantham's
false claim will now be circulated by those who have heard your
program, even medical professionals who administer vaccines to
children. The vaccine show you did with these three women on
December 1, was not just about vaccine rejection, it is the REASON
for vaccine rejection.  It is a real time example of how and why
vaccine interests are alienating and loosing the public trust by
abusing the public trust.  Your guests correctly reported that
the exodus from the vaccine program is being lead by educated parents
who have serious misgivings of the safety and trustworthyness of the
vaccine program, while they themselves were making false claims about
the safety of the vaccine program, thereby proving the untrustworthy
of the vaccine program.  And MPBN is participating in this
corruption by allowing false claims to made on your platform with out
challenge or correction. I hope that the irony that a show you
aired to raise confidence in the vaccination is actually destroying
trust in the vaccination is not lost on you.   Now this
claim of Ms. Grantham is merely one of many problematic statements
made by herself, MaineHealth, VaxMaineKids.org and Dr. Blaisdell, and
I would be happy to go over the false information that they are
sharing with the public under the guise of serving the public if you
decide to do a proper investigation of the fraud taking place in the
vaccine program both in Maine and at the federal level. But
for now, I await a response on your retraction of this particular
false statement.   I cannot imagine that MPBN would allow
any medical professional, industry representative or government
official to make such false claims about any other medical product
line or medical program.  I don't expect Maine Calling to allow
this to stand either. 
 
Thank you for your consideration, Ginger
Taylor, MS Media

 Dear
MaineHealth, This past week, Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth
appeared on MPBN's Maine Calling and made a fraudulent vaccine safety
claim. She reported to the public that there are several studies
comparing vaccinated v. unvaccinated children that find no increase
risk of autism and other developmental disabilities in children
vaccinated according to the CDC's recommended schedule.   In
fact, no such research has ever been published.   I
contacted Ms. Grantham and asked that she cite the research she
claims has been undertaken, or retract her statement.  She not
only failed to cite such studies, she actually cited a 2013 IOM
report that confirmed that no such research exists in the medical
literature, and that recommended against undertaking such research
because of cost, time and difficulty.  She has also failed to
retract her fraudulent claim and says she will not be responding to
me on this matter again. This is just the latest of several
false vaccine safety research claims that Ms. Grantham has made on
behalf of MaineHealth both in public and on the VaxMaineKids.org web
site, a MaineHealth Childhood Immunizations Program project. 
Several of these false statements have been brought to her attention
over the last five months, and she has failed to properly address
them.  I can therefore only assume that Ms. Grantham is a bad
faith player and is purposefully misleading of Mainers on vaccine
safety matters This is made all the more egregious as Ms.
Grantham has been quoted in the  Portland
Press Herald  as stating that, “Eliminating the philosophic
[vaccine] exemption is the ultimate goal,” of the work your
organization is undertaking.  It is unconscionable that
MaineHealth would make fraudulent safety claims in order to advance
the agenda of removing parental rights and depriving children of a
free and appropriate public education if their families decline to
participate in a medical program that presents severe adverse health
risks including disability, brain damage and death. I wish to
file a formal complaint against Ms. Grantham with MaineHealth. 
I believe that it is the duty of MaineHealth to review and retract
Ms. Grantham's false vaccine safety claims and to exercise
disciplinary action against Ms. Grantham, as well as clarify the
organization's position on the rights of parents to receive full and
accurate vaccine safety and efficacy information, and practice
uncoerced informed consent in vaccination. I have forwarded
the email exchanges with Ms. Grantham and MPBN below for your
review. I am publicly documenting this process  here . Please
direct me to appropriate contact on this matter so I may offer a full
account of the problem and offer MaineHealth my support in assuring
that it is offering accurate, evidence based information on vaccine
safety to the public. Thank you, Ginger Taylor Brunswick,
Maine

 To
the Food and Drug Administration  
 
 
 
 
 I would
like to file a complaint against MaineHealth for making fraudulent
statements concerning one of their product lines. 
 
 
 
 MaineHealth,
both on the VaxMaineKids.org web site and during an interview on MPBN
on December 1, have made false vaccine safety claims.  I have
contacted VaxMaineKids, MaineHealth and MPBN to ask for a retraction
and correction of the false marketing messages that they are issuing
to the public, but none of the organizations will properly address
the issue. 
 
 
 
 VaxMaineKids.org
makes the false claims on their web site that: “ THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM.”  And that, “No
other medical study anywhere in the world has ever found a link
between vaccines and autism. Not one.”
(http://www.vaxmainekids.org/mythbuster-series-autism/) During
an email exchange last summer with Cassandra Grantham, Program
Director of Child Health at MaineHealth, initiated by Ms. Grantham
after I had written about her work, I corrected the misinformation,
sending VaxMaineKids a list with dozens of studies that link vaccines
and autism. 
(http://www.scribd.com/doc/220807175/86-Research-Papers-Supporting-the-Vaccine-Autism-Link)
 Ms. Grantham failed to correct the false claims on the MaineHealth
web site, and wrote that she was no longer interested in discussing
the matter any further with me. Ms. Grantham, representing
MaineHealth, made further false claims on December 1 st 
on MPBN's Maine Calling, when she claimed that there were multiple
studies comparing populations of unvaccinated children to children
fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule that have found no
increased risk in autism among fully vaccinated children.   In
fact, no such research exists, as testified to by  Dr.
Col l een
Boyle ,
Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental
Disabilities during the House Oversight & Government Reform
Committee hearing  1
in 88 Children: A Look Into the Federal Response to Rising Rates of
Autism  on
November 29, 2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism
risk had been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr.
Boyle stated, \"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\"
 I wrote to Ms. Grantham to ask that she cite her sources or
retract her false claim.  In her response, she referred to three
publications as sources for her information, none of which referenced
a vaccinated v.. unvaccinated autism study.  In fact, one of her
references, a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine on the current
US vaccine program, addressed the lack vaccinated v. unvaccinated
research as a whole, and specifically in regard to autism and other
developmental disabilities, and notes that parents and the public
have been asking for this research for some time.  The IOM report
recommends against performing such research, because, although they
admit it can be accomplished and would be informative, it would also
be costly, time consuming and difficult.   Ms. Grantham
actually replied to me with information that confirms my allegations
against her false claim by MaineHealth. 
 
 
 
 I
have contacted several staff members at MaineHealth to ask for a
retraction and for clarification of their stance on a public policy. 
I have received no reply. Further, I have contacted both Maine
Calling hosts and producers, as well as MPBN management, to ask for a
retraction of these fraudulent claims, but none have replied.   I
have attached the email chains below. It is imperative that
the FDA provide oversight in this matter, as the federal 1986
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has removed the rights of
families to sue corporations like MaineHealth when members are harmed
or killed by a vaccine.  The result of this blanket liability
protection which has been in place for decades is that physicians,
medical care providers, health corporations and even government
agencies routinely put out false safety and efficacy information,
because there is no mechanism by which the public may directly hold
them accountable for fraudulent claims.  The public's right to take
these entities into a civil court, force them to testify under oath,
have judgments rendered by a jury and have remedies be enforced by a
judge has been removed.  As a result, misinformation can be
circulated by both malicious and merely uninformed parties, including
doctors providing recommendations to patients in their offices.  Bad
faith parties and organizations who wish to make outright fraudulent
claims are free to do so without fear of legal reprisal from their
customers, even if the worst possible outcome happens and the
vaccination that was delivered under false information or coercion
results in the death of a child. This complaint does not
represent the total number of false statements made by Ms. Grantham
and MaineHealth but is a short complaint on the easily corrected
fraud currently taking place.  In light of their refusal to correct
even these extremely obvious false statements, I believe that a full
accounting of their vaccine safety claims is appropriate. 
 
 
 
 Further,
Ms. Grantham in her professional, role has been quoted in the
Portland Press Herald as advocating the elimination of the
philosophical vaccine exemption in Maine.  This would remove the
rights of children to a free and appropriate education if their
parents did not choose to vaccinate as the state requests.  As
vaccines are legally classified by the federal government as
“Unavoidably Unsafe” (which means they cannot be made safe for
their intended use) and can result in serious diseases, disorders,
disability, brain damage and death, it a civil rights matter that
parents and individuals be free to exercise their right to informed
consent, and to reject one or more vaccines for one’s self or one’s
child.  It is also a civil rights matter that children be allowed
equal access to a free and appropriate public education without being
impeded by discriminatory policies.  In their actions in the last 6
months, I assert that MaineHealth has demonstrated a willingness
commit fraud in order to achieve their goal of removing either
families’ rights to medical informed consent or the right to a
public education for their children to increase vaccine sales. In
no other area of medicine are these types of false claims on
pharmaceutical products tolerated.  I hope that the FDA will take
this matter seriously and exercise its authority here to protect
consumers against false vaccine safety claims. Attachment:

Ms. Grantham, 
 
This week on MPBN's Maine Calling, in
response to a question about vaccine safety, you made the following
claim: 
 
 MPBN:
“Cassandra what kind of research is out there about the safety of
vaccines?” Cassandra Grantham: “So what's really great is
that is that many different organizations have put a lot of time and
effort into understanding the safety and efficacy behind vaccines and
there have been several recent studies that have actually come out
looking at associations between vaccinations and different situations
that kids may find themselves in, autism being one of them, but many
others. And of course we can't do studies that actually force
families not to immunize their children so that we can look at what
we would call it a randomized controlled trial, it's just not fair.
So what we have been able to do is look back over time at different
populations of children and we've actually found that kids who are
immunized, completely immunized with all of the vaccines according to
the the schedule that Dr.  Blaisdell 
 was
mentioning the one that recommended by the CDC, that they have no
higher risk of getting autism and some of these other developmental
challenges that families face than those kids that delayed or did not
receive any immunizations at all. So we're finding that there is
research that is now delving deeper into this topic and actually
proving that the CDC's recommended schedule is safe and it does work
and it doesn't increase risks of other situations for kids.” 
 
To the best of my knowledge, this is a
false claim, as no such research exists.  This as testified to
by  Dr.
Coleen Boyle , Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects
and Developmental Disabilities during the House Oversight &
Government Reform Committee hearing  1 in 88 Children: A Look Into
the Federal Response to Rising Rates of Autism  on November 29,
2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism risk had
been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr. Boyle stated,
\"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\" 
 http://youtu.be/O_GrCAzpA_0?t=9m20s 
(please see the notes in the video that addresses the claims made by
Dr. Koren Boggs that such research exists in further detail.) 
 
My
understanding of the history of this topic is that the first such
request for a study was made by the FDA in 1981 after they removed
mercury from over the counter products.  FDA declined to ban it
from vaccines, asking CDC to first do a vaccinated v. unvaccinated
study to see if it increased health risks, however CDC declined to
perform the study. 
 
The autism and vaccine injury communities
have been asking for such a retrospective study to be done for more
than a decade now, and health authorities have continued to refuse. 
Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced the  Comprehensive
Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of
2007 
( http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.2832 :)
to force NIH to do such a study, and reintroduced such legislation in
the years since.  In response to what he learned from Dr. Boyle
during the 2012 hearings, Rep Bill Posey (R-FL) joined with Maloney
and introduced H.R. 1757, The Vaccine Safety Study Act
( https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/26/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E576-1 )
that would again compel HHS to perform the study that you claim
already exists.   
 
The bill was not passed, nor to my
knowledge has any vaccinated v. unvaccinated research on autism or
any other developmental disabilities been published since Dr. Boyle
offered her testimony before Congress. 
 
 As such it is
appropriate for you to either produce the citation for this research
that the vaccine injury community has been lobbying for, or to
retract your false safety claims on MPBN for the product line you are
representing. 
 
Your false claims are only made more
egregious by the fact that you have publicly stated in the Portland
Press Herald that, \"Eliminating the philosophic [vaccine]
exemption is the ultimate goal.\"  It is my belief that you
are purposely lying to the public in order to remove parental rights
and deny Maine children a Free And Appropriate Education in order to
promote sales of a product line whose lack of safety is thoroughly
documented both by the federal government and the product packaging
itself.  This type of propaganda sales campaign should not be
tolerated by any responsible medical professional, health
organization, media outlet or legislator.

 Hello
Ginger ~ 
 Thank you
for listening to MPBN’s Maine Calling Show – it is great to know
that we have reached such a wide audience with important vaccine
messages.  I want to clarify that I do not represent any product
line or company other than MaineHealth, which is a health system
which supports on-time childhood immunizations.  I have never
been paid by or consulted for a pharmaceutical or medical
intervention company or agency. Please see below for MaineHealth’s
official statement regarding childhood immunizations.    
 
 MaineHealth supports the
health, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and
young adults.  We believe that vaccinating children on-time, as
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family
Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and
Gynecology (ACOG), is one of the best ways to reduce
vaccine-preventable diseases in our communities and keep children
safe and healthy. 
 
 In regards
to my statements about vaccine safety, I based those on these
studies.

 Ms. 
Grantham, None of the citations you offer contain any research
on autism risk, or any other developmental disabilities, in
vaccinated v. unvaccinated children, which is the claim you made on
Maine Calling.  Again, no such publish research exists in any
form.   I therefore demand a retraction of the fraudulent
safety claim by yourself, MaineHealth and MPBN. I will not
cease using your image, as this is a very newsworthy story and the
professional headshot of a medical corporation employee making false
claims about the product safety of the pharmaceuticals that it sells
is fair use of this image.

 Ms.
Rooks, Mr. Smith and Mr. Vogelzang, On your December 1 episode
of Maine Calling, Cassandra Grantham, a representative of
MaineHealth, made a fraudulent safety claim on your show.  I
have copied you on the my email exchange with her, which details the
false claim, my correction of the false information as supported by
the Congressional testimony of the head of the CDC's Director of the
National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, and
my request to Ms. Grantham for her to cite the multiple studies that
she claim exist or retract her claim. As you can see, she has
failed to produce any research comparing autism rates in vaccinated
and unvaccinated populations and failed to retract her claim. I
there for request that Maine Calling retract Ms. Grantham's claim in
the same format which it was offered, noting the false claim on the
archived version of the interview if MPBN chooses to leave it
online. I further strongly encourage Maine Calling to perform
an honest evaluation on why vaccine rates are low in Maine and
falling nationally.  As the educated mother of a vaccine injured
child, I can attest to the real reason.  It is because the
liability protection given to the entire vaccine industry in 1986 has
resulted in massive corruption in the vaccine program.  Ms.
Graham's behavior on your show is case in point.  Medical
providers and medical industry representatives can make any safety
claims that they choose, even completely false claims, because there
is no accountability mechanism in place for the public to hold them
accountable for false claims.  Even when a child is killed by a
vaccine after a false claim like this is made to a parent coercing
them into administering a vaccine that they would not have otherwise
agreed to have delivered to their child, there is no recourse to hold
anyone accountable, or even force them to stop making these false
claims.  So false claims like this one, once spoken by someone
claiming to hold authority in vaccinated, simply continue to
circulate and be repeated.   No doubt Ms. Grantham's
false claim will now be circulated by those who have heard your
program, even medical professionals who administer vaccines to
children. The vaccine show you did with these three women on
December 1, was not just about vaccine rejection, it is the REASON
for vaccine rejection.  It is a real time example of how and why
vaccine interests are alienating and loosing the public trust by
abusing the public trust.  Your guests correctly reported that
the exodus from the vaccine program is being lead by educated parents
who have serious misgivings of the safety and trustworthyness of the
vaccine program, while they themselves were making false claims about
the safety of the vaccine program, thereby proving the untrustworthy
of the vaccine program.  And MPBN is participating in this
corruption by allowing false claims to made on your platform with out
challenge or correction. I hope that the irony that a show you
aired to raise confidence in the vaccination is actually destroying
trust in the vaccination is not lost on you.   Now this
claim of Ms. Grantham is merely one of many problematic statements
made by herself, MaineHealth, VaxMaineKids.org and Dr. Blaisdell, and
I would be happy to go over the false information that they are
sharing with the public under the guise of serving the public if you
decide to do a proper investigation of the fraud taking place in the
vaccine program both in Maine and at the federal level. But
for now, I await a response on your retraction of this particular
false statement.   I cannot imagine that MPBN would allow
any medical professional, industry representative or government
official to make such false claims about any other medical product
line or medical program.  I don't expect Maine Calling to allow
this to stand either.

 Dear
MaineHealth, This past week, Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth
appeared on MPBN's Maine Calling and made a fraudulent vaccine safety
claim. She reported to the public that there are several studies
comparing vaccinated v. unvaccinated children that find no increase
risk of autism and other developmental disabilities in children
vaccinated according to the CDC's recommended schedule.   In
fact, no such research has ever been published.   I
contacted Ms. Grantham and asked that she cite the research she
claims has been undertaken, or retract her statement.  She not
only failed to cite such studies, she actually cited a 2013 IOM
report that confirmed that no such research exists in the medical
literature, and that recommended against undertaking such research
because of cost, time and difficulty.  She has also failed to
retract her fraudulent claim and says she will not be responding to
me on this matter again. This is just the latest of several
false vaccine safety research claims that Ms. Grantham has made on
behalf of MaineHealth both in public and on the VaxMaineKids.org web
site, a MaineHealth Childhood Immunizations Program project. 
Several of these false statements have been brought to her attention
over the last five months, and she has failed to properly address
them.  I can therefore only assume that Ms. Grantham is a bad
faith player and is purposefully misleading of Mainers on vaccine
safety matters This is made all the more egregious as Ms.
Grantham has been quoted in the  Portland
Press Herald  as stating that, “Eliminating the philosophic
[vaccine] exemption is the ultimate goal,” of the work your
organization is undertaking.  It is unconscionable that
MaineHealth would make fraudulent safety claims in order to advance
the agenda of removing parental rights and depriving children of a
free and appropriate public education if their families decline to
participate in a medical program that presents severe adverse health
risks including disability, brain damage and death. I wish to
file a formal complaint against Ms. Grantham with MaineHealth. 
I believe that it is the duty of MaineHealth to review and retract
Ms. Grantham's false vaccine safety claims and to exercise
disciplinary action against Ms. Grantham, as well as clarify the
organization's position on the rights of parents to receive full and
accurate vaccine safety and efficacy information, and practice
uncoerced informed consent in vaccination. I have forwarded
the email exchanges with Ms. Grantham and MPBN below for your
review. I am publicly documenting this process  here . Please
direct me to appropriate contact on this matter so I may offer a full
account of the problem and offer MaineHealth my support in assuring
that it is offering accurate, evidence based information on vaccine
safety to the public. Thank you, Ginger Taylor Brunswick,
Maine

 12/22/14 
 
 
 
 I would
like to file a complaint against MaineHealth for making fraudulent
statements concerning one of their product lines. 
 
 
 
 MaineHealth,
both on their VaxMaineKids.org web site and during an interview on
Maine Public Broadcasting (MPBN) on December 1, have made false
vaccine safety claims.  I have contacted VaxMaineKids, MaineHealth
and MPBN to ask for a retraction and correction of the false
marketing messages that they are issuing to the public, but none of
the organizations will properly address the issue. 
 
 
 
 VaxMaineKids.org
makes the false claims on their web site that: “ THERE
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM.”  And that, “No
other medical study anywhere in the world has ever found a link
between vaccines and autism. Not one.”
(http://www.vaxmainekids.org/mythbuster-series-autism/) During
an email exchange with Cassandra Grantham, Program Director of Child
Health at MaineHealth, initiated by Ms. Grantham after I had written
about her work, I corrected the misinformation, sending VaxMaineKids
a list with dozens of studies that link vaccines and autism. 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/220807175/86-Research-Papers-Supporting-the-Vaccine-Autism-Link
 Ms. Grantham failed to correct the false claims on the MaineHealth
web site. Ms. Grantham, representing MaineHealth, made further
false claims on December 1 st 
on MPBN's Maine Calling, when she claimed that there were multiple
studies comparing populations of unvaccinated children to children
fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule that have found no
increased risk in autism among fully vaccinated children.   In
fact, no such research exists, as testified to by  Dr.
Col l een
Boyle ,
Director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental
Disabilities during the House Oversight & Government Reform
Committee hearing,  1
in 88 Children: A Look Into the Federal Response to Rising Rates of
Autism  on
November 29, 2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism
risk had been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr.
Boyle stated, \"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\"
 I wrote to Ms. Grantham to ask that she cite her sources or
retract her false claim.  In her response, she referred to three
publications as sources for her information, none of which referenced
such a study.  In fact, one of her references, a 2013 report by the
Institute of Medicine on the current US vaccine program, addressed
the lack vaccinated v. unvaccinated research in regard to autism, and
notes that parents and the public have been asking for this research
for some time.  It
is imperative that the FTC provide oversight in this matter, as the
federal 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has removed the
rights of families to sue corporations like MaineHealth when members
are harmed or killed by a vaccine.   
 
 
 
 
 Ms.
Grantham, in her professional, role has been quoted in the Portland
Press Herald as advocating the elimination of the philosophical
vaccine exemption in Maine.  This would remove the right of children
to a free and appropriate education if their parents did not choose
to vaccinate as the state requests.  I assert that MaineHealth has
demonstrated a willingness commit fraud in order to achieve their
goal of removing either families’ rights to medical informed
consent or the right to a public education for their children to
increase vaccine sales. 
 
 
So doctors... feel free to claim that vaccines are made of rainbows and unicorn tears if you think you patients will believe you... cause no one cares if you lie.

Yes Some of the H1N1 Vaccines/Swine Flu Shots Have Thimerosal/Mercury In Them
" "
Remember all those talking heads on TV that keep saying that mercury is gone from vaccines and won't be in the H1N1 flu shot?  They are misinforming you. 
 
Does the Swine Flu shot have mercury in it?  The answer is yes... some of them. 
 
If you decide to get the shot, INSIST on seeing the vaccine package insert.  If you are offered a shot that is drawn from a vial, that will be a mercury containing vaccine. 
 
Keep in mind that many parents of children with autism reported that their child received a shot from a multi-dose vial, and then saw the nurse throw the bottle away.  Mercury is a heavy metal, and if the nurses who use that vial do not \"shake vigorously before use\" then the mercury settles at the bottom and the last person to get a shot drawn from that vial gets a \"hot shot\" with all the mercury in it. 
 
This week the FDA released the vaccine package inserts for the upcoming H1N1 vaccines:

Pay close attention to Section 17.2 where they discuss that patients are CONTAGIOUS after getting the nasal form of this vaccine. 
 
This can actually ...spread the disease that the CDC is supposedly trying to prevent. 
 
Note that the adverse reactions section reports that a side effect of the H1N1 flu shot in about ten percent of recipients is..... the flu itself.

IF you are getting the shot, read the packaging, make sure it is Hg free. And think twice about getting this shot. 
 
I have heard it reported that that mercury in vaccines has been proven safe... this is absolutely false.

Has Thimerosal Actually Been Removed From Vaccines?  If Not,  Of What Value Are the Epidemiological Studies?
" "
 Are the epidemiological studies relied upon by public authorities to refute assertions that the mercury based vaccine preservative thimerosal is responsible for some or all autism  cases reliable? These studies tend to show that autism rates did not decline after removal of thimerosal from vaccines.   This past year the epidemiological defense of vaccines took a hit with the Poling case and with assertions by Dr. Bernardine Healy, a former director of the American Red Cross and the US National Institutes of Health, that the necessary clinical research to refute such a connection had not been done, particularly into subsets of children who might be genetically vulnerable or prediposed to develop when autism triggered by mercury or other toxins?  Dr. Healy stated in  Fighting the Autism-Vaccine War , US  News & World Report, April 10, 2008, that: “vaccine experts tend to look at the population as a whole, not at individual patients. And population studies are not granular enough to detect individual metabolic, genetic, or immunological variation that might make some children under certain circumstances susceptible to neurological complications after vaccination. She also stated, amongst other points, that: thimerosal crosses the placenta, and pregnant women are advised to get flu shots, which often contain it . I find that last statement very troubling.  If the epidemiological studies are based on the premise that thimerosal has  been removed from vaccines and in fact they have not then what is the probative value,  if any,  of the epidemiological studies?   Particularly given the pregnancy context cited by Dr. Healy. I am only a humble small town lawyer in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada but my concern is prompted in significant part by the information provided by a prominent and accomplished member of the US  medical establishment.  Other credible sources also lead me to the same concern about whether thimerosal has, or has not, been removed from vaccines as claimed in the public health authorities' refutations of vaccine-autism connections. As of this posting  the web site of the US Food and Drug Administration  states:   Over the past several years, because of an increasing awareness of the  theoretical potential for neurotoxicity   of even low levels of organomercurials  and because of the increased number of thimerosal containing vaccines that had been added to the infant immunization schedule, concerns about the use of thimerosal in vaccines and other products have been raised. Indeed, because of these concerns, the Food and Drug Administration has worked with, and  continues to work with, vaccine manufacturers to reduce or eliminate thimerosal from vaccines.    Thimerosal has been removed from   or reduced to trace amounts  in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger,  with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine (see  Table 1 ).  A preservative-free version of the inactivated influenza vaccine (contains trace amounts of thimerosal) is  available in limited supply  at this time for use in infants, children and pregnant women. Some vaccines such as Td, which is indicated for older children (≥ 7 years of age) and adults, are also now available in formulations that are free of thimerosal or contain only trace amounts. Vaccines with trace amounts of thimerosal contain 1 microgram or less of mercury per dose. The above, current statements from the  US FDA , raise several concerns for me: 1) Theoretical potential for neurotoxicity of even low levels of organomercurials The use of the term \" theoretical potential for neurotoxicity \" tells me that potential toxcity of organomercurials has NOT been definitively ruled out by the FDA. I appreciate that the expression is used in an historical context to explain the decision to remove mercury based preservatives from vaccines but surely the FDA web site would have immediately stated after that comment that there was no longer even a theoretical potential if such were the case. 2) continues to work with, vaccine manufacturers to reduce or eliminate thimerosal from vaccines. Again, this information is taken from the web site of the US FDA as it exists today.   Why are they continuing to reduce or eliminate thimerosal from vaccines if the epidemiological studies were based on the premise that thimerosal had already been removed?   I appreciate that some of the studies are from other countries but have those countries all completely removed thimerosal from vaccines? If so, why were those other countries able to completely remove thimerosal when the US can not? In the United States a study by the California Department of Health released in February 2008 found that autism rates remained steady after the removal of thimerosal from vaccines. That study conclusion was qualified though by  Dr. Robert Schechter, a health officer with the California health department and lead author on the report of the study as reported in the  Lexington-Herald, February 5, 2008:   As for Haley's argument that some children still might be getting some mercury from vaccines, Schechter said that could be true. But he said the general removal of thimerosal from vaccines still should have caused autism rates to fall -- if mercury were the culprit in the disease.    \"I would not claim that children are getting no mercury from vaccines,\" Schechter said. \"But the average exposure for the population has been substantially decreased over the past decade. If mercury from vaccinations was a primary cause of autism, you would expect rates to be dropping substantially.\"   Substantial decrease is not the same as total removal of mercury from vaccines.  The California epidemiological study, at least, is not based on removal of mercury from vaccines. 3) Trace amounts The FDA site, as quoted above, states that   vaccines with trace amounts of thimerosal contain 1 microgram or less of mercury per dose.   That certainly sounds like a very small amount and the implication appears to be that the amount is too small to have any effect. But the FDA also referred to the   theoretical potential for neurotoxicity of even low levels of organomercurials.   It seems dubious to claim that epidemiological studies show no autism increase after removal of mercury-thimerosal if all elements of the material have not in fact been removed when the potential for neurotoxicity is recognized even in small amounts.  Partcularly since the FDA, as stated above, considers vaccines with trace amounts to be vaccines with the mercury removed:   A preservative-free version of the inactivated influenza vaccine (contains trace amounts of thimerosal) is  available in limited supply  at this time for use in infants, children and pregnant women.  Why leave trace amounts in the vaccines to begin with? If trace amounts of thimerosal can still have a preservative effect on bacteria in the vaccines then why can't they also have a neurotoxic effect on children receiving the vaccines?  And some of the flu vaccines, the ones not considered thimerosal free, contain more than trace amounts of thimerosal. I am not a medical authority and do not pretend to be.  Nor do I claim that vaccines or thimerosal cause autism.   As some one who does earn his living by some degree of critical thinking and analysis I find the statements of public health authorities about epidemiological studies refuting a vaccine-autism link open to question. Their own statements appear to contradict their claims that the studies refuting a vaccine-autism link are based on periods when thimerosal was removed from vaccines. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

IOM Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism (2004) Discouraged Investigation of Possible Vaccine Autism Connection
" "
 Anyone wishing to read the   Institute of Medicine  (IOM) Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism (2004)   referenced in the  CBS interview  with former NIH Head Dr. Bernadine Healy can access it at the  National  Academies Press  site. The document is 214 pages with hundreds of references to autism.   Some comments in the Review: At page  152:               BOX 2             Committee Conclusions and Recommendations                          SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT              Causality Conclusions              The committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.              The committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between MMR vaccine and autism.              Biological Mechanisms Conclusions              In the absence of experimental or human evidence that vaccination (either the MMR vaccine or the preservative thimerosal) affects metabolic, developmental, immune, or other physiological or molecular mechanisms that are causally related to the development of autism, the committee concludes that the hypotheses generated to date are theoretical only.              SIGNIFICANCE ASSESSMENT              The committee concludes that because autism can be such a devastating disease, any speculation that links vaccines and autism means that this is a significant issue.              PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE RECOMMENDATIONS              The committee recommends a public health response that fully supports an array of vaccine safety activities. In addition the committee recommends that available funding for autism research be channeled to the most promising areas.              Policy Review              At this time, the committee does not recommend a policy review of the licensure of MMR vaccine or of the current schedule and recommendations for the administration of the MMR vaccine.              At this time, the committee does not recommend a policy review of the current schedule and recommendations for the administration of routine childhood vaccines based on hypotheses regarding thimerosal and autism.              Given the lack of direct evidence for a biological mechanism and the fact that all well-designed epidemiological studies provide evidence of no association between thimerosal and autism, the committee recommends that cost-benefit assessments regarding the use of thimerosal-containing versus thimerosal-free vaccines and other biological or pharmaceutical products, whether in the United States or other countries, should not include autism as a potential risk. The above recommendations appear to support Dr. Healy's statements that the IOM expressly discouraged research and investigation of a possible vaccine/thimerosal link to autism and that   the IOM report authors did so because of fear of vaccination rejection by the general  population.  As the above quote indicates the recommendation was based on epidemiological studies. autism

"20751" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/03/18/minneapolis-reports-three-more-measles-cases/" "Minneapolis reports three more measles cases" "In  Minneapolis reports three more measles cases , the Minneapolis Star Tribune discusses, well, three more measles cases in the city.  Why bring this up here? Three more children under the age of five have developed cases of measles in Minneapolis, state health officials reported Thursday, including two Somali children who were not vaccinated because of fears about the vaccine safety. Four children have been infected.  Three were hospitalized.  At least two unvaccinated out of fear. Three more children under the age of five have developed cases of measles in Minneapolis, state health officials reported Thursday, including two Somali children who were not vaccinated because of fears about the vaccine safety. 
 Officials said that the vaccination rate has dropped in Minnesota’s Somali community, largely because of misconceptions about the vaccine safety. Concerns about a possible link between the vaccine and autism have spread in the Somali community, as well as other communities, in spite of medical reports debunking the connection. 
 “Contrary to misinformation that may still be circulating, the measles vaccine is safe and effective,” said Dr. Edward Ehlinger, Minnesota Commissioner of Health. “Without it, the risk of disease is real. Children can die from measles.” 
 The previous case, reported March 5, involved a child under a year old who was too young to be vaccinated. Officials said they did not know whether the fourth child had been vaccinated. I can already write the responses: 
“Better measles than autism” (as though this were a real choice.  MMR doesn’t increase the risk of autism) 
“If they offered a safe measles vaccine, this wouldn’t have happened” (as though the MMR causes autism, making it “unsafe”) 
“look at all the reports in VAERS of death/injury/etc” (as though every report in VAERS is an event caused by vaccines) 
“but vaccines don’t work anyway” I could go on with the responses, but why?  They are as obvious as they are lame. (edit to add–I missed on obvious one that has already been made: “4 cases=outbreak?”.  That one  just boggles the mind.  How many should there be before we take action?  If these were demonstrated cases of vaccines causing autism, the answer would be no more.  But, hey, it’s just a life-threatening disease in children, one under a year old.  I guess that “immature immune system” we hear vaccine skeptics claim is just fine at fighting a full on infection.  Just not a vaccine.)

Recommended 2006 Immunization Schedule, American Academy Of PediatricsCategory: Pediatrics News Article Date: 31 Jan 2006 - 0:00am (UK)                         The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued the recommended 2006 childhood immunization schedule for the United States. The statement represents joint recommendations from the AAP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). The 2006 schedule reflects several changes including the following: -- Hepatitis A vaccine is now recommended for universal administration to all infants 12 to 23 months of age, with a second dose six months later. -- A single dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine, a vaccine to prevent sepsis and meningitis, is recommended for all 11-to 12-year-olds, for adolescents at high school entry or 15 years of age, and for college freshmen who will be living in a dormitory. -- A single dose of an adolescent preparation of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular petussis (Tdap) vaccine is recommended for 11- to 12-year-olds, provided they have not received a tetanus and diphtheria (Td) booster dose, and for adolescents 13 to 18 years of age who missed the 11- to 12-year-old Td or Tdap booster dose. A licensure application has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for a live, oral rotavirus vaccine. The AAP is considering recommendations for use of this vaccine.

Autism Vaccine Myth Busting: Thimerosal Is Still Used In Vaccines
" "
 One of the myths pushed in the mainstream media is that thimerosal, the mercury preservative used in vaccines, has been removed from vaccines.  That position simply is not true.  
 The recent H1N1 panic showed that health authorities and pharmaceuticals still push vaccines containing thimerosal when it suits them.  The  Ipswich Massachusetts Chronicle  web site on  February 2, 2010 advertised immunization clinics for February 16 and 25, 2010 for thimerosal containing H1N1 shots: 
 
 
 \"Only the injectable (shot) form of the H1N1 influenza vaccine will be used. 
 
 
 Participants should wear a shirt with loose0fitting sleeves or short sleeves to the clinic since the injection will be given in the upper arm. 
 
 
 Just like the seasonal flu vaccine, many formulations of the H1N1 vaccine contain a preservative called thimerosal.  The vaccine that will be used at the clinic contains thimerosal.\" 
 
 
 Here in New Brunswick Canada the H1N1 (Swine Flu) vaccine also contained thimerosal and adjuvants and which were declared safe by our provincial health authorities as reflected in this   October 8, 2009 NB government news release .  Of particular note, our provincial health authorities declared that thimerosal does not cause autism and is safe to give to pregnant women, one of the high priority groups targeted to receive the H1N1 shot during the fall H1N1 Pandemic/Panic: 
 
 There have also been reports and public speculation about the safety of the H1N1 vaccine. The contents of the H1N1 vaccine will protect against contracting H1N1. The included additives and preservatives are there to help the vaccine work, and are not cause for alarm. 
 As a multi-dose vaccine, the H1N1 influenza vaccine will contain a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal to prevent contamination of the vaccine by serious infectious agents from the growth of bacteria. Thimerosal also has a stabilizing effect on the vaccine, ensuring its effectiveness. 
 The seasonal flu vaccine and most hepatitis B vaccines are also multi-dose vaccines, and thimerosal is added during the manufacturing process to maintain sterility of the vaccine. 
 There is no safety reason to avoid using vaccines containing thimerosal.  The best available scientific evidence to date shows no link between vaccines containing thimerosal and any adverse health condition, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. 
 The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has reviewed the safety of thimerosal and concluded that, \" There is no legitimate safety reason to avoid the use of thimerosal-containing products for children or older individuals, including pregnant women.\" International bodies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, share this opinion. 
 Most of the H1N1 vaccine available in New Brunswick will also contain an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance that is added to a vaccine in order to boost an individual's immune response. It also means that less of the virus, or antigen, is needed to make a dose of the vaccine. Unadjuvanted vaccine has no booster element, and more antigen is needed to create this kind of vaccine. 
 By developing an adjuvanted vaccine, Canada has used less of the virus material (antigen), allowing us to immunize more people in a timely manner. 
 Adjuvants are not new. Many commonly used vaccines in Canada contain an adjuvant. Adjuvants have been used for several decades to boost immune response to vaccines. However, adjuvants have not previously been used with influenza vaccines in Canada. 
 The WHO has indicated that it has no special concerns about the safety of adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines in general. 
 
The WHO is now under scrutiny for its role in pushing the H1N1 panic button.  And not everyone shares our NB officials' unquestioning faith  that thimerosal does not play a role in causing autism particularly when given to pregnant women.  Dr. Bernadine Healy, a highly respected former US National Institutes of Health Director has stated several times that the issue of a thimerosal autism connection is still an open question. She has made particular reference to the possible effect of the mercury preservative thimerosal o the fetuses of pregnant women: 
 
 \" thimerosal crosses the placenta, and pregnant women are advised to get flu shots, which often contain it.  Studies in mice suggest that genetic variation influences brain sensitivity to the toxic effects of mercury. And a primate study designed to mimic vaccination in infants reported in 2005 that thimerosal may clear from the blood in a matter of days but leaves inorganic mercury behind in the brain. \" 
 Former NIH Director Dr. Healy's concerns do not appear to have been taken seriously by public health authorities during the great H1N1 Swine Flu scare of 2009.

Can I Get The Flu Shot While Pregnant?
" "
(I have noticed a lot of people coming to my blog from the \"Can I get the flu shot while pregnant\" search term.  They have been referred to another post of mine, \" Did You Get The Flu Shot While Pregnant \".  Feel free to visit that post, which is on mom's reports of long term damage done to their kids from getting the flu shot, but I thought I should write something that more directly speaks to this question:) 
 
The CDC and it's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends the flu shot for pregnant women.  
 
However, I believe that this is an irresponsible recommendation as the flu shot has not been safety tested on pregnant women. 
 
And despite the fact that some of these flu vaccines are not for use in children, the CDC and ACIP have not issued a warning for pregnant women not to have them. 
 
Additionally, despite repeated requests from parents of vaccine injured children, the CDC and ACIP will not state a preference for pregnant women to receive only Thimerosal free flu shots. 
 
From the  vaccine package inserts : 
 
 Fluarix (Thimerosal free): 
Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with FLUARIX. It is not known whether FLUARIX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. FLUARIX should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. The ACIP has issued recommendations regarding the use of the influenza virus vaccine in pregnant women. 
 
Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether FLUARIX is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when FLUARIX is administered to a nursing woman. The ACIP has issued recommendations regarding the use of the influenza virus vaccine in nursing mothers. 
 
Pediatric Use: FLUARIX IS NOT INDICATED FOR USE IN CHILDREN. 
 
 Flulaval (Contains Thimerosal): 
Pregnancy:  Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with FLULAVAL. It is also not known whether FLULAVAL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. FLULAVAL should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. 
 
Nursing Mothers:  It is not known whether FLULAVAL is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when FLULAVAL is administered to a nursing woman. 
 
Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of FLULAVAL in pediatric patients have not been established. 
 
 Flumist (Thimerosal Free): 
Pregnancy:  Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with FluMist. It is not known whether FluMist can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.  FluMist should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. 
The effect of the vaccine on embryo-fetal and pre-weaning development was evaluated in a developmental toxicity study using pregnant rats receiving the frozen formulation. Groups of animals were administered the vaccine either once (during the period of organogenesis on gestation day 6) or twice (prior to gestation and during the period of organogenesis on gestation day 6), 250mcL/rat/occasion (approximately 110-140 human dose equivalents based on TCID50), by intranasal instillation. No adverse effects on pregnancy, parturition, lactation, embryo-fetal or preweaning development were observed. There were no vaccine related fetal malformations or other 
evidence of teratogenesis noted in this study. 
 
Nursing Mothers:  It is not known whether FluMist is excreted in human milk. Therefore, as some viruses are excreted in human milk and additionally, because of the possibility of shedding of vaccine virus and the close proximity of a nursing infant and mother, caution should be exercised if FluMist is administered to nursing mothers. 
 
Pediatric Use:  FluMist is not indicated for use in children  
 
 
 Fluvirin (Contains Thimerosal) 
Pregnancy:  Pregnancy Category C 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Influenza Virus Vaccine (FLUVIRIN®). It is also not known whether Influenza Virus Vaccine (FLUVIRIN®) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Influenza Virus Vaccine (FLUVIRIN®) should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. 
The clinical judgment of the attending physician should prevail at all times in determining whether to administer Influenza Virus Vaccine to a pregnant woman. 
 
Pediatric Use:  The safety and immunogenicity of FLUVIRIN® have been established in the age group 4 years to 16 years.  The use of FLUVIRIN® in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of FLUVIRIN® in adults that demonstrate the immunogenicity of FLUVIRIN®.  The safety and immunogenicity of FLUVIRIN® have not been established in children  
 
 
 Fluzone (Comes in both Thimerosal Containing and Thimerosal Free): 
PREGNANCY CATEGORY C 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Influenza Virus Vaccine. It is not known whether Influenza Virus Vaccine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Influenza Virus Vaccine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. For guidance regarding use in pregnant women, see INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. 
 
PEDIATRIC USE:  SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF FLUZONE VACCINE (SUBVIRION) IN INFANTS BELOW THE AGE OF 6 MONTHS HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.

MMR + Chicken Pox Vaccine = More Seizures
" "
Getting the Merck MMRV (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Chicken Pox combo vaccine), rather than the MMR and separate Chicken Pox vaccine, results in \"slightly more\" or more than double the seizures, depending on how you want to spin the story: \"It found a rate of febrile seizure of nine per 10,000 vaccinations among MMRV recipients, and four per 10,000 among children who got separate MMR and chicken pox shots. Of 166 children who had febrile seizures after either type of vaccination, 26 were hospitalized and none died, the CDC said.\" So CDC removes its preference for the MMRV vaccine, but does not change it's preference to the MMR and separate chicken pox vaccine.  It just does not state a preference.  Because half the seizures is not worth stating a preference?! This does not just call for a preference, it seems to make the MMRV obsolete.  What they had before the MMRV was safer. Is the CDC's priority the health of children or the health of Merck's bottom line? WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Children who get a combined vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox are  slightly more  likely to have seizures compared to those getting two separate shots for the same diseases, U.S. officials said on Thursday. The seizures are not usually life-threatening and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was no longer expressing a preference that children get the so-called MMRV combined vaccine rather than two shots -- the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) and a separate one against varicella (chicken pox). The CDC said it made the change after seeing evidence that children who got the combined MMRV vaccine faced an elevated, but still very small, risk of suffering febrile seizures after vaccination compared to those who got the two shots. A febrile seizure is a convulsion in young children associated with an increase in body temperature, often from an infection. While frightening, the seizures are not usually dangerous and only a small percentage of children who experience one go on to develop epilepsy. Dr. John Iskander, the acting director of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office, said it remained very important that parents get their children vaccinated against these diseases. \"These are vaccines that have had enormous public health benefits,\" Iskander said. The CDC said the availability of the MMRV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, already was limited in the United States because of manufacturing constraints unrelated to vaccine safety, and was not expected to be widely available until 2009. The CDC said a study examined the risk for febrile seizures seven to 10 days after vaccination among 43,353 children ages 12 months to 23 months who received the MMRV vaccine and 314,599 children of the same age who received the MMR vaccine and chicken pox vaccine administered separately. It found a rate of febrile seizure of nine per 10,000 vaccinations among MMRV recipients, and four per 10,000 among children who got separate MMR and chicken pox shots. Of 166 children who had febrile seizures after either type of vaccination, 26 were hospitalized and none died, the CDC said.

New Brunswick's H1N1 (Swine Flu) Vaccine Autism Experiment
" "
 New Brunswick is about to conduct its own H1N1 Vaccine Autism experiment. The H1N1 vaccines used here will contain both thimerosal AND unspecified adjuvants. As with most public health authorities the NB government information is not balanced concerning the possible risks associated with the vaccines generally and specifically with respect to possible vaccine autism connections. There is frequent mention of authorities like the WHO which called this H1N1 flu virus a pandemic in the first place, and the CDC, in   supporting the safety of the vaccines   generally. There is also the usual one sided information concerning possible vaccine autism connections, information which fails to mention credible health authorities like Dr. Bernadine Healy, Dr. Julie Gerberding and Dr. Jon Poling who have said that more research needs to be done on vaccine autism issues. Nor does the information release mention the critique offered by those like Dr. Healy who points out that the \"science\" to date on vaccine autism issues, the epidemiological studies, are not specific enough to determine the impact of vaccines on vulnerable population subsets, on individual children with conditions that might render them vulnerable. Dr. Healy also points out that flu vaccines have contained thimerosal and thimerosal crosses the placenta. (Dr. Poling, a neurologist, was involved with the issue with his daughter on whose behalf it was successfully claimed that her autism resulted from vaccination. The US government settled on the basis that her \"autism like symptoms\" were caused by the vaccine aggravation of her pre-existing mitochondrial disorder).         The NB government communication release does not mention that no observational study has been done comparing autism rates of vaccinated populations with autism rates of unvaccinated populations. With the use of vaccines containing thimerosal and adjuvants, most likely squalene, with pregnant women and young children targeted for early receipt of the H1N1 vaccines, the NB government is essentially conducting such a study. Hopefully they will remember these events in assessing NB autism rates 2 to 5 years from now as the young children vaccinated with the thimerosal and adjuvant (squalene) and the new born children of vaccinated pregnant women mature.          I don't know if vaccines cause or trigger autism. I am no longer assured by overstated health authority pronouncements that vaccines do not cause autism, that the science is closed on these issues, when people of such credibility as Dr. Healy, Dr. Gerberding and Dr. Poling say more research is needed.     I do hope that our NB health authorities turn out to be right whether it is from a lucky guess or not. I hope that they save every child and adult from H1N1 flu death with no resulting cases of autism. But I am far from convinced that such will be the case. I absolutely hope that they remember this H1N1 flu vaccine and assess future autism rates with an eye to its ingredients - thimerosal, squalene and whatever other ingredients it contains. And it is probably hoping for too much for them to actually record and compare the autism rates of children who are vaccinated with the H1N1 vaccine and those whose parents refuse the vaccination for them. Time will tell. H1N1 flu virus update (09/10/08) NB 1521 Oct. 8, 2009 FREDERICTON (CNB) - The following update on the H1N1 flu virus was issued by the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health for New Brunswick on Thursday, Oct. 8: We have moved forward with our seasonal vaccination program, according to plans. It started last week and will run for the month of October. The public awareness piece accompanying the campaign speaks to those most at risk of developing complications from seasonal influenza. They are: children six-to-23 months old, pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions, and the elderly. We encourage these groups to get the publicly funded vaccine. A list of clinics by region may be found at  www.gnb.ca/flu . There has been a frequently referred to, but as-yet unpublished, Canadian study that suggests an association between seasonal flu vaccine and acquiring a mild case of the H1N1 virus. This study is inconsistent with other international studies, and has failed to show a relationship that one causes the other. Both the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization have responded to the study, saying that preliminary data show that there is no link between having a severe bout of pandemic flu and having had a seasonal flu shot last year. New Brunswick's position on this study has never changed. We know that seasonal flu is fatal to 100-150 New Brunswickers each year, and that children are hospitalized by influenza more than any other age group. In making decisions for the province, we balanced this known significant risk and a vast body of published research against the results of one unpublished study, and determined that the best way to protect all New Brunswickers from both diseases was to move ahead with our plans to run a seasonal flu immunization campaign in October, and an H1N1 immunization campaign through November. We are running both campaigns because it is the best decision for New Brunswick. We made operational decisions early on that will allow us to have the capacity to offer both vaccines. There has never been a one-size-fits-all approach to seasonal vaccines in Canada, and this year is no different. Provinces and territories have not previously had to administer two separate flu immunization programs in a single season, and some of the decisions taken on seasonal and H1N1 vaccine timing reflect concerns over logistics, capacity and likely vaccine uptake. The seasonal flu vaccine is safe, and those in the high-risk groups, in particular, should take the steps to receive it as soon as possible. There have also been reports and public speculation about the safety of the H1N1 vaccine. The contents of the H1N1 vaccine will protect against contracting H1N1. The included additives and preservatives are there to help the vaccine work, and are not cause for alarm. As a multi-dose vaccine, the H1N1 influenza vaccine will contain a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal to prevent contamination of the vaccine by serious infectious agents from the growth of bacteria. Thimerosal also has a stabilizing effect on the vaccine, ensuring its effectiveness. The seasonal flu vaccine and most hepatitis B vaccines are also multi-dose vaccines, and thimerosal is added during the manufacturing process to maintain sterility of the vaccine. There is no safety reason to avoid using vaccines containing thimerosal. The best available scientific evidence to date shows no link between vaccines containing thimerosal and any adverse health condition, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has reviewed the safety of thimerosal and concluded that, \"There is no legitimate safety reason to avoid the use of thimerosal-containing products for children or older individuals, including pregnant women.\" International bodies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, share this opinion. Most of the H1N1 vaccine available in New Brunswick will also contain an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance that is added to a vaccine in order to boost an individual's immune response. It also means that less of the virus, or antigen, is needed to make a dose of the vaccine. Unadjuvanted vaccine has no booster element, and more antigen is needed to create this kind of vaccine. By developing an adjuvanted vaccine, Canada has used less of the virus material (antigen), allowing us to immunize more people in a timely manner. Adjuvants are not new. Many commonly used vaccines in Canada contain an adjuvant. Adjuvants have been used for several decades to boost immune response to vaccines. However, adjuvants have not previously been used with influenza vaccines in Canada. The WHO has indicated that it has no special concerns about the safety of adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines in general. New Brunswickers should continue to protect themselves and those around them by washing their hands thoroughly and often, coughing or sneezing into sleeves, staying home if sick, and keeping common surfaces clean. Persons at high risk of complications from influenza-like illness should seek medical attention promptly. Those at risk include pregnant women, people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, or those with compromised immune systems. Persons with influenza-like symptoms should stay home and minimize contact with family members as much as possible. If symptoms worsen, they should visit their physician or nurse-practitioner, a walk-in clinic or the nearest hospital emergency department. It is recommended that persons with influenza-like symptoms limit contact with other people, including other household members until they are free of symptoms and are feeling well. Those experiencing influenza-like illness should consider ending self-isolation when they are able to participate fully in all of their normal daily activities. It is important for New Brunswickers to understand that if they do not have influenza-like symptoms it is safe to go to work and school, to participate in activities and to socialize.

Not Just the Flu Vaccine
" "
Just to be clear. There is still thimerosal in some vaccines. Here is the  CDC's list of thimerosal containing vaccines : Ginger Shamblin Illinois Vaccine Awareness Coalition On July 5, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration released a list of vaccines with thimerosal (49.6 percent ethyl mercury). The following vaccines, still contain mercury as part of their manufacturing process or as a preservative. DtaP - Tripedia, Aventis Pasteur, Inc. Dtap-HepB-IPV - Pediarix, GlaxoSmithKline DT - Aventis Pasteur, Inc DT - Aventis Pasteur, Ltd. Td - Massachusetts Public Health Decavac - Aventis Pasteur, Inc Td - Aventis Pasteur, Inc. Energix - GlaxoSmithKline Hepatitis B - Recombivax HB (adult/adolescent available in preservative-free & thimerosal (mercury) containing vaccines; HepA/HepB - Twinrix - GlaxoSmithKiline Influenza: ALL INJECTED FLU VACCINES Japanese Encephalitis - JE-VAC, Biken Meningococcal - Menomune - Aventis Pasteur, Inc. Amounts range from .5 micrograms to 25 micrograms. Check the  CDC's web site  for exact amounts. Vaccines with .5 micrograms are usually described as \"low dose mercury\" vaccines. However, there has never been any safety testing on thimerosal, so no one knows how much mercury is enough to cause harm. Lead, a less potent neurotoxin than mercury, is considered unsafe at any level.

A New Database to Track Thimerosal Damage
" "
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE—AUGUST 10, 2005 The Alexis Foundation for Angelman and Autism Advancement Po Box 916263 Longwood, FL 32779 Erica Kosares, Director 407-862-8833 ekosares@alexisfoundation.org  Foundation launches database to link Thimerosal and autism Orlando, Fla.—In August 2005, the Alexis Foundation launched a national database to research the connection between thimerosal and autism. This nonprofit organization, which was founded by parents with autistic children and related disabilities, is using information in the database to explain why some children received more doses of thimerosal than others.  Thimerosal, which contains 49.6 percent ethylmercury, is believed to be the cause of autism. Ethylmercury is a highly toxic neurotoxin. The symptoms of autism and the symptoms of mercury poisoning are identical. Prior to 1986, children received a total maximum dose of 100 micrograms of ethylmercury in the first two years of life. By 1991, this dose was up to 246 micrograms of ethylmercury in the first two years of life, an increase of 147 percent. This increase came from the introduction of the Haemophilus Influenza Type B (Hib) and the Hepatitis B (Hep B) vaccines. Both vaccines contain thimerosal.  Despite its known neurotoxicity and its use in children, thimerosal has not been tested for safety. The Mercury-Free Act of 2004 introduced by U.S. Representatives Dave Weldon, MD (R-FL) and Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) would reduce human exposure to mercury through vaccines. It has yet to pass.  The Alexis Foundation is asking for assistance of families living with autism to forward their child’s vaccine information to help research the link between autism and thimerosal. The foundation will use this information to find out if mistakes were made during the manufacturing process and to determine if incorrect amounts of thimerosal were combined in childhood vaccines. This database could also show if thimerosal is currently being used as a preservative in childhood vaccines. For additional information and to input vaccine information please visit  http://www.Alexisfoundation.org/Vaccineinput.html  or e-mail admin@alexidsfoundation.org.

"23381" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/05/ginger-taylor-misrepresents-david-bowman/" "Ginger Taylor misrepresents David Bowman" "the admission of David Bowman at HRSA (who runs VICP) that vaccines can cause encephalopathy that causes autism as reported by David Kirby. 
 Following the Poling vaccine concession, Kirby wrote to HRSA and asked if this now meant that the VICP was now paying for vaccine induced autism. This the “official statement” that HRSA sent him: 
 David, 
 In response to your most recent inquiry, HRSA has the following 
statement: 
 The government has never compensated, nor has it ever been ordered to 
compensate, any case based on a determination that autism was actually 
caused by vaccines. We have compensated cases in which children 
exhibited an encephalopathy, or general brain disease. Encephalopathy 
may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms 
including autistic behavior, autism, or seizures. 
 Some children who have been compensated for vaccine injuries may have 
shown signs of autism before the decision to compensate, or may 
ultimately end up with autism or autistic symptoms, but we do not track 
cases on this basis. 
 Regards, 
 David Bowman 
Office of Communications 
Health Resources and Services Administration 
301-443-3376 
 Is this not a very significant disclosure by HHS and in conflict with many of their public statements of autism causation? HHS has admitted that vaccines can cause brain damage that becomes “autistic behavior, autism, or seizures”. Well, no, no its not. Lets look closley at the ‘offending’ paragraph: We have compensated cases in which children exhibited an encephalopathy, or general brain disease. Encephalopathy may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior, autism, or seizures. Quite clearly Bowman is saying that Encephalopathy  may be accompanied by  etc. A fact he goes on to clarify further in his next paragraph. How much clearer does it need to be? Ginger Taylor and David Kirby really have got to stop misrepresenting people in this way. It does their beliefs no justice.

Aluminum in Vaccines
" "
 AOA  has a piece on Dr. Sears  Mothering article .  He assumed aluminum had been safety tested before putting in vaccines. 
 
Never assume that just because a toxin is being injected into babies at high levels, that it has been safety tested. 
 
It appears that we have removed mercury, an adjuvant that causes autoimmune disorders, mitochondrial disorders and kills brain cells, and we have replaced it with aluminum, an adjuvant that causes autoimmune disorders,  mitochondrial disorders   and  kills brain cells . 
 
I should add that Heath Advocacy in the Public Interest randomly tested vaccines and found that one had 1,117 mcg of aluminum in it. (their site seems to be down right now) 
 
UPDATE:  I stand corrected by Quantumerik and Boyd Haley.  I sent the question to Dr. Haley and this was his response: 
 
\" Thimerosal is not an adjuvant, it does not enhance the immune response to an antigen as does aluminum.  It is only added as a preservative.  The pharmaceutical companies and their supporters would like for thimerosal to be an adjuvant, then they could not be sued for adulterating their vaccines and all costs would have to fall on the government programs for vaccine injury.  -boyd\"

Autism, Vaccines & the Spread of Mumps - Eastern  Canada
" "
The belief that some vaccines, or mercury based vaccine preservatives, cause or contribute to today's increasing autism rates, now estimated at 1 in 150, persists despite an almost total lack of support in the scientific community for any causal connection. The fear generated by that belief is itself believed to have contributed to higher rates of vaccine refusals with resulting increases in diseases such as measles and mumps. In Atlantic Canada we are currently suffering an outbreak of mumps, with the particular strain of mumps having orginated in the UK where immunization rates dropped from fear that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine caused autism. Health: ALERT: INFECTIONS Mumps outbreak spread s CAROLINE ALPHONSO May 11, 2007 Nova Scotia's mumps outbreak has spread to Ontario, infecting five people so far and putting public-health officials in the province on alert for even more cases in the weeks to come. The latest outbreak indicates that many who were vaccinated years ago are now susceptible to catching the disease. Public-health officials are now debating whether they need to administer a booster shot. Ontario's Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care confirmed yesterday that the cases, two of which are in Toronto, are linked to the outbreak in Nova Scotia, where more than 200 people have been infected by the disease. The outbreak, which began in late February, has also infected 34 people in New Brunswick and one in Prince Edward Island. ... Neil Rau, an infectious disease specialist at Halton Healthcare Services in Ontario, said the current strain of mumps originated in Britain, where there was a large outbreak in 2004. Immunization rates had drop significantly in Britain because many people believed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine caused autism. The vaccine-autism link has since been disproved, he noted. The disease reached Iowa last year, and Dr. Rau said it has now found its way into Canada. \"It's global travel compounded with vaccine refusal,\" he said. http://tinyurl.com/3b49fz

Autism and Vaccines - Measles Outbreak in San Diego
" "
The ugly side of the autism and vaccines debate is showing its dangerous face in the San Diego area where 12 children have fallen ill with measles. 3 of the children are too young to have received the measles vaccine but 9 were children whose parents refused to let them be inoculated against the measles.  Some parents believe that vaccines are connected to increases in autism rates.  The belief is not supported by the scientific and medical communities which maintain that the evidence in support of a vaccine autism connection does not exist.  The  New York Times News Service  reports: \" Measles, almost wholly eradicated in the United States through vaccines, can cause pneumonia and brain swelling, which in rare cases can lead to death.  \" ... In 1991, less than 1 percent of children in the states with personal-belief exemptions went without vaccines based on the exemption; by 2004, the most recent year for which data are available, the percentage had increased to 2.54 percent, said Saad B. Omer, an assistant scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. autism

Vaccine Strain Polio Death in Minnesota
" "
The live virus Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), which is no longer used in the US but is used in places like India and Nigeria, can lead to actual polio infections both in those who get the vaccine and in others who can catch the disease from those who are \"shedding\" the virus after the vaccine.   
 
This is a case where someone came into contact with someone shedding polio after OPV. 
 
I don't know why the OPV vaccine is still used at all.  It is my understanding that part of the reason polio is still active in India and Nigeria is because they use the OPV.   
 
 Minnesota Department of Health 
News Release 
April 14, 2009 
Contact information 
Polio virus associated with oral vaccine reported in Minnesota resident 
Patient who died had weakened immune system, multiple other health conditions 
 
State health officials are investigating a case of infection associated with the polio virus in a Minnesotan who died last month. 
 
The patient was infected with a virus strain found in the oral polio vaccine. The oral vaccine, which is no longer used in the U.S., contained live polio virus. The injected polio vaccine now in use contains only inactivated virus. 
 
The patient died with symptoms that included paralytic polio, but it is not known to what extent the polio may have contributed to the death. The patient had a weakened immune system and multiple health problems. The patient most likely acquired the vaccine-derived polio virus from someone who had received the live-virus, oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) before the use of OPV was discontinued nine years ago. 
 
Infection from polio virus can cause a wide range of symptoms. Most infections result in no or mild symptoms, but in rare cases can severely affect the neurologic system, resulting in paralysis. 
 
Minnesota Department of Health officials are emphasizing that there is no risk to the general public from this case. Only people who have had direct, close contact with the patient, such as certain health care workers, may be at risk of infection. Adhering to recommended infection control guidelines and being vaccinated protect against polio. At this time, no additional cases of infection with the polio virus have been reported in connection with the patient. 
 
\"We are working closely with our local and national partners to investigate this case,\" said Minnesota State Epidemiologist Dr. Ruth Lynfield. \"It's important to note that while there is no risk to the general public, many people still have vivid memories of a time when polio was a major public health concern before the first vaccines were introduced in the 1950s. This is a very rare occurrence and does not signal a resurgence of polio.\" 
 
MDH staff are working with hospital staff to determine if there might be health care workers at risk for disease. Hospital staff are notifying all health care workers who may have been exposed. \"Only unvaccinated people or people with deficient immune systems who have had direct, ungloved contact with the patient's bodily secretions are at any risk for disease,\" said Dr. Aaron DeVries, Medical Epidemiologist at MDH. Health officials will follow up with health care workers to make sure their immunizations are up to date and they are showing no signs of disease. \"If you don't hear from a public health or health care official, you're not at risk,\" DeVries said. 
 
This type of polio infection is very rare, officials stressed. In rare instances, a person who has either never been vaccinated or has certain immunodeficiencies can acquire the polio virus from someone who has been vaccinated and is excreting the virus in their stool. Sometimes these infections result in illness, as happened in this situation. Only 45 cases of vaccine-derived polio disease in persons with immunodeficiencies have been reported in the world since 1961. 
 
This is the second instance of a polio infection caused by a vaccine strain of virus in the United States since 2000, when use of live-virus oral polio vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. All polio vaccinations in the U.S. are now done with an injected, killed-virus vaccine. The other instance of vaccine-derived polio infection also occurred in Minnesota, in 2005, but was very different from this case. It occurred in an unimmunized child from a community that had high levels of non-immunization and that case was not associated with neurological symptoms. 
 
\"We suspect that one reason why Minnesota has detected both cases in the United States in the last 10 years is because of the high level of cooperation among astute clinicians, a network of clinical laboratories and the Minnesota Department of Health, which in turn has a Public Health Laboratory that looks for such rare agents as polio virus,\" Lynfield said. 
 
Naturally-occurring polio has been eradicated in the western hemisphere. The last case of naturally-occurring (not from vaccine) paralytic polio disease occurred in the United States in 1979. 
 
Although members of the general public are not at risk, MDH officials say this unusual case should serve as a reminder to make sure that all of your immunizations are current and that children receive immunizations as recommended. 
 
\"It's always a good idea to check with your physicians or health care providers to be certain all of your vaccinations are current,\" DeVries said. \"Make sure you're protected and your children are protected.\" 
 
Most people in the United States have been vaccinated against polio and healthy people have developed full immunity to the disease. An estimated 94 percent of Minnesota's two-year-olds have had the full primary series of three polio shots, which are usually administered in infancy. 
 
NOTE TO EDITORS/REPORTERS: According to Minnesota laws, the Minnesota Department of Health is unable to provide any further identifying information regarding the patient. In addition, the family has expressed their strong desire to maintain their privacy and confidentiality, so we are asking media to refrain from attempts to identify, locate or interview the family. Health officials are also concerned that doing so could interfere with the continuing investigation.

List of flu shots that contain mercury: Autism, mercury poisoning, thimerosal and the flu vaccine public_health@8:22 am PST email to the editor by Michael Dorausch, DC planetc1.com  news staff About two weeks ago, news reports began showing up online suggesting that the flu vaccine was found safe to be used in children under the age of two. The study looked at immunization records for more than 45,000 children and researchers determined that the intramuscular flu vaccine was safe to be used in children under the age of two. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"the single best way to protect against the flu is to get vaccinated each year\" and the CDC now recommends children under the age of two receive the flu vaccine. Hundreds of news articles began appearing on major web sites such as Google News, MSN, and Yahoo, touting the recently reported study and suggesting the vaccine was now safe for babies. The message was clear... get the shot, get the shot, get the shot. However, there was something missing that was not appearing in any of the news articles... flu shots contain thimerosal. That may come as no big deal to some, but to a parent that has been fighting with vaccine manufacturers and/or government officials to get mercury compounds out of vaccines, it's a very big deal. Thimerosal After increased pressure from consumers, parents of autistic children groups, and government elected officials, vaccine manufacturers and the FDA have collectively agreed to begin removing thimerosal from childhood vaccines. Problem is, up until these recent recommendations, the flu vaccine was not considered a childhood vaccine. Here is a list of FDA links with PDF document information on various intramuscular flu vaccines being used in 2006. Fluzone \"No Preservative\" pediatric dose by Aventis Pasteur, reports not to use thimerosal in the manufacturing process. Below that are some links to get more information about Thimerosal. Fluvirin™ (Chiron Vaccines Ltd.) Thimerosal (mercury derivative, =0.98 mcg mercury per 0.5 mL dose) is used in manufacture of the unit dose preservative free presentation but is reduced by the purification process to trace amounts. http://www.fda.gov/cber/label/inflchi091405LB2.pdf Fluarix™ (Influenza Virus Vaccine for intramuscular use) Thimerosal is used at the early stages of manufacture and is removed by subsequent purification steps to  http://www.fda.gov/CbER/label/inflgla083105LB.pdf FLULAVAL™ (Influenza Virus Vaccine) ID Biomedical Corporation of Quebec (IDB) FLULAVAL is an influenza virus vaccine indicated for active immunization of adults 18 years of age and older. Thimerosal, a mercury derivative, is added as a preservative. Each 0.5 mL dose contains 25 mcg mercury. http://www.fda.gov/Cber/label/inflidb100506LB.pdf Fluzone (Aventis Pasteur, Inc.) Fluzone vaccine is supplied in four different presentations: a 5 mL vial of vaccine which contains the preservative thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (25 µg mercury/dose)]; a 0.25 mL prefilled syringe (No Preservative: Pediatric Dose, for 6 – 35 months of age) distinguished by a pink syringe plunger rod; a 0.5 mL prefilled syringe (No Preservative, for 36 months of age and older); and a 0.5 mL vial (No Preservative, for 36 months of age and older).

Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth/VaxMaineKids.org Makes False Vaccine Safety Claims on MPBN's Maine Calling
" "
 
 
Hey Mainer's... you know that ours is the next state to have a target painted on its vaccine exemptions by Offit and CHOP Co., right?  Meet Cassandra Grantham, Maine's very own Offiteer.  She is telling some whoppers about vaccine safety research. 
 
Remember last year when Kim Spencer went on a local news broadcast and tore into Dr. Koren Boggs for claiming that there were \"several\" domestic and international studies that compared vaccinated children to unvaccinated children and found vaccination did not increase the risk for autism?  And remember that it pissed me off so much that  I made a video rant about it  and we demanded a retraction? 
 
Boggs would not make a public retraction of her false claims, but she did privately admit on facebook to her friends that she was wrong.  Sort of.  About part of what she said.  Pitiful. 
 
This week Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth and  Vax Maine Kids  takes center stage in making up the same bogus claim on Maine Public Broadcasting. 
 
On MBPN's Maine Calling, Host Jennifer Rooks lead a completely uncritical \"panel discussion\" with three of the women who are on the \"lets cripple the philosophical exemption\" team in Maine, Dr. Laura Blaisdell, Dr. Amy Belisle and Cassandra Grantham. 
 
You will remember two of these ladies as some of the participants in the screening of the  Invisible Threat  that I unloaded on last summer.  Back story here:  Invisible Threat, Ugh. 
 
During the  episode  of Maine Calling, Ms. Rooks asked Cassandra Grantham, \"What kind of research is out there about the safety of vaccines?\"  Grantham's response was the same stunningly fraudulent claim that Boggs made last year.  Actually, her claims were worse.  That there were new vaxxed/altvaxxed/fully vaxxed studies (my fantasy study) that showed no link between autism or other risks and vaccination. 
 
 

 
Absolutely amazing.  She just completely fabricated completely non existent research, and does it with such confidence!  Who could doubt her! 
 
Actually... she might be on to something.  We could save BILLIONS in research spending by just speaking research into existence instead of having to go through the costly and time consuming process of actually doing research. 
 
I think I will do that right now!  Watch carefully... 
 
So what's really great is that many organizations have put a lot of time and effort into understanding the profound impact of beauty on the world, and there have been several recent studies that have come out showing that I am THE most attractive woman in New England.  Further they recommended that funding should be directed toward a program to make my life as comfortable as possible to preserve my rare beauty.  
 
There!  Research done, not a penny spent!  I also heartily agree with the recommendations of these fine scientists, whose names I can't remember, because they are scientists and you are not so don't question it.  Science has spoken. 
 
Following the screening of Invisible Threat last summer, Ms. Grantham actually emailed me and said she wanted to have an exchange on my concerns.  I thought, \"hey great... a good faith person who actually is following through on the  creating a dialogue  BS that the vaccine industry reps usually don't mean at all.\"  I gave her just a taste of the problems I had with the vaccine program, and a lengthy note or two on how her VaxMaineKids.org web site was so full of false information that it would have to be taken off line with in minutes of the repeal of the vaccine injury act or they would be sued into oblivion.   But as soon as I gave her a rundown of just the start of the problems that needed to be address, and asked how she would like to proceed with the exchange, she suddenly changed her mind and decided she didn't want to talk with me any more.  I will put up the email exchange in another blog.  
 
But as a preview as to what a propagandist this woman has turned out to be, her website states, \" No other medical study anywhere in the world has ever found a link between vaccines and autism. Not one .\"  I sent her the  list of studies  that linked vaccines and autism, and she said she only accepted peer review studies.  An admission that either she does not know what peer reviewed studies are or that she is a bad faith player who was cornered and gave a BS answer.  I have to assume she never even opened the link.  Mind you this is a  MaineHealth  web site, one of the largest health corporations in the state. 
 
So today I finally got the time to write to Cassandra, call her out on her bold face lie, and ask her to cite these vaxxed v. unvaxxed autism studies or retract her claim.  I have copied MPBN, MaineHealth, a Maine Rep. who called into the program, and Dr. Blaisdell, who sat quietly by and allowed Grantham's lie to go unchallenged. 
 
 
 
 
 Subject:  False Vaccine Safety Claims made by MaineHealth on MPBN's Maine Calling

Ms. Grantham, 
 
This week on MPBN's Maine Calling, in response to a question about
    vaccine safety, you made the following claim: 
 
 
 MPBN:
                    “Cassandra what kind of research is out there about
                    the safety of
                    vaccines?” 
                     
                    Cassandra Grantham: “So what's really great is
                    that is that many different organizations have put a
                    lot of time and
                    effort into understanding the safety and efficacy
                    behind vaccines and
                    there have been several recent studies that have
                    actually come out
                    looking at associations between vaccinations and
                    different situations
                    that kids may find themselves in, autism being one
                    of them, but many
                    others. And of course we can't do studies that
                    actually force
                    families not to immunize their children so that we
                    can look at what
                    we would call it a randomized controlled trial, it's
                    just not fair. So what we have been able to do is
                    look back over time at different
                    populations of children and we've actually found
                    that kids who are
                    immunized, completely immunized with all of the
                    vaccines according to
                    the the schedule that Dr.  Blaisdell 
               
                    was mentioning the one that recommended by the CDC,
                    that they have no
                    higher risk of getting autism and some of these
                    other developmental
                    challenges that families face than those kids that
                    delayed or did not
                    receive any immunizations at all. So we're finding
                    that there is
                    research that is now delving deeper into this topic
                    and actually
                    proving that the CDC's recommended schedule is safe
                    and it does work
                    and it doesn't increase risks of other situations
                    for kids.” 
 
To the best of my knowledge, this is a false claim, as no such
    research exists.  This as testified to by  Dr.
      Coleen Boyle , Director of CDC's National Center on Birth
    Defects and Developmental Disabilities during the House Oversight
    & Government Reform Committee hearing  1 in 88 Children: A
      Look Into the Federal Response to Rising Rates of Autism  on
    November 29, 2012.  In response to a question whether or not autism
    risk had been studied in vaccinated v. unvaccinated children Dr.
    Boyle stated, \"We have not studied vaccinated v. unvaccinated.\" 
     http://youtu.be/O_GrCAzpA_0?t=9m20s  (please see the notes in the
    video that addresses the claims made by Dr. Koren Boggs that such
    research exists in further detail.) 
 
My understanding of the history of this topic is that the first such
    request for a study was made by the FDA in 1981 after they removed
    mercury from over the counter products.  FDA declined to ban it from
    vaccines, asking CDC to first do a vaccinated v. unvaccinated study
    to see if it increased health risks, however CDC declined to perform
    the study. 
 
The autism and vaccine injury communities have been asking for such
    a retrospective study to be done for more than a decade now, and
    health authorities have continued to refuse.  Rep. Carolyn Maloney
    (D-NY) introduced the Comprehensive Comparative Study of Vaccinated
      and Unvaccinated Populations Act of 2007
    ( http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.2832 :) to force
    NIH to do such a study, and reintroduced such legislation in the
    years since.  In response to what he learned from Dr. Boyle during
    the 2012 hearings, Rep Bill Posey (R-FL) joined with Maloney and
    introduced H.R. 1757, The Vaccine Safety Study Act
    ( https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/26/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E576-1 )
    that would again compel HHS to perform the study that you claim
    already exists.   
 
The bill was not passed, nor to my knowledge has any vaccinated v.
    unvaccinated research on autism or any other developmental
    disabilities been published since Dr. Boyle offered her testimony
    before Congress. 
 
 As such it is appropriate for you to either produce the citation
      for this research that the vaccine injury community has been
      lobbying for, or to retract your false safety claims on MPBN for
      the product line you are representing. 
 
Your false claims are only made more egregious by the fact that you
    have publicly stated in the Portland Press Herald that, \"Eliminating
    the philosophic [vaccine] exemption is the ultimate goal.\"  It is my
    belief that you are purposely lying to the public in order to remove
    parental rights and deny Maine children a Free And Appropriate
    Education in order to promote sales of a product line whose lack of
    safety is thoroughly documented both by the federal government and
    the product packaging itself.  This type of propaganda sales
    campaign should not be tolerated by any responsible medical
    professional, health organization, media outlet or legislator.

Why aren't people vaccinating?  I will say it again and again and again.  Because the liability protection given to vaccine interests has very visibly corrupted the vaccine program to the bone. 
 
Many of their claims are garbage.  To the point that their sales teams can pose as \"public health interests\" go on a supposedly thoughtful, intelligent program, make absurdly fraudulent, easily vetted, vaccine safety claims, which go completely unchallenged by the media, and there is literally no official recourse that the public can take to shut them down or hold them accountable for lies. 
 
Case in point, the ONLY means of recourse I have, as a member of the public and the mother of a vaccine injured child, to address this false claim, for which she should be fired and MaineHealth should be sued and put under review by the state, is to write the above letter.  One of probably a thousand letters on vaccine fraud that I have written in the ten years since my son's vaccine induced brain damage. 
 
And MPBN and Maine Health, and Vax Maine Kids and Dr. Blaisdell and anyone associated with this event at all is free to just ignore the complaint, or tell further lies to cover up this lie that was told to cover up the decades of lies and obfuscation being delivered to the American public. 
 
Perhaps if they don't retract this, I will have to get really, really serious with them and write  another  letter.

 Hello Ginger ~ Thank
 you for listening to MPBN’s Maine Calling Show – it is great to know 
that we have reached such a wide audience with important vaccine 
messages.  I want to clarify that
 I do not represent any product line or company other than MaineHealth, 
which is a health system which supports on-time childhood 
immunizations.  I have never been paid by or consulted for a 
pharmaceutical or medical intervention company or agency. Please see
 below for MaineHealth’s official statement regarding childhood 
immunizations.    
 
   MaineHealth
 supports the health, safety and well-being of infants, children, 
adolescents and young adults.  We believe that vaccinating children 
on-time, as recommended by the Centers
 for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the 
American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), is one of the best
 ways to reduce vaccine-preventable diseases in
 our communities and keep children safe and healthy. 
 
   In regards to my statements about vaccine safety, I based those on these studies.

In short, I work for MaineHealth, here are some unrelated studies so I can pretend like I am giving an answer, while not actually citing a vaxxed/unvaxxed study, stop using my picture, and I am not talking to you any more.  
 
Reminder that her web site says, \"Vax Maine Kids is a safe place for Maine parents to discuss their concerns and ask tough questions.  We promise to always give respectful,  evidence-based answers you can trust .\" 
 
So much for that. 
 
 
 
But for more irony/entertainment/fuel for your fury, the ONLY study she actually cited was by FRANK DESTEFANO!!! 
 
Just bullet pointing the things that should be noted here on her : 
 
1. OMG DESTEFANO?! 
 
- DeStefano took a tiny piece of vaccines in this junk study, the part we are least worried about causing problems, studied to see if that correlated to autism.  DeStefano: \"I have extablished that the spices in apple pie do not correlate to obesity.\"  Moms: \"Ummm... yeah... we were worried about the sugar, the butter and the crust.  Or the pie as a whole.  Because you are recommending our kids eat a crap load of pies, and our kids are getting really fat.\" 
 
- Grantham is misusing the junk study exactly the same way everyon else uses it. \"The spices in apple pie are not linked to obesity, therefor eating four apple pies in one sitting is not linked to obesity.\" 
 
- Grantham goes further beyond the misuse of this study by claiming it compaires vaccinated and unvaccinated children.  Mind you, the word \"unvaccinated\"  does not even appear in the paper .  Nor do the words, \"CDC,\" \"Schedule,\" or the phrase, \"fully vaccinated.\"  Therefore, it is difficult to see how Ms. Grantham could be both earnest and competent and put this paper forward to defend her MPBN claims. 
 
- DeSoto's critique of the study reports that it did not correctly match cases, and is invalid. http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00662-8/fulltext (and the Journal even links to her critique from the link Grantham provided) 
 
- FRANK DESTEFANO HAS BEEN CAUGHT HIDING THREE DIFFERENT AUTISM LINKS IN HIS WORK AT CDC AND IS CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION FOR FRAUD!  Here is  the rundown  for those who want to get current on the developments.  (Yet Grantham refers to his work while trying to defend the integrity of the vaccine program.  This is  me  right now.) 
 
- Frank DeStefano, in Sheryl Attkisson's interview with him about the charges against him claimed that it was not possible for vaccines to cause autism, then four days later changed his statement, admitting that he has never looked to see if vaccines can cause individual cases of autism, and that is something that someone could look into.  HE IS THE HEAD OF THE CDC IMMUNIZATION SAFETY OFFICE... HE IS THE ONE WHOSE JOB IT HAS BEEN TO LOOK INTO THIS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE! (insert Mugatu) 
 
 
 
2. The 2013 IOM Report:  The Childhood Immunization Schedule and Safety: Stakeholder Concerns, Scientific Evidence, and Future Studies   
 
 
 
- The report actually reports that there is NO VACCINATED V. UNVACCINATED RESEARCH. She actually sent me proof of my claim that I didn't know about.  Thank you Ms. Grantham for further indicting yourself.  From page 19 of the pdf: 
 
 
 
\"The committee’s literature searches and review were intended to identify health outcomes associated with some aspect of the childhood immunization schedule. Allergy and asthma, autoimmunity, autism, other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., learning disabilities, tics, behavioral disorders, and intellectual disabilities), seizures, and epilepsy were included as search terms. Furthermore, the committee reviewed papers on immunization and premature infants. 
 
In summary, few studies have comprehensively assessed the association between the entire immunization schedule or variations in the overall schedule and categories of health outcomes, and no study has directly examined health outcomes and stakeholder concerns in precisely the way that the committee was charged to address in its statement of task.  No studies have compared the differences in health outcomes that some stakeholders questioned between entirely unimmunized populations of children and fully immunized children.  Experts who addressed the committee pointed not to a body of evidence that had been overlooked but rather to the fact that  existing research has not been designed to test the entire immunization schedule .\"  
 
 
- The report says that it has evaluated doing such studies, that they would be doable, useful, but expensive, time consuming and difficult, so they don't recommend them.  Here is their full statement on vaxed v. uvaxed studies.  
 
 
\"Initiation of New Prospective Observational Studies 
 
Observational studies are another form of clinical research that can provide useful insights and information that may be used to answer research questions. The committee reviewed opportunities to study groups that choose not to vaccinate using a prospective cohort study design. However, such a study would not conclusively reveal differences in health outcomes between unimmunized and fully immunized children for two main reasons. First, to be informative, cohort studies require sufficiently large numbers of participants in each study group and the sample populations often suggested for use in a comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated children (such as some religious groups) are too small to adequately power a comparative analysis, particularly in the case of rare adverse health outcomes. Because meaningful comparisons require thousands of participants in each study group and less than 1 percent of the U.S. population refuses all immunizations, the detection of enough unvaccinated children would be prohibitively time-consuming and difficult.  
 
Such a study would also need to account for the many confounding variables that separate some populations from the average U.S. child, including lifestyle factors and genetic variables. To be useful, a comparison would require children matched by age; sex; geographic location; rural, urban, or suburban setting; socioeconomic group; and race/ethnicity. 
 
The committee acknowledges that large-scale, long-term studies of infants through adulthood would be informative for evaluating health outcomes associated with immunization. A new research initiative, the National Children’s Study, is a multicenter, congressionally funded effort that meets these criteria. Although such studies would be the optimal design for evaluating long-term health outcomes associated with the childhood immunization schedule, they would require considerable time and funding, and the committee did not find adequate epidemiological evidence to recommend investment in this type of research at this time.\" 
 
 Skimming through the report, it seems to be full of comedy gold, like this gem: \"The committee identified concerns among some parents about the number, frequency, and timing of immunizations in the overall immunization schedule. These concerns were not expressed by clinicians, public health personnel, or policy makers in the committee’s review.\" 
 
\"Well Jim, the customers are not buying because they don't trust the product, but the salesmen are fine with the product, so screw the custmers!\"  Of course the salemen are happy, they can lie about the product, don't have to know the true safety profiles, can't be sued and THEY GET PAID!  
 
Astonishing how these people believe this approach will increase vaccine uptake.  Crazy pills. 
 
3. Safety of Vaccines Used for Routine Immunization of US Children: A Systematic Review 
 
- The ONLY reference to the \"unvaccinated\" is in a discussion of an Italian study on the flu shot and ER visits and referred to kids who has not received a seasonal or H1N1 flu vaccine. 
 
- The ONLY discussion of autism in the paper is in regard to the MMR vaccine, no unvaccinated populations studied. 
 
So Grantham has not only proved herself wrong, she has proved herself either incompetent to read medical literature, a bad faith player or both. 
 
I responded to her with the following email:

 Ms.  Grantham, 
       
      None of the citations you offer contain any research on autism
      risk, or any other developmental disabilities, in vaccinated v.
      unvaccinated children, which is the claim you made on Maine
      Calling.  Again, no such publish research exists in any form.   
       
      I therefore demand a retraction of the fraudulent safety claim by
      yourself, MaineHealth and MPBN. 
       
      I will not cease using your image, as this is a very newsworthy
      story and the professional headshot of a medical corporation
      employee making false claims about the product safety of the
      pharmaceuticals that it sells is fair use of this image.

As Ms. Grantham has informed me that she is not talking to me any more, I assume I will not be hearing from her again.  
 
So as is appropriate, I have asked MPBN to retract the statement, and review the issues at play with new eyes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 Subject:  Request for Retraction of False Vaccine Safety Claims on MPBN's Maine Calling

 Ms. Rooks, Mr. Smith and Mr. Vogelzang, 
       
      On your December 1 episode of Maine Calling, Cassandra Grantham, a
      representative of MaineHealth, made a fraudulent safety claim on
      your show.  I have copied you on the my email exchange with her,
      which details the false claim, my correction of the false
      information as supported by the Congressional testimony of the
      head of the CDC's Director of the National Center on Birth Defects
      and Developmental Disabilities, and my request to Ms. Grantham for
      her to cite the multiple studies that she claim exist or retract
      her claim. 
       
      As you can see, she has failed to produce any research comparing
      autism rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations and failed
      to retract her claim. 
       
      I there for request that Maine Calling retract Ms. Grantham's
      claim in the same format which it was offered, noting the false
      claim on the archived version of the interview if MPBN chooses to
      leave it online. 
       
      I further strongly encourage Maine Calling to perform an honest
      evaluation on why vaccine rates are low in Maine and falling
      nationally.  As the educated mother of a vaccine injured child, I
      can attest to the real reason.  It is because the liability
      protection given to the entire vaccine industry in 1986 has
      resulted in massive corruption in the vaccine program.  Ms.
      Graham's behavior on your show is case in point.  Medical
      providers and medical industry representatives can make any safety
      claims that they choose, even completely false claims, because
      there is no accountability mechanism in place for the public to
      hold them accountable for false claims.  Even when a child is
      killed by a vaccine after a false claim like this is made to a
      parent coercing them into administering a vaccine that they would
      not have otherwise agreed to have delivered to their child, there
      is no recourse to hold anyone accountable, or even force them to
      stop making these false claims.  So false claims like this one,
      once spoken by someone claiming to hold authority in vaccinated,
      simply continue to circulate and be repeated.   
       
      No doubt Ms. Grantham's false claim will now be circulated by
      those who have heard your program, even medical professionals who
      administer vaccines to children. 
       
      The vaccine show you did with these three women on December 1, was
      not just about vaccine rejection, it is the REASON for vaccine
      rejection.  It is a real time example of how and why vaccine
      interests are alienating and loosing the public trust by abusing
      the public trust.  Your guests correctly reported that the exodus
      from the vaccine program is being lead by educated parents who
      have serious misgivings of the safety and trustworthyness of the
      vaccine program, while they themselves were making false claims
      about the safety of the vaccine program, thereby proving the
      untrustworthy of the vaccine program.  And MPBN is participating
      in this corruption by allowing false claims to made on your
      platform with out challenge or correction. 
       
      I hope that the irony that a show you aired to raise confidence in
      the vaccination is actually destroying trust in the vaccination is
      not lost on you.   
       
      Now this claim of Ms. Grantham is merely one of many problematic
      statements made by herself, MaineHealth, VaxMaineKids.org and Dr.
      Blaisdell, and I would be happy to go over the false information
      that they are sharing with the public under the guise of serving
      the public if you decide to do a proper investigation of the fraud
      taking place in the vaccine program both in Maine and at the
      federal level. 
       
      But for now, I await a response on your retraction of this
      particular false statement.  I cannot imagine that MPBN
    would allow any medical professional, industry representative or
    government official to make such false claims about any other
    medical product line or medical program.  I don't expect Maine
    Calling to allow this to stand either. 

     
Thank you for your consideration,

Also as appropriate, I have contacted MaineHealth and asked for a review and retraction of their multiple false vaccine safety claims, disciplinary action against Ms. Grantham, and a clarification on their position to remove the rights of parents to decline vaccines that can cause disability, brain damage and death, and still send their children to school. 
 
 
 
 Subject:  Information Requested on how to file a formal complaint against a Maine Health staffer for fraudulent claims

 Dear MaineHealth, 
       
      This past week, Cassandra Grantham of MaineHealth appeared on
      MPBN's Maine Calling and made a fraudulent vaccine safety claim.
      She reported to the public that there are several studies
      comparing vaccinated v. unvaccinated children that find no
      increase risk of autism and other developmental disabilities in
      children vaccinated according to the CDC's recommended schedule. 
       
       
      In fact, no such research has ever been published.   
       
      I contacted Ms. Grantham and asked that she cite the research she
      claims has been undertaken, or retract her statement.  She not
      only failed to cite such studies, she actually cited a 2013 IOM
      report that confirmed that no such research exists in the medical
      literature, and that recommended against undertaking such research
      because of cost, time and difficulty.  She has also failed to
      retract her fraudulent claim and says she will not be responding
      to me on this matter again. 
       
      This is just the latest of several false vaccine safety research
      claims that Ms. Grantham has made on behalf of MaineHealth both in
      public and on the VaxMaineKids.org web site, a MaineHealth
      Childhood Immunizations Program project.  Several of these false
      statements have been brought to her attention over the last five
      months, and she has failed to properly address them.  I can
      therefore only assume that Ms. Grantham is a bad faith player and
      is purposefully misleading of Mainers on vaccine safety matters 
       
      This is made all the more egregious as Ms. Grantham has been
      quoted in the  Portland
        Press Herald  as stating that, “Eliminating the philosophic
      [vaccine] exemption is the ultimate goal,” of the work your
      organization is undertaking.  It is unconscionable that
      MaineHealth would make fraudulent safety claims in order to
      advance the agenda of removing parental rights and depriving
      children of a free and appropriate public education if their
      families decline to participate in a medical program that presents
      severe adverse health risks including disability, brain damage and
      death. 
       
      I wish to file a formal complaint against Ms. Grantham with
      MaineHealth.  I believe that it is the duty of MaineHealth to
      review and retract Ms. Grantham's false vaccine safety claims and
      to exercise disciplinary action against Ms. Grantham, as well as
      clarify the organization's position on the rights of parents to
      receive full and accurate vaccine safety and efficacy information,
      and practice uncoerced informed consent in vaccination. 
       
      I have forwarded the email exchanges with Ms. Grantham and MPBN
      below for your review. 
       
      I am publicly documenting this process  here . 
       
      Please direct me to appropriate contact on this matter so I may
      offer a full account of the problem and offer MaineHealth my
      support in assuring that it is offering accurate, evidence based
      information on vaccine safety to the public. 
       
      Thank you, 
      Ginger Taylor 
      Brunswick, Maine 
     
    
 
 
 
 
I have decided that this is going to be a test of the system.  
 
A rep of a health management corporation makes fraudulent claims about the product line that the corporation is selling to the public, and for which it is taking insurance payments and government funding.  Is it possible to hold them accountable and force a review and retraction of their false claims, or does the 1986 Vaccine Act prevent the functioning of all public accountability?  As always, my money is on the latter, but we have to give them a chance to do the right thing, don't we? 
 
UPDATE: 
 
Guess what... they didn't do the right thing.  Neither did any of the state and federal authorities I filed complaints with. The results of my four month attempt to hold them accountable here: MaineHealth Remains Completely Unaccountable of False Vaccine Claims.  So I Wrote a Bill.

"20694" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/24/new-study-many-vaccines-at-once-ok-for-kids/" "New study: many vaccines at once OK for kids" "A  new study  from Pediatrics has come to the conclusion that: Timely vaccination during infancy has no adverse effect on neuropsychological outcomes 7 to 10 years later. These data may reassure parents who are concerned that children receive too many vaccines too soon Lead researcher Michael J. Smith  said : Our study shows that there is only a downside to delaying vaccines, and that is an increased susceptibility to potentially deadly infectious diseases, 
 … 
 We hope these findings will encourage more parents to vaccinate according to the American Academy of Pediatrics schedule, and reassure them that they’re making a safe choice when they do so. Lets hope so. Today is a great day in the forward momentum of the confidence in vaccines now that Andrew Wakefield  has been struck off  and this latest study can only add yet more weight that no vaccine, no vaccine ingredient and no vaccine schedule has _ever_ been shown to cause autism either directly or indirectly. This is the first time that a study such as this has been carried out: …nobody had studied whether getting several vaccinations in a short time could have negative consequences, for instance by overloading the immune system, as many parents believe, according to Smith. He found that receiving as many as 10 different shots — including flu and whooping cough — had no impact. And a CDC spokesman said: Parents that are considering delaying vaccination should realize that there aren’t any specific benefits, and that they are putting their child at risk, and not only their child but also the community, An excellent point. The benefits of vaccination are not just personal but societal. Those who refuse to vaccinate not only risk the personal well being of their children but the society they choose to live in.

Conor's Autistic Disorder Reality - School on Wednesday
" "
 On Wednesday Conor expects to be in school.  
 
He loves school, which for the past 3 years has been Nashwaaksis  Middle School,  and it has been a good experience for him. Yesterday we had to bring him home early because he wasn't feeling well. Today, Wednesday, he has to stay home again but he doesn't like it. 
 
Conor expects to be in school and not being in school today, Wednesday, bothers him ... a lot.  He is screaming some, crying some, and repeating over and over again \"School on Wednesday, School on Wednesday, School on Wednesday\". Some times he starts with Monday stopping at Wednesday:  \"School on Monday, School on Tuesday  ....  School on Wednesday\".

Day by day
" "
I haven't broken out the Advent calendar yet, but Bud's official countdown to Christmas has begun. Each evening, Bud wants to talk through the flow of the days ahead. Though he knows the days of the week, he is less interested in discussing that tomorrow will be Thursday, and then will come Friday, and is much more interested in talking about the  meaning  of each day in his life. He has just recently started identifying which activities at school go with which days of the week: Mondays are gym days; Tuesdays, music; Wednesdays, art; Thursdays, library; Fridays, gym again. Saturdays and Sundays are Mom and Bud Days. Tonight, Bud reminded me that Wednesdays are not just art days; they are also pizza days - the one day each week when Bud buys his lunch at school. Every other day, he brings his lunch from home and just buys milk in the cafeteria. So at dinner this evening, when Bud wanted to talk through the days to come, I had some trouble keeping up. \"Mama, what tomorrow is?\" \"Tomorrow is Thursday.\" \"No, Mama.\" \"Library day?\" \"No. Milk day.\" \"Oh, of course. Milk day.\" \"Then another milk day, then Mom and Bud day, then Mom and Bud day, then milk day, then milk day, then pizza day.\" So, for the record, and for those keeping score at home, that means we have 14 milk days, 3 pizza days, and 8 Mom and Bud days until Christmas. But who's counting?

Autism and High School: Conor's Final Preparation
" "
 
 
 
 
 Conor has been anxious to return to school; literally counting down each day and telling Mom and Dad how many days left until school. Today was ONE DAY left!.  Last year we did some  transition planning  for Conor's move from Middle School to High School.  Together with Middle School, High School and District 18 representatives we prepared Conor, as best we could, for the transition to High School.  The planning included actual visits to Leo Hayes High School and work with the UNB-CEL Autism Intervention trained  Teacher Assistants who will be working with Conor this year. They also visited Conor at Middle School and spent some time working with him there before the end of the year.  Hopefully that familiarity with the place, and with some key people, will help ensure a smooth transition. Today, with more fine weather, I took Conor for a visit to Leo Hayes High School just to see the building, one more time,  where he will be attending school tomorrow.

    After getting upset at school on  Monday afternoon  (after a good day), Charlie went on to have 'great,' 'excellent,' days at school. Friday there was no note and no phone call. 
 Gearing up for holidays and only three days of school once again, next week.

K.C. is in school again!
" "
   K.C. is attending school again. I haven't yet blogged about it but he started going about a week ago. He is doing very well in his new school! There are only 3 students in his class and it has made a real difference in the way K.C. get's on and off the bus. It seems he really wants to go! He is still in  the harness to ride the bus but the bus driver reports he is doing well. I asked his teacher how and if he is approaching his classmates and she said he is \"aloof.\" For 1 st grade K.C. will attend a full day program and then come home to his ABA sessions. So far so good! Way to go K.C.!

 Overbooked I might have written down this school year's schedule elsewhere, but so what. If you're wondering why I get fuck-all done, corresponded, or followed-through, perhaps it is due to the schedule below. You'll notice that, after nine years of parenting, I have managed to earn just over 90 minutes per day of free time in which to do all the laundry, bills, correspondence, various other projects, and house-tending. If anything is accomplished during any other time, it is because I am neglecting at least one child. (Or conscripting them!) Being the one who -- as Jennyalice puts it -- has a minivan permanently attached to my ass is not something that would normally get to me. I've worked with a schedule like, but not as intense as, this for years. But for the past five or six months, Leelo and Mali have been refusing to sleep at night, usually until 10 PM (even with all the sleepy-time routines and no daytime naps) and then Leelo wakes up at 6:30 AM. Seymour and I get none of that happy kids-in-bed, let's-parallel-websurf togetherness that is supposed to make the parenting bearable. It makes me grumpy. And hate everything and everybody. Monday 8:15 Drive Iz to school 8:30 Drive Mali to school 9:00 Get back home for Leelo's school bus 9:30 school bus actually arrives 11:15 Leave to pick up Mali 2:50 Pick up Iz, drive her to Aikido 3:20 Aikido starts 4:30 Aikido ends 6:00 Leelo's home session with Therapist R ends Tuesday 8:15 Drive Iz to school 8:30 Drive Mali to school 9:00 Get back home for Leelo's school bus 9:30 school bus actually arrives 11:15 Leave to pick up Mali 12:30 Pick up Leelo from his school 20 miles away 1:30 Leelo's home session with Therapist L starts 2:50 Pick up Iz 3:30 Iz's home Spanish tutoring starts 3:30 Leelo's home session ends 4:30 Iz's tutoring ends 5:00 Iz sees counselor twenty minute drive away 6:00 Iz's session ends Wednesday 8:15 Drive Iz to school 8:30 Drive Mali to school 9:00 Get back home for Leelo's school bus 9:30 School bus actually arrives 11:15 Leave to pick up Mali 12:30 Pick up Leelo from his school 20 miles away 1:30 Leelo's home session with Therapist L starts 2:50 Pick up Iz 3:30 Leelo's home session ends 4:00 Leelo's home session with Therapist R starts 5:30 Leelo's home session with Therapits R ends Thursday 8:15 Drive Iz to school 8:30 Drive Mali to school 9:00 Get back home for Leelo's school bus 9:30 school bus actually arrives 10:00 Bad Moms Coffee! 11:15 Leave to pick up Mali 12:30 Pick up Leelo from his school 20 miles away 1:30 Leelo's home session with Therapist L starts 1:45 Pick up Iz, drive to piano lesson (at Mali's school across town) 2:45 Iz's piano lesson 3:15 Piano ends 3:30 Leelo's home session ends Friday 8:15 Drive Iz to school 8:30 Drive Mali to school 9:00 Get back home for Leelo's school bus 9:30 school bus actually arrives 11:15 Leave to pick up Mali 2:50 Pick up Iz 4:10 Leelo arrives home As of today, the schedule is going to change. Therapist L has left us for greener pastures. She had been sucking up a bridge commute to work with Leelo for almost five years, so I can't blame her. Also, now that our boy spends so much time in school, the number of hours available to her weren't really worth the effort. We are sad sad sad but very much understand. Because now Leelo can go to school full time! He had been leaving school early three days per week to have home sessions with Therapist L. Now he will get to stay until 3:00 (and arrive home on the bus at ~4:00) four days per week, and go see Sage for speech therapy again on Wednesday, his early release day. Since the SLP working with him at school does not grok autism, this is a really good thing. I will write more soon about how much I love Leelo's school (SLP notwithstanding). And how much he loves it there, and is really learning there, and how much even Supervisor M, with her high standards, likes his school. He might not be sleeping, but during the day Leelo is a happy happy boy. And that is a remarkable thing for a kid who has spent the past four Februaries deep in a nasty behavioral bender. We are grateful. And relieved. ---- Forgot to mention that we were recently visited by a friend from Ghana.  Mali and I took him all over town . Charles had never encountered  Pollo en Mole  before, and was smitten. Never before had Seymour or I seen a used dinner plate so clean. Technorati Tags:  autism ,  autism blog ,  autistic

 The boys go back for the first day of school on Friday, so it'll be a busy week getting them ready to go.  I'll be back online by Saturday. 
 Enjoy the last of the summer--if you've got any left.

Last Day of School
" "
Well, here we are, at the end of another school year. Andy is having a water party today; Monday he starts at summer camp, and will go to Hazelwild five days per week. Joey has next week off. I am making big plans for doing a bunch of space stuff with him. We'll see how that goes.  After today, Joey leaves the first grade, and starts with the second grade. This is unusual; school years in Virginia technically run September-September, so he should be a first grader for three more months. We are putting him in with second graders for the first leg of summer school so he won't get bored and will get used to the new level of expected work. I hope that goes well. He met the teacher already, but I haven't. But what else do we expect from our Excellence in Reading and Excellence in Math boy?  So this is my last breath for a week. I expect to be having a lot of fun with Joey next week, a rare treat, no matter what we end up actually doing. I think I need to repair their pool and make sure I'm ready to go with summer... here at last!

Joey's School Bus Finally Arrives
" "
The  Hamilton Spectator  reports that Joey Van Dyk's school bus has finally arrived.  Joey is the 13 year old autistic boy whose bus did not show up for the first five days of school upsetting Joey and forcing his dad to leave work to drive him to school.   Joey's mom, quite understandably, is ecstatic and Joey had a great day. As the father of an autistic boy it gives me a happy buzz when I read of  things working out well for  autistic children and adults. autism

Rooster's Day:  1. It's the fourth day of school and so far the aide his is guaranteed by his IEP has not appeared yet.  2. His after school aide could not come today so he did not do his homework until he got home with us at 6:30 and he was TIRED.  3. His principal called to let us know that they are reorganizing second grade. Tomorrow he will have a new teacher. Not the wonderful Mrs. Y who sent us the sweet and warm email, to whom I sent a gift card to Baskin Robbins because she said ice cream is her favorite thing; no, he will not have Mrs. Y, who has many years of teaching experience and a great profile on the web site. No, the principal didn't care that Roo had three first grade teachers at his OLD school, because I am quite sure she wishes we had stayed there. Remember, she was forced to take our boy, after rejecting \"another kid with autism.\"  4. He told us that in the bathroom during after school care two boys teased him. One pushed his face into the wall, while the other threw paper towels at him. A third boy stood there with a cell phone, watching.  Peaches' Day:  Peaches has had remarkably poor behavior at her new after school program. When I picked her up today, I asked the teacher, \"How was today?\" He shook his head. \"Well,\" he said, \"Friday was good. I hope your husband told you I said that when he picked her up Friday. Today, though, she got in a full-fledged brawl, pulling hair and rolling around on the floor.\"  My Day:  I'm posting an ad for babysitters. See above.  Your day?  Comments encouraged.

Conor Back At School
" "
 Conor loves school.  He has asked for school all summer,  literally from the first week of summer vacation.  As the school year approached he asked for it more frequently.  This morning he woke up an hour ahead of the time we  had planned to wake him.  He was a bit anxious and was the first one in the driveway and into the car to go to school.  He was happy to get to school where he is shown waiting for his teacher assistant who worked with him last year and did an outstanding job. By the end of the day, back home,  the excitement was getting to him and he did some screaming but no self injury or destructive behavior.   To some extent it was like the first day of school for any child.  The autism was a factor primarily when he got tired. Above with Mom,  he has grown quite a bit since his first day of middle school last year.  autism

		 When first approached by Jack’s case worker at school about sending him to ESY (special education Extended School Year, if you don’t know), I was thrilled because Jack does really well with routine and structure, and I thought it would be good for him. 
 Our ESY is half-day school that runs for four weeks in July. As the school year drew to a close and Jack became more and more excited about not having to go to school, I started to wonder how he was going to react to having to turn right around in two weeks and go back to school. Especially when his brothers didn’t have to. 
 But we talked up how he got to go to summer school and was going to have all kinds of fun and he seemed to get in the spirit of it all. 
 Then, just before ESY started, I began to worry. It seemed disorganized and I was concerned about just throwing him into an unfamiliar school with unfamiliar people and a new teacher for four weeks.  I posted about that  and then became even more worried as comments started to roll in about bad experiences people had with ESY. 
 But I am thrilled to report that Jack finished his last day of ESY last Friday and that it was a completely wonderful experience for him.  He took to it immediately , partly because so many of the kids in his class were from his kindergarten and partly because  his teacher was amazing . 
 Whereas during the school year I was constantly getting phone calls about his (mis)behavior and his communication notebook was full of his teachers’ concerns, this summer’s communication was almost all positive. 
 Yes, there was  that bad week when he threw up on the bus more than once  and we had one note from the teacher about his hitting another child, but that was an anomaly. His teacher told me during an end-of-ESY phone conference, “With the structure and support, he’s doing really well.” 
 She also told me, “He says his mom is his best friend, but that ‘T’ is his best school friend,” which brought me all kinds of happy for all kinds of reasons. 
 Speaking of T, Jack has finally created a friendship with another boy. They are both on the spectrum and seem to enjoy each other a lot. T’s mother and I have gotten them together several times this summer. I imagine that Jack likes getting dropped off for his own playdates after seeing Sam dash off to playdate after playdate ever since he was in preschool. And I like that T’s mom knows what to do with Jack and isn’t nervous about taking him. She gets it. 
 It has been wonderful to see Jack happily run off to the bus at pick up every day instead of crying and trying to refuse to get out of the car, as he would sometimes do when I dropped him off for regular school. 
 It’s been fabulous to ask him at the end of the day how school was and to get a thumbs up or “It was faaaantastic!” or “We did X, Y, and Z.” This isn’t what I heard last year after school. 
 Plus, I’m happy to report that the bus drivers came around once I started sending Jack out to the bus with an ice pack and once he stopped barfing on the bus. They were really kind to him and made enough of an impression that he wrote a letter to give to them on the last day of school. (“Dear Bus Driver, It is the last day of school. We are having a pizza party…”) 
 I don’t know if it was the half-day schedule or that it was an all special education environment or if his teacher just really got him. I’m sure it helped that they came up with fun ways to do assignments (M&Ms math, for example), but he still did a lot of work. And instead of coming home with a check (“I didn’t do my best work.”) or a smiley face (“I made some mistakes.”), his work would come home with smiley face, star, check plus “WOW!” 
 I can only imagine how good for his self esteem these four weeks were. 
 I’m still drop-dead terrified of first grade, but it has been amazing to watch Jack have such a positive experience at school.

Zero Days to School and Conor is Happy
" "
 Knowing how anxious he would be to get to school today we had Conor's school bags and sports equipment packed and ready to go this morning. And Conor was happy to be going back to middle school.  In the bottom picture Conor and Mom head off to the Nashwaaksis Middle School.  Conor is the \"slightly\" taller one on the left. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

Christmas is Coming :)

 Well the Christmas tree is up and the twinkle lights are twinkling 
. 
 
The decorations are on the piano 
 
 
 
 
 And the Christmas wreath has been hung 
 
 
 The Christmas cards are made 
 
 And the presents are wrapped . 
 And here I am as a Humanist wondering why I am doing all of this :)

The one-of-its-kind doghouse, decorated with some 7,600 glass crystals and a cushion bearing Hello Kitty's face, will be put on display at a Tokyo department store later this month, Sanrio Co. said. Sanrio designer Ikuko Shimizu launched Hello Kitty in 1974 as a moon-faced cartoon cat on a coin purse.

Kickin' and Takin'
" "
I made some phone calls this morning that needed to be made. I got some stuff to the framers that needed to be framed. I got my dining room table cleared off and the potpourri out. I got the mantel cleared and arranged for fall. I made orange-glazed chicken for dinner. I guess the aliens really did get my brain jumpstarted. ;)  Andy was a doll in the framer's. As I explained that yes, I wanted them to frame a napkin with a crayon drawing of a bear on it (Joey's first clear picture of Little Bear), along with several other children's art pieces, a photo a friend gave me, a poster of dinosaurs, and a postage stamp, Andy wandered about the store... keeping his hands to himself. It was incredible. I was so proud of him. As we left, hand in hand, he looked up at me and said, very matter-of-factly: \"Mommy, let's pop into the toy store and look at some toys.\"  So we walked down the block to the little toy store, and bought a little dinosaur. Because who can resist such a little charmer?

Mr. Guinea Pig
" "
Tonight at dinner, Joey insisted that we call him \"Mr. Guinea Pig\" (that's Pinky Dinky Doo's pet guinea pig). He is SO CUTE. He puts his fingers up on each side of his head, and proclaims himself Mr. Guinea Pig. Then he pretends to be Mr. Guinea Pig for a while! How cool is THAT???

		 This: 
 is what you have to buy if you want to send two children to the public school my sons attend. 
 We don’t have  any  backpacks big enough for all that stuff. 
 I accept that I have a big ol’ list of things to buy for my kids’ school that I wouldn’t anticipate having to supply (lunch bags, Ziploc bags, paper plates, composition notebooks), but some of the items were amusing to me: 
 * A pack of addition and subtraction flashcards. (Isn’t this precisely what  teachers  are for?) * Two bottles of hand sanitizer. (Isn’t that what sinks are for?) * Five portfolio folders with 2 pockets inside (“2 blue, 2 yellow, and 1 additional color”). * One ruler with inches and centimeters. (What? As opposed to hectares?) * Two large boxes of tissues. 
 That’s all from the first grade supply list. Kindergartners only have to take in  one  large box of tissues. And no hand sanitizer. Apparently, they don’t have to be as clean. They also don’t have to supply the Clorox wipes that the first graders have to. 
 Oddly, even though the kindergartners don’t have to take in paper plates, they have to take in snack to share. The first graders take in paper plates, but no snack. 
 I would have been slightly less irritated by this list if Target hadn’t been out of crayons. And pencils. 
 Fortunately I happened to have the 22 required glue sticks at home because Target was out of those too. (I got a little overexcited about the cheap glue  last year  during school supply shopping.) 
 Nonetheless, I had to drag my now-irritated group of young men to Office Depot to spend $30 on top of the $50 I’d spent at Target. (Hand sanitizer is surprisingly expensive.) 
 All I have to say is that after sending 200 lunch-size brown paper bags into that school, I’d better see a whole hell of a lot of paper bag puppets coming home.

What is up with bubble gum?
" "
When I was a kid, bubble gum was the bane of parental existence. I liked bubble gum OK, and it was fun, but there were some kids I knew who chewed it extensively, as  Violet Beauregarde  extensively. Kids blew bubbles big enough to stick to their hair, smacked it and popped it, and made it crackle in class. It came in packs. It came with  trading cards . It came in little balls. It was everywhere.  Joey, and increasingly Andy, do well at focus and calming with bubble gum. Regular chewing gum is not as good; you need the soft square consistency to get the desired effect. The liquid-filled crap is right out. The oral heavy work is calming, stabilizing, and organizing.  To our surprise and grief, bubble gum is becoming increasingly difficult to find. For a while we got it at Target, and that was fine. They had the yummy chocolate kind, and Joey really liked that. Then Target switched to the yucky liquid-filled kind and no more chocolate; we went to CVS and found our treasure, though only in strawberry or watermelon. So be it. But now they've gone to tape or liquid-filled. So the hunt is on... where to find bubble gum in a consistent supply? Why doesn't any one store sell the whole selection of bubble gum? Am I going to be reduced to ordering it online, where you have to buy it in bulk (I wasn't thinking I was going to need to make a sudden $75 investment in bubble gum!) (*note: the investment is because generally, sites offer free shipping at that amount. Otherwise, the shipping is the same as the cost of a whole box of gum...) So what's the deal? Are kids not chewing bubble gum anymore? Is ther some kind of bubble gum strike? Why can't I get my hands on regular, yummy, not-stale bubble gum???

 You can't tell that there's crayon on this butterfly, but there is. It is purple stripey. Lucy drew on a big piece of paper. I didn't have any scissors for her, but after she was done coloring she came over to me in the kitchen where I was cooking and said, \"Here mommy. Here's a budderfly for you.\" Perhaps I am easily pleased, but I am thinking that was a pretty good looking butterfly to tear out of an 11x14 piece of paper!

			 The  Huffington Post  (HuffPo) opened online in May, 2005, styling itself \"The Internet Newspaper: News Blogs Video Community\".  Politically, HuffPo has a liberal tilt. 

 However, the HuffPo's science and \"wellness\" coverage has, well, a loony tilt. 

 The \"wellness\" editor is one  Patricia Fitzgerald , who believes that \"cleansing\" is the road to health.  Fitzgerald's \"wellness\" qualifications are, well, questionable. 

 Lately, there's been a movement in the science/medical blogosphere reacting to the, well, looniness of the Huffington Post's science/medicine coverage:

"20912" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/01/16/salon-retracts-robert-kennedys-deadly-immunity/" "Salon retracts Robert Kennedy’s “Deadly Immunity”" "One of the worst pieces written claiming that mercury caused an autism epidemic was the piece “Deadly Immunity” by Robert Kennedy Jr.  Salon.com and Rolling Stone co-published the piece.  It was immediately met with criticism and corrections: multiple correction pieces were published. Salon has decided to review the piece and decided that corrections were not enough.  They’ve pulled the piece from their site.   Here’s the statement . 
Correcting our record 
We’ve removed an explosive 2005 report by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about autism and vaccines. Here’s why  
 In 2005, Salon published online an exclusive story by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that offered an explosive premise: that the mercury-based thimerosal compound present in vaccines until 2001 was dangerous, and that he was “convinced that the link between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real.” 
 The piece was co-published with Rolling Stone magazine — they fact-checked it and published it in print; we posted it online. In the days after running “Deadly Immunity,” we amended the story with five corrections (which can still be found  logged here ) that went far in undermining Kennedy’s exposé. At the time, we felt that correcting the piece — and keeping it on the site, in the spirit of transparency — was the best way to operate. But subsequent critics, including most recently, Seth Mnookin in his book “ The Panic Virus ,” further eroded any faith we had in the story’s value. We’ve grown to believe the best reader service is to delete the piece entirely. 
 “I regret we didn’t move on this more quickly, as evidence continued to emerge debunking the vaccines and autism link,” says former Salon editor in chief Joan Walsh, now editor at large. “But continued revelations of the flaws and even fraud tainting the science behind the connection make taking down the story the right thing to do.” The story’s original URL now links to our  autism topics page , which we believe now offers a strong record of clear thinking and skeptical coverage we’re proud of — including the critical pursuit of others who continue to propagate the debunked, and dangerous, autism-vaccine link.

Thompson as “The CDC Whistleblower ” published online 
 August 22, 2014,  Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence :  Brian Hooker proves Andrew Wakefield wrong about vaccines and autism 
 Of course, the key finding in Brian Hooker’s paper is that Wakefield was wrong. Indeed, in this video, Wakefield even admits that he was mostly wrong about MMR and autism. Let that sink in again. He admits that he was mostly wrong about MMR and autism. OK, he says we were “partially right,” but the flip side of that is that he must have been mostly wrong. 
 
 August 22, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog:  Andrew Jeremy Wakefield plays video director while African-American Babies die, or something 
 Hooker is wrong in his assertions because the DeStefano paper did not leave out African-American children on purpose. Children were excluded from the analysis because of very legitimate and scientific reasons. They either were not the right age, did not have autism but some other neurodevelopment disorder, or were born outside of Georgia. Even if they were tossed into the analysis, DeStefano et al used a statistical analysis that took into account things like birth weight and mother’s age when analysing the data. They wanted to make sure that what they were seeing was most likely because of the MMR vaccine and not because of some other factor associated with autism. 
 
 August 23, 2014,  Ren at Epidemiological:  Directed Acyclic Graphs and the MMR vaccine doesn’t cause autism . 
 I’m very skeptical that Dr. Hooker’s simplified statistical approach can be better than DeStefano et al’s approach of conditional logistic regression. Conditional logistic regression has the advantage of being able to control for a multitude of confounders and effect modifiers. 
 
 August 24, 2014, Liz Ditz at I Speak of Dreams:  L’affaire CDC-MMR: Hooker, Wakefield, and Focus Autism Accuse African-American Senior CDC Researcher of Being A Race Traitor 
 According to Hooker, Wakefield, and Focus Autism, a respected senior African-American physician-researcher is a race traitor and a mass murderer. 
 
 August 25, 2014, Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:  The central conspiracy theory of the antivaccine movement   
 I can imagine three main possibilities for what happened. The first possibility from what I know is that Thompson had some sort of disagreement with his co-investigators, made the incredibly stupid—yes, stupid—decision to unburden himself to Brian Hooker, who, he must have known or should have known, is an antivaccine crank associated with Andrew Wakefield, and is now paying the price for that decision… The second possibility is that Thompson wanted to correct something Hooker was doing with the data and somehow let himself be drawn into saying things that could easily be taken out of context. The third, and (I hope) much less likely, possibility is that Thompson’s gone off the deep end and gone antivaccine. 
 
 August 25,2014, David Gorski MD at Science Based Medicine:  Did a high ranking whistleblower really reveal that the CDC covered up proof that vaccines cause autism in African-American boys? 
 “What [Hooker] has done, apparently, is found grist for a perfect conspiracy theory to demonize the CDC, play the race card in a truly despicable fashion, and cast fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the CDC vaccination program, knowing that most of the white antivaccine activists who support hate the CDC so much that they won’t notice that even Hooker’s reanalysis doesn’t support their belief that vaccines caused the autism in their children. Meanwhile, there is no evidence, at least none, submitted by the antivaccine propagandists flogging this conspiracy theory, that there really was a CDC conspiracy to hide anything. 
 
 August 25, 2014, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks,  Andrew Wakefield Tortures History  
 I want to focus on some statements made by one Andrew Wakefield, the British doctor who committed scientific fraud, resulting in the full retraction of his 1998 case series study on MMR and the stripping of his medical license. Wakefield boldly added himself to the list of not only torturing science, but now adds to his accomplishments torturing history and ethics (granted, we already knew he was ethically challenged). You see, in his videos (here and here) about the alleged “whistleblower”, William Thompson,Wakefield compared the purported “cover-up” to the Tuskegee syphilis debacle. It’s a false comparison used simply to inflame people and claim the race card. 
 
 August 25, 2014, Michael Simpson at Skeptical Raptor,  Great CDC Coverup–suppressing evidence that MMR vaccines cause autism?  cross-posted at  at Daily Kos 
 It’s clear what’s happening here. Thompson, through sheer ignorance or total incompetence may have had a conversation with Hooker. Given the fact that the antivaccination gang lacks any serious scientific evidence supporting their dogma that vaccines cause autism, they jump on anything, however tenuous, that makes it appear that all of the evidence that refutes their dogma should be thrown in the garbage. 
 
 August 26, 2014, Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:  Hey, where is everybody? The “CDC whistleblower” manufactroversy continues apace 
 Here it is, Tuesday already, and the antivaccine underground is still on full mental jacket alert over the biggest story the antivaccine movement has seen in a while. Fortunately, it’s a story that’s been largely ignored by the mainstream media, which tells me that maybe, just maybe, the mainstream media has figured out that it shouldn’t give undue credence to cranks. 
 
 August 26 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism, Atlanta,  MMR: serious questions and also how Brian Hooker and Andrew Wakefield are causing damage to the autism communties 
 A study relying largely on a small group of subjects (about 20) with the conclusion that more work is needed. Sounds vaguely familiar. And, as we will see, Mr. Hooker has teamed up with Andrew Wakefield to put out a video where they jump past the whole  this indicates more research is needed  through  this is absolute evidence of MMR causing autism  directly to  the CDC are engaging in a racist experiment sacrificing children to autism.  It’s like the events around Mr. Wakefield’s 1997 Lancet paper cranked up to 11. 
 
 August 26 2014,Lisa Lightner at Grounded Parents:  the CDC vaccines/autism/coverup theory {spoiler alert-it’s not true!} 
 
 a friend, a friend that I consider to be intelligent and reasonable….first posted a link to a CNN article. Correction–it’s iCNN…which is VERY different. ANYONE can post ANYTHING there. You can, really. It’s a crowdsourcing platform. Shame on you CNN for whoring out your name for page views. Because this is what happens–people will post just about anything….. 
 I wish we knew the causes of autism, I really do. But vaccines ain’t it. 
 Fear sells, don’t buy it. 
 
 
 August 26, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog:  How to end a scientist’s career with some fancy editing 
 As much as the anti-vaccine activists have been demanding that Dr. Thompson come out into the open and make some sort of a statement, no one seems to demand that Andrew Jeremy Wakefield and his team publish the entire recorded conversation between Brian Hooker and Dr. Thompson. All we get are lies and innuendo. We have operatives like Ginger Taylor writing on Twitter that CDC deliberately didn’t look at birth certificates for African-American babies in the DeStefano study.

 August 27 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism:  Discussions of the recent MMR/autism paper (and why the study isn’t what the author wants you to believe it is) 
 Below are a selected list of discussions about Brian Hooker’s recent paper and the highly irresponsible way he and his team are promoting it. Let me know if you spot one I should add to the list. 
 
 August 27, 2014,  Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:  The CDC “whistleblower” manufactroversy: Twitter parties and another “bombshell” e-mail 
 … just how desperate the antivaccine movement is to have Brian Hooker’s incompetent “reanalysis” of a ten year old vaccine safety study and Andrew Wakefield’s despicable race-baiting video gain traction in the mainstream media. The failure of this conspiracy theory to do so is driving antivaccine activists into ever-greater fits of lunacy online. 
 
 August 27, 2014, Phil Plait at Bad Astronomy, Slate:  No, There Still Is No Connection Between Vaccines and Autism 
 There’s a conspiracy theory going around that the CDC covered up a link between autism and vaccines. From what I can tell, this conspiracy theory is on the same level as the one that NASA faked the Moon landings. And you know how I feel about  that. 
 
 August 27, 2014, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks,  Anti-vaccine Activists Throw Twitter Tantrum 
 … the hashtag #CDCwhistleblower to do what really amounted to the social media equivalent of a temper tantrum, whining about how the mainstream media is not reporting on the study. It was really a sad display, as they simply all copied and pasted from the same list of talking points, not even adding their own interpretation. 
 August 27, 2014, in the morning: The Journal Translational Neurodegeneration removes Hooker’s paper from the public domain 
 
 August 27 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism: The Brian Hooker article “…has been removed from the public domain because of serious concerns about the validity of its conclusions” 
 August 27, 2014, Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch:  Journal takes down autism-vaccine paper pending investigation 
 An article purporting to find that black children are at substantially increased risk for autism after early exposure to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine has been shelved, amid claims that a CDC whistleblower has accused health officials of suppressing information about the link. 
 
 August 27, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog: Even the bottom-feeding journals seem to have some sense 
 ’m still left wondering how this paper got through peer review, or who did the peer review. They seem to not have bothered with checking the biostatistics or with looking back at the DeStefano paper. 
 A ugust 27, 2014, at approximately 2:30 pm, PDT, attorneys for William W. Thompson, the CDC employee,  publish Thompson’s statement 
 
 August 27, 2014: Ren at Epidemiological  Dr. Brian S. Hooker gets the Andrew Wakefield treatment . 
 My problem with Dr. Thompson’s statement is that the data were not omitted willy-nilly. There was a protocol that was established, and it excluded from the analysis children of different ethnicities, not just African Americans. In that exclusion, a vaccine-autism signal that was confounded by different factors was lost. It wasn’t lost out of bias but out of properly adjusting for different factors. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Sullivan at LeftbrainRightBrain  Andrew Wakefield betrays another “whistleblower” with Brian Hooker helping 
 Apparently Mr. Hooker is unaware that the secrecy of confession is absolute. Priests, real ones, not self appointed ones like Mr. Hooker, have been known to go to jail rather than divulge what they’ve been told in confession. Real priests don’t record confessions so they can betray another. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Debra Goldschmidt, CNN,  Journal questions validity of autism and vaccine study 
 Dr. Frank DeStefano, lead author of the 2004 study, said he and his colleagues stand by their findings. DeStefano said all the study authors, including Thompson, agreed on the analysis and interpretation before the study was submitted for publication 10 years ago. However, he said he plans to review his notes and will decide whether to run another analysis on the data. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog,  Autism is not death, unless you want it to be  
 While the black ribbon can mean different things to different people, it’s main use is for grieving or remembering the fallen, the dead. The way that these people have used it is to try to bring attention to their cause by equating autism with a death or a loss. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Orac at Respectful Insolence  A bad day for antivaccinationists: A possible retraction, and the “CDC whistleblower” issues a statement 
 Betrayals within betrayals. This can’t all be laid on Wakefield. Thompson was played. Big time.

			 Orac, an oncologist and surgeon, writes the blog  Respectful Insolence .  Orac has been been a long-time skeptic chronicling the antics (\"thermonuclear stupidity\") of the  anti-vaccine conglomerate  (or the  Society for the Promotion of Vaccine-Preventable Disease ).
Ginger Taylor is an anti-vaccine, \"autism is vaccine injury\", \"autism can be cured\" activist.  

 On August 26, 2009 Orac published a post, \" In Which Orac Defends Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum,  
 
 it's always the right time to give an anti-vaccinationist like Ginger Taylor a bit of the ol' Not-So-Respectful Insolence, especially now that she's apparently guest blogging for that happy home of wandering anti-vaccine propagandists, Age of Autism.  
 

J.B. Handley, the founder of the \"autism is vaccine injury\", \"autism can be cured\" organization Generation Rescue, responded a  foul-mouthed, invective-laced comment , in which he alleges that vaccines DO TOO cause autism. 

One of the pleasures of hanging around Orac's joint is the commenters.  l'asperge responded:  
 
Mr. Handley has run out of options, so now he's stamping his little feet and swearing like a teamster. First he tried to win on the science, but the universe remained stubbornly mechanistic. So he turned to the courts, but the special masters wouldn't cooperate. His latest brainstorm, 14Studies.com, just gave \"anyone with half a brain\" one more reason to laugh at him. Desperate for a victory, he turned to the court of public opinion, where both science and justice are subordinate to a collective need to amuse ourselves to death. But Handley's shtick isn't playing in Peoria, or anywhere outside an Autism One conference. Sociopathy is so 1998. 

You need a new website, Mr. Handley. \"14NaughtyWords.com\" is available.

"20913" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/01/16/salon-retracts-rfk-jr-article/" "Salon retracts RFK Jr. article" "In 2005, Salon published online an exclusive story by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that offered an explosive premise: that the mercury-based thimerosal compound present in vaccines until 2001 was dangerous, and that he was “convinced that the link between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real.” 
 The piece was co-published with Rolling Stone magazine — they fact-checked it and published it in print; we posted it online. In the days after running “Deadly Immunity,” we amended the story with five corrections (which can still be found logged) that went far in undermining Kennedy’s exposé. At the time, we felt that correcting the piece — and keeping it on the site, in the spirit of transparency — was the best way to operate. But subsequent critics, including most recently, Seth Mnookin in his book “The Panic Virus,” further eroded any faith we had in the story’s value. We’ve grown to believe the best reader service is to delete the piece entirely. 
 “I regret we didn’t move on this more quickly, as evidence continued to emerge debunking the vaccines and autism link,” says former Salon editor in chief Joan Walsh, now editor at large. “But continued revelations of the flaws and even fraud tainting the science behind the connection make taking down the story the right thing to do.” The story’s original URL now links to our autism topics page, which we believe now offers a strong record of clear thinking and skeptical coverage we’re proud of — including the critical pursuit of others who continue to propagate the debunked, and dangerous, autism-vaccine link. Well done  Salon .

			  There's a blogger who goes by the  nom de blogue  \"Sullivan\", mostly posting at  LeftBrain/RightBrain.   (He chose the name based on the character from  Monsters Inc. , one of his kids' favorite movies.)  I am proud to say that Sullivan is a friend in real life -- we met through blogging, discovered we lived in the same part of California, and meet from time to time for lunch or coffee or similar. 
 Sully is danged smart and a passionate advocate for truth, justice, and improving life for people with disabilities.  One of his children has significant disabilities, including autism. 
 JB Handley is also a father of a child with autism, but has a completely different character.  Handley and his wife founded Generation Rescue; Handley blogs from time to time at Age of Autism.  His blog posts are often scurrulious screeds (examples:  Novella ,  Gorski ,  Wallace  ,  Harris , and so on). Handley's   bête noire  is anyone who disagrees with the discredited notion that vaccines cause autism; his favorite target for villification is  Paul Offit, MD . 
 Today, based on an  offhand comment I wrote at Squidalicious , Handley has posted a cloud castle, claiming \"evidence\" that Sullivan is in fact not a father of a child with autism, but Paul Offit's wife Bonnie. 
 The chain of evidence is pathetic in its delusions.  But it's standard operating procedure for those enmeshed in pseudoscience: begin with a misinterpretation, and go hunting frantically (if not hysterically) for confirmation.  
 Update: Here's Handley's two promises 
 
 If you can produce a dad with a child with autism with a remarkable  grasp of the medical and scientific literature who blogs under the name  Sullivan, a man who has an inordinate grasp of the details of your  husband’s patents, lawsuits, published studies, and web habits,  I will  make sure that the pauloffit.com website is given to you and your  husband for good.   In fact, if you can produce this father, I promise to never, ever publicly write about or utter the name “Paul Offit” again.

			 Jake Crosby  is a young autistic man who, it appears, believes that vaccination caused his Asperger's.  He has written widely on anti-vaccination topics, as  discussed by Orac at Respectful Insolence .  Crosby primarily has been published at the anti-vaccine organ  Age of Autism . 
 Science Mom  at  Just the Vax summarizes what happened this week very well : 
 
 Last November (2012) there was a congressional hearing lead up by  California Republican representative Darrell Issa.   Autism parent Brian Hooker  revealed a series of meetings  he had with rep. Issa and other congress critters.  Mr. Hooker was accompanied by  Andrew Wakefield  who wined and dined members of the oversight committee that would ultimately hear testimonies from anti-vaccine groups on the topic of autism.  The testimonies and speakers at this hearing has made  Jake Crosby very angry  and has posted his diatribe on none other than the Bolen Report*. 
 The Cliff Notes version is that Jake has decided to slam his comrades-in-arms, particularly SafeMinds, because they chose to try and appear sane and rational (as sane and rational as one can be given that they believe vaccines cause autism) in front of the congressional committee by refusing to let Jake present his contorted conspiracy theories and instead letting Mark Blaxill speak and trimming Brian Hooker's screed down.  Jake's little hissy fit is a thing of beauty to read as it illustrates the mindset of anti-vaxxers and their slimy tactics to weasel their way onto a platform of legitimacy. 
 
 There is a history of folk scrubbing incriminating documents from the internet record.  I decided to take screenshots of Crosby's diatribe, posted below.  This of course removes the links, but preserves the sense. 
As always, click to embiggen.

Offit Called Out For Lying AGAIN!
" "
Why does this man still get published! 
 
 
In 2008 CBS ran this piece: 
 
 
 
(My blog on in  here .) 
 
Paul Offit responded to the piece in the OC Register  here . 
 
Note the comments section... everyone knew the man was not telling the truth. 
 
Now, three years later, the OC Register has  retracted the article , because they had to come to grips with what we have learned the hard way, that the man is a big fat liar. 
 
 \"An OC Register article dated Aug. 4, 2008 entitled “Dr. Paul Offit Responds” contained several disparaging statements that Dr. Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia made about CBS News Investigative Correspondent Sharyl Attkisson and her report. Upon further review, it appears that a number of Dr. Offit’s statements, as quoted in the OC Register article, were unsubstantiated and/or false. Attkisson had previously reported on the vaccine industry ties of Dr. Offit and others in a CBS Evening News report “How Independent Are Vaccine Defenders?” July 25, 2008.  
 
Unsubstantiated statements include: Offit’s claim that Attkisson “lied”; and Offit’s claim that CBS News sent a “mean spirited and vituperative” email “over the signature of Sharyl Attkisson” stating “You’re clearly hiding something.” In fact, the OC Register has no evidence to support those claims. Further, Offit told the OC Register that he provided CBS News “the details of his relationship, and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s relationship, with pharmaceutical company Merck.” However, documents provided by CBS News indicate Offit did not disclose his financial relationships with Merck, including a $1.5 million Hilleman chair he sits in that is co-sponsored by Merck. According to the CBS News’ documentation recently reviewed by the OC Register, the network requested (but Offit did not disclose) the entire profile of his professional financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies including: The amount of compensation he’d received from which companies in speaking fees; and pharmaceutical consulting relationships and fees. The CBS News documentation indicates Offit also did not disclose his share of past and future royalties for the Merck vaccine he co-invented. To the extent that unsubstantiated and/or false claims appeared in the OC Register and have been repeated by other organizations and individuals, the OC Register wishes to express this clarification for their reference and for the record.\"

"21061" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/09/07/amy-wallace-gives-lessons-from-the-field-to-health-journalists/" "Amy Wallace gives “lessons from the field” to health journalists" "In a recent article on the University of Southern California’s site  Reporting on Health , Amy Wallace gives lessons learned in her activities covering the vaccine/autism discussion.  The site, part of the Annenberg School for Communication, hosts her piece,  Covering Vaccines . Amy Wallace wrote a piece for Wired Magazine last year,  An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All .  As you might imagine, this piece was not well accepted by parts of the autism, nor the self-styled “vaccine safety” communities.  Ms. Wallace first had to endure the negative responses of those communities online, with emails such as an essay  Paul Offit Rapes (intellectually) Amy Wallace and Wired Magazine  as well as blog posts depicting her sitting down to a thanksgiving feast consisting of roast human baby. She, her publisher and Dr. Paul Offit were also subjected to a lawsuit by Barbara Fisher of the self-named “National Vaccine Informational Center” over a statement by Dr. Offit quoted in the piece: Paul Offit has a slightly  nasal voice and a forceful delivery that conspire to make him sound remarkably like Hawkeye Pierce, the cantankerous doctor played by Alan Alda on the TV series M*A*S*H. As a young man, Offit was a big fan of the show (though he felt then, and does now, that Hawkeye was “much cooler than me”). Offit is quick-witted, funny, and — despite a generally mild-mannered mien — sometimes so assertive as to seem brash. “Scientists, bound only by reason, are society’s true anarchists,” he has written — and he clearly sees himself as one. “Kaflooey theories” make him crazy, especially if they catch on. Fisher, who has long been the media’s go-to interview for what some in the autism arena call “parents’ rights,” makes him particularly nuts, as in “You just want to scream.” The reason? “She lies,” he says flatly. 
 “Barbara Loe Fisher inflames people against me. And wrongly. I’m in this for the same reason she is. I care about kids. Does she think Merck is paying me to speak about vaccines? Is that the logic?” he asks, exasperated. (Merck is doing no such thing). But when it comes to mandating vaccinations, Offit says, Fisher is right about him: He is an adamant supporter. The phrase “she lies” was singled out in the lawsuit, which was dismissed on its merits. The article brings the story to health journalists, who are being educated in the manner in which some groups use in response to articles with which they disagree.  Such responses as those levied against Ms. Wallace do not further the needs of disabled children or adults, in this readers opinion.

			 See foot of article for update 
 
 Correcting our record - Inside Salon - Salon.com .  In 2005, Salon published online an exclusive story by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that offered an explosive premise: that the mercury-based thimerosal compound present in vaccines until 2001 was dangerous, and that he was \"convinced that the link between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real.\" 
 The piece was co-published with  Rolling Stone  magazine -- they fact-checked it and published it in print; we posted it online. In the days after running \"Deadly Immunity,\" we amended the story with five corrections (which can still be found logged here) that went far in undermining Kennedy's exposé. At the time, we felt that correcting the piece -- and keeping it on the site, in the spirit of transparency -- was the best way to operate. But subsequent critics, including most recently, Seth Mnookin in his book \"The Panic Virus,\" further eroded any faith we had in the story's value. We've grown to believe the best reader service is to delete the piece entirely. 
 
 Rolling Stone  didn't have the cojones to make a public retraction -- they just disappeared the article, I don't know when. 
 Thanks to the editorial staff at Salon for standing up for evidence-based public discourse. 
 New at Autism News Beat:  Salon Retracts 2005 RFKjr article .  The comment I left there: 
 
 Let’s give some credit to Seth Mnookin &  The Panic Virus ; chapter 16 (“A Conspiracy of Dunces”) details how Kennedy cherry-picked quotes and distorted meanings, and kept repeating falsehoods even after several rounds of corrections by both Rolling Stone and Salon.com.  
 Kudos to Salon.com for being forthright and leaving the link to the article up, now pointing to reliable information about autism; a sneer in the direction of Rolling Stone, which just silently scrubbed the article out of existence:   http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/7395411/deadly_immunity    Wasn’t there a word for that when the Kremlin did so by doctoring photographs? 
 ”Deadly Immunity” is still up at:  Alex Jone’s Infowars site (not surprising)  http://www.infowars.com/vaccinations-deadly-immunity/  ;  RFKjr’s site (also not surprising)  http://www.robertfkennedyjr.com/articles.html#  ; and  Jay Gordon MD’s site  http://drjaygordon.com/vaccinations/deadly-immunity.html  and several hundred other sites.    Wonder how long it will take “Dr. Jay” to remove the paper?

CBS News Looks At Kennedy Claims
" "
A Kennedy Fuels Autism Debate http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/07/14/eveningnews/main709269.shtml Don't miss the \" Video excerpts of interview \" link in the written section of the story. The most interesting thing to me that he mentioned was that he flew autism researchers in to go with him when he met with the editorial boards of some major newspapers, and despite all the evidence they were shown that there could be a thimerosal/autism connection, they still didn't believe it and refused to print his charges. It seems to be an example of just how much people don't want to believe that this theory might be true. Cudos to CBS for actually taking a look at it on the evening news. Update:  A post from a woman on something about the web version of the story that I missed. A Kennedy Fuels Autism Debate  It's interesting to see how CBS's Internet text differs from its broadcast report by Sharyl Atkisson. For example, here's the Internet intro: \"Is there a link between autism and childhood vaccines? Medical experts say no --  resoundingly ...\" The next sentence refers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s support as \"controversial.\" However the Internet version leads with video of Kennedy, stating, \"Robert F. Kennedy is lending his famous family name to a new cause.\" On the Internet, Dr. Tanja Dr. Popovic says, \"Based on what we know right now, we don't think there's an association.\" On the broadcast, Atkisson counters, \"But that's not saying with 100% certainty that there isn't one.\" Popvic pauses, then repeats her previous statement. But that telling exchange is missing on from the Internet piece. On the Internet, Dr. Tanja Dr. Popovic says of the CDC, \"We've always been open about all of our activities.\" On the broadcast Atkisson comments, \"There's widespread disagreement about that.\" Again, that statement was omitted from the print version. It's definitely worth your time to listen to the extended 10-minute segment of Atkisson interviewing Kennedy. Unfortunately right underneath, CBS dredged up Dan Rather's dreadful hatchet job of Barbara Loe Fisher and others regarding a slight rise in pertussis cases (and no mention of how many cases occurred in vaccinated children).

What I found most troublesome was the idea that “vaccine scares” were used as a prime example of this false expertise.  At the time, I assumed that the author likely meant the autism/vaccine link. The author, Harry Collins of  Cardiff University , was recently interviewed by Ira Flatow of  Science Friday .   You an listen to the interview on the  Science Friday website  (or download from there). In the interview, he specifically mentions the Wakefield/MMR scare. The autism community is being used as a big example of the dangers of false-expertise.  Not a good sign.

			 The blog-keeper of Autism News Beat (ANB), who has  worked as a journalist,  requested and received access to the  AutismOne  conference as a journalist.  Until he acted like a journalist--you know, asking the hard questions?--and was escorted from the venue by security guards. 

 Orac has  more on ANB's expulsion,  characterizing the AutismOne conference as  a \"quackfest\".  In this post, Orac also addresses the sequelae from the Shoemaker subpoena fiasco (for the mercury militia) and how  autism \"journalists\" (such a Julie Deardorff) aren't particularly unbiased or professional. 

 ANB wrote an  introduction to the AutismOne conference  for two  Chicago Tribune  journalists who were to appear on a panel at the conference. 

 Steve Novella  favorably reviewed  Alice Park's  Time Magazine  cover story:  How Safe are Vaccines?  . 

 Previously, ANB had published a post on  \"vaccine rejectionism\" and empowerment. 

 Aaaeeeee!  David Kirby will be speaking to the UK Houses of Parliament on June 4.  Why aaaeeeee?  Vaccine uptake in the UK fell after the  Wakefield fiasco  (more from Brian Deer  here  and  here ). Now the veracity-free Kirby is flying across the Pond to repeat more lies about the connection between vaccination and autism.  Orac's posts on the Kirby: Beware and Get Ready, UK --  One ,  Two ,  Three 

 

 
Well, so much for quick.  But I learned a new and handy phrase: \"vaccine rejectionism\".  I like it.

 \"CDC Whistleblower\"on autism: for beginners. 
 Back in 2004, a CDC epidemiology team published a paper, \" Age at first measles-mumps-rubella vaccination in children with autism and school-matched control subjects: A population-based study in metropolitan Atlanta.\"  (The paper is also called, \"the Destefano paper\", after the lead author.) 
 The paper was a case-control study. The gist of the paper is that vaccination with MMR was similar for the 624 autistic children and the 1824 non-autistic children. The paper was one more piece in the wall that reads: \"vaccination does not cause autism.\" 
 The authors were: DeStefano F, Bhasin TK, Thompson WW, Yeargin-Allsopp M, Boyle C. 
 Here is a photograph of Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, MD. This will become important later; you will see why. ( More about Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp ; link to her  95 published papers .) 
 Another author was \"Thompson WW\", or  William W. Thompson , also a CDC researcher. 
 Thompson WW has been a co-author with Destefano F on  nine other papers, dating back to 2000. . The most recent co-authored paper is the 2013 paper,  Number of antigens in early childhood vaccines and neuropsychological outcomes at age 7-10 years. 
 The 2004 paper was the only time Thompson WW was a co-author with Yeargin-Allsopp M. 
 This brings us to the present. There is a biochemist named Brian Hooker, PhD, who has an autistic son.  Dr. Hooker is convinced  (in face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary) that thimerosal in the vaccines caused his son's autism.  Hooker has filed numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suits to  compel the CDC to release allegedly damning evidence.   There was a long and confusing brouhaha ( one ,  two , three,  four ,  five ,  six ) over the anti-vaccine movement's strategizing, and Hooker's involvement, in the run-up to the November 29 2012  Congressional Autism Hearing , chaired by Rep. Issa ( another report on the hearing ). The short version: Hooker is not an unbiased scientist; he's a man with an agenda: to prove that somehow, someway that vaccines cause autism; the CDC knew this as early as 2000; and that people at CDC have concealed data with malicious intent. 
 On August 8, 2014, Hooker published his latest paper, \"Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination timing and autism among young African American boys: A reanalysis of CDC data\". This paper re-analyzed the dataset (designed as for a case-control study) used in deStefano paper, using a cohort methodology and a different and less subtle statistical test. This is technical stuff, but it's critical to the validity of Hooker's findings. What Hooker claims to have found: \" a 3.36-fold increased risk for autism in African-American males who received MMR vaccination before the age of 36 months\"   
 The anti-vaccine front group,  Focus Autism , published a press release on the Hooker paper, including the following claims: 
 
		 
					 
			 
				
 
 According to Dr. Hooker, the CDC whistleblower informant -- who wishes to remain anonymous -- guided him to evidence that a statistically significant relationship between the age the MMR vaccine was first given and autism incidence in African-American boys was hidden by CDC researchers. After data were gathered on 2,583 children living in Atlanta, Georgia who were born between 1986 and 1993, CDC researchers excluded children that did not have a valid State of Georgia birth certificate -- reducing the sample size being studied by 41%. Hooker explains that by introducing this arbitrary criteria into the analysis, the cohort size was sharply reduced, eliminating the statistical power of the findings and negating the strong MMR-autism link in African American boys. 
 Dr. Hooker has worked closely with the CDC whistleblower, and he viewed highly sensitive documents related to the study via Congressional request from U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The CDC documents from Congress and discussions that Hooker had with the whistleblower reveal widespread manipulation of scientific data and top-down pressure on CDC scientists to support fraudulent application of government policies on vaccine safety. Based on raw data used in the 2004 DeStefano et al study obtained under FOIA, Dr. Hooker found that the link between MMR vaccination and autism in African-American boys was obscured by the introduction of irrelevant and unnecessary birth certificate criteria -- ostensibly to reduce the size of the study. 
 
 Remember that one of the authors of the Destefano paper is an African-American woman. Hooker is labeling her a race traitor.  On August 19, 2014 \"Autism Media Channel\" published a YouTube video,  CDC Whistleblower Confesses to Autism-Vaccine Fraud.  This video features one Andrew Jeremy Wakefield, claiming that Hooker was motivated to undertake his research because he was contacted by an unnamed, but remorseful CDC researcher. 
 On August 22, 2014, Autism Media Channel published a second YouTube video,  CDC Whistleblower Revealed . In this video, the identity of the CDC researcher was revealed: William W. Thompson. The Autism Media Channel videos, narrated by Wakefield, are quite inflammatory in tone.  Wakefield compared the alleged coverup (to which Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp would have had to been a party) to the infamous  Tuskegee syphilis experiments , and in a later passage, to  
 
 \"You see, vile as the crimes of Stalin, Pol Pot and Hitler were, these men were not hypocrites.... These men were not entrusted with the welfare of their victims. Their mottos did not include the words, 'To save lives and protect.' They were not running a mandatory program disguised as caring. 
 \"How many children? How many went to the wall in that decade of silence? How many Presidents, Mr. Obama?\" 
 
 There are several distinct issues: 
 
 The quality of the Hooker paper on its own merits. That is, what is the quality of Hooker's reanalysis? In other words, is there any there there? 
 Let's say Thompson had legitimate concerns about the Destefano paper, especially with respect to an effect of the MMR on African American male toddlers. Is there any other plausible way that Thompson could have addressed his concerns?  
 The \"whistleblower\" aspect. The story behind Hooker's reanalysis of the Destefano dataset is the claim that Thompson contacted Hooker to reveal \"secret knowledge\" -- that the CDC covered up data -- and that Hooker was the best person for this \"whistleblowing\" to go on. 
 Turning back to the Hooker paper, is there any legitimacy to Hooker's claims that one, some subjects were improperly excluded; and two, unneccessary variables from the birth certificates were used to obscure real risks.  
 
 With respect to the first and fourth issues, a really thorough examination of Hooker's paper would require access to the CDC dataset  and   Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval  and  funding for such a study.  
 With respect to the second point.   For scientists in a given field such as epidemiology, there would be many channels to get a message out that there was a statistically significant signal that wasn't reported in a paper, such as the claim about the Destefano paper.  If you are an author on the paper, you could  talk to a lot of people at any conference you go to, or pick up the phone and call a colleague at a different institution. You could say, \"Hey, I know this is tough, but I need someone to get the word out on this so I can get a follow up study funded and put this question which really bothers me to rest. Would you please help me out?\" 
 With respect to the third point: we will have to await further revelations.

 August 22, 2014,  Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence :  Brian Hooker proves Andrew Wakefield wrong about vaccines and autism 
 Of course, the key finding in Brian Hooker’s paper is that Wakefield was wrong. Indeed, in this video, Wakefield even admits that he was mostly wrong about MMR and autism. Let that sink in again. He admits that he was mostly wrong about MMR and autism. OK, he says we were “partially right,” but the flip side of that is that he must have been mostly wrong. 
 
 August 22, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog:  Andrew Jeremy Wakefield plays video director while African-American Babies die, or something 
 Hooker is wrong in his assertions because the DeStefano paper did not leave out African-American children on purpose. Children were excluded from the analysis because of very legitimate and scientific reasons. They either were not the right age, did not have autism but some other neurodevelopment disorder, or were born outside of Georgia. Even if they were tossed into the analysis, DeStefano et al used a statistical analysis that took into account things like birth weight and mother’s age when analysing the data. They wanted to make sure that what they were seeing was most likely because of the MMR vaccine and not because of some other factor associated with autism. 
 
 August 23, 2014,  Ren at Epidemiological:  Directed Acyclic Graphs and the MMR vaccine doesn’t cause autism .
 I’m very skeptical that Dr. Hooker’s simplified statistical approach can be better than DeStefano et al’s approach of conditional logistic regression. Conditional logistic regression has the advantage of being able to control for a multitude of confounders and effect modifiers. 
 
 August 24, 2014, Liz Ditz at I Speak of Dreams:  L'affaire CDC-MMR: Hooker, Wakefield, and Focus Autism Accuse African-American Senior CDC Researcher of Being A Race Traitor 
 According to Hooker, Wakefield, and Focus Autism, a respected senior African-American physician-researcher is a race traitor and a mass murderer. 
 
 August 25, 2014, Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:  The central conspiracy theory of the antivaccine movement  
 I can imagine three main possibilities for what happened. The first possibility from what I know is that Thompson had some sort of disagreement with his co-investigators, made the incredibly stupid—yes, stupid—decision to unburden himself to Brian Hooker, who, he must have known or should have known, is an antivaccine crank associated with Andrew Wakefield, and is now paying the price for that decision... The second possibility is that Thompson wanted to correct something Hooker was doing with the data and somehow let himself be drawn into saying things that could easily be taken out of context. The third, and (I hope) much less likely, possibility is that Thompson’s gone off the deep end and gone antivaccine. 
 
 August 25,2014, David Gorski MD at Science Based Medicine:  Did a high ranking whistleblower really reveal that the CDC covered up proof that vaccines cause autism in African-American boys? 
 \"What [Hooker] has done, apparently, is found grist for a perfect conspiracy theory to demonize the CDC, play the race card in a truly despicable fashion, and cast fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the CDC vaccination program, knowing that most of the white antivaccine activists who support hate the CDC so much that they won’t notice that even Hooker’s reanalysis doesn’t support their belief that vaccines caused the autism in their children. Meanwhile, there is no evidence, at least none, submitted by the antivaccine propagandists flogging this conspiracy theory, that there really was a CDC conspiracy to hide anything. 
 
 August 25, 2014, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks,  Andrew Wakefield Tortures History  
 I want to focus on some statements made by one Andrew Wakefield, the British doctor who committed scientific fraud, resulting in the full retraction of his 1998 case series study on MMR and the stripping of his medical license. Wakefield boldly added himself to the list of not only torturing science, but now adds to his accomplishments torturing history and ethics (granted, we already knew he was ethically challenged). You see, in his videos (here and here) about the alleged \"whistleblower\", William Thompson,Wakefield compared the purported \"cover-up\" to the Tuskegee syphilis debacle. It's a false comparison used simply to inflame people and claim the race card. 
 
 August 25, 2014, Michael Simpson at Skeptical Raptor,  Great CDC Coverup–suppressing evidence that MMR vaccines cause autism?  cross-posted at  at Daily Kos 
 It’s clear what’s happening here. Thompson, through sheer ignorance or total incompetence may have had a conversation with Hooker. Given the fact that the antivaccination gang lacks any serious scientific evidence supporting their dogma that vaccines cause autism, they jump on anything, however tenuous, that makes it appear that all of the evidence that refutes their dogma should be thrown in the garbage. 
 
 August 26, 2014, Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:  Hey, where is everybody? The “CDC whistleblower” manufactroversy continues apace 
 Here it is, Tuesday already, and the antivaccine underground is still on full mental jacket alert over the biggest story the antivaccine movement has seen in a while. Fortunately, it’s a story that’s been largely ignored by the mainstream media, which tells me that maybe, just maybe, the mainstream media has figured out that it shouldn’t give undue credence to cranks. 
 
 August 26 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism, Atlanta,  MMR: serious questions and also how Brian Hooker and Andrew Wakefield are causing damage to the autism communties 
 A study relying largely on a small group of subjects (about 20) with the conclusion that more work is needed. Sounds vaguely familiar. And, as we will see, Mr. Hooker has teamed up with Andrew Wakefield to put out a video where they jump past the whole  this indicates more research is needed  through  this is absolute evidence of MMR causing autism  directly to  the CDC are engaging in a racist experiment sacrificing children to autism.  It’s like the events around Mr. Wakefield’s 1997 Lancet paper cranked up to 11. 
 
 August 26 2014,Lisa Lightner at Grounded Parents:  the CDC vaccines/autism/coverup theory {spoiler alert-it’s not true!} 
 
 a friend, a friend that I consider to be intelligent and reasonable….first posted a link to a CNN article. Correction–it’s iCNN…which is VERY different. ANYONE can post ANYTHING there. You can, really. It’s a crowdsourcing platform. Shame on you CNN for whoring out your name for page views. Because this is what happens–people will post just about anything..... 
 I wish we knew the causes of autism, I really do. But vaccines ain’t it. 
 Fear sells, don’t buy it. 
 
 
 August 26, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog:  How to end a scientist’s career with some fancy editing 
 As much as the anti-vaccine activists have been demanding that Dr. Thompson come out into the open and make some sort of a statement, no one seems to demand that Andrew Jeremy Wakefield and his team publish the entire recorded conversation between Brian Hooker and Dr. Thompson. All we get are lies and innuendo. We have operatives like Ginger Taylor writing on Twitter that CDC deliberately didn’t look at birth certificates for African-American babies in the DeStefano study.

 There's nothing like a good conspiracy theory to get the creative juices flowing. For actor Rob Schneider, that means getting your dander up over your incorrect belief that the CDC altered data to bury the \"fact\" that MMR causes autism. 
 
 August 27 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism:  Discussions of the recent MMR/autism paper (and why the study isn’t what the author wants you to believe it is) 
 Below are a selected list of discussions about Brian Hooker’s recent paper and the highly irresponsible way he and his team are promoting it. Let me know if you spot one I should add to the list. 
 
 August 27, 2014,  Orac Knows at Respectful Insolence:  The CDC “whistleblower” manufactroversy: Twitter parties and another “bombshell” e-mail 
 ... just how desperate the antivaccine movement is to have Brian Hooker’s incompetent “reanalysis” of a ten year old vaccine safety study and Andrew Wakefield’s despicable race-baiting video gain traction in the mainstream media. The failure of this conspiracy theory to do so is driving antivaccine activists into ever-greater fits of lunacy online. 
 
 August 27, 2014, Phil Plait at Bad Astronomy, Slate:  No, There Still Is No Connection Between Vaccines and Autism 
 There's a conspiracy theory going around that the CDC covered up a link between autism and vaccines. From what I can tell, this conspiracy theory is on the same level as the one that NASA faked the Moon landings. And you know how I feel about  that. 
 
 August 27, 2014, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks,  Anti-vaccine Activists Throw Twitter Tantrum 
 ... the hashtag #CDCwhistleblower to do what really amounted to the social media equivalent of a temper tantrum, whining about how the mainstream media is not reporting on the study. It was really a sad display, as they simply all copied and pasted from the same list of talking points, not even adding their own interpretation. 
 August 27, 2014, in the morning: The Journal Translational Neurodegeneration removes Hooker's paper from the public domain 
 
 August 27 2014, Sullivan (Matt Carey) at LeftBrainRightBrain Autism: The Brian Hooker article “…has been removed from the public domain because of serious concerns about the validity of its conclusions” 
 August 27, 2014, Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch:  Journal takes down autism-vaccine paper pending investigation 
 An article purporting to find that black children are at substantially increased risk for autism after early exposure to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine has been shelved, amid claims that a CDC whistleblower has accused health officials of suppressing information about the link. 
 
 August 27, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog: Even the bottom-feeding journals seem to have some sense
 ’m still left wondering how this paper got through peer review, or who did the peer review. They seem to not have bothered with checking the biostatistics or with looking back at the DeStefano paper. 
 A ugust 27, 2014, at approximately 2:30 pm, PDT, attorneys for William W. Thompson, the CDC employee,  publish Thompson's statement 
 
 August 27, 2014: Ren at Epidemiological  Dr. Brian S. Hooker gets the Andrew Wakefield treatment .
 My problem with Dr. Thompson’s statement is that the data were not omitted willy-nilly. There was a protocol that was established, and it excluded from the analysis children of different ethnicities, not just African Americans. In that exclusion, a vaccine-autism signal that was confounded by different factors was lost. It wasn’t lost out of bias but out of properly adjusting for different factors. 
 
 August 27, 2014, Debra Goldschmidt, CNN,  Journal questions validity of autism and vaccine study 
 Dr. Frank DeStefano, lead author of the 2004 study, said he and his colleagues stand by their findings. DeStefano said all the study authors, including Thompson, agreed on the analysis and interpretation before the study was submitted for publication 10 years ago. However, he said he plans to review his notes and will decide whether to run another analysis on the data. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Sullivan at LeftbrainRightBrain  Andrew Wakefield betrays another “whistleblower” with Brian Hooker helping 
 Apparently Mr. Hooker is unaware that the secrecy of confession is absolute. Priests, real ones, not self appointed ones like Mr. Hooker, have been known to go to jail rather than divulge what they’ve been told in confession. Real priests don’t record confessions so they can betray another. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog,  Autism is not death, unless you want it to be  
 While the black ribbon can mean different things to different people, it’s main use is for grieving or remembering the fallen, the dead. The way that these people have used it is to try to bring attention to their cause by equating autism with a death or a loss. 
 
 August 28, 2014, ToddW at Harpocrates Speaks: CDC Whistleblower William Thompson Breaks Silence
 Thompson's statement certainly casts Wakefield/Hooker in a not all that surprising light. At the very least, it calls into question their claims and behavior. But it does not exonerate Thompson, either. Despite his claims that he supports vaccination and that he would not suggest parents avoid immunizing their children, Thompson's actions were incredibly irresponsible. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Orac at Respectful Insolence  A bad day for antivaccinationists: A possible retraction, and the “CDC whistleblower” issues a statement 
 Betrayals within betrayals. This can’t all be laid on Wakefield. Thompson was played. Big time. 
 
 August 28,2014, Mike Siegel at Mike's Meandering Mind:  Mathematical Malpractice Watch: Torturing the Data 
 You can’t pick and choose little bits of data to support your theory. You have to be able to account for all of it. And you have to be aware of how often spurious results pop up even in the most objective and well-designed studies, especially when you parse the data finer and finer. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Ari Brown MD at Parents   Vaccines. Autism. Are We Done With This Yet? 
 What makes good science? Independent researchers study the same hypothesis and draw the same conclusions. The study in question came out in 2004, and was certainly not the only or definitive study done on the safety of the MMR vaccine. Believe me, the MMR vaccine has been studied repeatedly by researchers all over the world since the Modern Vaccine War began in 1998. Good science shows there is no association between the MMR vaccine and autism. Period. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Alice Park at Time.com:  Whistleblower Claims CDC Covered Up Data Showing Vaccine-Autism Link\"> 
 ...any time scientists take the original population of participants in a study, however large, and drill down to analyze trends in a subgroup – in this case the African-American boys – the power of the associations they find dwindles. 
 
 August 28, 2014, Liz Klimas at The Blaze:  Researcher Says CDC ‘Chose to Cover Up’ Data Linking Autism With Vaccines…but There’s More to the Story 
 However, the CDC and other researchers in the field defend the initial presentation of the data and even call into question the analysis conducted in Hooker’s study. 
 
 August 29, 2014, Reuben Gaines at The Poxes Blog:  Working in the Quote Mine 
 
 Of course, the moms are not the only ones lying by omission about this whole thing. Plenty of anti-vaccine people online have been flooding comments sections of blogs with falsehoods. They say that data were omitted when they weren’t. Others said that Dr. Thompson was escorted off the CDC campus when was not. And, of course, the loonier of the loons are blaming everything from the Illuminati to the Reptilians for this. 
 The worst of the worst, however, keep using racially-charged language over this, and they keep stoking something that I’m sure not even they want to see catch on fire. 
 
 
 August 29, 2014, Orac at Respectful Insolence:  The CDC whistleblower William W. Thompson: Final (for now) roundup and epilogue 
 I conclude as I began, by asking “What now?” It’s obvious that the antivaccine contingent will flog this story for all it’s worth as long as they can, but fortunately the mainstream press doesn’t appear to be getting the message. It’s also clear that Hooker will continue to crank out incompetently performed epidemiological papers that torture the data until they confess a relationship between vaccines and autism 
 
 August 31, 2014, Amanda Z. Naprawa at The Vaccine Advocate:  Whistleblowers and Story Tellers 
 Ok. So we have a study by several epidemiologists in 2004 that concludes MMR does not cause autism. Then we have a 2014 study (under investigation by the journal that published it) by a biochemical engineer that reviews the same data and finds a connection for African-American boys. And this reanalysis is undertaken by a guy who has an agenda. I’m no epidemiologist, but I know that researcher bias is a big fat red flag when looking at the reliability and validity of a study. And moreover, his study had a different design than the original one which can, naturally, lead to different results. So based on this, we have to question his findings. But what is important to note, is that even Hooker can’t find a relationship between vaccines and autism in most children. Just black boys. And even for them: there’s no relationship between getting the vaccine and autism. Just between the ages of 24 and 36 months. 
 
 August 31, 2014, Dov Michaeli at The Doctor Weighs In:  Liars, Damn Liars, and Statistics: The Autism-Vaccine Fraud  
 What’s wrong with this paper? Statistics, for starters. Post-hoc subgroup analysis is fraught with risks too numerous to detail here. Suffice it to say that confounding factors fall into the “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns” categories. Multiple logistic regression analysis can can ferret some, but not all, such problems. It is puzzling then that Hooker chose to use extremely simplified contingency statistics (chi square) that are far more prone to false positives, since they’re less capable of isolating out confounding factors than the multiple logistic regression. 
 
 August 31, 2014, Sullivan at LeftBrainRightBrain:  Comment on: Expression of Concern: Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination timing and autism among young African American boys: a reanalysis of CDC data 
 In this case, it isn’t that Mr. Hooker’s decisions are poor (they are), it’s that his choices show that he has a rather strong ideological stance on vaccines and the CDC. One which the editors of his recent article likely wish Mr. Hooker had disclosed when he submitted his paper. 
 
 September 1, 2014, Russell Saunders at the Daily Beast:  Anti-Vaxxers Have a New Hero 
 In short, not only did experts outside of the CDC verify the original study, but Dr. Hooker’s new paper likely reaches the findings it does because he uses the wrong kind of analysis for the data set....So not only were whatever qualms Dr. Thompson had insufficient to have him remove his name from the original study, they were neither enough to make him speak out publicly in the decade since nor have him willingly attach his name to any effort to debunk it. Not a lot of air tooting that whistle, no matter what the video would lead viewers to believe. 
 
 September 1, 2014, Orac at Respectful Insolence:  The CDC whistleblower William W. Thompson: One last word 
 
 I was unexpectedly contacted by Rick Morgan, William Thompson’s lawyer... he stated that he understood that I thought Thompson either had a beef with his co-investigators or had gone off the deep end. However, he wanted to “plant a seed” that maybe—just maybe—there might be another explanation, that this had been torturing Thompson all these years and he just had to do something because he couldn’t take it any more. 
 And maybe that is true. I have no way of knowing. I do know that, whatever his motivation, Thompson had done horrible damage and almost certainly endangered African American children to suffer from measles who might not have contracted it otherwise. 
 
 
 September 1, 2014, Sullivan at LeftBrainRightBrain:  If this is what keeps a CDC researcher up at night, how would they ever keep a huge conspiracy going? 
 Think about that. A single result, one which many people agreed didn’t need to be discussed, was held back and this CDC researcher struggled with that decision for a decade. But he and his colleagues are just going along with what is supposedly the biggest cover-up in history? 
 
 September 1, 2014, David Gorski at Science-Based Medicine:  The CDC Whistleblower Saga: Updates, Backlash, and (I hope) a Wrap-up 
 Now imagine if there had been a real conspiracy to suppress compelling evidence indicating that vaccines cause autism. In that case, there wouldn’t just be a single man torturing himself over decisions made, as Thompson, if we believe Morgan, apparently has. It would be men and women at every level of the CDC. If the CDC couldn’t “keep Thompson quiet” over this, if Thompson was willing to risk destroying his career over a small subgroup analysis with almost certainly spurious results that weren’t followed-up on when he thought they should be, imagine what would happen if real data demonstrating a strong link between vaccines and autism had been covered up. There would be Bill Thompsons crawling out of the woodwork everywhere, beginning not long after the cover-up began.

Wow!  The Trib Gets It Right
" "
 photo credit- Todd Baker Creative Commons license Almost exactly two years ago I wrote  two posts   regarding how the Chicago Tribune was allowing non-factual gibberish to be published under its masthead thru the online in house blog of  Julie Deardorff , and how it was abdicating its  journalistic responsibility .  I was afraid at the time that this was to be indicative of what would pass for \"investigative journalism\" at mainstream, formerly powerhouse, papers (and other media outlets). I am happy to say that I was wrong. In May the Tribune published very good investigative pieces on  Dr. Mark and David Geier , as well as a local  Chicago quack by the name of  Dr. Mayer Eisenstein . Now this month there are two more articles on autism and quackery, detailing how  risky therapies have little basis in science , and  how legitimate researchers have seen their findings twisted  by those  who would fleece money from unsuspecting parents. All of these recent articles are the product of reporters  Trine Tsouderos  and  Patricia Callahan . I must say that I am impressed with the quality and consistency of these articles.  No false balancing of legitimate science with BS pseudoscience.  No confusing association of two events with causation.  Just a thorough investigation of the underlying science, and painstaking digging through all of the \"scientific sounding\" but totally bogus claims of those out there that would fleece desperate parents out of their time and money. If these two reporters keep up such great work, we just might see the rise of mainstream newspapers again.

I hope that will change. —

			 Updated with new blog posts & requests from bloggers formerly designated as \"anonymous\". So naturally the numbers change as well. 
    
 Yesterday (November 16, 2010), the Age of Autism blog published a  phantasmagoria  by J. B. Handley, asserting that the  blogger known as Sulliva n is in fact Bonnie Offit MD, the wife of  Paul Offit MD . 
 In that post, Handley wrote: 
 I’m personally convinced, I think Bonnie Offit is Sullivan. 
 Today (November 17, 2010), Mr. Handley  posted this comment

 I'll attend to just the first two sentences: 
 One of the more enjoyable parts of kicking the hornet's nest is watching the Keyboard Courage Club, aka anonymous bloggers, all get together to defend one of their own. It's a society of chicken-shits. 
 Two points: 
 
 Is  anonymous  the same as  pseudonymous?     
 How many of the bloggers who challenged Mr. Handly's phantasmagoria are in fact -- well, not blogging using their legal names?  
 
 I'm going to tackle the second point first, and leave the first for another post.  Let's look at the evidence to date: 
 As of November 17, 2010, at 6:39 Pacific Standard Time (PST)  November 18 at 8:05 pm  there are  eighteen  twenty responses to Mr. Handley's assertions:

 Let's review.  Hmmn.  Mr. Handley asserted that  \"anonymous bloggers\" were responding to his post.  So far,    9/18 = 50%  9/20 =45%  of bloggers responding did so under their own names.   As the Mythbusters would say, \"probably busted.\"   We aren't done yet.  What about the other  eight?  eleven? 
 
 Orac at Respectful Insolence  I am Bonnie Offit 
 
 Orac's relationship to David Gorski, MD is well-known.  In fact, at the blog Age of Autism Mr. Handley himself  made a big deal out of their relationship,  as did Jake Crosby at the same site in  an effort to threaten Dr. Gorski's employmen t. 
 So we are up to  10/18 = 55.55%.   10/20=50% Progress!  Even closer to busted. 
 Next: 
 
 Kev at LeftBrain/RightBrain  I am Bonnie Offit 
 Kev  at LeftBrain RightBrain  Society vs. Individuals 
 
 Who is Kev? He is Kevin Leitch;  his real-life identity is well-known to the folk at Age of Autism,  as this scurrilous post reveals . 
 So we are up to  12/18 = 66.66%.   12/20=60%   Even closer to busted.  Creeping up on busted! 
 Who is left?  Are they truly anonymous? 
 
 Catherina at JusttheVax  I am Bonnie Offit 
 Science Mom at JusttheVax  I'm Really Bonnie Offit 
 Todd W at Silenced by Age of Autism  I am Bonnie Offit! 
 Laura at Life at The House That Asperger's built  I am Bonnie Offit

 Are these people  anonymous  or  pseudonymous?   Let's take them on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 Catherina at JusttheVax -- she and her blogging partner, ScienceMom, were long-time commenters at sites such as Respectful Insolence.   They began their blogging career in April, 2009    
 Science Mom at JusttheVax  I'm Really Bonnie Offit  They have an email address,  justthevax@gmail.com , to which they respond [personal evidence]  
 
 My call?  Pseudonymous, and therefore the count is up to 14/20 = 70%.  Even closer to busted. 
 
 Todd W. is a long-time commenter at sites such as Bad Astronomy.    He has a website,  The Truth About the Evils of Vaccination  and a blog,  Silenced by Age of Autism  , to track comments that were moderated out of existence at the Age of Autism site, and  an email address to which he responds . [personal evidence] 
 
 My call?  Pseudonymous, and therefore the count is up to 16/20 = 80%.  Even closer to busted. 
 Next: 
 
 Sheldon at Vaccines Work  He Who Pays the Piper--I am Bonnie Offit 
 
 Sheldon is a long-time commenter at the Huffington Post (as Sheldon101), and other sites.  In October 2009 he started a blog to curate his comments, some of which were, well, moderated out of existence. (Is there a pattern here?) He has a  revealing about page , including  an email address  to which he replies [personal evidence] 
 My call?  Pseudonymous, and therefore the count is up to 17/20 = 85%.  Even closer to busted. 
 Although I don't know MJ myself, I know people who know him in real life and vouch for his identity. 
 
 MJ at Autism Jabberwocky  When Age of Autism Attacks 
 
 My call?  Pseudonymous, and therefore the count is up to 18/20 = 90%.  Even closer to busted. 
  
 
 Laura at Life at The House That Asperger's Built 
 
 Laura has an  informative about page , but no contact information. I'm putting her in the \"anonymous\" category. 
 
 Travis at the Pretend Biologist  I am Bonnie Offit 
 
 Travis also has an  informative about page  but not contact information.  For that reason I am also putting him  in the \"anonymous\" category. 
 
 Both Laura and Travis have left comments that indicate they don't think of themselves as \"anonymous\" so I'm adding them to a new category: blogs under a partial version of real name: 
 
 Laura at Life at The House That Asperger's built  I am Bonnie Offit 
 Travis at the Pretend Biologist  I am Bonnie Offit 
 
 Final count?  20/20 = 100%  
 That is strong enough to call 
 Mr. Handley's assertion is totally and completely busted. 
   
 Oh, and about Mr. Handley's comment that 
 
 ...anonymous bloggers, It's a society of chicken-shits. 
   
 
 Well, Mr. Handley, how about  your  anonymous (and vulgar) comments? 
 These are his most recent  (the ISP has been verified as Handley's):

"21411" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/04/13/the-john-best-junior-thread/" "The John Best Junior Thread" "For some time now, John (aka ForeSam to the uninitiated) has been crying that he’s been banned from this blog and been using that ban as an excuse. I’ve decided to call his bluff. For this thread, and this thread only, John will be free to argue, debate, insult, rage, pontificate and generally be the John Best we know and love.  In this thread will be discussing the following: 1) John’s belief that Eli Lilly invented autism in 1931. John says autism did not exist before Jan 1st 1931. 
2) John’s belief that all autism is mercury poisoning from thiomersal in vaccines. 
3) John’s belief that there was no autism in China prior to 1999. John says autism did not exist in China until Jan 1st 1999. 
4) John’s role as speaker at mercury militia marches and his position with Generation Rescue 
5) John’s opinion on homosexuality, which he believes is ‘a perversion’, and his subsequent opinion of David Kirby. 
6) John’s belief that as an adult male, fist fighting with his eight year old autistic son is a sign of good parenting. 
7) John’s belief that there has been an epidemic of autism. 
8) John’s belief that because Dan Olmsted didn’t find any autistic Amish, this proves thiomersal causes autism. 
9) John’s belief that it is acceptable to state that women he disagree’s with should be ‘horsewhipped’ 
10) John’s belief that phoning people he disagree’s with at their homes to abuse with them is acceptable. 
11) John’s belief that the word ‘muslim’ is interchangable with the word ‘terrorist’. Go for it. Either now, or wait for the man himself to defend himself.  Just remember that John is typical member of the thiomersal/autim connection. I of course am open to correction on that from other believers of the thiomersal/autism connection along with an explanation of why. Also remember John is a fully ‘paid up’ Generation Rescue Rescue Angel and his views on _all_ the above should be taken as representative of that organisation, unless of course, anyone from that org would like to deny John’s involvement with them on record.

"21089" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/01/another-wakefield-paper-retracted/" "Another Wakefield paper retracted" "Following the  retraction  by  The Lancet  of Mr. Wakefield’s “landmark” 1998 paper, many speculated as to if and when other retractions would follow.   The patient pool Mr. Wakefield relied upon for his study was very biased by the referral process.  Also, Mr. Wakefield’s team was working without ethical approval for many of the children studied.  The natural question to follow is not  if  The Lancet should retract, but how many papers by Mr. Wakefield’s team were also tainted and  should  be retracted. The American Journal of Gastroenterology has retracted a paper  from 2000 by Mr. Wakefield’s team:  Enterocolitis in Children With Developmental Disorders . Here is the notice: Retraction: Enterocolitis in Children With Developmental Disorders 
 A J Wakefield, A Anthony, S H Murch, M Thomson, S M Montgomery, S Davies, J J O’Leary, M Berelowitz and J A Walker-Smith 
 Am J Gastroenterol 2000; 95:2285–2295 
 On 28 January 2010, the UK General Medical Council’s Fitness to Practice Panel raised concerns about a paper published in the Lancet by Dr Wakefield et al. (1). The main issues were that the patient sample collected was likely to be biased and that the statement in the paper, that the study had local ethics committee approval, was false. There was also the possibility of a serious conflict of interest in the interpretation of the data. The Lancet has now retracted this paper (1). This paper in the American Journal of Gastroenterology (AJG) (2) also includes the 12 patients in the original Lancet article and therefore we retract this AJG paper from the public record.

"22405" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/10/04/xmrv-false-positive-in-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/" "XMRV: False Positive in chronic fatigue syndrome" "Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus ( XMRV ) has been suggested as linked to chronic fatigue syndrome and autism.  This has been rather controversial in both cases. Before we get to the “false positive” report, Science published one of the papers on XMRV and chronic fatigue syndrome  Murine leukemia viruses (MLV), including xenotropic-MLV-related virus (XMRV), have been controversially linked to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). To explore this issue in greater depth, we compiled coded replicate samples of blood from 15 subjects previously reported to be XMRV/MLV-positive (14 with CFS) and from 15 healthy donors previously determined to be negative for the viruses. These samples were distributed in a blinded fashion to nine laboratories which performed assays designed to detect XMRV/MLV nucleic acid, virus replication, and antibody. Only two laboratories reported evidence of XMRV/MLVs; however, replicate sample results showed disagreement and reactivity was similar among CFS subjects and negative controls. These results indicate that current assays do not reproducibly detect XMRV/MLV in blood samples and that blood donor screening is not warranted.  Reminds me of the  Hornig study  trying to find measles RNA in autistic children’s intestinal tissues.  Multiple laboratories.  No link found. But, what of the older studies claiming a link?  Well, Science also has a short article from some of the authors in an earlier paper.  They reexamined samples from their study and found that their samples were contaminated with XMRV plasmid DNA: Failure to Confirm XMRV/MLVs in the Blood of Patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Multi-Laboratory Study . In our 23 October 2009 Report, “Detection of an infectious retrovirus, XMRV, in blood cells of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome,” two of the coauthors, Silverman and Das Gupta, analyzed DNA samples from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients and healthy controls. A reexamination by Silverman and Das Gupta of the samples they used shows that some of the CFS peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA preparations are contaminated with XMRV plasmid DNA.” Again, this is very reminiscent.   In testimony for the Omnibus Autism Proceeding,  Stephen Bustin   discussed contamination  (and other) problems with the laboratory searching for measles virus in the samples provided by Andrew Wakefield’s group. Science ran another article,  False Positive , on the XMRV/chronic fatigue story: For the past 2 years, a controversy has roiled around the purported link between a mouse retrovirus, XMRV, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a baffling, debilitating disease with no known origin. An October 2009 paper in Science found XMRV in the blood of two-thirds of the CFS patients examined, but more than a dozen labs have failed to replicate it to date. Millions of dollars have gone into clarifying the question, which has had far-reaching consequences for people with CFS and, if the virus lurked in the blood supply, the public at large. A nine-lab study published online this week by Science found that none of the labs could reproducibly detect XMRV or relatives of the virus in blood samples distributed under a blinded code. Science is also running a partial retraction of the original paper, as a contributing lab found that it in fact had a contamination.  More discussion can be found at the blog A Photon in the Darkness as  Mikovits XMRV Study “Partial Retraction”  and at  ERV  as  XMRV and chronic fatigue syndrome: For your enjoyment– A magic trick . Other studies have already looked closely and found no evidence of a link:  PCR and serology find no association between xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) and autism .   The current articles in Science do not directly address autism, but they show the serious difficulties involved with studying XMRV and help us to understand how these potential links were made in the first place.

			 The short answer is no, there is not one physician; the person who did most to uncover Wakefield's fraudulent research is a UK investigative journalist, Brian Deer.  
 Here's the claim: 
 
 Wakefied's research never claimed vaccines cause Autism. His research showed that vaccines cause intestinal damage that led to leaky gut syndrome which allowed toxins to enter the bloodstream and brain, And THAT is what caused Autism. The doctor that supposedly debunked his research 
 
 Is there one doctor who, single-handedly, \"supposedly debunked\" Wakefield's research? No.  
 Was there a lengthy investigation by the British medical establishment of Wakefield's conduct as a physician? Yes.  ( Here  and  here , for starters.)

In this case, the discussion focuses on the original histopathology report/scoring sheets from Prof. Dhillon (co-author on the original Lancet article).  Four articles are presented. A special report by investigative journalist Brian Deer (Pathology reports solve new bowel disease riddle),  an editorial by BMJ editor Fiona Godlee  (Failings over the MMR scare may need parliamentary inquiry), a commentary by Ingvar Bjarnason, professor of digestive diseases, consultant physician and gastroenterologist, King’s College Hospital, London (Commentary: We came to an overwhelming and uniform opinion that these reports do not show colitis) and another commentary by Karel Geboes, professor of Pathology KU Leuven (I see no convincing evidence of enterocolitis, colitis, or a unique disease process). The first sentence of Mr. Wakefield’s now retracted 1998 Lancet article was “ Background  We investigated a consecutive series of children with chronic enterocolitis and regressive developmental disorder. ”  Based on review of these newly released reports, there is “not convincing evidence of enterocolitis” or colitis at all. Below is the press release for this set of articles in BMJ: MMR fraud needs parliamentary inquiry, says BMJ, as new information puts spotlight on Wakefield’s co-authors 
 
Editorial: Failings over the MMR scare may need parliamentary inquiry 
Special report: Pathology reports solve new bowel disease riddle 
Commentary: We came to an overwhelming and uniform opinion that these reports do not show colitis 
Commentary: I see no convincing evidence of enterocolitis, colitis, or a unique disease process 
 Britain s leading medical journal, the BMJ, is calling on MPs to launch a parliamentary inquiry into research which claimed that the MMR vaccine causes autism and bowel disease, following extraordinary new disclosures about what it calls the elaborate fraud behind the work of Andrew Wakefield. 
 In an editorial in the journal, BMJ editor-in-chief Dr Fiona Godlee says that at least six further research papers by Wakefield require independent investigation and that at least six former senior figures at the London medical school where the work was carried out may have a case to answer over their involvement. 
 In a letter sent to Andrew Miller MP, chair of the House of Commons committee on science and technology, Dr Godlee says that if University College London, where Wakefield worked, does not immediately convene an independent inquiry into the Wakefield affair, then parliament must intervene. 
 “Institutional misconduct is too important to be left to the institutions themselves,” she says. 
 In May 2010, Wakefield, formerly a researcher at the Royal Free medical school in Hampstead, north London, was struck off the medical register over a raft of charges, including dishonesty in research published in the Lancet in 1998.  And last January, the BMJ concluded that his claims linking MMR vaccine with autism and bowel disease were an elaborate fraud. 
 Now, the journal publishes further revelations about the research, removing any remaining credibility to the claim that Wakefield and his co-authors had discovered a new inflammatory bowel disease associated with MMR. Experts studying unpublished raw data submitted to the BMJ with a view to exonerating Wakefield say it provides no evidence of such disease and that almost entirely normal findings were misreported in the Lancet paper. 
 Published in February 1998, the paper claimed that 8 of 12 children with brain problems seen at the Royal Free hospital developed autism within days of MMR, and that 11 of the 12 had colitis.  The paper triggered a decade-long storm of public anxiety, plummeting levels of vaccination, and the re-emergence of measles as an endemic disease in Britain and elsewhere. 
 This new information does nothing to exonerate Wakefield of fraud but nor does it reflect well on his 12 authors, says Godlee. “It is impossible to reconcile [the new data] with what was published in the Lancet. The paper talks of enterocolitis and a new bowel disease involving a putative unique disease process.  How could two consultant histopathologists have reported healthy biopsies and then put their names to such a text?” 
 The BMJ has been at the forefront of investigating the MMR scare, and earlier this year Dr Godlee wrote to University College London reporting six more papers involving Wakefield which have aroused concerns.  She believes that a continuing failure to get to the bottom of the vaccine scandal raises serious questions about the prevailing culture of our academic institutions and attitudes to the integrity of their output. Given the extent of involvement of senior personnel at the highest level, only an independent inquiry will be credible, she says.  
 “This is not a call to debate whether MMR causes autism,” says Godlee. “Science has asked that question and answered it. We need to know what happened in this inglorious chapter in medicine. Who did what, and why?” 
 In an accompanying feature article published on bmj.com today, investigative journalist Brian Deer explains what the latest revelations add to our knowledge of the Wakefield saga. He also reveals that UCL included Wakefield s claims – not once but twice – in its submission to the UK s research assessment exercise as part of a bid for money. 
 “If UCL does not immediately initiate an externally-led review of its role in the vaccine scare, we believe that parliament should do it,” concludes Godlee. “After the effort and time it has taken to crack the secrets of the MMR scare, and the enormous harm it has caused to public health, it would compound the scandal not to heed the warnings from this catastrophic example of wrongdoing.”

			 This putative list of 28 papers was originally published (to the best of my ability to ascertain) on Joe Mercola's site as a part of his interview with Andrew Wakefield in April, 2010.  The list has returned to circulation recently, so it deserves another look. 
 Of the 28 papers, two (#18 and #22) are repeat citations, bringing the number down to 26. Wakefield's retracted Lancet paper was published on February 28, 1998. Any papers published prior to that date cannot be said to \"support\" or \"replicate\" his work. The list of 26 includes three papers (#5, #16, and #17) published well before the Lancet paper, so the list is down to 23. 
 Of the remaining 23 papers, #s 2, 3, 4, 18, and 19 have Wakefield as a co-author. So we are down to 18 papers.    
 Of those 18 papers, #9 was published by a journal Wakefield edited; #20  included Wakefield's co-authors on the retracted Lancet paper; and #27 is closely associated with Wakefield's Texas clinic, Thoughtful House None represent independent replication or support of Wakefield's research.  So the list is down to 15 papers. Remember what the retracted Lancet paper claimed,  
 \" We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.\" 
 Of the remaining 15 papers, #s 1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 24,25, 26, and 28 discussed some aspect of gut disfunction in autistic individuals but did not mention measles virus or measles vaccines.  These 10 papers do not, therefore, \"replicate\" or \"support\" the retracted Lancet paper or Walkfield's research.  the list is down to 5 papers. Of those 5 papers, #6 and 11 are by one researcher.    #14 is a speculative paper in a dodgy journal on the author's belief that autism is an occult tetanus infection. #15 discusses a treatment modality. #23 discusses metabolic variations in autistic adults.  Paper #6 does mention autism and measles, but there is  sound reason to believe that what the authors found was laboratory contamination , not measles virus. 
 In short, the list of 28 doesn't \"support Dr. Wakefield's Research\".

Gastrointestinal abnormalities in children with autistic disorder. J Pediatr. 1999 Nov;135(5):559-63. A case series study on 36 autistic children with pre-existing gastrointestinal symptoms found that many had unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption. This study did not look for measles virus. Instead it looks at gastrointestinal (GI) malabsoption as an underlying mechanism for autism. The study is uncontrolled; that it, it did not include autistic children without GI symptoms, nor did include non-autistic children who had similar GI symptoms. Most of the autistic children in the study upper GI problems such as reflux. This articles in no way “replicates” or “supports” Wakefield’s “findings”, which have been shown repeatedly to have been manufactured or the result of laboratory contamination. \"Autistic enterocolitis\" was not found.

A single case study (that is, one autistic child), from which the authors launch into the (unsupported) hypothesis that many children with autism have celiac disease, or subclinical \"gluten sensitivity\", and either of these conditions may cause micro-nutrient deficiencies and bowel distress. Further, they hypothesize that such children's behavior normalizes when fed a gluten-free diet. No mention of the measles vaccine or persistence of vaccine-strain measles in the gut. Not a support to Wakefield's claims.

Gastrointestinal symptoms in a sample of children with pervasive developmental disorders. J Autism Dev Disord. 2009 Mar;39(3):405-13. Epub 2008 Sep 13. This study looked at 172 autistic children, who were classified (in a non-specific way) as having GI problems or not having GI problems. Only 23% had GI problems, mostly constipation and diarrhea. Those with GI problems were no different from subjects without GI problems in demographic characteristics, measures of adaptive functioning, or autism symptom severity. Compared to autistic children without GI problems, those with GI problems showed greater symptom severity on measures of irritability, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Those with GI problems were also less likely to respond to treatment. There is a glaring weakness in this study: one is that there was not a \"typically developing, but with matched GI problems\" wing, to see if the GI problems alone would account for the differences. With respect to \"replicating\" or \"supporting\" Wakefield's research, the study did not look for measles virus, nor did study look for mumps or rubella virus. .

One: this paper entered the publication stream in advance of Wakefield's now-withdrawn paper, so it is hard to say how it supports or builds on Wakefield's now-discredited findings. Two: this paper is a wild surmise about antibiotic use in children later diagnosed with autism, and builds a cloud-castle about autism symptoms are really the result of a subacute, chronic tetanus infection. No actual data about finding tetanus in blood samples from autistic individuals are presented. In short, this is a fairytale, and in way ”replicates” or “supports” Wakefield’s “findings”.

Second, this is a short, letter to the editor type report on the investigation of alpha-1-antitrypsin levels in 8 children with autism vs in children with untreated and treated celiac disease and control children. Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor (meaning it inhibits the functions of enzymes involved in metabolism). The Walker-Smith letter found levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin in children with autism and celiac disease to similar. The letter did not mention the MMR vaccine; the vaccine was not used in the UK until 1988.

Second, it was published the year that the MMR vaccine was licensed in the US and 17 years before it was licensed in the UK. As the paper predates the wide use of the US. At the time, the DSM-II was in effect, \"autism\" was not a separate diagnostic category, but was characterized as \"Schizophrenia, childhood type\". This paper was an early attempt at finding distinguishing features between childhood autism and adult schizophrenia using a number of challenges and physiological measurements. One minor element in the paper is that \"malabsorption\" may lead to autistic behavior. In no way “replicates” or “supports” Wakefield’s “findings”

According to Catarina Becker at  JustTheVax , this citation resolves to a 2005 meeting abstract that has never been published a peer-reviewed journal. The abstract discussed nine autistic adult males with GI symptoms, who were evaluated for GI disease. Study did not look for measles virus, nor did study look for mumps or rubella virus. Study did not evaluate changes in gut structure. In no way “replicates” or “supports” Wakefield’s “findings”

 Myself on December 3 2013,  A List of 28 Studies from Around the World that Support Dr. Wakefield’s Research  
 
 The claim: 
 
 Dr. Wakefied's research never claimed vaccines cause Autism. His research showed that vaccines cause intestinal damage that led to leaky gut syndrome which allowed toxins to enter the bloodstream and brain, And THAT is what caused Autism. The doctor that supposedly debunked his research was funded by Merck, the manufacturer of the MMR and was related to Rupert Murdoch who obviously controls lots of the mainstream media. This man was also convicted of embezzling CDC funds.  Over two dozen studies have since confirmed what Wakefields studies have shown. 
 
 Note that the newest paper on this list is from 2009. Since then, there have been approximately 11,000 papers published on the subject of autism;  you would think that whoever has drawn up this list could find one or two to add to the list. 
 (repost of my December 2013 post, for those who have difficulty clicking links) 
   
   
 
		 
					 
			 
				
   
   
 This putative list of 28 papers was originally published (to the best of my ability to ascertain) on Joe Mercola's site as a part of his interview with Andrew Wakefield in April, 2010.  The list has returned to circulation recently, so it deserves another look. 
 Of the 28 papers, two (#18 and #22) are repeat citations, bringing the number down to 26. Wakefield's retracted Lancet paper was published on February 28, 1998. Any papers published prior to that date cannot be said to \"support\" or \"replicate\" his work. The list of 26 includes three papers (#5, #16, and #17) published well before the Lancet paper, so the list is down to 23. 
 Of the remaining 23 papers, #s 2, 3, 4, 18, and 19 have Wakefield as a co-author. So we are down to 18 papers.    
 Of those 18 papers, #9 was published by a journal Wakefield edited; #20  included Wakefield's co-authors on the retracted Lancet paper; and #27 is closely associated with Wakefield's Texas clinic, Thoughtful House None represent independent replication or support of Wakefield's research.  So the list is down to 15 papers. Remember what the retracted Lancet paper claimed,  
 \" We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.\" 
 Of the remaining 15 papers, #s 1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 24,25, 26, and 28 discussed some aspect of gut disfunction in autistic individuals but did not mention measles virus or measles vaccines.  These 10 papers do not, therefore, \"replicate\" or \"support\" the retracted Lancet paper or Walkfield's research.  the list is down to 5 papers. Of those 5 papers, #6 and 11 are by one researcher.    #14 is a speculative paper in a dodgy journal on the author's belief that autism is an occult tetanus infection. #15 discusses a treatment modality. #23 discusses metabolic variations in autistic adults.  Paper #6 does mention autism and measles, but there is  sound reason to believe that what the authors found was laboratory contamination , not measles virus. 
 In short, the list of 28 doesn't \"support Dr. Wakefield's Research\".

A case series study on 36 autistic children with pre-existing gastrointestinal symptoms found that many had unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption. This study did not look for measles virus. Instead it looks at gastrointestinal (GI) malabsoption as an underlying mechanism for autism. The study is uncontrolled; that it, it did not include autistic children without GI symptoms, nor did include non-autistic children who had similar GI symptoms. Most of the autistic children in the study upper GI problems such as reflux.

Gastrointestinal symptoms in a sample of children with pervasive developmental disorders. J Autism Dev Disord. 2009 Mar;39(3):405-13. Epub 2008 Sep 13. This study looked at 172 autistic children, who were classified (in a non-specific way) as having GI problems or not having GI problems. Only 23% had GI problems, mostly constipation and diarrhea. Those with GI problems were no different from subjects without GI problems in demographic characteristics, measures of adaptive functioning, or autism symptom severity. Compared to autistic children without GI problems, those with GI problems showed greater symptom severity on measures of irritability, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Those with GI problems were also less likely to respond to treatment. There is a glaring weakness in this study: one is that there was not a \"typically developing, but with matched GI problems\" wing, to see if the GI problems alone would account for the differences.

One: this paper entered the publication stream in advance of Wakefield's now-withdrawn paper, so it is hard to say how it supports or builds on Wakefield's now-discredited findings. Two: this paper is a wild surmise about antibiotic use in children later diagnosed with autism, and builds a cloud-castle about autism symptoms are really the result of a subacute, chronic tetanus infection. No actual data about finding tetanus in blood samples from autistic individuals are presented. In short, this is a fairytale, and in way ”replicates” or “supports” Wakefield’s “findings”.

Over this period Dr Wakefield and his supporters have cited a range of studies which are claimed to ‘verify’, ‘replicate’ or ‘support’ his MMR-autism theory.

 28.Gastroenterology. 2005:128 (Suppl 2);Abstract-303 http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/new-published-study-verifies-andrew-wakefields-research-on-autism-again/ Which of these studies supports a link between MMR and autism? None of them. Which studies support a link between MMR and inflammatory bowel disease? None. In fact, none of these studies focuses on MMR: the term ‘MMR’ is not included in any of the titles. One study (no 6) by Vijendra Singh, published in 2003, claims a link between measles virus and autism. According to virologists in London, Singh’s methodology was suspect and the evidence for the specific ‘anti-MMR’ antibody he identified was ‘not credible’(see Michael Fitzpatrick,  MMR and Autism: What Parents Need To Know , p90). Several studies claim to show an association between ‘autistic enterocolitis’ and autism. Of these (nos2, 3, 4, 9, 18, 19, 28) all but two feature Dr Wakefield as a co-author. Study no 9 is the work of Wakefield collaborators Arthur Krigsman and Carol Stott, published in a journal whose editors include Wakefield and Stott. Study no 28 is the work of Wakefield’s former Royal Free colleague Federico Balzola. The study by Dr Lenny Gonzalez, (no 27) a former collaborator with Wakefield at his Thoughtful House clinic in Texas, published in Venezuela, reports the extraordinary findings of autistic enterocolitis in 100% of 45 children with autism, and in 66.66% of 57 ‘developmentally normal’ controls. Apart from Wakefield and his former or current colleagues, no other researchers in the world have confirmed the existence of ‘autistic enterocolitis’ in children with autism. Some studies suggest the presence of gastrointestinal disorders other than ‘enterocolitis’ in association with autism. These include upper gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastritis and oesophagitis (no 1, Horvath;no 10, Galiatsatos; no 20, Torrente); coeliac disease or malabsorption (no 12, Genuis;no 16, Walker-Smith;no 17, Goodwin); microbial factors other than measles (nos14, 15, 24, 25 – the Finegold, Bolte, Sandler team; and no 26 –Parracho and colleagues at Reading). Most of these studies feature small numbers of cases and two (nos 16,17) were published more than 40 years ago.In study no 10, Polymnia Galiatsatos and colleagues in Montreal, Canada report the cases of two young adults, one with colonic inflammation, the other with gastritis. Nikolov and colleagues at Yale(no 13) simply report on ‘gastrointestinal symptoms’ in association with autism. Other studies suggest immune or autoimmune dysfunction in association with autism: Jyonuchi (nos7,8) and Singh (nos5,11). One study (no 23, Shinohe) focuses on abnormal glutamate metabolism in adults with autistic spectrum disorders. These studies do nothing to advance the vaccine-autism hypothesis. Given that supporters of Dr Wakefield often claim that his work has been ‘independently’ replicated, it is worth pointing out that Wakefield himself is a co-author on a quarter of the studies listed here (2,3,4, 18,19, 21,22). Others (9, 20, 27,28) feature former Royal Free team members(Ashwood, Torrente, Furlano, Balzola), or subsequent collaborators (Krigsman, Stott, Gonzalez). 
Those who, like me, have been following this sad story over the past 15 years, will have noticed that several authorities formerly cited in support of Wakefield’s theory seem to have fallen by the wayside. In the early days of the MMR controversy, Wakefield often cited the studies of Rosemary Waring and Patricia D’Eufemia in support of his notion of a ‘leaky bowel’. His colleague John Walker-Smith claimed that a letter from Aderbal Sabra published in the  Lancet  in 1998 (about children with food allergies and ADHD) provided a ‘great public vindication’ of the work of the Royal Free team (see  MMR and Autism , p143-4). Tokyo physician Hishashi Kawashima’s claims to have identified measles virus in children with autism were widely promoted – but soon discredited. In Sunderland, retired pharmacy lecturer Paul Shattock, an ardent Wakefield supporter, attracted widespread publicity for his claims to have identified distinctive urinary peptides linking MMR and autism, but his research was never published. The most widely cited research supposedly supporting Wakefield came from his Dublin collaborator John O’Leary (published in 2002 in separate papers with Uhlmann and Shiels). This was discredited by the evidence of Stephen Bustin in the Omnibus Autism Proceedings in the USA in 2009 (see Stephen A Bustin, Why There Is no Link Between Measles Virus and Autism, DOI: 10.5772/52844). 
Another study by Balzola, based on the use of the technique of ‘capsule endoscopy’ in a single (adult) case has also been dropped. It was rapidly followed by a report from another member of his team of ‘acute small bowel perforation secondary to capsule endoscopy’. Other forgotten Wakefield supporters are the South Carolina immunologist Hugh Fudenberg, and the Florida preacher and vitamin salesman Jeffrey Bradstreet, whose dubious practices were exposed in Brian Deer’s Channel Four documentary in 2004. The father and son team of Mark and David Geier, notorious for their promotion of the ‘Lupron protocol’ of chemical castration and heavy metal chelation as a treatment for autism as well as for their shoddy researches, have also been dropped from the list of supportive researchers. Another widely quoted ‘study’ supposedly supporting Wakefield was a poster presentation by Stephen Walker (working in collaboration with long-standing Wakefield ally Arthur Krigsman) at the IMFAR meeting in Montreal in 2006.These preliminary, provisional, unconfirmed, non-peer-reviewed findings – of measles virus in bowel biopsy specimens – in an uncontrolled study (which does not mention MMR) were widely reported – and enthusiastically acclaimed by Dr Wakefield. Walker himself disclaimed the interpretation that his work supported any link between measles and autism. This study has never been published. In conclusion, after 15 years, we are offered 28 studies, none of which supports the MMR-enterocolitis-autism hypothesis. It is not surprising that over this period Wakefield has failed to win the support of a single paediatrician, paediatric gastroenterologist, child psychiatrist or autism specialist in England. Surely it is time to call a halt? —

US scientists back autism link to MMR Telegraph.co.uk (Filed: 29/05/2006) The measles virus has been found in the guts of children with a form of autism, renewing fears over the safety of the MMR jab. American researchers have revealed that 85 per cent of samples taken from autistic children with bowel disorders contain the virus. The strain is the same as the one used in the measles, mumps and rubella triple vaccine. The findings will spark fresh concern about MMR, because they back theories of a causal link between the jab, autism and painful gut disorders suffered by a number of autistic children. The study replicates findings made by the gastroenterologist Dr Andrew Wakefield in 1998 and Prof John O'Leary, a pathologist, in 2002. Parents say their children were developing normally until they had the MMR jab, given when a child is between 12- and 18-months-old. The children now suffer from regressive autism. One theory is that the virus passes through the gut, causing damage, and into the bloodstream, from where it is able to attack the brain. More than 2,000 families claim that their children have suffered damage but the Department of Health reiterated last night that MMR is safe, a stance supported by the British Medical Association and all the Royal Colleges. Last year Government scientists failed to reproduce research results by Dr Wakefield. Research to be presented this week in Montreal, Canada, provides fresh evidence that the measles virus is present in the guts of autistic children. Dr Stephen Walker, of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, North Carolina, studied children with regressive autism and bowel disease. \"Of the handful of results we have in so far, all are vaccine strain,\" he said.

			 The short answer is no and no.  No vaccine-strain virus persistent in the gut; and no unique intestinal damage in autism.  The longer answer: In addition to the retracted 1998 paper, Wakefield was a co-author on a 2002 paper. which has  not  been retracted, but whose findings have been shown to be not valid. 
 The paper is: Uhlmann V, Martin CM, Sheils O, Pilkington L, Silva I, Killalea A, Murch SB, Walker-Smith J, Thomson M, Wakefield AJ, O'Leary JJ.  Potential viral pathogenic mechanism for new variant inflammatory bowel disease . Mol Pathol. 2002 Apr;55(2):84-90. 
 Astonishingly, the paper and an accompanying editorial were the subject of a BBC World News episode of Panaroma on Sunday February 3 2002, \" MMR: Every Parent's Choice\"  (the link is to a transcript of the show).  
 How about the Uhlmann paper?  Is it true that there is evidence of damage to some children's  intestinal tracts from vaccines, specifically the measles vaccine?  To say that it is true, two things would have to be true: evidence of damage, and evidence of vaccine-strain measles virus (VSMV) in the damaged areas.  I will discuss the second issue first.  Was there ever evidence of \"vaccine-strain measles virus (VSMV) in the damaged areas\"?  The answer is almost certainly no.  Stephen Bustin, who is arguably the world's expert on the technique used to find viral particles in tissue, says no.  The technique is polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Professor Bustin has published several articles on the shortcomings of the Wakefield research group (including Uhlmann): 
 
 RT-qPCR and molecular diagnostics: no evidence for measles virus in the GI tract of autistic children  (2008) 
 Why There Is no Link Between Measles Virus and Autism  (2013) 
 
 In 2008, Hornig et al. set out to replicate Wakefield and Uhlmann's finding, in: 
 Hornig M, Briese T, Buie T, Bauman ML, Lauwers G, Siemetzki U, Hummel K, Rota PA, Bellini WJ, O'Leary JJ, Sheils O, Alden E, Pickering L, Lipkin WI.  Lack of association between measles virus vaccine and autism with enteropathy: a case-control study . PLoS One. 2008 Sep 4;3(9):e3140. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003140. 
 
 This study provides strong evidence against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR exposure. Autism with GI disturbances is associated with elevated rates of regression in language or other skills and may represent an endophenotype distinct from other ASD. 
 
 These are just a few of many papers that show that children with autism  do not  have vaccine-strain measles virus in their GI systems or circulating in their blood.  
 Turning back to the first issue: do autistic people have changes in the histology of their gastrointestinal tracts that is unique to autism ? (Histology = \"the study of the microscopic structure of tissues.\") 
 In 2007,  a literature review was published (emphasis added) 
 
 MacDonald TT, Domizio P.  Autistic enterocolitis; is it a histopathological entity?  Histopathology. 2007 Feb;50(3):371-9; discussion 380-4. 
 AIMS:  To review the literature on the histopathological diagnosis of the condition termed 'autistic enterocolitis'. 
 METHODS AND RESULTS:  We have reviewed all published works where mucosal biopsy specimens from autistic children have been examined histopathologically. Abstracts were excluded. Our review of the published works,  nearly all from a single centre , identifies major inconsistencies between studies, lack of appropriate controls and misinterpretation of normal findings as pathology. Ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be more prevalent in children with regressive autism but is also seen in children with food allergies and severe constipation,  the latter being an extremely common finding in autistic children 
 CONCLUSION:The histopathological diagnosis of autistic enterocolitis should be treated with caution until a proper study with appropriate methodology and controls is undertaken. 
 
 What about the children in Wakefield's retracted 1998 paper? As Brian Deer reported in the  British Medical Journal (April 2010) , the 12 children in the 1998 paper really had histological profiles within the normal range.  
 
 With swollen glands in the terminal ileum (widely regarded as a benign or normal finding in children), this “colitis”—which was even cited in the retracted paper’s title—was Wakefield’s new disease. And yet the colitis was apparently invisible to the Royal Free’s pathology service. 
 In fact the service identified findings suggestive of possible inflammatory bowel disease in only one of the 12 children. “The mild patchy generalised increase in inflammatory cells with lymphoid aggregates and follicles is not very specific but could be in keeping with low grade quiescent inflammatory bowel disease,” it reported for child 2. But this inflammation resolved after two months’ enteral feeding with a product now marketed as Modulen. A repeat ileocolonoscopy found no abnormality, and a food intolerance was diagnosed. 
 
 In short, autistic folk  do not  have changes in the histology of their gastrointestinal tracts that is unique to autism, nor are there GI changes caused by vaccination against measles, or any other immunization.

"21995" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/09/16/what-are-the-allegations-against-dr-wakefield/" "What are the allegations against Dr. Wakefield?" "Dr. Andrew Wakefield, not of Thoughtful House in the U.S., has recently been called before the  General Medical Council  for a “fitness to practice hearing”.  The allegations stem from activities related to his research of about 10 years ago on children (many autistic).   I recently discussed two of incidents being investigated:  a birthday party  where blood was drawn from typically developing children (for controls) and  activities related to his invention  and the subsequent patent his hospital (the Royal Free) applied for.  I found it interesting to see these layed out, so I decided to post them here for others to read as well. These are allegations.  The process has not concluded, nor has any decision been reached. This is a short version.   A detailed list  (93 pages) can be found on Brian Deer’s website.  Note that these 93 pages include allegations against Doctors Murch and Walker-Smith. Dr Andrew WAKEFIELD GMC Reference number: 2733564 
 Professor John WALKER-SMITH GMC Reference number: 1700583 
 Professor Simon MURCH GMC Reference number: 2540201 
 The GMC’s statutory purpose is to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public by ensuring proper standards in the practice of medicine. 
 We investigate complaints about individual doctors in order to establish whether their fitness to practise is impaired and whether to remove or restrict a doctor’s registration. 
 The GMC does not regard its remit as extending to arbitrating between competing scientific theories generated in the course of medical research. 
 The following is a summary only of the allegations which will be made before the Panel at the forthcoming hearing. 
 The Panel will inquire into allegations of serious professional misconduct by Dr Wakefield, Professor Walker-Smith and Professor Murch, in relation to the conduct of a research study involving young children from 1996-98. 
 Dr Wakefield, Professor Walker-Smith and Professor Murch, were at the relevant times employed by the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine with Honorary Clinical contracts at the Royal Free Hospital. 
 It is alleged that the three practitioners were named as Responsible Consultants on an application made to the Ethical Practices Committee of the Royal Free Hospital NHS Trust (“the ethics committee”) in 1996 to undertake a research study involving children who suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms and a rare behavioural condition called disintegrative disorder. The title of the study was “A new paediatric syndrome: enteritis and disintegrative disorder following measles/rubella vaccination”. The Panel will inquire into allegations that the three practitioners undertook research during the period 1996-98 without proper ethical approval, failed to conduct the research in accordance with the application submitted to the ethics committee, and failed to treat the children admitted into the study in accordance with the terms of the approval given by the ethics committee. For example, it will be alleged that some of the children did not qualify for the study on the basis of their behavioural symptoms. 
 It is further alleged that the three practitioners permitted a programme of investigations to be carried out on a number of children as part of the research study, some of which were not clinically indicated when the Ethics Committee had been assured that they were all clinically indicated. These investigations included colonoscopies and lumbar punctures. It is alleged that the performance of these investigations was contrary to the clinical interests of the children. 
 The research undertaken by the three practitioners was subsequently written up in a paper published in the Lancet in February 1998 entitled “Ileal-Lymphoid-Nodular Hyperplasia, Non-Specific Colitis and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children” (“the Lancet paper”). 
 It is alleged that the three practitioners inaccurately stated in the Lancet paper that the investigations reported in it were approved by the ethics committee. 
 The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield and Professor Walker-Smith acted dishonestly and irresponsibly in failing to disclose in the Lancet paper the method by which they recruited patients for inclusion in the research which resulted in a misleading description of the patient population in the Lancet paper. It is further alleged that Dr Wakefield gave a dishonest description of the patient population to the Medical Research Council. 
 The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield and Professor Walker-Smith administered a purportedly therapeutic substance to a child for experimental reasons prior to obtaining information about the safety of the substance. It is alleged that such actions were irresponsible and contrary to the clinical interests of the child. 
 The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield was involved in advising solicitors acting for persons alleged to have suffered harm by the administration of the MMR vaccine. It is alleged that Dr Wakefield’s conduct in relation to research funds obtained from the Legal Aid Board (“LAB”) was dishonest and misleading. It will be alleged that Dr Wakefield ought to have disclosed his funding from the LAB to the Ethics Committee but did not. 
 The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield ordered investigations on some children as part of the research carried out at the Royal Free Hospital from 1996-98 without the requisite paediatric qualifications to do so and in contravention of his Honorary Consultant appointment. 
 The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield failed to disclose his involvement in the MMR litigation, his receipt of funding from the LAB and his involvement in a Patent relating to a new vaccine to the Editor of the Lancet which was contrary to his duties as a senior author of the Lancet paper. 
 The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield acted unethically and abused his position of trust as a medical practitioner by taking blood from children at a birthday party to use for research purposes without ethics committee approval, in an inappropriate social setting, and whilst offering financial inducement. 
 We cannot guarantee that all those wishing to attend the hearing will be able to do so, as seating is limited. If you plan to attend the hearing please email the GMC press office press@gmc-uk.org. In the event that we have to allocate seats those people who have notified the press office will be seated before others.

"22564" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/11/10/brian-deer-on-andrew-wakefield-pathology-reports-solve-new-bowel-disease-riddle-2/" "Brian Deer on Andrew Wakefield: Pathology reports solve “new bowel disease” riddle" "Today the British Medical Journal (BMJ) released a four articles on Andrew Wakefield and his research efforts at the Royal Free Hospital.  To sum up the four articles in a single sentence (from Fiona Godlee of the BMJ): “Previously unpublished histopathology grading sheets apparently completed by Amar Dhillon, the senior pathologist on the paper, remove any remaining credibility from the claim that the Royal Free doctors had discovered a new inflammatory bowel disease associated with MMR” For those who may wish a bit of background, earlier this year, the BMJ had a series of articles on Mr. Wakefield’s research: Secrets of the MMR scare: how the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed  (Feature by Brian Deer) Secrets of the MMR scare How the vaccine crisis was meant to make money  (Feature by Brian Deer) The Lancet’s two days to bury bad news  (Feature by Brian Deer) and   Wakefield’s article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent  (editorial by Fiona Godlee of the BMJ) These articles came after Mr. Deer was able to review the  transcripts  of Mr. Wakefield’s  “Fitness to Practice” hearings  held before the  General Medical Council  (GMC). Mr. Wakefield’s work focused on gastrointestinal disease. He went so far as to claim to have found a new syndrome, which he coined  autistic enterocolitis . 13 years later, there is still no proof such a condition actually exists. When evidence came forward that the discussion of the children in the Lancet did not match the clinical records, Mr. Wakefield claimed that ““Dr Dhillon’s diagnosis formed the basis for what was reported in the Lancet,” and “I played no part in the diagnostic process at all.” Unfortunately it has been difficult to verify these statements. For one, the slides made from the samples taken from the children in the Lancet study are apparently missing, so direct comparison of what was reported in the paper to what was actually found in the children was difficult.  Also, Dr. Dhillon’s analyses were not available. Until now.  The scoresheets used by  Amar Dhillon , the pathologist coauthor on the 1998 Lancet article, were recently made available to the BMJ.  These form the basis for the articles published today. In his new BMJ article,  Pathology reports solve “new bowel disease” riddle , Mr. Deer discusses the pathology reports.  He  compiled a table  based on these reports (for example,  the report from Child 1 ).  If I can summarize Mr. Deer’s discussion: what is striking about these reports is that they are not striking.  Dr. Dhillon used his own score method to rank the disease found in the specimens.  In most cases, these were “normal” or “mild”.  Mr. Deer shared the reports with a number of professionals for comment.  Including  Dr. Henry Appleman : “Most of this stuff is so close to normal that you’ve really got to question whether there is really anything there,” said Henry Appelman, professor of surgical pathology at the University of Michigan and a specialist in gastrointestinal disease. “These are the kind of things that we in our practise here would ignore completely.” And  Ingvar Bjarnason : “Everyone thinks I am crazy even asking them,” said King’s gastroenterologist Bjarnason, after discussing the scorings with other specialists. “All but one of the children is normal in their eyes. There is no enteritis and no colitis, simple as that.” While the reports were not striking, there is indication of inflammation.  Mr. Deer argues that a key point was left out of the Lancet article, the presence of constipation in many of the children, which would have put the inflammation signs into better perspective for the readers: No less controversial, the authors omitted from the paper the children’s principal gastroenterological problem. “Almost all” had “severe” constipation.(30)  The GMC panel heard, for example, that after bowel preparation by nasogastric tube, the first patient, who had mild caecal cryptitis, endured two attempted ileocolonoscopies that failed because of faeces in the caecum, with “scope trauma” noted on the second. 
 This omission of constipation was no small matter. It went to the heart of how the paper would be read. Specialists told me that both mild inflammation and prominent lymphoid follicles may be expected to be associated with this sign. 
 (30)	Murch S, Thomson M, Walker-Smith JA. Authors’ reply. Lancet 1998;351:908. Mr. Deer, of course, is not a medical professional.  But, we do not have to rely solely on Mr. Deer’s report. The BMJ has two companion pieces by medical professionals. In  Commentary: I see no convincing evidence of “enterocolitis,” “colitis,” or a “unique disease process” ,  Karel Geboes , Professor Doctor, Department of Pathology Univ Hospital KUleuven reports: In general, the data are rather similar to the reports of the Royal Free hospital pathology service, which I reviewed for the BMJ last year.(7)  Although minor abnormalities are noted in a minority of patients, I see no convincing evidence of “enterocolitis,” “colitis,” or a “unique disease process” being present in all patients. The Wakefield et al paper is obviously problematic and its wording does not reflect the data shown in the grading sheets. 
 (7) Deer B. Wakefield’s “autistic enterocolitis” under the microscope. BMJ 2010;340:c1127. In  Commentary: We came to an overwhelming and uniform opinion that these reports do not show colitis ,  Dr. Ingvar Bjarnason , professor of digestive diseases, consultant physician and gastroenterologist at King’s College, London, writes: The hospital pathology service found the histopathology to be normal,(3)  and, except in the case of the child mentioned above, the grading sheets also note normal findings. The fact that these scores were interpreted as abnormal raises, in my opinion, questions for the authors of Wakefield et al to answer, and particularly for the consultant histopathologists.  
 From the histological and endoscopic reports, there are no grounds to believe that any new inflammatory bowel disease may have been discovered, or any possible “unique disease process” observed, as reported by Wakefield et al. Nothing can be said about the aetiology of any minor irritations noted, and nothing can be inferred regarding treatment. 
 (3) Deer B. Wakefield’s “autistic enterocolitis” under the microscope. BMJ 2010;340:c1127. In  Institutional research misconduct, Failings over the MMR scare may need parliamentary inquiry , BMJ editor Fiona Godlee discusses how there is no sign that the Royal Free Hospital (University College London) has begun the expected inquiry into the misconduct which occurred there in the 1990’s: It is now more than 18 months since the UK’s General Medical Council found Andrew Wakefield guilty of dishonesty and other serious professional misconduct(1) ; and it is nearly a year since the BMJ concluded that his now retracted Lancet paper linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine with autism and bowel disease was an “elaborate fraud.”(2)  (3)  At that time, January 2011, we called on Wakefield’s former employer, University College London (UCL), to establish an inquiry into the scandal. Ten months on, no inquiry has been announced. Ironically, these data were made available to the BMJ with the intent of exhonerating Mr. Wakefield. In 1997, Dhillon was asked to reassess intestinal biopsy specimens taken from children enrolled in Wakefield’s research after the hospital’s histopathology service, under consultant and fellow coauthor Susan Davies, reported most of the children’s biopsies to be normal. His 62 A4 grading sheets were sent to the BMJ by c, a self employed environmental microbiologist. Lewis says he was given them by Wakefield after they met at a vaccine safety conference in January. In his accompanying letter, Lewis concludes that a non-expert pathologist such as Wakefield could have thought they showed that the children had non-specific colitis. Ms. Godlee is being kind, in my opinion, using the title the self-styled “vaccine safety” conference chose.  This was the same conference in Jamaica which was  discussed here  at Left Brain/Right Brain recently.  It strikes me as rather odd that Mr. Wakefield did not provide these documents to the BMJ directly.  Perhaps in a response to the articles published earlier this year.  What advantage he gained in providing them through a proxy is unclear. When he was found guilty of misconduct by the GMC, Mr. Wakefield vowed that he would not go away.   So far, this appears true.  However, his arguments are getting weaker as time goes on.  In this case, they seem to have outright backfired.  Writes Ms. Godlee: The grading sheets are certainly interesting, but not for the reasons Lewis (or, it may be assumed, Wakefield, in giving them to him) intended. We sent them to two independent reviewers and supplied the data for comment to two further senior gastroenterologists. We also showed them to Brian Deer, the investigative journalist who over the past eight years has uncovered the secrets behind the MMR scare and who arguably knows more about this case than anyone apart from Wakefield. Our expert reviewers are in no doubt that Dhillon’s findings—like Davies’s before him—are almost all normal, or as near to normal that the changes they reported were likely to be physiological.(6)  (7)  In an accompanying feature article, Deer explains what they add to our knowledge of the Wakefield saga.(8)

While his now-retracted 1997 Lancet paper is most often discussed, the strongest evidence he had actually came in later work where his team reported that they found evidence of the vaccine strain of the measles virus in the intestinal tissues of autistic children. The team used a methodology called  Polymerase chain reaction  (PCR). PCR amplifies a specific fragment of DNA, allowing one to identify if small amounts of that gene are present in larger samples. PCR tests were performed by John O’Leary in Dublin. As revealed later, Andrew Wakefield had a business stake in this laboratory. As part of the MMR litigation in the UK, the vaccine manufacturers hired  Stephen Bustin  to review the methods and results of the O’Leary laboratory. Those results were not made public, but Prof. Bustin later was called in to testify in the U.S. Autism Omnibus Proceeding (the vaccine court). That testimony was discussed here at LeftBrain/RightBrain and elsewhere. Prof. Bustin is one of the world’s experts on PCR. Prof. Bustin has now written his own account of the history of the measles-virus/autism work by Mr. Wakefield’s team in  Why There Is no Link Between Measles Virus and Autism . The full report is free, open access. The report discusses what he already disclosed in his testimony: the multiple failures which resulted in the reporting of a false association of measles virus and autism. Some of those failures include: Absence of transparency: the key publication shows no data; hence an expert reader cannot evaluate the reliability of its conclusions 
 Unreliable techniques and protocols: analysis of the qPCR data was incorrect 
 Disregard for controls: obvious evidence of extensive contamination was disregarded 
 Lack of reproducibility: the data could not be duplicated by several independent investigators One key failure involved skipping key steps in using PCR on measles virus. The measles virus is an RNA virus. PCR is very inefficient at detecting RNA, so a step called reverse transcriptase is used to convert the RNA to DNA before PCR (RT-PCR). The O’Leary lab did not perform this step. This result, and others, show that the samples used by Mr. Wakefield’s team were contaminated. Prof. Bustin goes into detail and covers more important topics, and as the paper is relatively short, it is worth a read for those interested in the science. Prof. Bustin concludes: As a result, the conclusions put forward by this [the Wakefield/O’Leary] paper are entirely incorrect and there is no evidence whatever for the presence either of MeV genomic RNA or mRNA in the GI tracts of any of the patients investigated during the course of the studies reported by O’Leary et al. Instead, it is clear that the data support the opposite conclusion: there is no evidence for any MeV being present in the majority of patients’ analysed. Unfortunately, the authors do not report whether any the patients had received the MMR vaccination. However, assuming that a significant proportion had done so, it is also clear that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and the presence of MeV in the intestine of autistic children.  The Wakefield MMR hypothesis is already failed, so this does not really change the conversation. What this report by Prof. Bustin does is document his own observations, measurements and analyses for the historical record so we can see just how bad the science was that promoted the Wakefield hypothesis. —

"22435" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/12/22/xmrv-paper-withdrawn/" "XMRV paper withdrawn" "The paper that started the idea that  XMRV  (Xenotropic murine leukemia virus) might be linked to  chronic fatigue syndrome  (also called myalgic encephalomyelitis) has been fully withdrawn by the journal, Science.  In a rare move, the journal has withdrawn the article in an “editorial” retraction.  I.e. the editor, not the authors, have retracted the article. ScienceInsider (a blog at Science) writes in In a Rare Move,  Science Without Authors’ Consent Retracts Paper That Tied Mouse Virus to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome : After enduring more than 2 years of criticism that included evidence of contamination and misrepresentation of data, a Science paper that linked a mouse retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) today received its last rites: Editor-in-Chief Bruce Alberts issued a full retraction. The study’s 13 authors in September signed a partial retraction after one of the three collaborating labs found that a contamination had marred its contribution, but they could not agree on the wording of the full retraction, so Alberts issued it without their approval. “Science has lost confidence in the Report and the validity of its conclusions,” wrote Alberts in a rare “editorial” retraction, which appears in the 23 December issue of Science. “It is Science’s opinion that a retraction signed by all the authors is unlikely to be forthcoming.”  The original article,  Detection of an Infectious Retrovirus, XMRV, in Blood Cells of Patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome , is  fully retracted .  This follows  a partial retraction by the authors : In our 23 October 2009 Report, “Detection of an infectious retrovirus, XMRV, in blood cells of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome,” two of the coauthors, Silverman and Das Gupta, analyzed DNA samples from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients and healthy controls. A reexamination by Silverman and Das Gupta of the samples they used shows that some of the CFS peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA preparations are contaminated with XMRV plasmid DNA.   There was also an “ editorial expression of concern ” The story of the Science paper on XMRV and CFS has had even more twists.  Nature News discusses this in  XMRV paper withdrawn  and the above mentioned  Science Without Authors’ Consent Retracts Paper That Tied Mouse Virus to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome . I first heard of the retraction through Twitter and Trine Tsouderos of the Chicago Tribune.  The Trib has an article by Ivan Oransky,  Embattled chronic fatigue syndrome paper retracted  is online at the Chicago Tribune. The lead author in the Science article on XMRV and CFS also made public statements about XMRV being present in the blood of autistic children.  This  was picked up by David Kirby , whose work publicity work was key in promoting the now debunked link between mercury and autism.  Not surprisingly, Mr. Kirby took the angle (attributed to the lead researcher on the CFS article, Judy Mikovits) that this might give evidence to the vaccine-epidemic notion of autism.   While Ms. Mikovits has not published any work on XMRV and autism, two other groups have. 
 
Lack of infection with XMRV or other MLV-related viruses in blood, post-mortem brains and paternal gametes of autistic individuals. 
 
PCR and serology find no association between xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) and autism. Both articles are available free, but from the titles alone you can tell that the evidence goes against any link. As  reported here recently , there is a multicenter XMRV/CFS study ongoing, led by Ian Lipkin and Ms. Mikovits is continuing to work on this study at the National Cancer Institute.

			 The article that won't die: Sally Beck's \"Scientists fear MMR link to autism,\" published in the Daily Mail on May 28, 2006. 
 That's right, 2006.  
 It gets worse.  Two of the complainants in the  Omnibus Autism Proceeding , the  Cedillos  and  Hazelhursts ,  relied upon the unpublished Walker et al. research.  Both the Special Masters in  the hearings, and the presiding judge in the following Hazelhurst appeal,  dismissed the evidentiary value of the Walker et al. study   (exerpts from the hearings and the appeal are below).  In other words, the Walker data have been examined and found unconvincing, because it was scientifically suspect.  
 The Walker study (never published) in no way validates  Wakefield's fraud .  The MMR vaccine still does not cause autism.

Back in 2006, what Beck referred to as \"new American research\" was actually a \"poster presentation\" at the  2006 International Meeting for Autism Research  (IMFAR).  A \"poster presentation\" is a way of presenting preliminary results from research.In terms of levels of evidence for a particular hypothesis, it is very weak.  (The complete text of the poster presentation is below.)

 Persistent Ileal Measles Virus In A Large Cohort Of Regressive Autistic Children With Ileocolitis And Lymphonodular Hyperplasia: Revisitation Of An Earlier Study 
 Steve Walker, Karin Hepner, Jeffrey Segal, Arthur Krigsman, Wake Forest University School of Medicine 
 Background: Autistic enterocolitis, consisting of a nonspecific ileocolitis coupled with ileocolonic lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH), was first introduced as a new, potentially virus-induced disease entity eight years ago in a group of ASD children with developmental regression. 
 Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to examine ileal biopsy tissue in a large cohort of pediatric patients who carry a diagnosis of regressive autism and whose chronic gastrointestinal symptoms warranted diagnostic endoscopic evaluation, for evidence of measles virus RNA. 
 Methods: Patients who had been diagnosed with autism and who were referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for evaluation of chronic GI symptoms were eligible to participate in this IRB approved study. For each patient, medical histories, vaccination records, histopathology reports, and ileocolonoscopic biopsy tissue were available for evaluation. Terminal ileum (TI) biopsy tissue was assayed by RT-PCR for the presence of measles virus RNA and PCR-positive samples were sequenced. 
 Results: Medical and clinical data have been collected for >275 patients who fit the study inclusion criteria. PCR analysis on TI biopsy tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive for the F gene amplicon. Fourteen have been verified by DNA sequence and an additional 56 amplicons are being sequenced now. Work is ongoing to assay the remaining specimens (~200) and to identify and assay relevant control tissue samples. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this large cohort of pediatric autistic patients with chronic GI symptoms confirm earlier findings of measles virus RNA in the terminal ileum and support an association between measles virus and ileocolitis /LNH.

 Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism  6/1/2006 
 WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – An American scientist whose research replicates a connection published in England in 2002 between the measles virus and bowel disease in autistic children strongly warns against making the “leap” to suggesting that the measles vaccine might actually cause autism. 
 “That is not what our research is showing,” said Stephen J. Walker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. Walker and colleagues have issued an abstract to be presented at this week’s International Meeting for Autism Research, indicating that a high percentage of autistic children that they have tested with chronic bowel disease show evidence of measles virus in their intestines. 
 Some observers have said that the presence of the measles virus indicates a strong possibility that the measles vaccine, a possible source of the virus, could have caused the children’s autism. That possible connection has caused a major controversy in the United Kingdom, where the connection was first made in 2002. The vaccine is first given as part of a triple vaccine called MMR – for measles, mumps and rubella – at ages 12-18 months. That is shortly before a particular type of autism (regressive) begins to appear in children afflicted with the condition, which has fueled the speculation about a connection. 
 Walker says the new research does not support the connection, and he notes that the results have not even been published in a peer-reviewed journal. “Even if we showed association (between measles virus and bowel disease) and we published it in a peer-reviewed journal, the conclusion will be simply that there is measles virus in the gut of a large number of children who have regressive autism and bowel disease. End of story. 
 “We haven’t done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease.” 
 Walker explains that exploring the causes of chronic bowel disease in autistic children is the major impetus for his research. “There are lots of viruses in the gut, and any one of them could be causing inflammation. If it truly is from a vaccine and this virus causes inflammation and a chronic bowel condition in some susceptible children, then that’s something that needs to be known.” 
 The main task at hand, Walker said, is to determine what is causing the bowel condition in the autistic children, a condition that has a direct influence on cognitive and behavioral issues associated with autism. 
 A high percentage of autistic children have chronic bowel disease, a discovery in the late 1990s that eventually led to the measles virus connection. 
 “If anybody has severe GI problems, it causes problems with focus, it causes problems with everything. You can’t do anything until you get that resolved. We’ve all experienced that. 
 “These kids experience it hour after hour every single day of their lives. Many of them are non-verbal so they can’t tell anybody what the problem is, and the behavior that they exhibit as a result of a severe stomach ache was once attributed to just being autistic and having weird behaviors – for example, leaning over the sharp edge of a coffee table for hours at a time. That seems weird, but what they’re doing is relieving pressure on their lower abdomen.” 
 Walker said that relieving the bowel discomfort has been shown to improve other conditions associated with autism, such as cognition and the ability to learn. “There’s case after case where kids improved cognitively, behaviorally and biomedically when you treat the bowel disease. There is a great improvement from better nutrition alone. You see improvements in their overall condition.” 
 Walker said he will continue to look for possible causes, the biological mechanism, and new treatments of the bowel condition. “That’s the goal for me: understanding the biology of what’s causing the disease and then gaining insight into the most effective way to treat it, so that clinicians will not have to go through a trial and error approach.”

 page 46-47 
 Finally, Dr. Hepner pointed to a study that is currently in progress, conducted by herself and several others, to which I will refer as the “Walker study.”  She stated that the “preliminary data” from that study “present another step in support” of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of autistic children.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.) 
 page 64-65 
 c.  The Walker study 
 Petitioners have also relied on a study that is currently in progress, conducted by Dr. Hepner and several others, often described as the “Walker study.”  (See Ex. 59, Tab K; P. Trial Ex. 3.) Dr. Hepner stated that the “preliminary data” from that study “present another step in support” of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of some autistic children.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; see also Tr. 634A-35A.)  After consideration of the Walker study and the testimony about it in the record of this case, however, I conclude that the study does not provide any substantial support to the proposition that the measles virus persists in the bodies of Michelle Cedillo or any other autistic individuals. 
 Dr. Hepner reported that she and three other researchers--Steve Walker, Jeff Segal, and Dr. Arthur Krigsman, the latter being another of petitioners’ experts in this case--are engaged in a study similar to the Uhlmann study, in that their objective is to perform PCR testing for the detection of measles virus on intestinal biopsies of children with both developmental delay and gastrointestinal symptoms.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.)  Dr. Hepner stated that the researchers generated “multiple primer sets” and “tested them for their specificity and sensitivity” in identifying the presence of measles virus.  (Tr. 635A; Ex. 63, p. 5.)  Dr. Hepner and Dr. Krigsman testified that the study, which began in 2003, is not yet complete, but that the group conducted some initial testing and presented “preliminary data” from the study at an autism-related conference in 2006, in the form of a “poster presentation” (literally, a poster board describing the study was set on an easel at the conference). (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 474A-75, 634A.)  Dr. Hepner reported that of 82 biopsy samples tested in the study’s initial testing, which all came from children with both “developmental delay” and “GI [gastrointestinal] symptoms,” 70 tested positive for measles virus.  (Ex. 63, p. 5.)  She further stated, without explanation, that her group was able “to confirm vaccine strain specificity” in some of the positive samples.  (Tr. 635A.) 
 Petitioners, in their post-hearing briefs, have relied on the Walker study as supportive of their view that the Unigenetics measles virus testing should be considered reliable.  (P1, pp. 141, 154-55, 242; P3, pp. 33-34.)  After full consideration, however, I cannot agree. First, two of respondent’s experts, Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin, each pointed to a number of flaws in the Walker study, based on the description in the poster presentation.  (Tr. 1861-65; 1952A- 59A.) 
 Moreover, a second important reason to discount the Walker study is the testimony of Dr. Hepner herself.  Dr. Hepner stated that the initial data from her study were only “very preliminary data.”  (Tr. 659.)  She acknowledged that it would be inappropriate to “draw any conclusions” from those preliminary results.  (Tr. 682.)  She acknowledged that her group at this time is still attempting “to test this assay, to optimize the assay” (Tr. 660A)--i.e., to develop the test to a point where they can then be confident that their test is yielding reliable results.  Part of developing any such test is to use “negative controls”--i.e., to test samples that are known to be free of the target, to make sure that the test is not erroneously identifying the target in samples that do not contain it.  However, Dr. Hepner explained that her group is still at the point of developing their negative controls.  (Tr. 658, 681.) 
 In short, Dr. Hepner was forthright in acknowledging that, in terms of drawing any conclusions with regard to the issue of the validity of measles virus testing, the preliminary data available from her study simply are “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.) In sum, it is clear that the Walker study must be disregarded.  First, both Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin pointed out a number of reasons why one cannot draw any conclusions from, or place any reliance on, the preliminary data from the Walker study.  And even petitioners’ expert Dr. Hepner, one of the study’s own authors, has acknowledged that the preliminary data from the study are “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.)  Accordingly, I must agree with Dr. Hepner on this point.  I conclude that the Walker study is not useful in deciding the issue of whether the Unigenetics measles virus detection testing was reliable. 
 p. 71 
 b.  The Walker study 
 Petitioners also, in their final post-hearing brief in this case, pointed to another item of evidence in the record.  (P4, pp. 33-34.)  They pointed to the ongoing Walker study, discussed above, and note that one of their experts who has worked on that study, Dr. Krigsman, stated that in the study’s initial testing, six specimens were determined to be positive “for vaccine-strain-specific RNA.”  (Tr. 487A.)  However, as I have already discussed above, the preliminary data from the Walker study, in the words of the petitioners’ own expert and co-author of that study, Dr. Hepner, is simply “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.)  Thus, again in Dr. Hepner’s own words, it would not be appropriate for me to “draw any conclusions” from that data.  (Tr. 682.)

 I. The Preliminary Findings of the Walker Study 
 Petitioners also rely on unpublished findings of measles virus in tested bowel tissues taken from autistic children as support for their claim regarding measles persistence.  Petitioners’ expert Dr. Hepner expressed the opinion that the published 2002 Uhlmann findings are “reliable,” see Cedillo Tr. at 639, and her confidence in the reported positive findings of measles virus is bolstered by the preliminary findings of a study on which she is working.  Dr. Hepner discussed her current work with a team of investigators in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Walker at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Dr. Hepner described the project as a study “to create a highly reproducible, highly sensitive, very specific . . .  experimental design to detect [measles virus] RNA in the bowel biopsies of ASD patients.”  Id. at 634A-635A.  She stated that the preliminary findings of the study, which were presented as an abstract at the June 2006 International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR), confirm the presence of vaccine strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.  Id. at 635. 
 Dr. Hepner stated that while positive controls (specifically “an artificial laboratory construct” of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.  Id. at 658, 663, 674-675.  The experimental controls are patients who do not have ASDs but have gastrointestinal symptoms.  Id. at 675.  The experimental group includes ASD patients who have “[inflammatory bowel disease]-like symptoms, but not all of whom have received the MMR vaccine.”  Id. at 676.  She described the preliminary results of the experiments as “a technical achievement” because the investigators “believe that they have developed some assays to detect [measles virus] in this cohort of patients in biopsied tissue that is vaccine strain specific.”  Id. at 682.  But Dr. Hepner declined to “draw any conclusions about the biological significance” of the investigators’ findings.  Id. 
 However, respondent’s expert Dr. Bustin expressed some concern about the preliminary PCR results reported in the Walker abstract presented at the IMFAR conference and discussed in Dr. Hepner’s testimony.  Dr. Bustin’s chief concern after reviewing the slides from the poster presentation is that there is evidence from the location of the bands in the experimental gel that the obtained results are not specific for the intended target.  See id. at 1955A-1958A.  Because the experiment did not include a negative control, a proper determination of what the observed bands show cannot be made. See id. at 1958.  In the absence of both positive and negative controls during a PCR run, Dr. Bustin stated that he “[could not] have any confidence” in the test results.  Id. at 1959A. 
 The testimony during the Cedillo hearing of the parties’ experts, Dr. Hepner for petitioners and Dr. Bustin and Dr. Ward for respondent, made clear that standard laboratory practice requires that positive samples (that always contain the targeted material), negative samples (that never contain the targeted material), experimental samples (the subjects with an exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material), and control samples (the subjects without the exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material) are run during each experiment.  See Cedillo Tr. at 620A, 621A, 627A, 677 (Dr. Hepner); id. at 1842 (Dr. Ward); id. at 1959A (Dr. Bustin). The use of the positive and negative controls provides information about the internal consistency of the experiments.  Informed that test results without the use of these controls during PCR experiments may not be reliable, the undersigned cannot place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study (addressed by petitioners’ experts Drs. Corbier, Hepner, and Krigsman), specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested. 
 pp 175-176 
 Petitioners’ claim that the measles virus can persist in the gut of certain vaccinated children and cause inflammation is based on reported findings of persistent measles virus in the biopsied gut tissue taken from autistic children who have received the MMR vaccine and developed gastrointestinal symptoms.  Petitioners’ reliance, however, on the published reports of positive test results, the unpublished positive findings of the preliminary Walker study, and the positive lab results obtained by Unigenetics lab from biopsied gut tissue taken from children involved in the OAP litigation is unavailing.  Strong evidence, including highly credible expert testimony, indicates there were numerous irregularities in the testing procedures.  Those irregularities compromised the integrity of the conducted tests and have rendered the test results unreliable.  Underscoring the unreliability of the test results is the inability of other laboratories (that is, accredited laboratories not affiliated with either Dr. Wakefield, his colleagues, or the Unigenetics lab) to replicate the reported findings in gastrointestinal tissues or blood cells. 
 Petitioners’ theory is based on the characteristics of the wild-type measles virus rather than on the characteristics of the attenuated vaccine-strain measles virus. Petitioners’ theory is further based on unreliable reports of positive measles findings.  The bases for petitioners’ theory that the measles component of the MMR vaccine can lead to the development of autism are unsound.  Petitioners have failed to offer reliable support for the proposition that the MMR vaccine can cause autism and have failed to meet their burden of proof under the first prong of the Althen standard.

 The Hazlehursts also argue that the special master disregarded critical evidence regarding the reliability of the Walker group's test results, in violation of the Vaccine Act's requirement to consider \"all . . . relevant medical and scientific evidence.\" 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-13(b)(1). They assert that the special master ignored evidence— including testimony from Dr. Hepner and exhibits from the Walker group's 2006 IMFAR poster presentation—showing that the Walker group used genetic sequencing to verify its test results. If the special master had given that evidence proper consideration, the Hazlehursts argue, she would have found that the Walker study reliably detected persistent vaccine-strain measles virus in the bowels of autistic children. The Hazlehursts therefore assert that the special master's decision to accord little weight to the Walker group's test results was arbitrary and capricious. We disagree. 
 As an initial matter, even if the special master had made no explicit reference to the evidence that the Walker group used genetic sequencing, we would presume that she considered that evidence. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Daig Corp., 789 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (\"We presume that a fact finder reviews all the evidence presented unless he explicitly expresses otherwise.\"). In this case, however, it is not necessary to rely on that presumption, as the special master's opinion specifically refers to that evidence. Discussing Dr. Krigsman's testimony, the special master explained: 
 Dr. Krigsman stated that the preliminary findings of that [Walker group] study show that based on the obtained PCR results, measles virus is present in the biopsied gastrointestinal tissue taken from patients with autism and bowel disease and examined by Dr. Krigsman. Dr. Krigsman acknowledged, however, as did Dr. Hepner, that not all of the samples had been sequenced for vaccine strain measles. 
 Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *139 (citations to exhibits and testimony omitted). Thus, the special master clearly understood the testimony that some, though not all, of the Walker group's samples were sequenced to confirm vaccine-strain specificity. Moreover, the exhibits that the special master cited in her opinion included the June 2006 IMFAR abstract and IMFAR poster presentation—the very documents that the Hazlehursts contend were \"ignored.\" We thus cannot conclude that the special master failed to consider the evidence in question, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-13(b)(1). 
 In any event, an examination of the cited exhibits and testimony reveals inconsistent and preliminary data that provides only minimal support for the petitioners' claim that the Walker group confirmed the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus, as opposed to wild-type measles virus. While the abstract states that \"PCR analysis on. . . tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive\" for measles virus, the poster presentation states that \"PCR analysis on . . . tissue from an initial 86 patients showed that 57 (66%) were positive\" for measles virus. With respect to sequencing, the abstract observes that \"[f]ourteen [samples] have been verified by DNA sequence,\" but it does not state whether the sequencing was vaccine-strain specific. The poster presentation, on the other hand, states: \"Thirty five [samples] have currently been verified by DNA sequence. Six of the thirty five MV [measles virus] positive [samples] bear sequence that is specific to vaccine strain MV.\" That information, which suggests that only a small number of samples were successfully sequenced for vaccine-strain measles virus, is confirmed by Dr. Krigsman's testimony: \"All we could say at the time of this poster is that, as far as vaccine-strain-specific sequencing positivity, a total of six specimens [] were positive . . . . So genetic material that was specific for vaccine-strain measles virus was positive in six.\"[ 3 ] Given that the Walker group's data reflects only a small amount of vaccine-strain-specific sequencing, it was not inappropriate for the special master to include only a brief discussion of the Walker group's sequencing efforts in her opinion. 
 The special master's decision to accord little weight to the Walker group's data was largely based on the study's other shortcomings and was thus well within her discretion in weighing the evidence. Most significantly, the special master found that the Walker group's research was unpublished, preliminary, and incomplete. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *124-25, *139, *150. Embodied only in a poster presentation, the Walker study was not subject to peer review and therefore has not been subjected to scrutiny from the greater scientific community. See id. at *16, quoting Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 594 (1993) (\"The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a peer reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive, consideration in assessing the scientific validity of a particular technique or methodology.\"). In fact, Dr. Krigsman and Dr. Hepner repeatedly described the Walker group's data as \"partial\" and \"preliminary.\" As the special master observed, Dr. Hepner testified that she \"certainly wouldn't draw any conclusions about the biological significance\" of the Walker group's test results at that early stage. In particular, Dr. Hepner noted the lack of a \"proper control source\" of tissue samples from children without autism spectrum disorders. She explained that the Walker group's current data does \"not give us any information yet about this cohort of patients relative to a different cohort of patients.\" 
 The special master also expressed misgivings about the Walker group's use of controls in its study. The special master noted that \"while positive controls (specifically `an artificial laboratory construct' of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125. In their reply brief, the Hazlehursts dispute the special master's statement that \"no negative controls have been run.\" They argue that negative \"technical\" controls were run with every sample to check for contamination and to assure the reliability of the PCR testing, even though the Walker group lacked certain \"experimental\" controls, namely, control samples of tissue from children who tested negative for autism. 
 The record is unclear as to precisely what negative controls were run. Although Dr. Hepner testified that \"no-template negative controls\" were run \"as a control for contamination,\" she also stated that the Walker group was still \"in the process of procuring samples that would be appropriate negative controls.\" She further noted that \"the negative control at this point generally has been a no-template control because we don't have access to the right material.\" The confusion is compounded by Dr. Bustin's testimony that he could not rule out the possibility of contamination—suggested by several indicators of unidentified genetic material in the Walker group's poster presentation—because \"there's no negative control there.\" 
 What is clear from the record is that, at the time of the omnibus autism hearings, certain key controls used by the Walker group were incomplete and in flux. Most critical is the undisputed lack of a sufficient control group of non-autistic children with which to compare the positive findings in autistic children. If the Walker group were to find persistent measles virus at comparable rates in both autistic and non-autistic children, for example, such a finding would significantly undermine the petitioners' theory that persistent measles virus contributes to the causation of autism spectrum disorders. Moreover, Dr. Hepner's testimony suggests that the Walker group was also seeking a different type of positive control to rule out the possibility of cross-contamination. That evidence further underscores the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of the Walker group's results. 
 Like the Court of Federal Claims, we do not believe that the Walker group's small amount of vaccine-strain-specific genetic sequencing \"carries enough weight to overcome the special master's conclusion that the Walker group's results were preliminary, unpublished, and not entitled to substantial weight.\" Hazlehurst, 88 Fed. Cl. at 488. We therefore find no error in the special master's determination that she could not \"place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study . . . specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125.

			 This is a revision of a  previous post. 
 On May 28, 2006, The Daily Mail (UK)  published  Sally Beck's article,  \"Scientists fear MMR link to autism.\"  ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-388051/Scientists-fear-MMR-link-autism.html).   I will get to the problems with the study, but first, the problem with the article as it now exists online.  
 The Daily Mail's lack of publication date is a reprehensible failure of  journalism.  The internet is an eternal now; the only signpost for  readers is for publishers (including me)  to indicate  when  a particular piece was published.   Beck's article (like many others, not just at the Daily Mail) exists in the \"eternal now\", giving casual readers the false impression that it is current.   At some point after 2006 The Daily Mail eliminated comments on the article, removing even that clue. It was the date on the comments that alerted me that the article wasn't current. 
 Every few months,  someone comes across Beck's article and assumes (rightly enough, given the context) that the Beck article is current and accurate information. 
  Moving from criticisms of The Daily Mail's internet presence to Beck's article itself and the underlying research: 
 Back in 2006, what Beck referred to as \"new American research\" was actually a poster presentation at the  2006 International Meeting for Autism Research  (IMFAR).   A \"poster presentation\" is a way of presenting preliminary  results from research.In terms of levels of evidence for a particular  hypothesis, it is very weak.  (The complete text of the poster  presentation is below.) 
 The Walker study (never published) in no way validates  Wakefield's fraud .  The MMR vaccine never did not cause autism. 
 I suspect that Wake Forest University, and possibly the lead author,  Walker, was embarrassed, and put out a press release dated   June 1,  2006 press release from  Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center  Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism . (The complete text of the press release is below.) 
 It gets worse.  Two of the complainants in the  Omnibus Autism Proceeding , the  Cedillos  and  Hazelhursts ,  relied upon the unpublished Walker et al. research.  Both the Special Masters in  the hearings, and the presiding judge in the following Hazelhurst appeal,  dismissed the evidentiary value of the Walker et al. study   (exerpts from the hearings and the appeal are below).  In other words, the Walker data have been examined and found unconvincing, because it was scientifically suspect.

 Persistent Ileal Measles Virus In A Large Cohort Of Regressive Autistic Children With Ileocolitis And Lymphonodular Hyperplasia: Revisitation Of An Earlier Study 
 Steve Walker, Karin Hepner, Jeffrey Segal, Arthur Krigsman, Wake Forest University School of Medicine 
 Background: Autistic enterocolitis, consisting of a nonspecific ileocolitis coupled with ileocolonic lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH), was first introduced as a new, potentially virus-induced disease entity eight years ago in a group of ASD children with developmental regression. 
 Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to examine ileal biopsy tissue in a large cohort of pediatric patients who carry a diagnosis of regressive autism and whose chronic gastrointestinal symptoms warranted diagnostic endoscopic evaluation, for evidence of measles virus RNA. 
 Methods: Patients who had been diagnosed with autism and who were referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for evaluation of chronic GI symptoms were eligible to participate in this IRB approved study. For each patient, medical histories, vaccination records, histopathology reports, and ileocolonoscopic biopsy tissue were available for evaluation. Terminal ileum (TI) biopsy tissue was assayed by RT-PCR for the presence of measles virus RNA and PCR-positive samples were sequenced. 
 Results: Medical and clinical data have been collected for >275 patients who fit the study inclusion criteria. PCR analysis on TI biopsy tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive for the F gene amplicon. Fourteen have been verified by DNA sequence and an additional 56 amplicons are being sequenced now. Work is ongoing to assay the remaining specimens (~200) and to identify and assay relevant control tissue samples. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this large cohort of pediatric autistic patients with chronic GI symptoms confirm earlier findings of measles virus RNA in the terminal ileum and support an association between measles virus and ileocolitis /LNH.

 Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism  6/1/2006 
 WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – An American scientist whose research replicates a connection published in England in 2002 between the measles virus and bowel disease in autistic children strongly warns against making the “leap” to suggesting that the measles vaccine might actually cause autism. 
 “That is not what our research is showing,” said Stephen J. Walker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. Walker and colleagues have issued an abstract to be presented at this week’s International Meeting for Autism Research, indicating that a high percentage of autistic children that they have tested with chronic bowel disease show evidence of measles virus in their intestines. 
 Some observers have said that the presence of the measles virus indicates a strong possibility that the measles vaccine, a possible source of the virus, could have caused the children’s autism. That possible connection has caused a major controversy in the United Kingdom, where the connection was first made in 2002. The vaccine is first given as part of a triple vaccine called MMR – for measles, mumps and rubella – at ages 12-18 months. That is shortly before a particular type of autism (regressive) begins to appear in children afflicted with the condition, which has fueled the speculation about a connection. 
 Walker says the new research does not support the connection, and he notes that the results have not even been published in a peer-reviewed journal. “Even if we showed association (between measles virus and bowel disease) and we published it in a peer-reviewed journal, the conclusion will be simply that there is measles virus in the gut of a large number of children who have regressive autism and bowel disease. End of story. 
 “We haven’t done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease.” 
 Walker explains that exploring the causes of chronic bowel disease in autistic children is the major impetus for his research. “There are lots of viruses in the gut, and any one of them could be causing inflammation. If it truly is from a vaccine and this virus causes inflammation and a chronic bowel condition in some susceptible children, then that’s something that needs to be known.” 
 The main task at hand, Walker said, is to determine what is causing the bowel condition in the autistic children, a condition that has a direct influence on cognitive and behavioral issues associated with autism. 
 A high percentage of autistic children have chronic bowel disease, a discovery in the late 1990s that eventually led to the measles virus connection. 
 “If anybody has severe GI problems, it causes problems with focus, it causes problems with everything. You can’t do anything until you get that resolved. We’ve all experienced that. 
 “These kids experience it hour after hour every single day of their lives. Many of them are non-verbal so they can’t tell anybody what the problem is, and the behavior that they exhibit as a result of a severe stomach ache was once attributed to just being autistic and having weird behaviors – for example, leaning over the sharp edge of a coffee table for hours at a time. That seems weird, but what they’re doing is relieving pressure on their lower abdomen.” 
 Walker said that relieving the bowel discomfort has been shown to improve other conditions associated with autism, such as cognition and the ability to learn. “There’s case after case where kids improved cognitively, behaviorally and biomedically when you treat the bowel disease. There is a great improvement from better nutrition alone. You see improvements in their overall condition.” 
 Walker said he will continue to look for possible causes, the biological mechanism, and new treatments of the bowel condition. “That’s the goal for me: understanding the biology of what’s causing the disease and then gaining insight into the most effective way to treat it, so that clinicians will not have to go through a trial and error approach.”

 page 46-47 
 Finally, Dr. Hepner pointed to a study that is currently in progress, conducted by herself and several others, to which I will refer as the “Walker study.”  She stated that the “preliminary data” from that study “present another step in support” of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of autistic children.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.) 
 page 64-65 
 c.  The Walker study 
 Petitioners have also relied on a study that is currently in progress, conducted by Dr. Hepner and several others, often described as the “Walker study.”  (See Ex. 59, Tab K; P. Trial Ex. 3.) Dr. Hepner stated that the “preliminary data” from that study “present another step in support” of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of some autistic children.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; see also Tr. 634A-35A.)  After consideration of the Walker study and the testimony about it in the record of this case, however, I conclude that the study does not provide any substantial support to the proposition that the measles virus persists in the bodies of Michelle Cedillo or any other autistic individuals. 
 Dr. Hepner reported that she and three other researchers--Steve Walker, Jeff Segal, and Dr. Arthur Krigsman, the latter being another of petitioners’ experts in this case--are engaged in a study similar to the Uhlmann study, in that their objective is to perform PCR testing for the detection of measles virus on intestinal biopsies of children with both developmental delay and gastrointestinal symptoms.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.)  Dr. Hepner stated that the researchers generated “multiple primer sets” and “tested them for their specificity and sensitivity” in identifying the presence of measles virus.  (Tr. 635A; Ex. 63, p. 5.)  Dr. Hepner and Dr. Krigsman testified that the study, which began in 2003, is not yet complete, but that the group conducted some initial testing and presented “preliminary data” from the study at an autism-related conference in 2006, in the form of a “poster presentation” (literally, a poster board describing the study was set on an easel at the conference). (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 474A-75, 634A.)  Dr. Hepner reported that of 82 biopsy samples tested in the study’s initial testing, which all came from children with both “developmental delay” and “GI [gastrointestinal] symptoms,” 70 tested positive for measles virus.  (Ex. 63, p. 5.)  She further stated, without explanation, that her group was able “to confirm vaccine strain specificity” in some of the positive samples.  (Tr. 635A.) 
 Petitioners, in their post-hearing briefs, have relied on the Walker study as supportive of their view that the Unigenetics measles virus testing should be considered reliable.  (P1, pp. 141, 154-55, 242; P3, pp. 33-34.)  After full consideration, however, I cannot agree. First, two of respondent’s experts, Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin, each pointed to a number of flaws in the Walker study, based on the description in the poster presentation.  (Tr. 1861-65; 1952A- 59A.) 
 Moreover, a second important reason to discount the Walker study is the testimony of Dr. Hepner herself.  Dr. Hepner stated that the initial data from her study were only “very preliminary data.”  (Tr. 659.)  She acknowledged that it would be inappropriate to “draw any conclusions” from those preliminary results.  (Tr. 682.)  She acknowledged that her group at this time is still attempting “to test this assay, to optimize the assay” (Tr. 660A)--i.e., to develop the test to a point where they can then be confident that their test is yielding reliable results.  Part of developing any such test is to use “negative controls”--i.e., to test samples that are known to be free of the target, to make sure that the test is not erroneously identifying the target in samples that do not contain it.  However, Dr. Hepner explained that her group is still at the point of developing their negative controls.  (Tr. 658, 681.) 
 In short, Dr. Hepner was forthright in acknowledging that, in terms of drawing any conclusions with regard to the issue of the validity of measles virus testing, the preliminary data available from her study simply are “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.) In sum, it is clear that the Walker study must be disregarded.  First, both Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin pointed out a number of reasons why one cannot draw any conclusions from, or place any reliance on, the preliminary data from the Walker study.  And even petitioners’ expert Dr. Hepner, one of the study’s own authors, has acknowledged that the preliminary data from the study are “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.)  Accordingly, I must agree with Dr. Hepner on this point.  I conclude that the Walker study is not useful in deciding the issue of whether the Unigenetics measles virus detection testing was reliable. 
 p. 71 
 b.  The Walker study 
 Petitioners also, in their final post-hearing brief in this case, pointed to another item of evidence in the record.  (P4, pp. 33-34.)  They pointed to the ongoing Walker study, discussed above, and note that one of their experts who has worked on that study, Dr. Krigsman, stated that in the study’s initial testing, six specimens were determined to be positive “for vaccine-strain-specific RNA.”  (Tr. 487A.)  However, as I have already discussed above, the preliminary data from the Walker study, in the words of the petitioners’ own expert and co-author of that study, Dr. Hepner, is simply “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.)  Thus, again in Dr. Hepner’s own words, it would not be appropriate for me to “draw any conclusions” from that data.  (Tr. 682.)

 I. The Preliminary Findings of the Walker Study 
 Petitioners also rely on unpublished findings of measles virus in tested bowel tissues taken from autistic children as support for their claim regarding measles persistence.  Petitioners’ expert Dr. Hepner expressed the opinion that the published 2002 Uhlmann findings are “reliable,” see Cedillo Tr. at 639, and her confidence in the reported positive findings of measles virus is bolstered by the preliminary findings of a study on which she is working.  Dr. Hepner discussed her current work with a team of investigators in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Walker at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Dr. Hepner described the project as a study “to create a highly reproducible, highly sensitive, very specific . . .  experimental design to detect [measles virus] RNA in the bowel biopsies of ASD patients.”  Id. at 634A-635A.  She stated that the preliminary findings of the study, which were presented as an abstract at the June 2006 International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR), confirm the presence of vaccine strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.  Id. at 635. 
 Dr. Hepner stated that while positive controls (specifically “an artificial laboratory construct” of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.  Id. at 658, 663, 674-675.  The experimental controls are patients who do not have ASDs but have gastrointestinal symptoms.  Id. at 675.  The experimental group includes ASD patients who have “[inflammatory bowel disease]-like symptoms, but not all of whom have received the MMR vaccine.”  Id. at 676.  She described the preliminary results of the experiments as “a technical achievement” because the investigators “believe that they have developed some assays to detect [measles virus] in this cohort of patients in biopsied tissue that is vaccine strain specific.”  Id. at 682.  But Dr. Hepner declined to “draw any conclusions about the biological significance” of the investigators’ findings.  Id. 
 However, respondent’s expert Dr. Bustin expressed some concern about the preliminary PCR results reported in the Walker abstract presented at the IMFAR conference and discussed in Dr. Hepner’s testimony.  Dr. Bustin’s chief concern after reviewing the slides from the poster presentation is that there is evidence from the location of the bands in the experimental gel that the obtained results are not specific for the intended target.  See id. at 1955A-1958A.  Because the experiment did not include a negative control, a proper determination of what the observed bands show cannot be made. See id. at 1958.  In the absence of both positive and negative controls during a PCR run, Dr. Bustin stated that he “[could not] have any confidence” in the test results.  Id. at 1959A. 
 The testimony during the Cedillo hearing of the parties’ experts, Dr. Hepner for petitioners and Dr. Bustin and Dr. Ward for respondent, made clear that standard laboratory practice requires that positive samples (that always contain the targeted material), negative samples (that never contain the targeted material), experimental samples (the subjects with an exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material), and control samples (the subjects without the exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material) are run during each experiment.  See Cedillo Tr. at 620A, 621A, 627A, 677 (Dr. Hepner); id. at 1842 (Dr. Ward); id. at 1959A (Dr. Bustin). The use of the positive and negative controls provides information about the internal consistency of the experiments.  Informed that test results without the use of these controls during PCR experiments may not be reliable, the undersigned cannot place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study (addressed by petitioners’ experts Drs. Corbier, Hepner, and Krigsman), specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested. 
 pp 175-176 
 Petitioners’ claim that the measles virus can persist in the gut of certain vaccinated children and cause inflammation is based on reported findings of persistent measles virus in the biopsied gut tissue taken from autistic children who have received the MMR vaccine and developed gastrointestinal symptoms.  Petitioners’ reliance, however, on the published reports of positive test results, the unpublished positive findings of the preliminary Walker study, and the positive lab results obtained by Unigenetics lab from biopsied gut tissue taken from children involved in the OAP litigation is unavailing.  Strong evidence, including highly credible expert testimony, indicates there were numerous irregularities in the testing procedures.  Those irregularities compromised the integrity of the conducted tests and have rendered the test results unreliable.  Underscoring the unreliability of the test results is the inability of other laboratories (that is, accredited laboratories not affiliated with either Dr. Wakefield, his colleagues, or the Unigenetics lab) to replicate the reported findings in gastrointestinal tissues or blood cells. 
 Petitioners’ theory is based on the characteristics of the wild-type measles virus rather than on the characteristics of the attenuated vaccine-strain measles virus. Petitioners’ theory is further based on unreliable reports of positive measles findings.  The bases for petitioners’ theory that the measles component of the MMR vaccine can lead to the development of autism are unsound.  Petitioners have failed to offer reliable support for the proposition that the MMR vaccine can cause autism and have failed to meet their burden of proof under the first prong of the Althen standard.

 The Hazlehursts also argue that the special master disregarded critical evidence regarding the reliability of the Walker group's test results, in violation of the Vaccine Act's requirement to consider \"all . . . relevant medical and scientific evidence.\" 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-13(b)(1). They assert that the special master ignored evidence— including testimony from Dr. Hepner and exhibits from the Walker group's 2006 IMFAR poster presentation—showing that the Walker group used genetic sequencing to verify its test results. If the special master had given that evidence proper consideration, the Hazlehursts argue, she would have found that the Walker study reliably detected persistent vaccine-strain measles virus in the bowels of autistic children. The Hazlehursts therefore assert that the special master's decision to accord little weight to the Walker group's test results was arbitrary and capricious. We disagree. 
 As an initial matter, even if the special master had made no explicit reference to the evidence that the Walker group used genetic sequencing, we would presume that she considered that evidence. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Daig Corp., 789 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (\"We presume that a fact finder reviews all the evidence presented unless he explicitly expresses otherwise.\"). In this case, however, it is not necessary to rely on that presumption, as the special master's opinion specifically refers to that evidence. Discussing Dr. Krigsman's testimony, the special master explained: 
 Dr. Krigsman stated that the preliminary findings of that [Walker group] study show that based on the obtained PCR results, measles virus is present in the biopsied gastrointestinal tissue taken from patients with autism and bowel disease and examined by Dr. Krigsman. Dr. Krigsman acknowledged, however, as did Dr. Hepner, that not all of the samples had been sequenced for vaccine strain measles. 
 Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *139 (citations to exhibits and testimony omitted). Thus, the special master clearly understood the testimony that some, though not all, of the Walker group's samples were sequenced to confirm vaccine-strain specificity. Moreover, the exhibits that the special master cited in her opinion included the June 2006 IMFAR abstract and IMFAR poster presentation—the very documents that the Hazlehursts contend were \"ignored.\" We thus cannot conclude that the special master failed to consider the evidence in question, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-13(b)(1). 
 In any event, an examination of the cited exhibits and testimony reveals inconsistent and preliminary data that provides only minimal support for the petitioners' claim that the Walker group confirmed the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus, as opposed to wild-type measles virus. While the abstract states that \"PCR analysis on. . . tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive\" for measles virus, the poster presentation states that \"PCR analysis on . . . tissue from an initial 86 patients showed that 57 (66%) were positive\" for measles virus. With respect to sequencing, the abstract observes that \"[f]ourteen [samples] have been verified by DNA sequence,\" but it does not state whether the sequencing was vaccine-strain specific. The poster presentation, on the other hand, states: \"Thirty five [samples] have currently been verified by DNA sequence. Six of the thirty five MV [measles virus] positive [samples] bear sequence that is specific to vaccine strain MV.\" That information, which suggests that only a small number of samples were successfully sequenced for vaccine-strain measles virus, is confirmed by Dr. Krigsman's testimony: \"All we could say at the time of this poster is that, as far as vaccine-strain-specific sequencing positivity, a total of six specimens [] were positive . . . . So genetic material that was specific for vaccine-strain measles virus was positive in six.\"[ 3 ] Given that the Walker group's data reflects only a small amount of vaccine-strain-specific sequencing, it was not inappropriate for the special master to include only a brief discussion of the Walker group's sequencing efforts in her opinion. 
 The special master's decision to accord little weight to the Walker group's data was largely based on the study's other shortcomings and was thus well within her discretion in weighing the evidence. Most significantly, the special master found that the Walker group's research was unpublished, preliminary, and incomplete. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *124-25, *139, *150. Embodied only in a poster presentation, the Walker study was not subject to peer review and therefore has not been subjected to scrutiny from the greater scientific community. See id. at *16, quoting Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 594 (1993) (\"The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a peer reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive, consideration in assessing the scientific validity of a particular technique or methodology.\"). In fact, Dr. Krigsman and Dr. Hepner repeatedly described the Walker group's data as \"partial\" and \"preliminary.\" As the special master observed, Dr. Hepner testified that she \"certainly wouldn't draw any conclusions about the biological significance\" of the Walker group's test results at that early stage. In particular, Dr. Hepner noted the lack of a \"proper control source\" of tissue samples from children without autism spectrum disorders. She explained that the Walker group's current data does \"not give us any information yet about this cohort of patients relative to a different cohort of patients.\" 
 The special master also expressed misgivings about the Walker group's use of controls in its study. The special master noted that \"while positive controls (specifically `an artificial laboratory construct' of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125. In their reply brief, the Hazlehursts dispute the special master's statement that \"no negative controls have been run.\" They argue that negative \"technical\" controls were run with every sample to check for contamination and to assure the reliability of the PCR testing, even though the Walker group lacked certain \"experimental\" controls, namely, control samples of tissue from children who tested negative for autism. 
 The record is unclear as to precisely what negative controls were run. Although Dr. Hepner testified that \"no-template negative controls\" were run \"as a control for contamination,\" she also stated that the Walker group was still \"in the process of procuring samples that would be appropriate negative controls.\" She further noted that \"the negative control at this point generally has been a no-template control because we don't have access to the right material.\" The confusion is compounded by Dr. Bustin's testimony that he could not rule out the possibility of contamination—suggested by several indicators of unidentified genetic material in the Walker group's poster presentation—because \"there's no negative control there.\" 
 What is clear from the record is that, at the time of the omnibus autism hearings, certain key controls used by the Walker group were incomplete and in flux. Most critical is the undisputed lack of a sufficient control group of non-autistic children with which to compare the positive findings in autistic children. If the Walker group were to find persistent measles virus at comparable rates in both autistic and non-autistic children, for example, such a finding would significantly undermine the petitioners' theory that persistent measles virus contributes to the causation of autism spectrum disorders. Moreover, Dr. Hepner's testimony suggests that the Walker group was also seeking a different type of positive control to rule out the possibility of cross-contamination. That evidence further underscores the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of the Walker group's results. 
 Like the Court of Federal Claims, we do not believe that the Walker group's small amount of vaccine-strain-specific genetic sequencing \"carries enough weight to overcome the special master's conclusion that the Walker group's results were preliminary, unpublished, and not entitled to substantial weight.\" Hazlehurst, 88 Fed. Cl. at 488. We therefore find no error in the special master's determination that she could not \"place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study . . . specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125.

Brian Deer , the reporter who broke the story exposing the possible misdeeds involved in the MMR-causes-autism research conducted at the Royal Free Hospital by Wakefield et al., has a story out in the  Sunday Times : Truth of the MMR vaccine scandal 
 After an epic misconduct hearing, the doctors who caused panic over the vaccine are about to learn their fate. A report on the greatest health scare of recent times The story re-introduces the readers to the story of MMR scare and how it began.  I suspect the real story will come out after the GMC decision is handed down and details from the patient records are discussed as in Brian Deer’s recent articles such as  MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism . Mr. Deer faces a pretty major smear campaign from Dr. Wakefield’s supporters.  I can only expect it to get worse after the decision is handed down–whatever that decision may be.

			 Beginning in 1998, Andrew Wakefield proposed the hypothesis that being vaccinated against measles contributed to autism, including identifying a new syndrome, \"autistic enterocolitis\",  in which autism was in part gastrointestinal inflammation caused by vaccination against measles.  His research was  roundly debunked,  and the majority of his co-authors  retracted their contributions . 

 However, belief in the vaccination-autism connection lived on.   A case study, repeating Wakefield's method of sampling gut tissue, has just been published in the  Public Library of Science   journal, PLOS-One. This study provides strong evidence  against  association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract  or  MMR exposure. Autism with GI disturbances is associated with elevated rates of regression in language or other skills and  may  represent an endophenotype distinct from other ASD. Predictably, anti-vaccination activists and those who insist that vaccination  does too  cause autism are decrying the study.

"20939" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/01/06/brian-deer-in-the-bmj-how-the-case-against-the-mmr-vaccine-was-fixed/" "Brian Deer in the BMJ: How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed" "Brian Deer, the investigative journalist who broke the story of the misdeeds of Andrew Wakefield, has a new article in the BMJ,  How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed .  The article is prefaced: In the first part of a special BMJ series, Brian Deer exposes the bogus data behind claims that launched a worldwide scare over the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and reveals how the appearance of a link with autism was manufactured at a London medical school This article is damning enough,  but as a series this may lay out clearly, in one place, the cases behind the multiple ethical breaches which cost Andrew Wakefield his license to practice medicine in the UK. Some may ask “why?”  There is so much information out there about Mr. Wakefield and his misdeeds.  Do we really need it again?  I would say yes.  In this BMJ series we have the research (and other) ethical lapses laid out in a medical journal.  No lengthy GMC transcripts.  No news stories with false balance.  No “Callous Disregard” book. The full article is worth the read.  Here is the summary from today’s article.   How the link was fixed 
 The Lancet paper was a case series of 12 child patients; it reported a proposed “new syndrome” of enterocolitis and regressive autism and associated this with MMR as an “apparent precipitating event.” But in fact: 
 •	Three of nine children reported with regressive autism did not have autism diagnosed at all. Only one child clearly had regressive autism 
 •	Despite the paper claiming that all 12 children were “previously normal,” five had documented pre-existing developmental concerns 
 •	Some children were reported to have experienced first behavioural symptoms within days of MMR, but the records documented these as starting some months after vaccination 
 •	In nine cases, unremarkable colonic histopathology results—noting no or minimal fluctuations in inflammatory cell populations—were changed after a medical school “research review” to “non-specific colitis” 
 •	The parents of eight children were reported as blaming MMR, but 11 families made this allegation at the hospital. The exclusion of three allegations—all giving times to onset of problems in months—helped to create the appearance of a 14 day temporal link 
 •	Patients were recruited through anti-MMR campaigners, and the study was commissioned and funded for planned litigation In multiple ways, the story of the Lancet article was crafted to support the conclusion Mr. Wakefield had–a conclusion he came to  before  starting on the research project. Yes, before. In his research proposal to the legal aid board, Mr. Wakefield made the following statement (quoted in Mr. Deer’s article): ““In contrast with the IBD cases [those set out in paragraph 2] which have a prima facie gastrointestinal pathology, children with enteritis/disintegrative disorder form part of a new syndrome. Nonetheless, the evidence is undeniably in favour of a specific vaccine induced pathology. ”   Mr. Deer presents a table comparing how the Lancet article reported the 12 children and how the records really show their cases.  He compares regressive autism (only 1 patient’s records clearly show it), non-specific colitis (only 3 children showed it) and whether symptoms occured in the days following MMR (10 clearly did not, 2 are unclear).  In all, none of the Lancet 12 children had all three features. So that is the Lancet 12: the foundation of the vaccine scare. No case was free of misreporting or alteration. Taken together, NHS records cannot be reconciled with what was published, to such devastating effect, in the journal. Mr. Deer opens his piece with a discussion he had with the father of child 11.  Mr. 11 did not agree with the way his son was represented in the Lancet article.  Mr. 11 states: “Please let me know if Andrew W has his doctor’s license revoked,” wrote Mr 11, who is convinced that many vaccines and environmental pollutants may be responsible for childhood brain disorders. “His misrepresentation of my son in his research paper is inexcusable. His motives for this I may never know.” We may never know the motives.  In the end, I don’t care.  It is the damage that this fraudulent research has caused to the autism communities and to public health that matter.  Countless families have believed Mr. Wakefield, with parents blaming themselves for causing their child’s disability.  As to public health, Mr. Wakefield is responsible for a drop in vaccine uptake in the UK, which led to disease and death.

Learning Disabilities Associations (Canada, Ontario) Do Not Support the Porter/NBACL Full Inclusion Model
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the MacKay Inclusion Review the Autism Society of New Brunswick opposed the full or extreme inclusion model which Gordon Porter and the NBACL is now in the process of again imposing on New Brunswick students.  I have commented many times expressing my personal opposition to the inflexible full inclusion beliefs which have caused harm to my severely autistic son and others for whom the mainstream classroom is not an appropriate educational environment.  This is not just an issue though between some parents of autistic children and the NBACL/Porter Full Inclusion true believers. The Learning Disabilities Associations of Canada and Ontario have also opposed the full inclusion model which limits placement options, causes physical harm to some, and deprives some of a real education:  
 
 
 LEARNING DISABILITIES ASSOCIATION OF ONTARIO  
 
 POLICY STATEMENT ON EDUCATIONAL INCLUSION FOR 
 
 STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES  
 
 
 The following policy statement of the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada  (LDAC) was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Learning Disabilities Association of Ontario (LDAO), as recommended by the LDAO Legislation and Policy Committee, on November 17, 2008.  
 
 
 
 Learning Disabilities Association of Canada (LDAC) Policy Statement on  
 
 Educational Inclusion for Students with Learning Disabilities (presented to the  
 
 LDAC Executive Committee in February 2005, the LDAC Board of Directors in June 2005 and ratified on November 26, 2005).  
 
 
 
 STATEMENT 
 
 
 
 The Learning Disabilities Association of Canada (LDAC) does not support full  
 
 educational inclusion or any policies that mandate the same placement, instruction,  or treatment of all students with learning disabilities or the idea that all students with learning disabilities must be served only in regular education classrooms at the exclusion of all other special education placement options.  
 
 
 
 LDAC believes that full inclusion, when defined this way, violates the rights of parents and students with disabilities guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedom and Human Rights Codes which guarantee education equality and freedom from discrimination and rejects the arbitrary placement of all students in any one setting.   
 
 
 
 LDAC supports the availability of a continuum of education services as prescribed in an individual educational plan for each student with learning disabilities to ensure success and must be flexible enough to meet the changing needs of students with learning disabilities by:   
 
 
 
 
 1) Providing a range of options and services and diverse learning environments  
 
 (placements) to meet the specific needs of each student;   
 
 
 
 2) Providing the most enabling environment for that student that will effectively meet the student’s best interests socially, emotionally, behaviourally, physically and educationally; and,  
 
 
 
 3) Focus on what is in the best interest of the student and, in that context, consider all the needs of the student as expressed by the student and his/her parents and that of their consulting professionals.   
 
 
 
 RATIONALE  
 
 
 
 Because each student with learning disabilities has unique needs, an individualized education plan and placement must be tailored on individual strengths and needs. For one student, the plan may be provided in the regular classroom yet for another student, the regular classroom may be an inappropriate placement and may need alternative instructional environments, teaching strategies, and/or materials that cannot or will not be provided within the context of the regular classroom environment. The severity and nature of the individual needs should determine the alternative teaching strategies, accommodations, resources, supports and placement required. 
 
 
 
The LDAO repeated their opposition to a mainstream classroom inclusion only policy in a  February 10, 2009 letter to Ontario Education Minister Kathleen Wynne .  The letter stressed the need for a range of placement options based on the needs of the individual student: 
 
 
 
 
 
Inclusion is good when it means something more than placement in a common mainstream classroom. Inclusion is good when it does not deprive individual students with a range of education placement options that suitable for their needs.  Inclusion is good when it is evidence based on the best interests of the individual student.  Flexible inclusion is good.   
 
 
 
Inflexible, dogmatic, everyone in the classroom philosophy is not good.  It harms some students and deprives them of a meaningful, happy education experience.   Autism advocates in New Brunswick fought the extreme everyone in the mainstream classroom model during the MacKay and Ministerial Committee inclusion reviews.   We were successful in ensuring the enactment of an inclusive education definition by our Department of Education which recognizes that real inclusion means an approach which assesses the individual needs, abilities and challenges of individual students on an evidence basis.   
 
 
 
Now Gordon Porter and the NBACL, both of which oppose the evidence based approach,  are now in charge. They are effectively writing and enforcing their extreme mainstream classroom inclusive education for all policy for the Alward government.  Autism parents must be vigilant in resisting their back to the future philosophy and insist on an evidence based approach guided by our children's best interest; as radical as those concepts may seem to Mr Porter and company.   
 
 
 
It is not clear where the Learning Disabilities Association of New Brunswick stands on these issues but their counterparts in the LDA of Canada and Ontario have spoken clearly and their positions are consistent with an evidence based student centered approach.  Their clear, strong positions will be of great help in our efforts.

Autism and Education: The  Full Inclusion  Mainstream Classroom For All  Standard Discriminates Against Some Autistic Children
" "
   Extreme Full Inclusion Model of Education in Canada  and New Brunswick has Discriminated Against  Some Children With Autism Disorders 
 Imposing a standard, namely that the inclusive classroom meets all needs, is a perception not based on reality and is stereotypical. In other words, the standard takes the position that one environment meets the needs of all special needs children. By its very nature, such a standard is discriminatory, as was made clear by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Meiorin, Grismer, Law and Mercier decisions . 
 
 THE FULLY INCLUSIVE CLASSROOM IS ONLY ONE OF THE RIGHT WAYS TO MEET THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD 
 Presented by Yude M. Henteleff, C.M., Q.C. 
to the 
C.A.C.L. NATIONAL SUMMIT ON INCLUSIVE EDUCATION 
OTTAWA, ONTARIO 
NOVEMBER 24, 2004 
 The above document by Yude Hentelleff  QC  should  be mandatory reading for Educators and Human Rights Commission and Tribunal  members across Canada.  Unfortunately that does not appear to be the case particularly in New Brunswick where the extreme full mainstream classroom inclusion model has been pushed relentlessly by Gordon Porter, the New Brunswick Association for Community Living and senior officials in the Department of Education.   
 Meanwhile some children, including some autistic children, for whom the mainstream classroom is not the right learning environment are forced into situations where they injure themselves, or others, in order to get out of an environment which is not the right option for them; an environment that overwhelms and harms therm.  My son, fortunately, has been accommodated in a separate learning environment for his primary ABA based instruction in our neighborhood schools with time spent in common areas of the school for other activities where he does get to interact with other students.  Conor was removed from the mainstream classroom, at our request, after he came home every day with bite marks on his hands and wrists.  He has been well accommodated by our schools and our school district. Other students for whom the mainstream classroom is not the right option have not always been so fortunate.

I am reading the Ontario Ministry of Education guidelines for developing and implementing individual education plans (IEPs). I read similar legal documents when Ben was much younger, but over time it seemed that what was written in his IEP wasn't necessarily followed, often because of a lack of resources. 
 
Here are the most salient points I've learned, some of which I had no understanding of and which were never explained to me. This information is taken from  Individual Education Plans: Standards for Development, Program Planning and Implementation, 2000 , and  The IEP, A Resource Guide, 2004 . 
 
The IEP is supposed to set specific, observable, measurable annual goals and learning expectations against which the student's progress is  continually  assessed. 
 
The IEP is based on individual student strengths and needs that are specific, consistent with the IPRC and supported by assessments. In the information-gathering stage, students share their perceptions of their strengths and needs,  talents and interests . Information about the student's personal characteristics, hobbies or interests and non-academic accomplishments can be included. Students assist in setting goals and understand the IEP so they can actively work to achieve it. 
 
The IEP lists the teaching strategies, accommodations, staff and equipment needed to support the student's learning. 
 
The student's current level of achievement in each subject, course or skill is described to act as a baseline against which progress is regularly measured and recorded in the IEP. 
 
Students may be working on 'modified' or 'alternative' curriculum. 
 
Modified curriculum means that changes are made to typical grade-level expectations. Students may have goals based on a different grade level or the number and complexity of the regular grade level expectations may be altered. 
 
Alternative expectations are not tied to the Ontario curriculum and tend to focus on life skills. Alternative programs include speech remediation, social skills, personal care and transit training. At the high-school level, they are non-credit courses.  \"For the vast majority of students, these programs would be given  in addition  to modified or regular grade-level expectations. A very small number of students who are unable to demonstrate even the most basic literacy or numeracy skills may receive only an alternative report.\" 
 
I had no understanding of the difference between modified and alternative programs and was surprised to learn that all of my son's programs are alternative and that he has no specific IEP goals related to reading, even though he can read! 
 
The IEP must describe how the student's achievement of goals will be assessed and results must be reported to parents on the provincial report card. Teacher comments on student strengths, areas for improvement and new steps in reaching the goals must be identified in the IEP. 
 
Regular evaluation to ensure the student is meeting goals is required, and if the student is not progressing, the IEP needs to be revised. 
 
If the student can't participate in a provincial assessment, it must be noted why on the IEP. 
 
If the student is 14 or older, a transition plan must be included in the IEP. It must include specific goals based on the strengths, needs and  interests  of the student. They must relate to work, further education or community living and include actions necessary each year to help the student achieve them. 
 
Students in high school must be given the opportunity to provide input into the IEP. \"Open communication and cooperation between home and school will...ensure that the two have similar expectations.\" 
 
I feel silly that I wasn't better educated and up to date on IEPs. At some point I made the mistake of thinking that I could trust educators to do what was best for my son. That is obviously not the case and that is why parents have to take an active role in developing and monitoring their child's IEP.  
 
Tell us your IEP story!

Some Autistic Students Do Well In The Mainstream Classroom and Some Do Not
" "
 KESQ.com  in Palm Springs, California reports that an increasing amount of autistic students are leaving special education classes and integrating into mainstream classrooms.  Educators in the area provide the support necessary and they recognize that the mainstream classroom does not work for ALL students with autism.  They look at what works best for each student: \"In the past we had children undiagnosed in general education, coping or diagnosed incorrectly without the support needed,\" says Palm Springs Unified Schools District's Autism Specialist Sally Talala. Entering into a traditional classroom isn't for every child with autism. Specialists say it takes a team approach to find out what is best for each individual. The assistance team is growing. Parents, schools and specialists work together to place each child in the right class for their specific needs. They take a look at social skills, communication and behavior, integrating those with more mild cases. Here in New Brunswick, in recent years, much has been done to further the  education and well being of autistic students.  Teacher assistants and resource teachers have been receiving autism specific training through the University of New Brunswick College of Extended Learning Autism Intervention Training Program.  The autism specific training has helped provide many autistic students receive a real education. Some autistic students can receive their education in the classroom for all or part of the day. Some of our schools have also begun to accommodate the needs of those autistic children, like my son Conor, for whom education in the general classroom for most of the day is an overwhelming,  counterproductive and even harmful experience.  They are taught in smaller, quieter, less busy  areas where they can receive one on one instruction, by autism appropriate learning methods and with a curriculum suitable to their development level.   They are also brought into the mainstream classroom for brief periods for activities within their individual ability ranges. Despite this progress there are those in New Brunswick who insist that the mainstream classroom is the right place for all students.  Their intentions are noble but their understanding of autistic children is lacking.  Their beliefs are part of a philosophy of total classroom inclusion for all students that has dominated the New Brunswick education system for the past thirty years.  The recent efforts to accommodate the needs of autistic students has been met with determined resistance by the total inclusion advocates who include the current Chair of the New Brunswick Human Rights Commission  who was instrumental in promoting New Brunswick's total inclusion philosophy,  the Executive Director and other representatives of the New Brunswick Association for Community Living,  and some senior Education Department officials. Despite the efforts of these very influential, well connected advocates of total mainstream inclusion progress has been made. There are  people in government, in the Department of Education, school districts and schools who have made decisions in the best interests of autistic children notwithstanding pressure from the total inclusion advocates. Hopefully those autistic children who can learn in the mainstream classroom will continue to be educated there while those autistic children for whom the mainstream classroom is not appropriate will continue to be accommodated in  learning environments suitable for them in light of their autistic conditions. Hopefully the best interests of autistic children will continue to prevail over the rigid philosophical beliefs of the total mainstream classroom inclusion advocates. autism

 A new school in my area is dedicated to providing children with special needs with a positive environment, as well as the educational and support services they need.  It seems odd that I’m actually considering this, because, years ago, I was committed to ensuring all of my children had the benefits of an inclusive educational environment.  Unfortunately, in this school district, that goal was unattainable. 
 Alex and Ben have both been placed in segregated school environments since they entered elementary school, where they have minimal interactions with regular education peers.  They have primarily attended school in what is called a “CD” or cognitively disabled classroom—a classroom positioned “off to the side” of the regular classrooms that is designed specifically for children with more severe special needs.  More recently, Ben has been pulled out of even this environment and placed in an even more isolated classroom due to his behaviors. 
 According to the principle of “least restrictive environment,” the ideal situation for both boys is an environment that provides them with the educational and support services they need in an environment that places the “least restrictions” on them.  Now that a new environment is available, I’m beginning to suspect that the least restrictive environment will be a school committed to their needs, instead of a room segregated from their peers. 
 Today I will visit this new school and see the environment for myself.  If I like what I see, I’m going to take a serious look at what is being provided for my children versus what could be provided for them.  If the new environment is indeed a better environment for their education, then that will become a new goal.  The idea isn’t, however, to have them “placed” somewhere specific, but to have their needs met in a way in a better, more successful way.  Of course, I’m already meeting with resistance to the idea, but I’m up to the challenge!

Autism Dad's Concerns About Role of Premier's Council on the Status of Disabled Persons
" "
Following is a letter I forwarded to the Premier's Council on the Status of Disabled Persons. New Brunswick has just spent the last few 2-3 years reviewing its inclusive education system which has focussed on mainstream classroom inclusion for all students. As mentioned in the letter this approach does not work for ALL students including some autistic students such as my son. Our Education Department HAS provided for exceptions for students such as my son,providing an alternate learning environment and when available trained Teachers' Aides. The Department is now working to improve the deficit of trained personnel to work with our many autistic school children. But it makes no sense to engage in a review and make services available if educators and parents are pressured to place all children in the mainstream classroom regardless of whether they are well served by such placement.  From: HAROLD L DOHERTY [mailto:dohertylaw@rogers.com] Sent: March 28, 2007 11:43 AM To: PCSDP@gnb.ca Subject: Inclusive Education Quiz March 28 2007 Mr. Randy Dickinson and Mr. Gary Comeau Premier's Council on the Status of Disabled Persons Re \"Quiz Contest Promotes Inclusive Education in New Brunswick (07/03/22)\" I am the father of an 11 year old profoundly autistic boy.  I participated both as an individual parent and as the representative of two provincial autism organizations at different stages of the Mackay Inclusive Education review process.  I currently sit as the Autism Society New Brunswick representative on the Ministerial Committee on Inclusive Education. At this time, I express my own personal views, in stating that  I take exception to the use of the office and resources of the Premier's Council on the Status of Disabled Persons to promote one view of the merits of a full inclusion system in New Brunswick schools. There are many diverging points of view with respect to the emphasis on mainstream classroom inclusion for all students regardless of disability or ability.  Some profoundly autistic children are overwhelmed by classroom environment stimulation and require a quieter learning environment where they learn a different curriculum by different teaching methods than children their own age.  Other disability organizations have also expressed some reservations about the over emphasis on full mainstream inclusive education. One of the great disadvantages of the inclusion revolution which has dominated New Brunswick schools for the past 30 years has been the lost of specialized expertise in teaching children with specific disabilities a problem which is currently being addressed for autistic children by the training of Teachers' Aides and Resource Teachers at the UNB-CEL Autism Intervention Training Program. Reducing these complex issues to a quiz format with correct answers being those which support the status quo emphasis on mainstream classroom inclusion for all is, in my view, an inappropriate use of public resources of your office. Respectfully, Harold L Doherty

Larry's Gulch Inclusive Education Review June 21, 22,  2012
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 Meeting of Senior Department of Education Officials With Gordon Porter And Other Advocates of Extreme Everyone In the Mainstream Classroom Inclusion June 20, 21, 2012 
 Information from  CANADALAND  web site. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 L: Yude  M. Henteleff, C.M., Q.C., L.L.D. (Hon.)     R: Harold L. Doherty  
 at the Atlantic Human Rights Centre Inclusion Conference Crowne Plaza Fredericton-Lord Beaverbrook, June 14, 15, 2012 Mr. Henteleff presented, a paper advocating for a range of learning placement optionsin order to ensure meaningful inclusion:    MEANINGFUL ACCESS, INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF A WIDE RANGE OF PLACEMENTS, AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF INCLUSIVITY IN EDUCATION 
 
 
 
It was a privilege, on June 14, 15, 2012  to attend the Atlantic Human Rights Centre Inclusion Conference at the Crown Plaza in Fredericton and to meet the very distinguished lawyer and disability advocate Yude Henteleff above. I personally have tried for many years to advocate for a rational evidence based inclusive education policy that provides a range of learning environments to accommodate the diverse challenges and needs of persons with disabilities particularly students with autism spectrum disorders.  Unfortunately anything that was discussed at that conference was not likely to have been considered by the NB government and department of Education officials when  they met with Gordon Porter, and other \"all students in the mainstream classroom inclusion philosophy \" one week later at Larry's Gulch . 
 
 
 
 
Autism Spectrum Disorder has been increasingly recognized for its heterogeneity particularly with respect to cognitive deficits, sensory challenges, self injurious behaviors,  and learning disabilities.  In NB the fight for an education policy that allows for alternative learning environments to accommodate those students, like my son, who do not function well in the regular classroom, and can even be harmed by that location,  has largely been undone by Gordon Porter and the NBACL including various members of the influential Carr family and their NBACL associate Danny Soucy.    At the June 14 2012 conference above Mr Henteleff and I were  voices advocating for evidence based accommodation of the needs of students with disabilities.  Gordon Porter was there presenting individuals with anecdotal horror stories about segregation.  
 
 
 
 
The conference appeared to have been a waste of time and money.  One week later,  at Larry's Gulch,  senior education officials and government officials met with Gordon Porter, Canada's most  obsessive advocate for reducing learning options for all students to the mainstream classroom.  Neither I, a former ASNB president and long time critic of NB's extreme mainstream only inclusion policy, nor the distinguished lawyer and disability advocate Yude Henteleff were present. 
 
 
 
I  met Mr Porter,  NBACL/CACL icon,  on several occasions during the MacKay and Ministerial Committee inclusive education reviews. During a breakout session in a room at the MacKay review Gordon Porter grew visibly annoyed with me and another ASNB parent advocate when we advocated a range of learning settings to accommodate some students with autism disorders who would have difficulty functioning in the mainstream classroom.  He dismissed our comments by telling us that \" you people should be thankful \" for what we had.  I  have no doubt that when he attended Larry's Gulch with fellow NBACL official,  and co-author of the last of several inclusive education reviews, Angela Aucoin, Krista Carr of the NBACL and her husband Jody Carr, then the Minister of Education, and Danny Soucy MLA and NBACL official at various times,  that he pushed his obsessive,  extreme inclusion philosophy and made no positive mention of the need for a range of learning environments to accommodate those with severe autism and other disorders. 
 
I wasn't present at the Larry's Gulch inclusive education review but I am sure that it likely topped the  Wayne MacKay and Ministerial Committee reviews and any views that did not support  the Gordon Porter extreme, all students in the mainstream classroom, inclusion philosophy.

CBC Inclusion Interviews: What Did Smith and Carr Mean By Inclusion? 
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CBC's Terry Seguin conducted two very good interviews with outgoing NBTA President Heather Smith and EECD Minister Jody Carr over the last two days.  However, neither of Terry's guests gave a clear definition of what they meant by \" inclusion \".  The only clear definition of inclusion offered by the current administration is one provided by the Alward administration's inclusion mentor Gordon Porter. It is a definition of inclusion which Minister Carr has not disavowed and one which is at odds with the New Brunswick government's policy statement which defines inclusion as evidence based and based on a student's best interests.  
 
 
 
The source of much of the uproar over inclusion in NB is Mr. Porter's obsessive insistence that ALL students be educated in the regular classroom as he stated last year in a session on inclusive education in Newfoundland: 
 
 
 
 \"CORNER BROOK —  Gordon Porter believes inclusion is the most natural thing in the world.  The educator and director of Inclusive Education Initiatives presented a session on inclusive education at the Greenwood Inn and Suites on Thursday. Porter, who is also the editor of the Inclusive Education Canada website inclusiveeducation.ca, spoke to parents, educators and agency professionals who deal with children with special needs at the pre-conference for the Newfoundland and Labrador Association for Community Living Conference taking place in the city today and Saturday. The session was sponsored by the Community Inclusion Initiative.  
 
 
 
  Porter’s session revolved around the theme of parents and teachers working together to make inclusion work. “It means kids go to their neighbourhood schools with kids their own age in regular classes,” said Porter.“If you’re seven years, old you go to the school just down the street. You go in a class with other seven-year-olds, and you’re supported if you have extra needs. “It’s so simple, it’s that simple,” said Porter.\"\" 
 
 
 
 - Diane Crocker, The Western Star, April 13, 2012:  Inclusion in the classroom 'simple', says educator . 
 
 
 
 For some children with challenges, including some like my son with severe autism, inclusion in the classroom was not simple or natural.  He was overwhelmed by the classroom environment and came home each day with self inflicted bite marks on his hands and wrists.  He  was removed from the classroom at our request and  received his instruction from UNB-CEL Autism trained education aides at alternate locations in grade school, middle school and high school.  The biting disappeared and he was able to receive the education promised to all children in New Brunswick. He was accommodated. 
 
 
 
 Now my son's alternate learning locations are targeted as \"segregated\" learning by the omniscient Mr. Porter. The accommodation of my son's  disability that has allowed him to receive his education in local schools is at serous risk of disappearing when the Porter Aucoin Report becomes fully implemented in 2013.  It seemed to me in listening to EECD Minister Carr and NBTA President Smith that they were not challenging Mr. Porter's \" everyone in the classroom \" dictate.  They appeared to disagree only over how many aides would be in the regular classroom to assist the teacher.  My son's accommodated education is at serious risk in the Porter era.

Putting Our Money Where Our Priorities Are: Our Children Deserve Better
" "
\"Good teachers are to education what education is to all other professions—the indispensable element, the sunlight and oxygen, the foundation on which everything else is built.\" -- Lowell Milken 
 
 
 
This is especially true when it comes to teachers for children with disabilities like autism, ADHD, and dyslexia, among other common learning and/or neurological disorders. I wouldn't be surprised if most if not all parents of special needs students haven't run up against teachers whose education was inadequate to the task, especially when are children are mainstreamed with regular education teachers. Even the  National Council on Teacher Quality  notes that \"To ensure that our children receive a world-class education, their teachers need to be world-class. Sixty years of research and the experience of nations whose students outperform our own have proven that we can only achieve this goal by raising the bar of admission to teacher preparation programs.\" 
 
 
 
According to the  US Department of Labor , \"[s]pecial education teachers in public schools are required to have a bachelor’s degree and a state-issued certification or license. Teachers in private schools also need a bachelor’s degree, but may not be required to have a state license or certification.\" Is a bachelor's degree really adequate? Even for regular education teachers?  
 
 
 
How much training do teachers receive for teaching? At the secondary level, education courses generally begin in earnest during the junior year, and the  average semester hours  needed for secondary education certification are 30 hours or around 11 courses varying from 1, 2 to 3 semester hours. The average teacher has had one 1 hour course on exceptional needs student.  
 
 
 
Teaching children, readying them for the future, is too important to rely on bachelor's degrees where they only spend one short class on exceptional needs students, especially given  the reality that 13.1%  of U.S. students are disabled. 
 
 
 
According  to  Martha L. Minnow,   \"[p]roviding better training, support, and satisfaction for teachers is critical to improving both special education services and education for all students. Allocating funds to training programs, salaries, and class size reduction will help; shifting paradigms of instruction to provide continuity within the classroom for students as well as teachers will do as much.\" 
 
 
 
It is imperative for our children's futures that the local, state, and federal levels of government recognize that competence in both our students and teachers requires the commitment of funds for research into best practices, to increasing teacher and staff pay and training, and to giving all students the individualized attention they need in order to succeed.

 To Whom It May Concern: 
 
 
 
 The following  is Autism Society of New Brunswick’s submission to the Inclusive Education: A Review of Programming and Services in New Brunswick committee. 
 
     
 
 Thank you, 
 
 
 
 Luigi Rocca 
 
 President, ASNB 
 
 
 
 
 
             
 
 “If a child cannot learn in the way we teach, then we must teach in the way he can learn.”  Ivar Lovaas. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Autism presents one of the biggest challenges to the New Brunswick Government’s inclusion policies.  According to the Department of Education’s own numbers, there are no less than 1,000 students in the public school system with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  In the majority of cases, these students are not receiving a meaningful education.   
 
 
 
 
 
 What Inclusion means to Autism Society of New Brunswick 
 
 
 
 Inclusion is a philosophy, not a methodology. 
 
 
 
 -           Inclusion should provide autistic school children access to a REAL education in a positive learning environment which may be inside or outside the classroom, or a combination of both, depending on the individual circumstances of the student with autism with the support of an individually assigned and dedicated Teacher Assistant (TA) formally trained in Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) methodologies. 
 
 
 
 -           Inclusion is more than simply including students with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) physically in the classroom. 
 
 
 
 -           “The philosophy of “full inclusion” is that students with special needs can and should be educated in the same settings as their normally developing peers with appropriate support services rather than being placed in special education classrooms or schools.”  Medical School, University of North Carolina. 
 
 
 
 Although the goals and values underlying full inclusion are laudable, neither research nor thoughtful analysis of the nature of supports concurs.  There is very little  empirical evidence  to support the above definition of full inclusion as it relates to students with autism. 
 
 
 
 -           Numerous studies clearly show students with an ASD cannot learn in a typical classroom environment.  Students with an ASD learn in a one-to-one setting, exclusive of the classroom. 
 
 
 
 -           Students with an ASD who have no supports will not learn.  If students with an ASD have supports such as formally trained TA’s in ABA methodology, reinforcers, trials, rewards, visuals, etc., learning occurs. 
 
 
 
 -           ASD, by its very nature, manifests itself differently with each student.  Therefore, flexibility is absolutely crucial with respect to classroom inclusion.  Some students with an ASD, particularly lower functioning students learn better in a quieter setting outside the classroom while some can learn in a room with their peers; most will benefit from a judicious mix of the two settings.  It is imperative that each student be properly assessed by trained individuals so that a proper and individualized learning environment can be designed for each student. 
 
 
 
 -           Many students with an ASD will be following a completely distinct curriculum. 
 
 
 
 -           It is critical to take into account the needs and characteristics of the individual student with autism and apply flexible inclusion policies so as to ensure the highest quality education and development. 
 
 
 
 
 
 What Do We Need 
 
 
 
 -           Ideally, parents of students with an ASD would benefit most by having teachers trained in ABA methodologies to teach their children on a one-on-one basis.  We realize that with the one-to-one methods required for most autistic students, it would be unrealistic to expect this of the public school system. 
 
 
 
 -           In general, New Brunswick has some of the highest quality teachers anywhere.  They are, however, sorely lacking in the training and knowledge necessary to plan and implement effective strategies for students with an ASD. 
 
 
 
 -           The Department of Education does not provide the proper training in ABA to work one-to-one with ASD students.  Faced with this reality, parents have asked for dedicated, individually assigned TA’s trained in ABA. 
 
 
 
 The Department of Education, the Teachers Union, and CUPE Union representing TA’s have to understand this reality, and adjust their collective agreements to reflect it.  It is imperative that no student be denied a meaningful education due to union or collective agreement issues.  Unfortunately, this often what happens so it is critical that the current mindset be changed. 
 
 
 
 -           Parents are frustrated and angry at the Department of Education policy on TA assignment, as the TA is for the teacher not the individual student.  Also, TA’s changing on a regular basis from year to year, multiple TA assignments to a student with autism throughout the school day, no guarantee that a TA trained in ABA methodologies will be assigned to an ASD student. 
 
 
 
 -           The TA Union needs a special designation of TA’s with ABA training to be matched with students    with an ASD.     Currently TA’s with special training in tube feeding or catherization are matched to students with this type of need and the same standard needs to apply with ABA training of TA’s. 
 
 
 
 -           The members of the Unions should have their rights but they should also be part of a regime which reflects more expressly the need to protect students with autism who are sometimes hurt by job competition process and work jurisdiction disputes between the Teacher and TA unions. 
 
 
 
 -           Faculties of Education need more learning in Special Education given the number of special  needs students.     Universities should be offering degrees in Special Education. 
 
 
 
 -           To achieve inclusion for students with an ASD  proper support  is needed in the form of TA’s who can work one-to-one with students with autism, and who are formally trained in ABA methodology, which has been proven effective in educating students with autism. 
 
 
 
 
   A Service Delivery Model   
 
 
 
          -    In New Brunswick ABA Training is available through the College of              Extended Learning: Autism Intervention Training.  The Department of Education to date has not seen fit to provide this training to its TA’s and Methods & Resource Teachers (M&R).  Yet, it is this very training which would squarely meet requirements to teach students with an ASD. 
 
 
 
 -           The Autism Support Worker (ASW) course offered through the College of Extended Learning is exactly what is needed for TA’s who work in the school system with students with autism.  It would be purely arbitrary to fail to provide the necessary training, or to provide less adequate training to the TA’s who work with students with an ASD in the more challenging school environment. 
 
 
 
 -           The Clinical Supervisor (CS) training offered through the College of Extended Learning is exactly what is needed for the Resource & Methods teachers.  These ABA trained teachers would be qualified to develop and monitor ABA programs designed specifically to each individual student with autism.  The ASW trained TA will be under the supervision of the trained M&R teacher, to implement the ABA programs with the individual student with autism. 
 
 
 
 -           Speech Pathology, Occupational Therapy, and Physiotherapy services are offered to students through the Extra Mural Program.  The input from these professionals, which is often required for the student with autism, can be incorporated into the individual ASD students ABA program by the CS trained M&R teacher, followed by the ASW trained TA to implement. 
 
 
 
 -           The teaching of life skills, especially in the Middle and High School levels; need to be incorporated into the autistic students education program. 
 
 
 
 -           A specific outline of transition protocols for transitioning from Elementary to Middle School, and Middle School to High School, based on the individual autistic student’s needs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 What Are the Systemic Barriers to Having Inclusion 
 
 
 
 
 
 Again….  Inclusion is a philosophy not a methodology. 
 
 
 
 -           A teacher cannot instruct an entire class and still provide the level of one-to-one instruction required by a student with an ASD. 
 
 
 
 -           Inconsistency and misinterpretations of the learning needs of students with an ASD at the Department of Education level, School District level, and School level. 
 
 
 
 -           Collective agreements between the NBTA and CUPE representing TA’s, do not address the interests of students with an ASD, and some procedures and rights within the contracts can be detrimental to the education of students with an ASD.  Two examples are work jurisdiction and seniority rights. 
 
 
 
 -           Long wait times for students with an ASD to access Occupational and/or Speech Therapy are not the exception, they are the norm.  Once recommendations are made, it is common for the recommendations NOT to be implemented.  School Administrations, teachers, and M&R teachers do not appreciate the “how” and “why” to implement these recommendations. 
 
 
 
 -           Organization of Team meetings often falls on the shoulder of the parents. 
 
 
 
 -           Schools have denied parents requests to have the Department of Education’s Autism Consultant involved. 
 
 
 
 -           The Department of Education’s required document of the SEP/IEP is not meaningful.  The goals are often vague, not clearly defined, and not a working document.  It is developed and utilized in a variety of ways throughout the province.  Often viewed by parents as a waste of time to incorporate. 
 
 
 
 -           Educators often label behaviors incorrectly i.e.: bold and rude, when in fact the behavior is communication impairment.  For example, we know of one high functioning student with an ASD who forced himself to vomit in order to have himself removed from the classroom which was causing him great anxiety.  This behaviour is often interpreted as “bad” when in fact from the student’s perspective, it is very rational.  In time, what is considered a normal environment for most students becomes torture for a student with an ASD and they will do whatever is necessary to stop it.  Any rational person would do the same thing. 
 
 
 
 -           Teachers and School Administration often inadvertently reward negative behavior of students with an ASD.  Thus increasing the negative behavior leading to student frustration, and at times, suspension.  Suspension is a consequence a student with an ASD might not have any ability to understand, thus leading to more complications for the student to receive a REAL education.  In addition, what is perceived by the teacher as a “punishment”, can actually be a “reward” for the autistic student because it removes him/her from the classroom. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Propose Alternative Methods of Delivery 
 
 
 
 -           The Department of Education needs to endorse having more than one Autism Consultant for the entire province.  One Autism Consultant is inadequate to serve a population of more than 1000 students. 
 
 
 
 -           Training of TA’s as ASW’s, and training of M&R teachers as CS’s through the College of Extended Learning: Autism Intervention Training. 
 
 
 
 Accountability Measures 
 
 
 
 -           The Department of Education fully endorse ABA, providing formal training to TA’s and M&R teachers. 
 
 
 
 -           Develop a legal and workable education tool to replace the SEP/IEP. 
 
 
 
 -           ABA was endorsed recently in the Department of Education’s Teaching Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder document.  However, the document is woefully inadequate on specifics of formal training and implementation of ABA methodologies. 
 
 
 
 -           ABA is endorsed by a wide variety of very credible institutions and research organizations. 
 
 
 
 -           Court cases have clearly outlined ABA as the only proven method for treating and teaching children with autism, and the child’s constitutional right to have it provided.

 Survey Results 
 
 
 
 Autism Society New Brunswick conducted a survey with parents of students with an ASD to get their views on the current system.  In the interest of brevity, we are not including the full results.  We can, however, summarize the views of parents in two words: frustration and despair.  The vast majority of parents, particularly those of low functioning ASD students, believe that the current inclusion policies are failing their children.  We will provide the details of the survey at your request. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Funding Model 
 
 
 
 One suggestion would be that the Province of New Brunswick acting through the Department of Education   ensure funding to ensure that TA’s are properly trained in ABA  and available to each student in the province that needs them, regardless of which school district they are located in.  
 
 It should not be left to the individual school districts, and whatever funding model that is adopted should ensure this goal is met. 
 
 
 
 Final Comments 
 
 
 
 -           Until the Department of Education commits to ABA training of TA’s and M&R teachers, the outcome for quality education and more importantly a quality of life during the school years will continue to be bleak and discouraging. 
 
 
 
 -           Do not let students with an ASD currently in New Brunswick schools become a generation lost to bureaucratic inertia or lack of will. 
 
 
 
 We ask that the Department of Education formally train TA’s in ABA methodologies, who work with our autistic children.

New Brunswick Autism Education:  Everyone in the Mainstream Classroom Inclusion Model Continues to Hold Back Progress
" "
 I have been a frequent promoter of the progress made in New Brunswick in the education of autistic students. Recent developments though show the extent to which that progress has been uneven with ultimate implementation of changes being left to the School District level. A bilingual and bifurcated Education department in New Brunswick has resulted in some francophone districts preferring to go it alone or to follow models from outside New Brunswick. 
 Two developments have spurred the  progress that has been made. One is  the training of 4-500 teacher assistants at the excellent UNB-CEL Autism Intervention Training program. The program has received high marks on external review by Dr. Eric Larsson and has included knowledgeable guest speakers like David Celiberti of the Association for Science in Autism Treatment.  The UNB-CEL AIT program has emphasized both quality and integrity with course entry requirements, substantial practicum and examination requirements. Unfortunately the program has been opposed by some in the Department of Education who felt that the program, which resulted from political-parent consultation, represented a loss of departmental influence. The Department is now moving back to what it has wanted all along ...  an in house training program with all the inherent conflicts of interest, quality and integrity issues that in house training brings with it. Some school districts have also refused to enroll teacher assistants in the program particularly in New Brunswick's francophone school districts which have tended to go their own direction in New Brunswick's bilingual and bifurcated education system. 
Progress has also been made in modernizing inclusion in New Brunswick schools.  For years the dominant \" everybody in the mainstream classroom\"  approach pushed hard by  the New Brunswick Association for Community Living and by Gordon Porter,  the former chair of the New Brunswick Human Rights Commission,  has held total sway in New Brunswick.  This approach does not reflect the research literature, or the experience of families like ours, which says that not ALL students with autism belong in the mainstream classroom.  I have presented legal reviews and research literature reviews to the MacKay Inclusion Review, (Professor MacKay is one of the worst offenders, and I use the term \"offender\" intentionally, when it comes to promoting the \"everybody in the mainstream classroom\" model of inclusion). 
 
 My son used to come home with bite marks on his hands and wrists from his days in a mainstream classroom where he was overstimulated, and learning a different subject matter, using different methods than the other children in his class. Once removed from the class for most of his  academic learning his self injury ceased and his school career has been a true joy as I have indicated many, many times on this blog.  Conor has not been sent to a prison like isolation room.  He has been educated in a small side room with an autism trained teacher assistant. The room is decorated with the usual learning tools and is not in the least restrictive. Conor visists the school gym, pool, kitchen and library.  He is around other children there and in the halls.  I have seen children greet him at school many, many times.  Conor's classroom is the school and he is not alone in such accommodations which have been made for other students in District 18. 
 The concept of the whole school as a classroom or learning environment is not mine. I am not a professional educator and I did not come up with it. The person who did relay that concept to me was Alex Dingwall the Superintendent of School District 18.  The use of the whole school environment. to provide alternative learning locations and accommodation for autistic children who can not function in the mainstream classroom is not mine. It may or may not be Superintendent Dingwall's but it was he who relayed it to me during a settlement conference for a Human Rights complaint I had filed on behalf of my son and which I ultimately withdrew because he has been accommodated in our neighborhood schools here in Fredericton. 
 I caught some of the CBC coverage of the Moncton child placed in a jail like time out room. I heard Krista Carr of the NBACL offering her commentary without acknowledging that the system in place in that school district is the total inclusion,  everybody in the mainstream classroom , model which does not recognize that the classroom is not right for all children and does not put any emphasis on providing alternate learning locations outside the mainstream classroom. The total inclusion model pushed by the NBACL, by the former chair of the NB Human Rights Commission and by Professor Wayne Mackay has failed and harmed some New Brunswick autistic students, including, for a brief period of time, my own son. Thankfully Conor has,  long since his failed mainstream classroom experience, had access to an alternate learning location in our neighborhood schools. The credit for that accommodation does not belong to me, or to Professor Wayne MacKay,  former Human Rights Commissioner Gordon Porter or NBACL official Krista Carr. The credit belongs to educators at School District 18 who have accommodated my son's disability.

Autism Disorders and Transition To and Through School: A Small Suggestion
" "
 
 
 
 
 Conor visiting and preparing for his transition from middle school to high school by  
 
 visiting the grounds of the school and seeing the Leo Hayes High School building.  
 
 
 
I have commented on transition
planning in the school system before and I don't know if what we did with our
severely autistic, profoundly developmentally delayed son can be done under the
new Department of Education and Early Childhood Development   policies   or the
collective agreement negotiated by Finance Minister Higgs with CUPE Local 2745,
the union representing aides.  The
essence of what we did though was to show Conor what his next year would look
like in advance of the changes.  When we
were transitioning Conor to high school we took him for visits to Leo Hayes
High School while he was still in middle school.  The aide who worked with him at middle school
went with Conor for these meetings where he met his aides who would start with
him at LHHS and faded out during some of the visits.  On weekends we simply took him to the school
grounds to get used to seeing the school he would be at the next year.   We had done the same thing when Conor
transitioned from Nashwaaksis Memorial (grade) School to Nashwaaksis Middle
School.    
 
 
 
For some students with autism
visits to their next school may, as it did with Conor, help reduce their
anxiety about the transition.

Gordon Porter's Vanity And Bill 61, An Act To Amend The Education Act,  Will Result in MORE  EXCLUSIONARY Education Practices in New Brunswick Schools
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Gordon Porter believes that inclusive education is simple. Unfortunately most teachers, the NBTA organisation itself, aides and education administrators have been bullied and intimidated into following his simple philosophy unquestioningly even though they know it flies in the face of the truth. They know that many children are present in NB schools with complex learning, behavior, cognitive and sensory challenges which render education under any label anything but simple but they dare not speak out.  More and more children are, and with the current  Bill 61, An Act to Amend the Education Act , more and m ore in future will be, excluded from NB schools as placement and learning options are reduced in favor of Mr Porter's regular classes and mindlessly simple philosophy. 
 
 
 
 The picture by Diane Crocker above and accompanying quotes are from the Newfoundland paper the  Western
Star article, \" Inclusion in the classroom ‘simple,’ says educator \" , with highlighting added by me for emphasis: 
 
 
 
 \"CORNER BROOK —  Gordon Porter believes inclusion is the most natural thing in the world.  The educator and director of Inclusive Education Initiatives presented a session on inclusive education at the Greenwood Inn and Suites on Thursday. Porter, who is also the editor of the Inclusive Education Canada website inclusive education.ca, spoke to parents, educators and agency professionals who deal with children with special needs at the pre-conference for the Newfoundland and Labrador Association for Community Living Conference taking place in the city today and Saturday. The session was sponsored by the Community Inclusion Initiative.  
 
 
 
  Porter’s session revolved around the theme of parents and teachers working together to make inclusion work. “It means kids go to their neighbourhood schools with kids their own age in regular classes,” said Porter.“If you’re seven years, old you go to the school just down the street. You go in a class with other seven-year-olds, and you’re supported if you have extra needs. “It’s so simple, it’s that simple,” said Porter.\" 
 
 
 
 
Gordon Porter's vanity has led to exclusive education practices in New Brunswick schools.  I know this to be true, teachers, aides and administrators in NB schools and retired teachers know this to be true. The only ones who do not know this to be true are Gordon Porter who has aggressively pushed  his own simplistic, non evidence based,   non inclusive  education on NB students and schools over the past 30+ years and his NBACL followers. Mr Porter's simple (his own words) philosophy has resulted, and continues to result, in more restricted range of options for placement of children with severe learning, behavior and cognitive challenges within New Brunswick schools. By restricting the range of placement options for NB students Mr Porter has forced numbers of students including students with severe autism, cognitive and behavior challenges out of their local schools to home based learning.   
 
 
 
In some cases students have been locked in rooms by themselves with no supervision, some have been charged with assault, some have banned from school premises.  When the Porter, everybody in the mainstream classroom, false inclusion philosophy fails the child is blamed and he or she is banned from the so called inclusive schools of NB.   
 
 
 
Mr Porter can receive dozens of ribbons to pin on his chest from countries with struggling education systems but the reality in NB is that education is rapidly becoming more exclusive, less inclusive, as options that might accommodate persons with severe autistic, cognitive, sensory and obsessive behaviors are simply eliminated from schools. 
 
 
 
My interest in the false inclusion in NB schools arises from my son's severe challenges.  He has in fact been accommodated ... by individualized instruction outside the regular classroom with ample socialization at the local swimming pool and gym and daily connection with other children in the Leo Hayes High School Resource Centre, an excellent, practical, evidence based and truly inclusive resource for children with extra needs.  The LHHS Resource Centre though is at serious risk as Gordon Porter continues to push entrenchment and expansion of his exclusionary policies in NB schools.  
 
 
 
My son's alternative arrangements came about in part because of our advocacy on his behalf.  I happen to be a lawyer and have some professional skills that are of assistance in communicating with education officials and advocating for our son. Some other parents are not as fortunate and some have more than one child with extra needs.  
 
 
 
With respect to autism spectrum disorders the University of North Carolina TEACCH program which has
substantial influence in academic and professional autism circles has articulated the following position statement ( underling added by me for emphasis ) on inclusion of children with autism one which calls for a range of placement options.  It is an evidence based position which recognizes the heterogeneity of autism disorders and the range of accommodations required: 
 
 
 
 
 \" TEACCH's
position on inclusion of children with autism : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The
     TEACCH program recognizes the important value of preparing all persons
     with autism for successful functioning within society. Each person with
     autism should be taught with the goal of successful functioning with as
     few restrictions as is possible.                                                             
 Decisions
     about including children with autism into fully integrated settings must
     be made consistent with the principle of the \"least restrictive
     environment\" as a guiding principle. No person with autism should be
     unnecessarily or inappropriately denied access to meaningful educational
     activities. However, it should be noted that  the concept of least
     restrictive environment requires that appropriate learning take place.
     Placement decisions also require that students be capable of meaningful
     learning and functioning within the setting selected 
 Activities
     which are inclusive for children with autism should be offered based on an
     individual assessment of the child's skills and abilities to function and participate
     in the setting.  Inclusion activities are appropriate only when
     preceded by adequate assessment and pre-placement preparations including
     appropriate training. Inclusion activities typically need to be supported
     by professionals trained in autism who can provide assistance and
     objective evaluation of the appropriateness of the activity. 
 Inclusion
     should never replace a full continuum of service delivery, with different
     students with autism falling across the full spectrum.  Full
     inclusion should be offered to all persons with autism who are capable of
     success in fully integrated settings. Partial inclusion is expected to be
     appropriate for other clients with autism. And  special classes and
     schools should be retained as an option for those students with autism for
     whom these settings are the most meaningful and appropriate. 
 
 
Mr Porter's obsession with everybody in the classroom philosophy will hurt many more children as it becomes even more entrenched by the current  Bill 61, An Act to Amend the Education Act , which will, once passed into law, give greater legal status to Mr Porter's false notion of inclusion. The principle that the evidence based best interests of the child should be a dominant consideration in setting school policy will now be challenged by Mr Porter's inclusion illusion.  More and more NB students will be forced from NB schools into home based learning.

NBTA Acknowledges Education Department's Obsession With Inclusion Philosophy
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
The New Brunswick Teachers Association has spoken up ... sort of ... about New Brunswick's extreme inclusion philosophy.  The NBTA to its credit  acknowledges, finally, that inclusion is a philosophy not an educational plan as stated by outgoing NBTA President Heather Smith at a meeting of delegates from around the province.  Smith also acknowledged that the education focus during the past year has been  on the Porter Aucoin Report with all  \"professional development \" focused on inclusive education.  Smith, in a recent  Daily Gleaner  article by Tara Chislett,  also talks about the need for more resources without identifying any of those resources.  Many autism students who require autism trained education aides do not have them.  
 
Outgoing NBTA President Smith also fails to acknowledge that some students with severe autism and other severe difficulties require accommodation of their disabilities by learning outside the regular classroom. Unfortunately the inclusion extremists have targeted such human rights accommodations as constituting segregation and  are trying to eliminate them. What Smith did not say is that in New Brunswick inclusion is a ridiculously simplistic \" everybody benefits from education in the regular classroom \" belief. 
 
Although Ms. Smith did not go far enough in her critique of the education philosophy that has ruled the minds of New Brunswick educators and civil servants it is a solid beginning.  At last one voice, other than the Autism Society New Brunswick in its submissions to the MacKay and Ministerial inclusive education reviews, and me personally, has spoken out against the decades old mindset that has provide obstacles to the accommodation of students with severe disability challenges.  
 
 
 
 
 \" The president of the New Brunswick Teachers’ Association says the Department of Education has focused too much on inclusive education over the last year  instead of giving teachers what they need most: an education plan laying out achievement goals. 
 
 
 
 
 “One year ago, I stood at this AGM and made the statement that New Brunswick was still without a publicly unveiled education plan,” she told the crowd. “It’s frustrating that I am here making the same statement today.  It is quite clear that the education focus this year has been on the Porter Aucoin Report and that all department-led professional development has focused on inclusive education. 
 
 
 
 “I have a degree in special education and it is my belief that  inclusion is an approach, a philosophy, not an educational achievement goal.” 
 
 
 
 Smith said in addition to a lack of an education plan, schools continue to struggle with not having enough resources as the government continues to cut away at budgets.     ...   “Inclusion’s not an outcome. I’m sorry.  It’s a philosophy. And we’ve had that philosophy in our schools since the mid-80s.  It’s a great philosophy, we support it if the supports and resources are there so schools can do it effectively.   “But that’s not a plan for education. It’s not .\"   (Bold added - HLD)

Autism in NB Schools and Gordon Porter's New Minister of Education
" "
 
 Gordon Porter                            Education Minister Jody Carr 
 Gordon Porter was one of the 5 men  who formed the David Alward transition team that advised New Brunswick's David Alward as he prepared his transition from Premier Designate to Premier. One of the key tasks they handled was to assist in drafting the 15 Conservative MLA's who would form the pared down Cabinet. It is no surprise that MLA Jody Carr was named to fill the post of Education Minister. Carr, his wife Krista Carr, and brother and fellow MLA Jack Carr, are all disciples of Gordon Porter's extreme inclusion philosophy. They have all resisted for several years, in conjunction with Gordon Porter and the NB Association for Community Living with which Mr. Porter and the Carrs are affiliated,  efforts by parents of some autistic children to have their children educated in neighborhood schools but outside of the mainstream classroom 
 Gordon Porter began introducing in NB his extreme model of inclusion, with its \"all children in the regular, mainstream classroom\", decades ago. His views on inclusive education do not appear to have changed, literally, since mankind walked on the moon. During the MacKay Review of NB's inclusive education system, and while Mr. Porter was chairperson of the NB Human Rights Commission,  he spoke to me, and another autism advocate, contemptuously and angrily, dismissing us as \" you people \". While in the position of NB Human Rights Chair Gordon Porter's HR officers drafted a position on accommodation in NB Schools ..  a position which supports Porter's \"keep all children in the mainstream classroom\" vision.   
 Gordon Porter's philosophy resulted in Conor being placed in a mainstream classroom where he was overstimulated and overwhelmed by being forced to learn a different curriculum by a different method than the other students in the class. Conor came home every day with bite marks on his hands and wrists while in Gordon Porter's inclusive classroom setting. The  biting declined and ceased almost entirely once he was removed at our request to a quieter setting. The evidence did not support Conor's inclusion in a mainstream classroom and school and district officials respected that evidence and accommodated my son's disability. I am thankful that they did.   
 Gordon Porter's extreme inclusion philosophy has lost ground in NB schools despite his stranglehold on positions of influence in education circles. The Ministerial Committee on Inclusive education, which began during the Lord government years, and continued during the Graham government of the past 4 years,  made a commitment to an evidence based approach to inclusive education based on the best interests of the individual child in its  definition of  inclusive education . That evidence based approach permits children like my son Conor, diagnosed with Autistic Disorder and assessed profound developmental delays, to receive ABA based instruction in a separate, quieter area of the school,  while visiting common areas of the school such as the gym, pool, kitchen etc where they can also meet other children.  
 Hopefully Education Minister Jody Carr will shake free of the dominating influence of Gordon Porter and not try to roll back the progress that has been made in New Brunswick schools  by so many autistic children, including my son Conor. I am told by some people whose opinions I value that I should give Minister Carr an opportunity to do the right thing by autistic children so I will but I will do so reluctantly, cautiously and with an  eye to ensuring that the Porter Philosophy of Inclusion does not force my son back into the mainstream classroom where his education, his health and his safety would be at risk.  Hopefully new Education Minister Jody Carr will not try to undo the commitment to evidence based education that is necessary for many children with disabilities and disorders, including some with Autism Spectrum Disorders, to receive a real education in New Brunswick schools.

Telegraph-Journal: New Brunswick Public Education Must Be Inclusive and Flexible
" "
 
 
 
 
 
A  New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal June 16, 2012 editorial , reprinted in its' entirety below, has called for a flexible model of inclusion for New Brunswick public education.  The editorial references education policy analyst Paul Bennett who gave a presentation Thursday at the Atlantic Human Rights Centre conference on inclusive education.

 BE INCLUSIVE AND FLEXIBLE 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 TELEGRAPH-JOURNAL 
 
 EDITORIAL

 It is imperative that public education be accessible to all students. While the Alward government’s $62 million investment in new resources to support inclusion should help, critics say the province’s vision of inclusion itself needs to change. 
 
 One of those constructive critics is education policy analyst Paul Bennett. Mr. Bennett gives New Brunswick high praise for its commitment, but he does not believe equal access can be met within the walls of a single classroom. We’re inclined to agree. 
 
 The one-classroom model of inclusion cannot meet the needs of all students, as countless parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and severe dyslexia can attest. Why not acknowledge that hundreds of families are not being well-served, and open the door to private schools or transition programs, funded by provincial vouchers, as Nova Scotia has done? 
 
 This would give parents greater choice in their children’s education. It would also serve as a better incubator of innovative and effective education practices than public schools can provide, while still being accessible to all. 
 
 The education department seems determined to train more teachers who are interested in special needs instruction. Given the low performance of New Brunswick schools generally, though, we’re not hopeful that New Brunswick can train its way out of this problem. 
 
 The average quality of schooling in New Brunswick is among the poorest in Canada. It is unlikely that the turnover in teachers who are better trained will occur fast enough to meet the needs of average students, let alone those who require specialized instruction. 
 
 Wouldn’t student needs be served better by permitting the creation of new schools and programs specifically for students with special needs, staffed by professionals who specialize in this area of education? 
 
 These schools would not replace classroom inclusion, but augment it by providing alternatives for those students whose needs are greatest. 
 
 In Nova Scotia, parents already have access to private, independent special education schools. Since 2004, when the Nova Scotia Tuition Support Program was created, the provincial government has even provided short-term funding for students to attend designated special education private schools, with the goal of transitioning back into public schools at a later date. 
 
 We are proud to live in a province which has affirmed that all students have an equal right to education. Surely it is not a big step to admit that to achieve this equality of opportunity, some special needs students will require resources outside the standard classroom.

It was a treat when Ben came home Tuesday night with a course catalogue for choosing his courses for Grade 10.  
 
He has to take math and science and history and English – what you’d expect as part of any education – but he also has some choice in non-academic courses like construction technology and drama. The courses are part of a well-thought out high-school curriculum designed by the Ontario Ministry of Education. 
 
The reason this was a treat was that for three years we have lived in the world of ‘alternative expectations’ – read no expectations – at the segregated school Ben attended. 
 
Alternative expectations are courses that are not tied to the Ontario curriculum and tend to focus on life skills. They include speech, social skills, personal care and transit training. At the high-school level, they are non-credit courses.  
 
\"For the vast majority of students, these programs would be given in addition to modified or regular grade-level expectations,” reads  The IEP – A Resource Guide  from the Ministry. “A very small number of students who are unable to demonstrate even the most basic literacy or numeracy skills may receive only an alternative report.\" 
 
Although Ben does read, and is now writing, for three years he received only alternative courses and an alternative report. In his last year the courses were things like art appreciation, gym, social skills (which was a cooking class) and ‘math’ – which involved tasks like putting flashlights together. 
 
Four courses were offered per semester. They didn’t follow the general Ontario curriculum and my understanding is that they didn’t follow any Ministry-mandated content. It was up to the school to decide what it would offer. 
 
The value of having a province-wide curriculum, I imagine, is that if students are taught the same material across schools, to meet one set of standards, you have a way of measuring progress and ensuring accountability. 
 
I’m not sure why the same approach wouldn’t be taken with students with disabilities in segregated schools. Why would the same thought and energy not be put into developing a standard curriculum – ideally that draws on the general curriculum all students receive?  
 
Why is it okay for students in these segregated high schools to have no Ontario-directed course content and no choice of courses and for students and parents to simply accept whatever learning is put forward in a particular class and school? 
 
Last night I got to go through the standard credit high-school courses with Ben, in a document (above) aptly called:  Life is the sum of all your choices .  
 
Doesn’t it seem like there’s a double standard here?

"33078" "50" "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2009/05/25/eoct-fever/" "EOCT Fever" "End Of Course Tests  were at our school a couple weeks ago at our school and spilled out over a couple of weeks. While these are not quite as high stakes as the CRCT for middle and elementary students or the graduation test, they are still big. They are supposed to make up 15% of the students grade. They can, under some circumstances, be used to graduate a student even when a section of the graduation test is not passed. Here are the courses with EOCTs: 
 U.S. History 
 Physical Science 
 American Literature 
 9 th  grade literature 
 Algebra 
 Geometry 
 Biology 
 Economics 
 It strikes me as a bit funny that there are so many courses with  no  EOCT. Plus, each of these courses will also have a final exam next week. So what is up with the EOCT? The EOCT is merely a practice for the graduation test. These are the courses covered by the GHSGT, and so students get a special practice test in order to assess their readiness for the graduation test — and the school’s readiness for making AYP.  Apparently, not much counts after you take the GHSGT.  Why not an EOCT in chemistry, World History or the foriegn languages?  If teaching and learning are the focus, why not teaching and learning in these other areas?  Especially since the Highly Qualified requirement still apllies to teachers teaching these other courses. Apparently, we do have a national curriculum: Testing and Test Prep. I’ve been doing some e xtra reading , and it is alarming and depressing where public education is going in the 21 st  century. The system that defeated the Communists and brought down the wall during the cold war is now being replaced by the system we worked so hard to defeat. Of course, the testing schedule disrupts the schedule of everyone in the building. While I am self-contained, it still impacts me as there is no planning period, the lunch schedule is off and having to accommodate everyone else derails my kids. But no one thinks about my kids when designing the schedule.

Autism and Education: Conor Votes For FLEXIBLE Inclusion
" "
 
 
 
 UPDATE: Conor had a great day at school today! 
 
Conor got up at 6 am today, as he has for the last 2+ months to mark down the number of days to school. He started doing this with 65 days to go and today he was very happy to mark 0 days to school! He also placed his packed bookbag and lunchbag at the front door to make sure we went to school. 
 
Conor has severe autistic disorder with \"profound developmental delays\".  He was removed from the regular classroom, at our request, early in his education when we realized that the self inflicted bite marks were happening because of his placement in the regular classroom where he was overhwhelmed.  The biting declined, and disappeared completely, once he was placed in an individual learning environment to receive his ABA based instruction.  Since then adjustments have been made so that he starts his day and spends breaks with other challenged students in a resource center at the Leo Hayes High School. It is an important and valuable resource where Conor has been very well received and where he has made friends.  He also socializes with other students in the halls and in a variety of settings in the school and on expeditions. He receives his primary ABA based instruction outside the mainstream classroom in a quieter, less overwhelming individualized environment. 
 
 
 Conor's flexible model of inclusion works for him and many other students who require accommodation of their disability based challenges. The rigid ideological everyone in the classroom philosophy for learning did not work for Conor and does not work for ALL students with autism and other challenges.  Some students with autism can prosper in the classroom some can't.   
 
 It is necessary, in an evidence based, humane and lawful education system to look at the needs and strengths of each child and accommodate those who require accommodation.  In some cases that means outside the mainstream classroom.  
 
 
 
Conor voted against the rigid inflexible model of full inclusion for all when he came home each day with bite marks on his hands. Today, once again, he voted for FLEXIBLE inclusion when he marked his board to show ZERO days to school.  Conor is going back to school, flexible inclusion and all, and he is very happy.

"33144" "50" "https://specialed.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/we-need-a-better-transition-program/" "We Need a Better Transition Program" "The way NCLB is currently structured and the way schools are really pushing and driving, now is the time to straighten out the transition-to-work emphasis, especially for those students who are older than 18.  I currently have 2 that should have/could have graduated at 18, but they are being served in the public school system in my classroom.  Is the focus on academics the best thing for them at this age?  Certainly not for my students or those with more moderate intellectual disabilities.  The unemployment rate for students with disabilities runs 80-90%, and this is because school systems are ill-equipped for this task.  Public high schools are being pushed and pressured to offered a curriculum that prepares  all  students for college.  The large vocational programs that were in place in the 1970’s and ’80’s are now long gone and are largely replaced by more academic space or by computer labs.    So on top of the demands for offering the regular education curriculum for all of my students, I am also having to try to offer some sort of meaningful job/employment services and skills.  These skills are not aligned with the basic core academic standards that I am supposed to be using in order to teach.  The daily living skills are also not aligned to core standards.  And yet, when I submit lesson plans, they must include the state academic standards and must somehow align.  This is the basic problem that NCLB brings to the local school system.  We are not doing that good of a job in the core mission of academics and we are also tasked with teaching some sort of meaningful vocational skills.    The problem is that the least restrictive environment for a 16 year-old is not the same as it is for a 20 year-old.  And yet, that is exactly how it works in our school system.  Regular students are either working or going to further their education while students with severe disabilities have no other choice but to remain in the same building, in the same classrooms with the same teachers until they age out at 21+ years of age.  Other students have moved on while those with severe disabilities are stuck.  And for all of my training and background I simply do not have the resources to offer everything to everyone all the time.  When NCLB first started impacting those of us who taught this population, there was a lot of talk about aligning our goals with the standards.  We were to just take what we were already doing and find some way to make it fit into the regular curriculum.  Some things work more natural than others.  For instance, speaking and communicating are part of almost every task we do and that easily aligns.  We can count things that approach an algebra standard.  However, when we get into the real meat and guts of a high school academic curriculum, very little fits into what a student with severe disabilities does in the real world and in real life.  Geometry, American literature, physical science and world cultures are not very relevant to them.  That doesn’t mean they can’t learn it or that we can not teach them.  But when a skill has to be taught 500-1500 times in order to be mastered, is that the best use of our time?  To be sure, teaching the core content takes alot of creativity and is sometimes even fun.  It does, in fact, reflect just what their peers are doing, only at a more basic level.   However, at the age of 18, that is no longer true.  Their peers or  not  still in high school.  They have moved on, and so it is that the students with severe disabilities should also move on.  The present academically focused atmosphere of NCLB arguably serves its purpose but there gets to be a point where is becomes an even more serious impediment and liability.  Students need to be preparing for work outside of school.  They need to get outside of the bell schedule, outside of class changes and out of their desks.  They need to be in a seperate place where the focus is solely on transitioning to work.  The regular high school is  not  trhe least restrictive environment for students who are 19-21+.  They need to be in a place better suited to train them towards goals that will better serve them outside of the constraints of NCLB.  A student could opt to continue to work towards the regular credentials, of course, but there should also be another option besides spending the entire 7-8 years after middle school in one building, in one room.  This simply turns high school SID/PID rooms into yet another version of institutionalization.  No other population of student gets handled and treated this way.   To that end, we do need to do a better job of including our students in the regular education setting, even if it is for a modified period of time.  At the present time, the opportunity for discimination is entirely too rampant.  I have voiced concern about  mainstreaming and inclusion before .  But after waking up to some issues with being discriminated against, I realize that the only way to combat it is to always be around and in everyone’s face.  Plus, for my part, if they won’t let me get away from SID/PID than perhaps I can gain access to the regular education classroom by getting my students placed there.  Suddenly I become a more critical part of the landscape as teachers scramble trying to figure out what to do with these kids.   So two things need to happen: 1.) Make a final drive towards full inclusion 2.) Establish a place for those who graduate from high school to be served until they are aged out, where the emphasis is vocational skills rather than the core standards mandated by NCLB.   It’s really going to be up to parents to make demands toward this, though.  I’m speaking as both teacher and parent but know that as an employee of the school system my voice can more easily be squelched.  Plus this might not be something other parents want, so I’m curious about that.  Should we more fully include those with severe and profound disabilities?    I will say to you parents that the regular school system is simply too poorly equipped to offer your student the vocational training that he/she really and truly needs.  The mission of the school system is to educate students according to the state curriculum standards.  That will always come first, and everything else is extra, regardless of what is put on the IEP.  We can write lovely goals and a lovely transition plan but that neither compels nor empowers us to carry out those plans.  The IEP is pretty much toothless in areas that do not align with NCLB.  If it does not address the state curriculum, I’m going to have a hard time carrying it out because the law clearly mandates what I’m required to do — teach to the standards.  And I do not have sufficient time to even do that very well.  So guess what happens to those goals, objectives and transition plans?  They are being sidelined.   Under IDEA, all students are entitled to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE)  However, NCLB has totally changed the definition of “appropriate.”  It is all about the state mandated curriculum and meeting standards of performance mandated by the federal government.  So you may want your child to learn some functional skills like tying his/her shoe, going to the bathroom, do some sorting, assembling or other vocational/life skill tasks.  However we at the school are under serious constraints of time and resources.  I’m going to do my best for the students that I have, and their parents but this is not the same business that it was when I started or even 2 years ago.  The shift has been focused and radical.    Tags:  inclusion ,  mainstreaming ,  NCLB ,  No Child Left Behind ,  severe disabilities ,  Special Education ,  transition " 4.36386330783197e-05 0.000195378933238271 0.000172182078614773 8.12021939442589e-05 2.02614016082351e-05 0.561575455820639 0.000101072168335559 0.000166185289803937 7.08907484197017e-05 5.26561854055127e-05 7.70287254894545e-05 3.46432700237003e-05 9.19462665975792e-05 5.97372425919377e-05 0.00178958132352655 0.000268928425328781 0.000118337488790868 0.000200630832940306 0.00063306034339732 0.000128001243298157 5.64429457791096e-05 0.000253775527709248 0.000137083457677374 8.37356346327485e-05 0.00011379461889836 5.60839020028494e-05 0.307313801847555 0.0571350684381072 8.58831580790958e-05 9.80412360185076e-05 8.05326858485552e-05 5.88055449188823e-05 0.00714360913528821 0.00185351927830703 0.038233363485607 5.21609630765232e-05 9.53420723229901e-05 6.131495434487e-05 7.30415040217582e-05 0.000365062346063385 0.000516264586163896 4.61336396330189e-05 0.00189838541155175 4.31080564283522e-05 4.49828206343158e-05 0.000118183637658928 0.00541324973529307 7.73388187884851e-05 0.00184679725497407 0.0107642746875421

Not too long ago, the estimate was 1 in 166. Then 1 in 150. About a year ago, the estimate was revised to 1 in 100.  But, these numbers are estimates. And,  more importantly, these estimates spam a wide range. Autism prevalence estimates vary by state and by ethnicity.  The state with the highest prevalence estimate is New Jersey.   A team in New Jersey has analyzed the most recent data for the relationship on factors such as race/ethnicity and household income.  What did they find?  Kids from high income families are twice as likely to get an autism designation as kids from less affluent areas.  The prevalence estimate in wealthy areas?  17 per 1000.  Or 1 in 59.  Here is the abstract: Background: In 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in New Jersey, one of the wealthiest states in the United States, than in other surveillance regions. Objective: To examine the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with ASD prevalence. Methods: Information on eight-year-olds with ASD from four counties was abstracted from school and medical records. US Census 2000 provided population and median household income data. Results: 586 children with ASD were identified: autism prevalence was 10.2/1000, higher in boys than girls (16 vs. 4/1000); higher in white and Asian non-Hispanics than in black non-Hispanics and Hispanics (12.5, 14.0, 9.0, and 8.5/1000, respectively); and higher (17.2/1000 (95% CI 14.0-21.1)) in tracts with median income >US$90,000 than in tracts with median income ?US$30,000 (7.1 (95% CI 5.7-8.9)). Number of professional evaluations was higher, and age at diagnosis younger, in higher income tracts (p < .001), but both measures spanned a wide overlapping range in all SES levels. In multivariable models race/ethnicity did not predict ASD, but the prevalence ratio was 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.1) when comparing highest with lowest income tracts. Conclusions: In the US state of New Jersey, ASD prevalence is higher in wealthier census tracts, perhaps due to differential access to pediatric and developmental services.

Study Watch : Early Diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Massachusetts Birth Cohorts, 2001–2005
" "
A  new study  in Pediatrics covers the the number of children receiving early intervention services for autism in Massachusetts.  I am sure will be writing about this one in more depth in the near future but  The main point here is that children receiving early intervention services for autism increased significantly for children born between 2001 and 2005. 
 
One statistic that jumped out at me while I was skimming the study - 
 Among boys, early ASD diagnoses increased more than 70%, from 88 per 10,000 children for the 2001 birth cohort to 151 per 10,000 for the 2005 cohort. That implies that the rate of autism in boys born in 2005 in Massachusetts is about 1.5%.  I feel more aware already...

 Objective : We examined trends in autism spectrum disorder diagnoses by age 36 months (early diagnoses) and identified characteristics associated with early diagnoses. 
 
 Methods : Massachusetts birth certificate and early-intervention program data were linked to identify infants born between 2001 and 2005 who were enrolled in early intervention and receiving autism-related services before age 36 months (through December 31, 2008). Trends in early autism spectrum disorders were examined using Cochran-Armitage trend tests. X(2) Statistics were used to compare distributions of selected characteristics for children with and without autism spectrum disorders. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independent predictors of early diagnoses. 
 
 Results : A total of 3013 children (77.5 per 10 000 study population births) were enrolled in early intervention for autism spectrum disorder by age 36 months. Autism spectrum disorder incidence increased from 56 per 10,000 infants among the 2001 birth cohort to 93 per 10,000 infants in 2005. Infants of mothers younger than 24 years of age, whose primary language was not English or who were foreign-born had lower odds of an early autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Maternal age older than 30 years was associated with increased odds of an early autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Odds of early autism spectrum disorders were 4.5 (95% confidence interval: 4.1-5.0) times higher for boys than girls. 
 
 Conclusions : Early autism spectrum disorder diagnoses are increasing in Massachusetts, reflecting the national trend observed among older children. Linkage of early-intervention program data with population-based vital statistics is valuable for monitoring autism spectrum disorder trends and planning developmental and educational service needs.

Study: Recurrence Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Baby Siblings Research Consortium Study
" "
The risk of a sibling developing autism is almost double what it was thought to be?  
 
Hmm. 
 
 Recurrence Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Baby Siblings Research Consortium Study 
 
 Objective : The recurrence risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is estimated to be between 3% and 10%, but previous research was limited by small sample sizes and biases related to ascertainment, reporting, and stoppage factors. This study used prospective methods to obtain an updated estimate of sibling recurrence risk for ASD. 
 
 Methods : A prospective longitudinal study of infants at risk for ASD was conducted by a multisite international network, the Baby Siblings Research Consortium. Infants (n = 664) with an older biological sibling with ASD were followed from early in life to 36 months, when they were classified as having or not having ASD. An ASD classification required surpassing the cutoff of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and receiving a clinical diagnosis from an expert clinician. 
 
 Results : A total of 18.7% of the infants developed ASD. Infant gender and the presence of >1 older affected sibling were significant predictors of ASD outcome, and there was an almost threefold increase in risk for male subjects and an additional twofold increase in risk if there was >1 older affected sibling. The age of the infant at study enrollment, the gender and functioning level of the infant's older sibling, and other demographic factors did not predict ASD outcome. 
 
 Conclusions : The sibling recurrence rate of ASD is higher than suggested by previous estimates. The size of the current sample and prospective nature of data collection minimized many limitations of previous studies of sibling recurrence. Clinical implications, including genetic counseling, are discussed.

"In many autism prevalence studies, higher socio-economic status (SES) for the parents is correlated with higher autism rates in the children of those families.  While a conclusive reason for this has not been shown, it has been conjectured that the SES variability could be due to social influences such as access to care. A recent study from Sweden shows the opposite.   In this study, lower income families and children of parents with manual occupations show higher autism prevalence: OBJECTIVE: 
Epidemiological studies in the United States consistently find autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to be overrepresented in high socioeconomic status (SES) families. These findings starkly contrast with SES gradients of many health conditions, and may result from SES inequalities in access to services. We hypothesized that prenatal measures of low, not high, parental SES would be associated with an increased risk of offspring ASD, once biases in case ascertainment are minimized. 
 METHOD: 
We tested this hypothesis in a population-based study in Sweden, a country that has free universal healthcare, routine screening for developmental problems, and thorough protocols for diagnoses of ASD. In a case-control study nested in a total population cohort of children aged 0 to 17 years living in Stockholm County between 2001 and 2007 (N = 589,114), we matched ASD cases (n = 4,709) by age and sex to 10 randomly selected controls. We retrieved parental SES measures collected at time of birth by record linkage. 
 RESULTS: 
Children of families with lower income, and of parents with manual occupations (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.3-1.6) were at higher risk of ASD. No important relationships with parental education were observed. These associations were present after accounting for parental ages, migration status, parity, psychiatric service use, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and birth characteristics; and regardless of comorbid intellectual disability. 
 CONCLUSIONS: 
Lower, not higher, socioeconomic status was associated with an increased risk of ASD. Studies finding the opposite may be underestimating the burden of ASD in lower SES groups. I haven’t been able to view the full study yet, so I am not sure what influences the authors may be implicated.  What they do suggest is that the autism prevalence in lower SES groups may be underestimated in many prevalence estimates.  I don’t think this will come as a surprise to many who consider the lower prevalence in the lower SES groups to be an indication of social factors at play.

"That is the question researchers at the University of Wisconsin studied in a recent paper in the  Wisconsin Medical Journal : Socioeconomic Disparity in the Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Wisconsin. The brief report looked at the data used in the 2002 CDC prevalence study that reported 1 in 150 children are diagnosed with autism in the U.S..  The data are collected through the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. 
 
Here is one of the tables : 
 Prevalence vs SES for Wisconsin What’s it say? Basically, if you are wealthy or have a high level of education, your kid is much more likely to be diagnosed autistic. The authors are pretty limited in what they can say.  They didn’t look into the “why”.  That they did say was this: Although the positive association with SES reported here is consistent with early observations of autism and some previous epidemiologic studies,2-3,5 the reason for this association and the potential role of SES differences in access to health and educational services for ASD cannot be determined from the data available. and: Further research is also needed to examine whether the association reported in this paper is a result of differential access to health services, other sources of ascertainment bias, or SES differences in the risk of developing ASD. Do I think that kids of wealthy parents are really 2.5 times more likely to *be* autistic?  No.  But, are they more likely to *get* a diagnosis?  It sure looks like it. I am not surprised.  There are very large disparities by geography (state to state, rural vs. urban) and by ethnicity in much of the CDC’s ADDM network data.  I was surprised that the disparity by socio-economic-status was so large.

When one “identical” twin has autism, the odds are high that the other twin does as well.  But, what about those cases where only one twin has autism?  The pair is “discordant”.   One of the major twin studies ongoing is the “Child and Adolescent Twin Study of Sweden” (CATSS).  The study is not just an autism study, as  their website  notes: The aim of this study is to investigate how both genetic and environmental effects influence health and behavior in children and adolescents. In this study parents to all Swedish twins turning 9 or 12 years are asked to complete a telephone interview concerning the health and behavior of their twins. The interview screens for several different health (e.g., asthma, allergies, diabetes) and behavior (e.g., attention, social interaction) problems. Some of the families will be followed up with additional questionnaires, as well as with genotyping and clinical interviews.  By studying discordant pairs, they are able to look for other risk factors.  In this case, low birth weight.  They found that low birth weight confers a significant risk for autism.  Three times higher risk for a discordant autism pair for low birth weights. They conclude ” a non-genetic influence associated with birth weight may contribute to the development of ASD” Here is the abstract: Lower birth weight indicates higher risk of autistic traits in discordant twin pairs.

Abstract 
BACKGROUND: 
 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder of complex etiology. Although strong evidence supports the causal role of genetic factors, environmental risk factors have also been implicated. This study used a co-twin-control design to investigate low birth weight as a risk factor for ASD. 
 Method 
We studied a population-based sample of 3715 same-sex twin pairs participating in the Child and Adolescent Twin Study of Sweden (CATSS). ASD was assessed using a structured parent interview for screening of ASD and related developmental disorders, based on DSM-IV criteria. Birth weight was obtained from medical birth records maintained by the Swedish Medical Birth Registry. 
 RESULTS: 
 Twins lower in birth weight in ASD-discordant twin pairs (n=34) were more than three times more likely to meet criteria for ASD than heavier twins [odds ratio (OR) 3.25]. Analyses of birth weight as a continuous risk factor showed a 13% reduction in risk of ASD for every 100 g increase in birth weight (n=78). Analysis of the effect of birth weight on ASD symptoms in the entire population (most of whom did not have ASD) showed a modest association. That is, for every 100 g increase in birth weight, a 2% decrease in severity of ASD indexed by scores on the Autism – Tics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), and other Comorbidities (A-TAC) inventory would be expected in the sample as a whole. 
 CONCLUSIONS: 
 The data were consistent with the hypothesis that low birth weight confers risk to ASD. Thus, although genetic effects are of major importance, a non-genetic influence associated with birth weight may contribute to the development of ASD.

Autism Prevalence in Gothenburg Sweden
" "
I haven't seen the full text of this one yet but it looks interesting.  The 0.80% is relatively close to what was found in the US 5 years ago but I have to wonder why it is so far below the more recent 2.64% estimate out of South Korea. 
 The Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Toddlers: A Population Study of 2-Year-Old Swedish Children .  
   Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is more common than previously believed. ASD is increasingly diagnosed at very young ages. We report estimated ASD prevalence rates from a population study of 2-year-old children conducted in 2010 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Screening for ASD had been introduced at all child health centers at child age 21/2 years. All children with suspected ASD were referred for evaluation to one center, serving the whole city of Gothenburg. The prevalence for all 2-year-olds referred in 2010 and diagnosed with ASD was 0.80%. Corresponding rates for 2-year-olds referred to the center in 2000 and 2005 (when no population screening occurred) were 0.18 and 0.04%. Results suggest that early screening contributes to a large increase in diagnosed ASD cases.

The people at Kaiser Permanente, the MIND Institute and the California Department of Public Health must account for a sizable fraction of research papers published.

Such is the case with at least part of the recent study,  Is Infertility Associated with Childhood Autism?   The authors found no evidence of increased risk for ASD with infertility.

Interpretation of existing studies is limited by racial/ethnic homogeneity of study populations and other factors.

Among singletons (349 cases, 1,847 controls), we found no evidence to support an increase in risk of ASD associated with infertility. Among multiple births (21 cases, 54 controls), we found an increased risk associated with infertility history and with infertility evaluations and treatment around the time of index pregnancy conception; however, small sample size and lack of detailed data on treatments preclude firm interpretation of results for multiple births. –by Matt Carey " 0.000181474438643775 0.000812497544746654 0.000716031732823871 0.000337685246378591 8.42585164478326e-05 0.000443699753624055 0.82408446125013 0.0006910936491502 0.0217816950941192 0.000218974587733716 0.000320329573397867 0.000144066565262309 0.000382365256176559 0.000248421680533453 0.00027980755000392 0.00828065538763683 0.000492115078634441 0.000834337952729405 0.0670932998514352 0.000532302506624085 0.000234722106952378 0.00105534404228266 0.000570071557573796 0.000348220744270008 0.000473223222831004 0.000233228997220265 0.0174226032483119 0.00124455130627271 0.000357151377161299 0.00040771163107856 0.000334901048128906 0.0360560317245821 0.00105803198017926 0.000545698198571983 0.001425698646057 0.000216915169557259 0.000396486961974636 0.000254982709935799 0.000303748422097826 0.00151813839363236 0.00214692393773213 0.000191850105386451 0.000732277286191218 0.000179267996944798 0.000187064340639984 0.000491475277480415 0.00102450311880841 0.000321619118999989 0.000517744174239701 0.00179023993867288

Regional Differences And Quarterly Growth Due To Two Factors
" "
I previously argued that apparent differences in the prevalence of autism across regions in the state of California must be due to group inequivalence. Given that there is a clear  broadening of criteria  component as time goes by, I suggested that some Regional Centers are simply behind in their knowledge of autism and catching up. But after looking at client characteristics per Regional Center, I have found that the reality is a bit more complex. Quarterly caseload growth and regional caseload differences seem to be affected by two factors that act largely independently. Table 1: Q4 2005 Autistic Client Characteristics By Regional Center Regional Center Autism-Epilepsy Ratio Epilepsy MR Severe Behaviors In MR Population CVRC 0.32 5.31% 25.6% 20.99% 2.48% SDRC 0.62 6.82% 54.73% 23.42% 9.26% SARC 0.85 5.45% 17.70% 14.67% 5.31% ELARC 1.34 6.06% 21.19% 17.67% 8.49% WRC 1.61 5.51% 22.38% 13.25% 10.73% Table 1 shows that there is inequivalence between Regional Centers, but it is not as straight forward as the inequivalence observed in the state-wide quarterly data. A pattern emerges, however, if you look at the proportion of autistics in the population with mental retardation. Except for San Diego (SDRC), which does appear to be behind in criteria, it would seem that differences in autism rates can be explained by how many clients evaluated as having mental retardation are also determined to be autistic. In order to test this hypothesis, let us adjust the autism caseload by assuming that 7% of all clients with mental retardation are also classified as autistic (as this is roughly the state-wide average). We will then see what the proportion of MR and lack of it among autistics might be given this assumption. Table 2: Q4 2005 Adjusted Characteristics (Theoretical) Regional Center Autism-Epilepsy Ratio MR No MR CVRC 0.47 49.21% 47.90% SDRC 0.54 47.74% 46.83% SARC 0.89 22.10% 60.96% ELARC 1.32 17.82% 77.29% WRC 1.48 15.81% 77.69% Table 2 looks more like the state-wide time-based data, as we would expect. The consistency of these results does two things: - It suggests that our assumption is probably valid. That is, the proportion of autistics in the MR population throws off the numbers, and differences in this proportion are apparent, not actual. - It suggests that the proportion of autism in the non-MR population varies from region to region simply due to inequivalence, i.e. differences in criteria between regions. New Model These findings lead me to come up with a more specific model to explain both the explosion in diagnoses since the early 1990s and regional differences in apparent prevalence. The model involves two factors: 1) There is increasing recognition of autism in the population with MR. [This was already noted in  \"Like Missing a Train Wreck\" - By The Numbers ]. 2) There is increasing recognition of autism in the population without MR. These two factors act somewhat independently. As time goes by, both occur simultaneously. But they may vary independently from region to region. For example, San Diego (SDRC) is considerably behind the average Regional Center in Factor # 2, but is considerably ahead in Factor # 1. Fresno (CVRC) is considerably behind in both factors. West LA (WRC) is considerably ahead in both. In retrospect, these two factors are obvious. But note that a common error is to assume that 'broadening criteria' includes only Factor # 2.

"20921" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/01/10/increased-autism-risk-found-in-closely-spaced-pregancies/" "Increased autism risk found in closely spaced pregancies" "Prof. Peter Bearman  is the Jonathan Cole Professor of the Social Sciences at Columbia University.  His team has been delving in-depth into the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS) data on autism. There are some big caveats to using the CDDS data.  These include: 
The CDDS dataset is based on administrative prevalence.  In other words, it is a listing of individuals who sought and were successful getting services.  It is not a listing of all autistics in California and it the standards of inclusion are not standardized over time and geography. In terms of shear size, it is probably the largest such dataset in the U.S..  So, taking the limitations to heart, it is worth taking a look at what one can do with these data. The authors note this: Use of administrative records of the California DDS for identification of autism represents a strength of the study, facilitating population-based analyses over 11 years of birth records from this populous and diverse state. However, inclusion as a case subject depends on seeking services and receiving a qualifying diagnosis, with previous reports estimating that 75% to 80% of people with autism in California register with the DDS. The authors are: Keely Cheslack-Postava, PhD, MSPH, Kayuet Liu, DPhil, and Peter S. Bearman, PhD. The team took the data and asked, is there an increased risk of autism for children based on how long the parents waited after a previous birth? Consider second-born children.  If a mother gets pregnant right after her first born, is the risk of autism the same, greater or less than if she waits?  Based on what they found, the Columbia group would say that the risk is higher if the mother gets pregnant again shortly after giving birth. Here is a blurb on the study: INCREASED AUTISM RISK FOUND IN CLOSELY SPACED PREGNANCIES 
  
An examination of California birth records found second-born children were more than three times more likely to be diagnosed with autism if they were conceived within 12 months of the birth of their older sibling. The farther apart pregnancies were spaced, the lower the risk of autism. The study, “Closely Spaced Pregnancies Are Associated With Increased Odds of Autism in California Sibling Births” published in the February 2011 issue of Pediatrics (published online Jan. 10) examined the odds of autism among more than 660,000 second-born children. Compared to children who were conceived more than three years after the birth of an older sibling, children conceived after an interpregnancy interval (IPI) of less than 12 months were over three times more likely to be diagnosed with autism. Children conceived after an IPI of 12 to 23 months were 1.86 times more likely to have been diagnosed with autism, and children conceived after an IPI of 24 to 35 months were 1.26 times more likely to have been diagnosed with autism. 
  
One possible explanation for the increased risk of autism is that women are more likely to have depleted levels of nutrients such as folate and iron, as well as higher stress levels, after a recent pregnancy; however, these factors were not tested in the current study. Study authors suggest the finding is particularly important given trends in birth spacing in the U.S.; between 1995 and 2002, the proportion of births occurring within 24 months of a previous birth increased from 11 percent to 18 percent. Closely spaced births occur because of unintended pregnancies but also by choice, particularly among older women who delay childbearing. The study was funded by the NIH Director’s Pioneer Award Program. Here is the abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the interpregnancy interval (IPI) is associated with the risk of autism in subsequent births. 
 METHODS: Pairs of first- and second-born singleton full siblings were identified from all California births that occurred from 1992 to 2002 using birth records, and autism diagnoses were identified by using linked records of the California Department of Developmental Services. IPI was calculated as the time interval between birth dates minus the gestational age of the second sibling. In the primary analysis, logistic regression models were used to determine whether odds of autism in second-born children varied according to IPI. To address potential confounding by unmeasured family-level factors, a case-sibling control analysis determined whether affected sibling (first versus second) varied with IPI. 
 RESULTS: An inverse association between IPI and odds of autism among 662 730 second-born children was observed. In particular, IPIs of 36 months. The association was not mediated by preterm birth or low birth weight and persisted across categories of sociodemographic characteristics, with some attenuation in the oldest and youngest parents. Second-born children were at increased risk of autism relative to their firstborn siblings only in pairs with short IPIs. 
 CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that children born after shorter intervals between pregnancies are at increased risk of developing 
autism; the highest risk was associated with pregnancies spaced <1 year apart. Pediatrics 2011;127:000 Simply put, they claim that indeed there is an increased risk of autism if a follow-on pregnancy comes shortly after the first.  In fact, the odds of having an autistic child are  Here is Figure 2 of the paper .  This shows their computed odds ratio as a function of IPI–inter-pregnancy interval.   The authors conclusion is: This study provides evidence of an inverse association between IPIs and autism risk, with a more than threefold elevated odds in pregnancies conceived within a year of a previous birth. This finding is particularly important given trends in birth spacing in the United States. Between 1995 and 2002, the proportion of births occurring within 24 months of a previous birth increased from 11% to 18%. Closely spaced births occur in some part because of unintended pregnancies but also by choice, particularly among women who delay childbearing. Therefore, additional research to confirm this association in other populations and to undercover underlying mechanisms is particularly critical. As with any study like this, replication is critical.    But, if there isn’t some unkown artifact at play here, this could point to more information on causation in autism.

They used the  Interactive Autism Network  database.  Here is the abstract: Current estimates of the heritability of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) derived from existing clinical twin studies1, 2, 3, 4 are potentially confounded by a number of factors, including low sample size, inconsistency in case definition and the role of de novo mutation (currently estimated to contribute to some 20% of cases), and the possibility that heritable causes of ASD in a twin could result in environmentally engendered affectation of a non-identical co-twin in utero, especially if mediated by humoral or immune mechanisms. To minimize these confounds, we compared autism recurrence in half siblings versus that in full siblings, using data (6 June 2011) from over five thousand families enrolled in the Interactive Autism Network (IAN), a national volunteer register for ASD, detailed characteristics of which have been previously described by our group. Recurrence rate among full siblings was observed to be approximately twice that among half siblings, providing strong evidence of genetic transmission of ASD. The recurrence risk is the chance that a sibling has autism if another sibling does.   The authors found the recurrence risk to be twice as high for full siblings, which is consistent with a primarily genetic model of autism risk. This follows on a number of recent twin studies ( here ,  here  and  here ) have shown a lower concordance than previously estimated and  the baby siblings study  which showed a 19% recurrence risk for autism. I wonder at how many half-siblings there are in the cohort.  A small subpopulation could mean large error bars.

"23247" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/07/18/genetic-heritability-and-shared-environmental-factors-among-twin-pairs-with-autism/" "Genetic Heritability and Shared Environmental Factors Among Twin Pairs With Autism" "The results of the long-awaited  California Autism Twin Study (CATS)  have been published.  The article,  Genetic Heritability and Shared Environmental Factors Among Twin Pairs With Autism  appears in the Archives of General Psychiatry and is open-access (i.e. free).  The study set out “To provide rigorous quantitative estimates of genetic heritability of autism and the effects of shared environment.” The basic idea of a  twin study  is fairly straighforward: “identical” (or monozygotic, MZ) twins share 100% of their DNA, “fraternal” (dizygotic, or DZ) twins share about 50% of their DNA.  If a condition is purely genetic, identical twins will both have the condition or not have the condition.  The percentage of twins with a condition is called  concordance .  High concordance implies a highly genetic condition.   Early twin studies  showed a high concordance.  These studies were relatively small.  The first study, Infantile autism: a genetic study of 21 twin pairs, was published in 1977 and included, as you might guess, only 21 twin pairs.  Of these, 10 DZ and 11 MZ twins.  There were three twin studies which made up the main body of knowledge suggesting a strong heritability of autism, including a total of 56 pairs. The California Twin study sought to take a much closer look.  First by including a much greater number of twin pairs, and second by including modern diagnostic methods.  They used the California Department of Developmental Services as a resource to identify twin pairs with at least one autistic.  The CDDS database has advantages and disadvantages.  First, the database is large and covers fairly diverse state.  This is important when you consider that (a) only about 1% of the population is autistic and (2)  only about 3.2% of the population are twins .   That means about 1 in 3000 are twins+autistic.   The disadvantages of the CDDS as a resource include the fact that not everyone with an ASD qualifies for services or is correctly classified.  Of those who qualify, inclusion in the CDDS is voluntary.  Technically, the CDDS serves only those with autistic disorder or those in the “fifth category” which includes “…disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or requiring treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation.”  This would limit the ability to identify ASD concordance.  For example, twins who both have Asperger syndrome. One major strength of the study was the use of clinical assessments plus parent interviews for diagnosis.  They did not rely upon the CDDS reports for diagnoses.  Also, the study determined twin status (MZ or DZ) through genetic testing, something which wasn’t available when the first twin studies were performed.  Here is the abstract for the study: Context  Autism is considered the most heritable of neurodevelopmental disorders, mainly because of the large difference in concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. 
 Objective  To provide rigorous quantitative estimates of genetic heritability of autism and the effects of shared environment. 
 Design, Setting, and Participants  Twin pairs with at least 1 twin with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) born between 1987 and 2004 were identified through the California Department of Developmental Services. 
 Main Outcome Measures  Structured diagnostic assessments (Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) were completed on 192 twin pairs. Concordance rates were calculated and parametric models were fitted for 2 definitions, 1 narrow (strict autism) and 1 broad (ASD). 
 Results  For strict autism, probandwise concordance for male twins was 0.58 for 40 monozygotic pairs (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.74) and 0.21 for 31 dizygotic pairs (95% CI, 0.09-0.43); for female twins, the concordance was 0.60 for 7 monozygotic pairs (95% CI, 0.28-0.90) and 0.27 for 10 dizygotic pairs (95% CI, 0.09-0.69). For ASD, the probandwise concordance for male twins was 0.77 for 45 monozygotic pairs (95% CI, 0.65-0.86) and 0.31 for 45 dizygotic pairs (95% CI, 0.16-0.46); for female twins, the concordance was 0.50 for 9 monozygotic pairs (95% CI, 0.16-0.84) and 0.36 for 13 dizygotic pairs (95% CI, 0.11-0.60). A large proportion of the variance in liability can be explained by shared environmental factors (55%; 95% CI, 9%-81% for autism and 58%; 95% CI, 30%-80% for ASD) in addition to moderate genetic heritability (37%; 95% CI, 8%-84% for autism and 38%; 95% CI, 14%-67% for ASD). 
 Conclusion  Susceptibility to ASD has moderate genetic heritability and a substantial shared twin environmental component. The concordance values are 77% for male MZ twins and 50% for female MZ twins.  These values are high.  But the heritability estimates are influenced not just by the MZ twin concordance, but by the difference between MZ and DZ concordance.  Consider if 100% of “identical” twins had a condition.  This doesn’t necessarily mean that the condition is fully caused by hertiablity if, say, 100% of the “fraternal” twins also had the condition.   In the California Twin study, DZ concordance values were relatively high (31% for males and 36% for females). Based on these values, the authors calculate that shared environment accounts for 55% of the risk of autism and 37% for genetic heritability. There are big “error bars” (or confidence intervals) for the concordance and heritablity values.  It is worth noting that the concordance values here are similar to those  reported recently by Bearman’s team at Columbia  (40-50% pairwise concordance for MZ twins.  This study also used the CDDS as a resource, but did not use clinical assessments) and  Goldsmith’s group at the University of Wisconsin  (43% pairwise concordance).  These  studies also concluded that genetic heritability was lower than previously thought. The authors concluded their paper: Our study provides evidence that the rate of concordance in dizygotic twins may have been seriously underestimated in previous studies and the influence of genetic factors on the susceptibility to develop autism, overestimated. Because of the reported high heritability of autism, a major focus of research in autism has been on finding the underlying genetic causes, with less emphasis on potential environmental triggers or causes. The finding of significant influence of the shared environment, experiences that are common to both twin individuals, may be important for future research paradigms. Increasingly, evidence is accumulating that overt symptoms of autism emerge around the end of the first year of life. Because the prenatal environment and early postnatal environment are shared between twin individuals, we hypothesize that at least some of the environmental factors impacting susceptibility to autism exert their effect during this critical period of life. Nongenetic risk factors that may index environmental influences include parental age, low birth weight, multiple births, and maternal infections during pregnancy. Future studies that seek to elucidate such factors and their role in enhancing or suppressing genetic susceptibility are likely to enhance our understanding of autism. The authors can be heard on KQED in San Francisco discussing the paper.  http://www.kqed.org/assets/flash/kqedplayer.swf In a companion commentary on Archives of General Psychiatry,  Is Autism, at Least in Part, a Disorder of Fetal Programming? , Peter Szatmari comments on the shift in perception based on the new heritability estimates: “The autism field can now join the chorus and ask, “Where did all the heritability go?” We now appear to have an answer, at least in part: those original estimates were inflated.” “Inflated” seems a bit of a loaded word.  There are big error bars on the current study, there were even bigger ones in the old studies.  What I found very interesting was this peak at an upcoming paper by the Baby Siblings Research Consortium: The high DZ concordance rate is consistent with estimates reported from the Baby Siblings Research Consortium. In these studies, infant siblings of children with ASD are followed up from birth to age 36 months so that risk can be calculated in a prospective fashion. The latest report from the Baby Siblings Research Consortium suggests that the risk is upwards of 20%, which is slightly less than the DZ rate provided by Hallmayer and colleagues (31%-36% for ASD). The confidence intervals of the estimates overlap to be sure, but this may also suggest potential ascertainment bias for concordant as opposed to nonconcordant DZ twin pairs or that twinning itself is a risk factor for ASD. (reference: Ozonoff S, Young G, Carter AS, Messinger D, Yirmiya N, Zwaigenbaum L, Bryson SE, Carver L, Constantino J, Dobkins K, Hutman T, Iverson J, Landa R, Rogers S, Sigman M, Stone W. Recurrence risk for autism spectrum disorders: a Baby Siblings Research Consortium Study. Pediatrics. In press.) They commentary poses some good questions about potential bias in the California Autism Twin Study: One must ask whether there was any bias artificially reducing concordance in the study by Hallmayer and colleagues. One possibility is missing data, which are substantial. Another possibility is differential misclassification. It is not inconceivable that parents are more likely to rate MZ twins with a disability as more dissimilar than DZ twins. There may be an unconscious effort on their part to see one twin as less affected than the other. Such reporting effects, known as sibling deidentification, have been reported for twin studies of temperament.8 It would be extremely interesting to see whether concordance rates differ by instrument, ie, the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised, which is based on parental report, vs the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, which is based on an independent observer. If the sensitivity of the measurement tool is less in MZ twins than in DZ twins, a smaller difference in observed concordance rates would be expected compared with true concordance rates based on no measurement error. and: A third threat to the validity of the findings is that twinning itself might be a risk factor for ASD, so that the heritability estimates generated would not be generalizable to the population of nontwin children with ASD. There may be some factor associated with twinning such as maternal age, coming from a monochoreonic placenta, prematurity, or in vitro fertilization that could place twins at risk for ASD. There is in fact some evidence that twins have a higher rate of autism than nontwins,9 but further work needs to be undertaken to provide better evidence.
 It’s taken 34 years since the first autism twin study until the much larger California Autism Twin Study.  This has been a time consuming and expensive undertaking.  I doubt there will be a chance in the near future for a larger study to address the issues laid out above.  This doesn’t preclude some other studies to clarify some questions, but the California Autism Twin Study will likely stand for some time before being challenged or confirmed.

"Perhaps the most well-known statistics about autism come from the CDC’s autism surveillance project.  The  Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network  is a multi-state operation coordinated by the CDC.   Their reports are the source of the “1 in 166”, “1 in 150” and “1 in 100” numbers one hears in the press and elsewhere.  The Netweork looks at children’s medical records, educational records and sometimes both sets of records and make determinations of which children have autism spectrum disorders (ASD’s).  This allows the Network to monitor large numbers of children.  But they don’t actually test each child,bringing up questions of how accurate are the prevalence numbers. A CDC team has looked into this question (actually, questions) in a recent paper: Evaluation of a Records-Review Surveillance System Used to Determine the Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Abstract 
 We conducted the first study that estimates the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of a population-based autism spectrum disorders (ASD) surveillance system developed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The system employs a records-review methodology that yields ASD classification (case versus non-ASD case) and was compared with classification based on clinical examination. The study enrolled 177 children. Estimated specificity (0.96, [CI(.95) = 0.94, 0.99]), PPV (0.79 [CI(.95) = 0.66, 0.93]), and NPV (0.91 [CI(.95) = 0.87, 0.96]) were high. Sensitivity was lower (0.60 [CI(.95) = 0.45, 0.75]). Given diagnostic heterogeneity, and the broad array of ASD in the population, identifying children with ASD is challenging. Records-based surveillance yields a population-based estimate of ASD that is likely conservative If you are looking for a glossary for these terms,  one can be found here . Sensitivity: Proportion of persons with condition who test positive 
 Specificity: Proportion of persons without condition who test negative. 
 Positive Predictive Value (PPV): Proportion of persons with positive test who have condition 
 Negative Predictive Value (NPV): Proportion of persons with negative test who do not have condition. The methods used scored well in specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. What was somewhat lacking is sensitivity–proportion of people who test positive.    Many children with ASD’s are not captured by the methods used, suggesting that the estimates by the CDC are likely low. What would be very interesting to see would be how the sensitivity has varied over time.  Is part of the rise in the CDC’s autism prevalence estimates due to changes in sensitivity?  Could the records be getting better as a result of the autism awareness campaigns over the last 10 or more years?

Study Watch : Trends in the Prevalence of Developmental Disabilities in US Children, 1997–2008
" "
According to a  new study  due to be published in the June issue of Pediatrics, the number of children and teenagers diagnosed with a developmental disability has increased 17 percent since the late 1990s.  
 
 Trends in the Prevalence of Developmental Disabilities in US Children, 1997–2008 
 
 Objective : To fill gaps in crucial data needed for health and educational planning, we determined the prevalence of developmental disabilities in US children and in selected populations for a recent 12-year period. 
 
 Participants and Methods : We used data on children aged 3 to 17 years from the 1997–2008 National Health Interview Surveys, which are ongoing nationally representative samples of US households. Parent-reported diagnoses of the following were included: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; intellectual disability; cerebral palsy; autism; seizures; stuttering or stammering; moderate to profound hearing loss; blindness; learning disorders; and/or other developmental delays. 
 
 Results : Boys had a higher prevalence overall and for a number of select disabilities compared with girls. Hispanic children had the lowest prevalence for a number of disabilities compared with non-Hispanic white and black children. Low income and public health insurance were associated with a higher prevalence of many disabilities. Prevalence of any developmental disability increased from 12.84% to 15.04% over 12 years. Autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other developmental delays increased, whereas hearing loss showed a significant decline. These trends were found in all of the sociodemographic subgroups, except for autism in non-Hispanic black children. 
 
 Conclusions : Developmental disabilities are common and were reported in ~1 in 6 children in the United States in 2006–2008. The number of children with select developmental disabilities (autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other developmental delays) has increased, requiring more health and education services. Additional study of the influence of risk-factor shifts, changes in acceptance, and benefits of early services is needed.

I’ll come back for more detail and discussion soon, but the bottom line: the autism prevalence estimate for the US is now about 2%.  3.23% for boys. Here is the press release for this: CDC and HRSA issue report on changes in prevalence of parent-reported  
 Autism Spectrum Disorder in school-aged children  
 Who: CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics and the Health Resources and Services Administration 
 What: “Changes in Prevalence of Parent-Reported Autism Spectrum Disorder in School-Aged Children: 2007 to 2011-2012.” 
  The report was co-authored by HRSA and data collection was conducted by the CDC.  The data come from the National Survey of Children’s Health, a nationally representative phone survey of households with children. This survey is conducted every four years. 
 Main findings of the report: 
 · The prevalence of parent-reported ASD among children aged 6-17 years was 2 percent in 2011-2012 compared to 1.2 percent in 2007. 
 · The change in prevalence estimates was greatest for boys and for adolescents aged 14 to 17 years. 
 · Children who were first diagnosed in or after 2008 were more likely to have milder ASD than those diagnosed in or before 2007. 
 · Much of the increase in the prevalence estimates from 2007 to 2011-2012 for school-aged children was the result of diagnoses of children with previously unrecognized ASD. 
 The report is available at  http://www.cdc.gov/nchs .  
 For information about HRSA’s autism efforts visit  http://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs/autism/index.html .  
 For information about CDC’s autism efforts visit  http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html .  As indicated above, there are clearly social factors at play involving identification of individuals previously unidentified.  For example: If one looks at the prevalence estimate for 6-9 year olds in 2007, a value of 1.31% was obtained.  In 2010-11, the prevalence for children born in the same years (now aged 10-13 years old) is 2.39%.  In other words, children born in the years 1998-2001 saw an big increase in the estimated autism prevalence.   For the 2010-11 report, about 1/3 of the children were diagnosed after 2008.  These are children 6-17 years old, so they were born in 2005 and before.  About 30% of children born in 1998-2001 were diagnosed after 2008.  These are children aged 7-13. And, yes, this means that the thimerosal hypothesis, the notion that the increased exposure to thimerosal from vaccines in the 1990’s cause an autism-epidemic, is even less viable.  There are obviously a number of social influences behind the increase in autism prevalence estimates in the U.S..  These could mask a “real” increase (or, interestingly,  a real decrease ).  But had thimerosal been a primary driver of the increased prevalence, the prevalence would be dropping.  The prevalence for children 6-9 years old, children born after the phase out of thimerosal, now is estimated at 1.82%. —

 Antidepressants associated with autism. — Environmental Health News Antidepressant Use During Pregnancy and Childhood Autism Spectrum Disorders Lisa A. Croen, PhD; Judith K. Grether, PhD; Cathleen K. Yoshida, MS; Roxana Odouli, MSPH; Victoria Hendrick, MD  Arch Gen Psychiatry. Published online July 4, 2011. doi:10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.73 Context  The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has increased over recent years. Use of antidepressant medications during pregnancy also shows a secular increase in recent decades, prompting concerns that prenatal exposure may contribute to increased risk of ASD. Objective  To systematically evaluate whether prenatal exposure to antidepressant medications is associated with increased risk of ASD. Design  Population-based case-control study. Medical records were used to ascertain case children and control children and to derive prospectively recorded information on mothers' use of antidepressant medications, mental health history of mothers, and demographic and medical covariates. Setting  The Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Northern California. Participants  A total of 298 case children with ASD (and their mothers) and 1507 randomly selected control children (and their mothers) drawn from the membership of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Northern California. Main Outcome Measures  ASDs. Results  Prenatal exposure to antidepressant medications was reported for 20 case children (6.7%) and 50 control children (3.3%). In adjusted logistic regression models, we found a 2-fold increased risk of ASD associated with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by the mother during the year before delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.3]), with the strongest effect associated with treatment during the first trimester (adjusted odds ratio, 3.8 [95% confidence interval, 1.8-7.8]). No increase in risk was found for mothers with a history of mental health treatment in the absence of prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Conclusion  Although the number of children exposed prenatally to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this population was low, results suggest that exposure, especially during the first trimester, may modestly increase the risk of ASD. The potential risk associated with exposure must be balanced with the risk to the mother or fetus of untreated mental health disorders.

I recently wrote a rather long introduction  to their recent paper,  Social Demographic Change and Autism . The study abstract is here: Social Demographic Change and Autism 
Liu K, Zerubavel N, Bearman P. 
 Abstract 
 Parental age at child’s birth–which has increased for U.S. children in the 1992-2000 birth cohorts–is strongly associated with an increased risk of autism. By turning a social demographic lens on the historical patterning of concordance among twin pairs, we identify a central mechanism for this association: de novo mutations, which are deletions, insertions, and duplications of DNA in the germ cells that are not present in the parents’ DNA. Along the way, we show that a demographic eye on the rising prevalence of autism leads to three major discoveries. First, the estimated heritability of autism has been dramatically overstated. Second, heritability estimates can change over remarkably short periods of time because of increases in germ cell mutations. Third, social demographic change can yield genetic changes that, at the population level, combine to contribute to the increased prevalence of autism. They start by noting their group’s previous work which showed an increased risk for autism based on both maternal and paternal age.  There is a strong relationship between parental age and autism. The one study (King et al. 2009) that decomposes maternal and paternal age—and confounding cohort effects— identifies maternal age as riskier than paternal age (using the California data deployed in this analysis).  Relative risks were as high as 1.8.  These are not as high as the increased risk for Down Syndrome, which can be 10x higher in older mothers, but it is still a notable effect.   The authors note that parental age has increased notably during the 1990’s, the same time that the “autism epidemic” started. … the proportion of children born whose parents were age 35 or older at birth increased rapidly: from 24.3% in 1992 to 36.2% in 2000. Many factors have been identified as correlated to the autism increase.   Basically anything that increased over the 1990’s could be argued to be correlated with an increase in autism prevalence.   Correlation is not causation, as we hear over and over.  One must go beyond correlation in order to claim that there is a real effect. And Prof. Bearman’s group does go beyond correlation.  They look at autism in twins and siblings and show that (1) the concordance is much lower than has been previously reported and (2) the concordance is changing with time.   They go into detail on the methods in the paper, including how to determine how many twins were “identical” (monozygotic or MZ) vs. fraternal dizygotic or DZ).   Here is the table  showing the concordance for twins and sibling pairs from the paper,  Casewise and Pairwise concordance numbers are given. Casewise concordance (Pcw) measures the probability that a co-twin will be affected (with a given disorder), given that the other twin is affected. Pairwise concordance (Ppw) measures the proportion of concordant (both twins are affected) pairs in all pairs with at least one twin who is affected. Pairwise concordance is what most people think of as concordance. The pairwise concordance is 40% for MZ (identical) male twins and 50% for female twins.  Much lower than the higher values from previous, smaller studies which claimed 36-90% concordance.  From the paper from Prof. Bearman’s group: The Evidence for High Heritability of Autism 
To date, the strongest evidence supporting the idea that autism is a genetic disorder arises from twin and family studies. Previous twin studies on full syndrome autism have reported high pairwise concordance rates in identical (MZ) twins (36%–96%) and low concordance rates in fraternal (DZ) twin pairs (0%–31%) (Bailey et al. 1995; Folstein and Rutter 1977; Ritvo et al. 1985; Steffenburg et al. 1989). Because MZ twins share 100% of their genes while DZ twins share only around 50%, a large difference between MZ and DZ concordance rates is regarded as strong evidence for genetic infl uences. The recurrence risk of autism in siblings is reported to range from 3%–9%, which is much higher than the population rate of 10 in 10,000 children (Baird and August 1985; Bolton et al. 1994; Piven et al. 1990; Ritvo et al. 1989).3 Relatives of a child with autism are also more likely to have broadly defined autism spectrum traits than controls (Szatmari et al. 2000).  Low concordance is consistent with another recent study, G enetic variance for autism screening items in an unselected sample of toddler-age twins , from Prof. Goldsmith’s group at U. Wisconsin.  The abstract is below: OBJECTIVE: Twin and family studies of autistic traits and of cases diagnosed with autism suggest high heritability; however, the heritability of autistic traits in toddlers has not been investigated. Therefore, this study’s goals were (1) to screen a statewide twin population using items similar to the six critical social and communication items widely used for autism screening in toddlers (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers); (2) to assess the endorsement rates of these items in a general population; and (3) to determine their heritability. 
 METHOD: Participants composed a statewide, unselected twin population. Screening items were administered to mothers of 1,211 pairs of twins between 2 and 3 years of age. Twin similarity was calculated via concordance rates and tetrachoric and intraclass correlations, and the contribution of genetic and environmental factors was estimated with single-threshold ordinal models. 
 RESULTS: The population-based twin sample generated endorsement rates on the analogs of the six critical items similar to those reported by the scale’s authors, which they used to determine an autism threshold. Current twin similarity and model-fitting analyses also used this threshold. Casewise concordance rates for monozygotic (43%) and dizygotic (20%) twins suggested moderate heritability of these early autism indicators in the general population. Variance component estimates from model-fitting also suggested moderate heritability of categorical scores. 
 CONCLUSIONS: Autism screener scores are moderately heritable in 2- to 3-year-old twin children from a population-based twin panel. Inferences about sex differences are limited by the scarcity of females who scored above the threshold on the toddler-age screener. Back to Prof. Bearman’s study: their analysis went deeper, including measures of the pairwise concordance for non “identical” twins.  Opposite sex twins have a 10% concordance, and same sex twins (dizygotic) have 20% concordance.     That gender difference in concordance is quite notable. The risk of having an autistic child is much higher if one already has an autistic child.    The recurrance risk is about 10% for full siblings, 3% for half siblings.  These values are quite high considering that the autism (not ASD, but autism) prevalence is less than 1%.  The recurrence risk is much higher for siblings of an autistic female than autistic male.   Male siblings of a female “proband” have a recurrence risk of 18%.  Female siblings of a male “proband” have much lower recurrence risk of 5%.   Prof. Bearman’s group has done what may be a first in concordance studies: analyzed data as a function of birth year.  “Temperal concordance”.  I.e. they ask the question, does the concordance change with time?  The answer, yes. Here are panels (A) and (B) from Figure 1 of the paper . Panel (A) shows casewise temporal concordance.  Concordance increases for single-sex (SS) twins, and decreases for other-sex (OS) twins during the 1990’s.  The authors note this is consistent with a de novo mutation mechanism for increased risk for autism.  Panel (B) shows that the average age for the twin parents is also increasing over this time period.  From the paper: In panel B, we report change in mean parental age at twin births, which increases steadily during the same period. Recall that because MZ twins are developed from a single pair of matched egg and sperm cells, any de novo mutations will be found in both twins. In contrast, DZ twins develop from two distinct pairs of egg and sperm cells. Because de novo mutations are rare events, the chance that both DZ twins will share the same de novo mutation is extremely low. If de novo mutations have an increasing causal share in the etiology of autism over time, we should expect an increase in the difference between MZ and DZ concordance rates. One mechanism that accounts for de novo mutations’ increasing share of autism etiology is the rise in parental age over our study period, which is likely to lead to increased mutation rates. One question that naturally arises in regards to multiple births is the use of assisted reproduction technology (ART).  The authors discuss this: Although the genetic influence on autism has been overestimated, it has increased over time due to non-allelic mechanisms. Although the human gene pool does not change substantially over one or two generations, de novo germ-line mutation rates are much more susceptible to rapid social and/or environmental changes (such as rising parental age), and thus can explain the increase in the heritability of autism. Of importance is the fact that although age of parents at birth of twins was signifi cantly higher in 2000 than in 1992, age of parents at the birth of their second-born did not increase over the same period. Thus, the difference between the trends of OS twin concordance and full-sibling recurrence risk may be associated with age of parents. Since the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) is associated with the age of parents and has increased radically over the same time period, ART may be implicated in the increased prevalence of autism. Our data show that the increase in the percentage of children with autism born in multiple births (from 3.6% in 1992 to 5.7% in 2000) exceeded that of the percentage of multiple births in all births in California (from 2.1% in 1992 to 2.9% in 2000). This implication requires future investigation.  The risk of autism is higher with multiple births and increased at a greater rate than the percentage of multiple births in general. The authors discuss the possibility of prenatal exposures to infection or toxicant or a gene/environment interaction might follow the same trends they observe: It remains possible that other factors have contributed to the diverging trends in the SS and OS concordance. A virus or a toxicant experienced in utero could yield the results that we observe. Specifically, an increasingly prevalent virus (or toxicant) associated with a small risk of autism would lead to increasing concordance of SS twins (who often share the same placenta) and decreasing concordance of OS twins. Similarly, interactions between genes and an increasingly common environmental trigger could also generate the same pattern. However, we believe that an increase of de novo mutations attributable to rising parental age is more parsimonious given the documented rise in parental age, recent findings that link de novo mutations and autism, and the observed associations between concordance rates and parental age reported in this article. The authors address one concern that I had in reading the paper: what if some change in the way children are qualified for regional center services changed the characteristics of their population.  Or, to put it more simply, are the autistics in 2000 really comparable to those in 1990?  Regional center data show a decreasing percentage of children also in the mental retardation and epilepsy categories.  Could this have an effect on their results?  From the paper: The temporal concordance trend reported in this article is not predicted by a diagnostic expansion theory. If ascertainment and surveillance dynamics rest behind the increase in SS concordance, we would expect to observe increasing rather than decreasing concordance for OS twin pairs over time. The observation of decreasing concordance over time in OS twins challenges the idea that the results we observe are an artifact of reduction of error in diagnosis as a consequence of enhanced surveillance or clearer understanding of diagnostic markers. First, there is no evidence that diagnostic errors have been reduced; second, if this were the case, we should observe the same effect across all pair types. Finally, increasing ascertainment and surveillance would predict heightened recurrence risk for siblings over time. We do not observe any increase in such risk (chi-square statistics of linear trends in proportion = 1.613; p = .204). The authors’ concluding paragraph is: For social scientists, there are three important discoveries. First, we show that a sociological eye on the role of genetics yields the insight that de novo mutations may play a signifi cant role in autism etiology. Only by observing changing patterns of concordance over time—that is, historicizing genetic influences rather than essentializing them—could we find evidence of a new causal mechanism underlying autism. Second, by working with a large population-based data set, versus small clinical samples, we have been able to properly estimate the true heritability of autism. These estimates show that autism is far less heritable than previously thought and consequently, explanations for the precipitous increase in prevalence must turn toward environmental and social dynamics often ignored by the scientific research community. Third, we show that the identification of the mechanisms by which social processes operating at the macro level—in this case, increases in parental age—“get under the skin” and shape health outcomes is a proper social science activity. This study has the possibility to have a major impact on autism causation research.   I would not be surprised at all if this ends up as one of the papers highlighted by the IACC for the year.  I’m certain that this paper will be brought up in online discussions for some time to come, what with the very different estimate of twin concordance than previously quoted.

The Environment and ADHD
" "
A new study was published in Pediatrics today that deals with one of the other major childhood disorders, ADHD.  According the this study, a child is more likely to develop ADHD if they have prenatal exposure or childhood exposure to lead.  I have not read the study yet, but from the  press  it is  getting  it seems this is a result is going to be an important one - 
 
 Association of Tobacco and Lead Exposures With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
 METHODS Data are from the 2001–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of the US population. Participants were 8 to 15 years of age (N = 2588). Prenatal tobacco exposure was measured by report of maternal cigarette use during pregnancy. Lead exposure was assessed by using current blood lead levels. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was used to ascertain the presence of ADHD in the past year, on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria. 
 RESULTS A total of 8.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.3%–10.1%) of children met criteria for ADHD. Prenatal tobacco exposure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.4 [95% CI: 1.5–3.7]) and higher current blood lead concentrations (aOR for third versus first tertile: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.5–3.8]) were independently associated with ADHD. Compared with children with neither exposure, children with both exposures (prenatal tobacco exposure and third-tertile lead levels) had an even greater risk of ADHD (aOR: 8.1 [95% CI: 3.5–18.7]) than would be expected if the independent risks were multiplied (tobacco-lead exposure interaction term, P < .001). 
 CONCLUSIONS Prenatal tobacco and childhood lead exposures are associated with ADHD in US children, especially among those with both exposures. Reduction of these common toxicant exposures may be an important avenue for ADHD prevention.

"22406" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/10/19/autism-risk-and-low-birth-weight-newborns/" "Autism Risk and low birth weight newborns" "A recent article in the journal Pediatrics has gathered a lot of news coverage this week.  Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Adolescents Born Weighing<2000 Grams    Here is the abstract: Objective: To estimate the diagnostic prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in a low birth weight (LBW) cohort.  
 Methods: Participants belonged to a regional birth cohort of infants (N = 1105) born weighing <2000 g between October 1, 1984, and July 3, 1989, and followed up by periodic assessments to 21 years of age. At 16 years (n = 623), adolescents were screened for ASD using a wide net (previous professional diagnosis of an ASD or a score above a liberal cutoff on the Social Communication Questionnaire or the Autism Spectrum Symptoms Questionnaire). At 21 years (n = 189), 60% of screen positives and 24% of screen negatives were assessed for diagnoses of ASD by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule or the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised.  
 Results: Samples retained at ages 16 and 21 years were representative of samples assessed at earlier ages except for lower levels of social risk. Of positive screens, 11 of 70 had ASD; of negative screens, 3 of 119 had ASD. The fractions of the 2 screening groups with ASD (14.3% in screen-positives and 2.5% in screen negatives) were weighted by fractions of screen-positives and screen-negatives among the adolescents (18.8% and 81.2%, respectively). This calculation produced an estimated prevalence rate of ASD in the entire cohort of 5% (31 of 623).  
 Conclusions: The diagnostic prevalence of ASD in this LBW preterm cohort was higher than that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 8-year-olds in the general US population in 2006.  The idea that low birth wieght might increase risk of autism isn’t new, but this is a different design: following a low birthweight cohort into adulthood. The paper, and definitely the media coverage, has some limitiations.  A great discussion of this paper and the media coverage can be found at  The Biology Files  in an article by  Emily Willingham :  Autism and low birthweight: study–and quote–limitations  It’s written much better than I could do, an whatever I’d write at this point would just be a distillation of it. This is different from the risk of autism due to premature birth, something the media mixed up on occasion and that Emily Willingham discusses in her article.   There are certainly some concerns about how the 5% figure was derived, and one can’t really make a direct comparison between a closely watched cohort at adulthood to the prevalence of 8 year olds based on record review (as in the CDC prevalence estimates).  However, the idea that low birth weight is a risk factor is worth investigation.

"22863" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2013/07/01/autism-is-more-prevalent-in-urban-areas/" "Autism is more prevalent in urban areas" "When my kid was first diagnosed autistic I was presented with the idea of the “autism epidemic”.  There was a great deal of discussion at that time about the rising number of clients in the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS) system receiving services for autism.  One of the first thing I did was to search through another database in California–that of the California Department of Education.  What I learned quickly was that autism is not identified at the same rate for various locations or various racial/ethnic groups.  The disparities are quite large.  In my own school district, for example, the administrative prevalence of autism is 1/3 that of Caucasians.  This has remained constant over the past 10 years, even as the overall numbers increase.  Another disparity that has been observed repeatedly is a disparity between cities (urban) and rural areas.  The fraction of autistics identified in urban areas is higher than that in non urban areas.  Recently, a study of the Danish population finds that, yes, the more urban area a kid lives in, the higher the chances are that s/he will be diagnosed autistic: Urbanicity and Autism Spectrum Disorders. The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is for the majority of cases unknown and more studies of risk factors are needed. Geographic variation in ASD occurrence has been observed, and urban residence has been suggested to serve as a proxy for etiologic and identification factors in ASD. We examined the association between urbanicity level and ASD at birth and during childhood. The study used a Danish register-based cohort of more than 800,000 children of which nearly 4,000 children were diagnosed with ASD. We found a dose-response association with greater level of urbanicity and risk of ASD. This association was found for residence at birth as well as residence during childhood. Further, we found an increased risk of ASD in children who moved to a higher level of urbanicity after birth. Also, earlier age of ASD diagnosis in urban areas was observed. While we could not directly examine the specific reasons behind these associations, our results demonstrating particularly strong associations between ASD diagnosis and post-birth migration suggest the influence of identification-related factors such as access to services might have a substantive role on the ASD differentials we observed. Let’s repeat that last line for emphasis: “our results demonstrating particularly strong associations between ASD diagnosis and post-birth migration suggest the influence of identification-related factors such as access to services might have a substantive role on the ASD differentials we observed.” Yes, a larger fraction of kids in  rural   urban  areas are identified as autistic– even if they were born in a rural area . While many will see this as a threat to the idea that there is a vaccine-induced epidemic of autism.  After all, if we aren’t identifying all the autistics in a given population, how can one take services related data and claim that the true rate of autism is rising?  While there is some small value in putting yet another nail into that coffin lid, the real value of a study like this is pointing out that there is likely a substantial population left unidentified.  Even today.  Those not identified as autistic are either (a) identified as having some other disability or (b) not identified as disabled at all.  In other words, there is likely a large population who are not receiving the services and supports which are best suited to their needs.  That’s real.  That’s wrong.  And we need more people advocating to correct it. —

				 This essay  is interesting because it tries to explain what it is like to not have the ability to get your thoughts out at will. The assumption is nearly always that having a hard time expressing your thoughts means that your thoughts are jumbled. It is a silly theory, in my opinion. All you need to do is see how a person travelling in a foreign country seems to lose their ability to make jokes or express complex ideas in another language if they are not completely fluent, but it is clear they express ideas, joke, and think OK in their own language. Autism is different, of course, because the language in which I struggle to express my thoughts verbally is my native language. But that doesn’t mean I’m not thinking my thoughts clearly. Like the author says, my output really isn’t mine to control. What is your opinion about this article?

    One of my aunts sent me a Chinese New Year's email in.......Chinese. I was able to read most of the words without a dictionary: I studied Mandarin when I was in college and Cantonese (which is the only language that my grandmother,  Ngin-Ngin , speaks) for just a few months when I was 7 years old. (My sister and I did not want to go, and my parents acceded to us.)  
 
\"It would be great if Charlie could study Chinese,\" I thought more than a few times when Charlie was a baby. I looked at the Chinese books on my shelves and looked forward to one day resuming my own study of Mandarin, together with Charlie. 

 Then came the past few years and speech therapy, verbal behavior, verbal imitation programs, oral-motor exercises with whistles and straws, sign langauge, PECS, the Language Master: Anything, everything, to teach Charlie to talk.  

 (The Chinese books have stayed on the shelf, and gotten rather dusty.) 

 Charlie was eating lunch while I printed out my aunt's email and started to read it out loud. 

 \"Xin de yi nian......\"  I read.  

 \"Xin ,\" said Charlie. 

 \"Woo de,\"  I read. 

 \"Woo de,\"  said Charlie. 

 \"Peng you.\" 

 \"Peng you.\" 

 Charlie's pronunciation perfectly echoed mine: When he says a new English word, he usually has to practice saying it for some time. Chinese is a tonal language in which you modulate the rising or falling of your voice and this, along with the particular sounds of vowels of consonants, determines the meaning of a word. Charlie instantly picked up on the \"level\" tone I used for  \"xin\"  (\"new\") and the dip in my voice when I said  \"woo\"  (\"I\").  

 \"New year......my friend,\" I translated. And started to count up to ten in Mandarin; each time, Charlie repeated each number with ease. 

 \"Yi.\" 

 \"Yi.\" 

 \"Er.\" 

 \"Er.\" 

 \"San.\" 

 \"San.\" 

 And so on up to 10 ( shi ). 

 I know that Charlie has first to work on his communication skills, on his English pronunciation and yet----I was simply very struck at the ease with which he can say words in Chinese. Might a few lessons in a foreign language help his speech in general? Might I simply be confusing him? I have often figured out what Charlie is saying not so much from the vowels and consonants, as from the melody with which he pronounces a certain word, and he seems alike attuned to the tone and pitch of Jim's and my voices. 
 
Almost too fittingly, it is Chinese New Year today, February 18th, the Year of the Pig:  Gong Hay Fat Choy  (\"Best wishes and Congratulations. Have a prosperous and good year.\") 

 Gong Hay Fat Choy, woode peng you! : Charlie said those words, just like that, too.

Signs

Joey had a good speech session today. He's learning sign language. This will give him visual cues, to use when he cannot find words, or for us to use to better communicate with him. HIs favorite sign is  \"fox.\"  Today, he and Nikki were doing some other things, including looking at some Richard Scary books. He turned to her and signed about what he saw on the page: \"The fox ate and ate until he was full!\" When Nikki said these words he said, \"Yes! That's right!\" and laughed, and then repeated them.    I still think most of Joey's speech is scripted or echoed. I usually use \"scripted\" to mean that he knows what the words mean, and is trying to use previously-heard strings of words to convey meaning, sometimes quite successfully. \"Echoed\" means the words are empty, repeated because he has learned they are a proper response, but doesn't know what the exchange means; or he just likes the words and says them, perseverating on the sounds; or he is too upset to be able to recall the words he needs, so he repeats back anything his brain clings to, regardless of meaning. He is clever enough to sometimes mix strings, so that one half of the sentence is pulled from Little Bear while the second half is from Pinky Dinky Doo, but they are still just blocks and strings of words he has heard before.  The signs seem to be doing several things for Joey. They give him a visual cue, so that slow sound and language processing can be slightly bypassed. He understands what you are asking of him or telling him. They are also providing him a way to communicate spontaneously, without having to come up with spoken words. He gets very happy about this, like talking about the fox in the picture. He doesn't have to come up with scripted words for a new situation; he can go with signs, movements that he can apparently access better and faster.  So when Nikki was having a hard time getting him to sit an attend, she finally signed her request:  sit   please ! He saw the signs, suddenly lit up, said, \"Oh! Sit, please!\" and sat down.  Sign language will probably never be Joey's primary form of communication. He speaks very well, and he's well on his way to reading. However, he seems to like it, and seems to be helping him catch on to concepts, and we;re going to try to focus on giving him signs he can use to talk to us, instead of a bunch of signs for us to boss him around with. He's so funny, sitting in front of a mirror, signing \"fox\" to himself and giggling. I need to get a mirror put up in his room.

What is \"Tongue-Thrust\" in Spanish?
" "
In Andy's preschool, they have Spanish class every Wednesday. I think it is useful to learn new languages, especially since I have a difficult time with it and the world is full of people who do not speak English. Unfortunately, I failed to consider the issues my own child might have with learning a different language.  To be honest, Andy has very little trouble with language, so I didn't think much about it at all. It is the speech that is the trouble- articulation. Why wouldn't I think, if he has trouble articulating in English, that he wouldn't have trouble articulating in Spanish?  Lately, he has been very upset about going to school on Wednesdays, because he doesn't want to do Spanish or Music, his two Wednesday specials. So I have doing a lot of trying to pull out of him why he doesn't like Spanish or Music. And this morning, I got some answers. Apparently his little friend thinks singing is \"yucky\" and Andy is upset about that, because he  likes  music, but he  doesn't  like his friend saying that the songs are yucky. And then there was Spanish.  \"Worth er yucky.\"  \"The Spanish words? You don't like the Spanish words?\" \"No.\" \"Why don't you like the Spanish words? What words have you learned?\" {Tangle of sounds that included, I think, \"Spanish\", \"pretend\", \"words\", \"don't like\", \"yucky.\"} \"Spanish isn't pretend. It is a real language. We speak English. Not everyone speaks English. People in other places speak different languages. Some speak Spanish; people in Spain and Mexico speak Spanish. Some people speak French, or German, or Hindi... and Mommy learned a language called Sanskrit! People spoke it a long time ago.\"  {pause, then something that I think included something about sounding funny.} \"Are you having trouble  saying  the Spanish words?\" \"Yeth.\"  \"They don't sound right?\"  \"Yeth.\" {Something that included the name of his friend.} \"Does {Andy's Friend} say the words? Can he say the words?\"  \"Yeth.\"  \"And you have trouble saying them?\" \"YETH!\" Oh, dear. So we talked a little about how it isn't his fault that he has trouble saying the words. And I told his teacher that not being able to say the words is frustrating him, and I suspect someone was making fun of him not being able to say them properly- or he  perceived  they were making fun of him. Perhaps the Spanish teacher needs a little birdie to remind her he has an articulation issue?

He invented a world, a planet called “Stickfus,” which is inhabited by stick figures (Gufligees, Eywetie, Max the Mad Scientist, Pinya, to name a few), and the people on the planet speak two languages:  English and Sticktopian.  Benj has created this (latter language) and has remained remarkably consistent when he refers to it.  His name in Sticktopian is “Bejoq,” (sometimes he signs his schoolwork that way), and so we decided to make him a Planet Stickfus cake with his Sticktopian name on it.  You can see for yourself just how happy this made him; the camera caught him in a rare, soft moment.

    The ancient Greek word  logos  means \"account, reason, explanation, speech, utterance.\" It means \"word\" as in \"in the beginning was the Word,\" the first five words of the Gospel according to John ( en arche en ho logos ). Our culture places a huge value on the word, on  words , on speech and speaking and language. To not be able to talk has been interpreted as tantamount to a person having lesser cognitive ability. 
 
And a child not speaking is one of those first things parents report when they think their child may have autism. 

 Charlie had four sounds by the time of his first birthday on May 15, 1998:  ma [for me], da [for Jim and for something over there], ugi [an expression of contentment], mmmmmm [????????].  Or, those were the meanings we posited for those sounds. Charlie had no words when he was diagnosed on July 22, 1999, and we have ever since placed a huge emphasis on speech therapy, PECS, verbal imitation programs, verbal behavior---on anything that could assist his speech and communication, especially as we sensed that an inability to explain himself was often behind Charlie's tantrums and head-banging. 

 The result of seven and a half years of speech therapy and seven years of ABA, is that Charlie (who might have never talked) can say most  single words clearly  and is slowly, slowly, slowly, working on longer phrases and sentences. And yet, if there is one lesson I have learned in these almost nine years with Charlie, it is that language is not his primary mode of communication. It is that, language need not be  the  primary mode of communication.  
 
Language serves that role for many of us but I am inclined to think that Charlie self-expresses with much more than just the sounds from his mouth, his larynx, his tongue, and all the anatomy of our speech organs. Charlie has gained a lot from doing verbal behavior when he was three years old and steadily over the past year, but increased speech and communication skills are only the proverbial tip of the iceberg as a measure of what Charlie has learned. Charlie being able to talk more and better is only one sign of his learning; much else--play skills, social abilities, OT, PT--is crucial and helps his speech and him as a whole. 

 For Charlie's communication arises from his whole body, from what he does not do and what he does, from the melodies he feasts us with. Charlie does it his way.

Joy has learned a new sign. It was just over two weeks from the point at which I was taught the sign in April (and started using it sporadically) to the point at which she demonstrated conclusively that she understood the sign without a spoken word. After that, I started doing hand-over-hand to have her make the sign as well. This past weekend, she grabbed JoyDad's hands to have  him  make the sign. Then later she made the sign all on her own. Here's a web site where you can see a  demonstration of the sign . Here's what she's asking for. Video.  Baby Einstein video, to be precise.  She's also vocalizing, a little sound halfway between \"vuh-voh\" and \"fuh-foh\". It's all about the motivation, baby!

 That's how Charlie has been talking lately. I do have to note, aside from the last long-ago memorized sentence from my and a few other friends' favorite childhood book, that most of those phrases would qualify as echolalia. They are words that I have said in Charlie's presence, and that he has repeated after a space of up to a minute.  

 Echolalia  is not a bad thing around here. I know that it is one of those DSM-IV symptoms---\"red flags\"---that can scream \"this child may have autism!!!!\". And it would certainly be at least a bit grating on the parental ears to hear everything one's mom-self had said instantly repeated by one's child. 

 But you see, once upon a time,  Charlie could not talk at all .

"16159" "26" "http://www.esteeklar.com/2013/12/03/breathing-life-into-words/" "Breathing Life into Words" "Adam has been reading words since he’s been 11 months old. When he reads aloud, it sounds as if Adam has weaker reading skills, but his typing is always better than reading out loud. Yet there is a difference in how we come to language, and I suppose I’m more inclined these days to post-structuralism in the way words relate to other words when I think of relativism and how, as we hear about some autistic folks, that words can have an associational meaning. For many people, words relate to an event, a sound, an occurrence. They are associational; sometimes they are sensory where metaphor works best. The point is, language is just a system. It limits experience that can not always be translated into words. For Adam, words are very important. They can mean life and death since most people would not bother to understand Adam’s language outside of “behavioural” contexts. As David Abram says, we are conditioned to speech. We miss the sensory properties and ways of knowing outside of speech and language; it is very hard for Adam and other people who come to language differently (if they can at all), to translate experience into words. Decoding and reading words can be different than feeling. I think that we have to view language more creatively and recognize that language does not denote intelligence  – although we live in a society that still believes it does. Language is a half-formed tool, and in a political sense, it excludes many folks who do not come to the dominant, or ordinary, language as easily as some. Adam and I were reading last night. I asked him to read out loud, but unless he uses words in the way he uses them (which is why typing is useful in many ways), it’s difficult to know what he knows about a word. So, as we were reading, I quickly ripped off strips of paper and we not only spelled words (which he can do well), but we made them come alive. The word around when literally around Adam’s head. The word “through” went through his fingers. “Wind” moved violently (fanned by me with a large book) and a pictorial leaf “spinned” and “tumbled” to the ground. “Whisper” came close to his ear and whispered “I love you,” and the “breeze” gentle moved the word on the strip of paper in the air. Adam wanted to read more. He grabbed book after book off the shelf as he read out loud, while we both made the words come alive for hours. This is akin to when we hear parents labeling items all around the house which makes words “functional.” Yet words are more than that. How can we make words sensory? How do we make them experiential? How can we role-reverse the word? God may have breathed the word into Adam, but he forgot that we have to also breathe life into words. And still, words are never enough.

    Today I started to read  Engaging Autism: Using the Floortime Approach to Help Children Relate, Communicate, and Think  by  Stanley Greenspan  and Serene Wiedman. Dr. Greenspan \"redefines\" autism according to three \"core or primary problems\" (p. 5; I have substituted [Charlie] for Dr. Greenspan's \"the child\"): 
   
 Is [Charlie] having trouble with establishing intimacy and warmth? [the ability of \"establishing closeness\"] 
 Does [Charlie] communicate with gestures and emotional expressions? [the ability of \"exchanging emotional gestures in a continuous way\"] 
 When [Charlie] begins using words, does he use them meaningfully? [the ability of \"emerging words or symbols with emotional intent\"] 
 

 My response to the three questions is \"No,\" \"Yes,\" and \"Yes.\"

    \"Peesszz yess, peesszz!\" Charlie called out as he stood by the black car this afternoon. \"Bye bye\" he added in the direction of our home speech therapist, who had just spent a busy hour working on his articulation and oral-motor exercises. She laughed--\"Bye Charlie, see you next week!\"--we have known her for three years, in which she has been babysitter, classroom aide, and (now that she has her Master's), home speech therapist. 
 
Charlie also has another speech session on Wednesday, at a local center in our town, and I realized that it was speech--\"peesszz\"--that he was calling for. 

 But it sure sounded like \"peace.\" Great minds think alike,  and who knows but Charlie and  Mom-NOS's Bud  are on the same mellow wavelength.  

 Speech and language have always been a huge challenge for Charlie, who would probably be non-verbal without  intensive ABA therapy  starting when he was just over two years old. But the reason Charlie's every word is a   platinum recording   is that, with every word and phrase and sentence uttered, he is one step farther along to expressing himself--to being himself--in language. 

 Charlie loves talking. We are always after those clear phrases and whole sentences--be it \"I want wait eat fries\" to \" Take no lip \"; Charlie himself just enjoys, I think, humming melodic notes or loosely pronouncing words that turn into babble-mush (\"dive dive dive four zero six wahnnn zero six zero zero zero zero!\"). 

 Charlie's speech may not always be recognizable to us, but he does enjoy hearing the sound of his voice, and being able to \"do things with language just as we do\" deeply  connects  him to us.

Silence is golden

Yet more insight gleaned from the  SCERTS  seminar. During his presentation, Barry Prizant made frequent references to Ros Blackburn, a woman from England who has autism and often gives presentations at autism conferences. Like Temple Grandin, Blackburn is able to talk about autism in a way that gives neurotypicals real insight into life on the spectrum. One particular reference stood out for me. Prizant said that he once asked Blackburn to name the thing that other people did that was most frustrating to her. She answered that other people don't allow enough time for people with autism to answer questions. Typically, she said, just as she is forming the answer the other person starts talking again. And not only that - they're not just repeating themselves,  they are saying things differently. It struck an instant chord. I do it all the time. I hear other people do it all the time as well. We honestly think we're being helpful. We ask, \"Bud, what did you do in school today?\" Pause. We think,  is he listening? We say, \"Bud, look at me. Was school fun today?\" \"Yeah.\" We think,  good, he's listening.  We repeat, \"What did you do?\" Pause. We think,  maybe he doesn't understand what I'm looking for. We ask, \"What was your favorite part of school today?\" Pause. We think,  he still doesn't get it; I'll be more clear. We say, \"Did you play with toys at school?\" \"Yeah.\" We think,  here we go!  We say, \"What did you play with?\" Pause. And on and on it goes until we give up or have gotten enough yes/no responses to satisfy our need for the pretense of conversation. According to Prizant, Ros Blackburn compares her experience of this sort of \"conversation\" to assembling a jigsaw puzzle. Someone asks a question, and she begins to piece it together -  what are they asking? what is the expected response? what do I think about this? how do I put that into words?  The piecing takes her full concentration, so she is silent while she thinks. She is silent, in fact, for a long time; long enough that the other person decides s/he needs to be \"helpful\". Unfortunately, by rephrasing the question, it feels to Blackburn as if the person steps in, grabs the puzzle she has almost completed, and hurls the pieces into the air. Now she has to start over, this time trying to assemble the puzzle with a heightened level of frustration. (And we wonder why people with autism get  dysregulated ?) So I've been trying since the seminar to slow down my conversations with Bud and to stop \"prompting\" his answers. The conversations go something like this: \"Bud, what was your favorite thing in school today?\" Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause.

    Charlie can verbally identify almost all of the letters of the alphabet--he's been working still on discriminating  f  from  t  and  i  from  l . At our biweekly meeting with his ABA therapist team and ABA consultant, it was noted that he seems to make fewer errors identifying letters when they're altogether in a word.  
 
Charlie was not even three years old when he learned his numbers. We assumed his mastery of the alphabet would follow---I say this with the wry sigh of hindsight, six years later. Of course there are a lot more letters than numbers and they occur in both CAPITAL and lowercase versions. Add to this that the appearance of letters can differ widely, from handwriting style to font choice, and that Charlie's  apaxia  resulted in him pronouncing  b ,  d ,  e ,  g ,  p , and a few others all as \"eeee\" until he was six or seven. And, that Charlie has always had trouble controlling the movement of his eyes--he has looked out the corners of them since he was an infant. (Prism lenses and practice in focusing his gaze on a particular object have helped.) 

 The remark tonight at Charlie's ABA therapy meeting--that he can identify the letters more readily when they are in a word--seemed emblematic to me of something about Charlie's learning, namely, that it is sometimes harder for him to talk about--even to identify--something \"in isolation,\" singly and on its own. But pair that item with another thing--give him \"frog\" instead of just \"f\"--and he knows it readily. That is, Charlie can grasp some concepts more easily when presented with a varied and complex \"field\" of items. And when I think of all the time--all the years--he \"made no or minimal progress\" on IEP goals in labeling \"common household objects\" or letters, etc., I wonder if an over-simplified teaching approach--and an underestimation of his intelligence--have retarded Charlie's learning.

ASAN on Non-Verbal Autism
" "
 Just in time for the holidays, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) has put out a new video promoting its views of autism.  The video is pretty much in line with most of what they have said in the past but there is one very prominent theme that I wanted to talk about.   So, first thing first, if you haven’t seen the video, go watch it  here .     Did you notice how non-verbal autism was portrayed?  If you missed it, here are a few lines from the video about what it means to be non-verbal -     People know what \"nonverbal\" means: I can't speak, so I use my computer to communicate.   Even though I couldn't talk, my parents believed that I could understand speech.     My parent's got me a computer so I could speak with them.  Once I learned to type, I never stopped.  Now I have conversations with my family every day.   The presumption in all of these statements is that, even though a person is non-verbal because of autism, their language ability is intact.  That they can still understand language when someone uses it with them and will be able to demonstrate that ability if given the proper assistance.   Unfortunately that presumption is badly wrong and, quite frankly, very damaging.  When a person is non-verbal because of autism it is because autism is disrupting their ability to receptively understand and expressively use language.  This disruption is pervasive and will likely impact their ability to use language in any form.   What the video seems to be referring to is a form of verbal  apraxia  which is another disorder that is sometimes (but rarely) co-morbid in autism.  In this disorder the person has problems speaking, i.e. verbally using language, because they have problems producing speech.   It can be difficult to tell the difference between apraxia and non-verbal autism because there can be so much overlap and only a specialist is going to be able to make a proper differential diagnosis.  But there are few differences that you will typically see.   People with apraxia will typically have the ability to receptively understand language and the ability to expressively communicate using methods other than speech.     People with non-verbal autism don’t typically have a problem making the basic sounds of language or putting those sounds together to form words but rather are unable to use those tools to emit language.   But perhaps the most important difference is that the conditions need to be treated differently.  I don’t know that much about treating apraxia but I do know that to teach a non-verbal person with autism to communicate you have to try and teach them how to use and understand language.   Over time you would expect, given the proper help, that people with either condition will improve and find ways to work around their disability.  But if you are expecting a non-verbal person with autism to be able to suddenly one day type fluently with both hands and use perfect language to express complex philosophical ideas about why Autism Speaks doesn’t represent their views on autism, you are going to be disappointed.   It takes a long time and a lot of hard work to learn to use language and it doesn’t happen simply because someone reads to them and they see letters as colors.   I know from personal experience that my two mostly non-verbal twin daughters have made significant progress over the years.  They can now understand simple ideas when someone talks to them, they can repeat most words, they can say simple sentences, they can write words, they can read aloud, and they can even type.   But what they can’t do yet is use language in any form to express more than the simplest thoughts, hold even a simple conversation, or use language to learn abstract ideas.  The disruption in their ability to use and understand language is profound and is at the core of their autism.   The twins, along with their more verbal younger sister, fall into the part of the spectrum that involves severe language disruptions.  This part of the spectrum makes up at least half of all cases of autism.     One of the things that I have learned over these past eight years is that the one thing you can’t do is sit back and expect that the person understands language or is going to regain the use of language on their own.     You can’t just “accept” the person is different and keep throwing incredibly complex language at them and hope they will learn.  The available evidence suggests that doing so can hinder a child’s ability to learn to use language.   The good news, if there is anything good about language issues, is that there are quite a few good resources for how to approach the problem.  For example,  this book  covers the basics of how to work on teaching communication and, if you want a a primer on what is known about the language disruption in autism, I would recommend  this book .   But keep in mind that with even the best methods and using a variety of supports and accommodations that is it going to take a while to overcome the non-verbal aspect of autism.

"31897" "48" "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/her-language/" "Her Language" "From the moment she wakes, she is making sounds. High and low, up and down, soft and loud and soft. She sings and hums, she babbles repetitively; sounds that cannot accurately be represented through typed letters. It is, as one woman put, incessant. During the day, it becomes background music. At bedtime, it can be annoying. But I am most aware of it when we are in public. Once, I was told that she was “distracting the other children.” But there is no stopping it. There is no silencing her. Her vocalizations were once hurtful, indicating an altered brain, and the fact that I, her own mother, had no idea if she was speaking words I should recognize or if she was just making noise. In the past, I clumped all of her “noises” in the category of vocal stimming. Recently, I’ve started seeing it as one of her languages, her primary language. (Hope was actually the first one to help me see it as a language – she used to mimic Rhema’s sounds back to her. And then I watched  Amanda Baggs ‘ profound video, and it forever changed my thinking about communication.) It occurred to me that while it is so important to me that she learn to speak and understand my language (and I am so appreciative when she does), it’s just as important that I learn hers. So I’ve been practicing when she’s asleep or at school, trying to say things the way she says them and when she says them. When I sing a string to her, she doesn’t always look me in the eye, but she grins a soft grin. Sometimes she repeats it back to me. Sometimes she just giggles. As I wrote in  Song Without Words , I realize that I don’t have to know the meanings of the words in her language. Often she is prompted to repeat words in my language whether she understands the meaning or not. The hope is that she will understand the meaning in time. Perhaps I will understand the meaning of  her  words in time. Sometimes she is so busy talking in her language, she does not listen well… to me or to her teachers. She has to be shushed to hear what we are saying. Sometimes I am so busy talking in my language, I do not listen well. I have to be shushed to hear what she is saying. But when I hear it,  really  hear it, I feel like the most blessed mother of all, because her lovely chorus fills my days. Here’s a sample of my daughter’s beautiful song, her voice, her language. It’s called “I Want Rice.” “My language is not about designing words or even visual symbols for people to interpret. It is about being in a constant conversation with every aspect of my environment, reacting physically to all parts of my surroundings.” ~ Amanda Baggs " 0.000132921319027671 0.000595115467288838 0.000524458888556991 0.000247338240582381 6.17153205115856e-05 0.000324988780484569 0.000307861291347915 0.3677289116094 0.000215930040015094 0.000160388378950935 0.000234626042862132 0.000105521846633408 0.000280064203979203 0.0054279957996845 0.000204945605002966 0.000819143921272262 0.000360450683051279 0.000611112518217141 0.00192827341125604 0.00038988604583093 0.00017192268120089 0.000772988874777913 0.00566358890161559 0.000255054987286798 0.0475609628484817 0.000170829049962635 0.222602774455942 0.0953402732040672 0.000261596247381243 0.00029862920745695 0.000245298948952395 0.000179119052210693 0.000774957660317911 0.000399697747447476 0.0220284112047575 0.0001588799539491 0.00029040767590632 0.000186762600767407 0.000222481145110856 0.0955406626186456 0.0068185576115285 0.000140520997084454 0.000536357976924807 0.000131305206349889 0.000137015654032228 0.000359982059404092 0.0322266324070109 0.000235570573142327 0.000379222765879013 0.0852478862684503

				 The world of non-verbal autism is changing thanks to assistive technology. When I was small, the best I got as a communication tool was PECS pictograms. For those not familiar with PECS, it is a system of basic needs communication and it looks like this.
 
  In recent years, new devices have flourished. I started communicating on a letter board, a low tech way to point to letters. I still use this method often because it is fast, portable, and if I mess up a board there is no loss of expensive equipment. Here are some types of letter boards.
 
 
   And mine has a math side too.
 
   Now I have been using a dynawrite also with word prediction and voice output.
 
   Some kids use a fusion,
 
   or an iPad. Recently many non-verbal kids I know switched to iPads and like it. It shows their work in stored memory which is good for school.
 
 
 
   The thing is, any method involving letters needs to be taught because autism limits the motor planning to do typing or pointing clearly. None of us learned this skill in school. We all went to someone who had to patiently teach us how to express our thoughts in this modality. Then our moms worked really hard with us at home. The journey to communication is long and hard and starts with the opening of a door.

 I was taught not to use “um” when I spoke, it makes people sound uneducated and can become quite grating. But when I learnt French, I was specifically taught to use the French equivalent when pausing to find the right words (an “euh” rather than a “um”). The use of such filler words serves a purpose that comes to the fore when learning a new language: It signals a pause while you try to find the right words. I hadn’t realised the significance of all this until my autistic son started saying “um” across the past week. Spoken language does not come naturally to my son. There was a time when it looked like he was going to be largely non-verbal. Each small language step has been hard-won. From single words with occasional correct use – mostly pure echolalia – to two words together, to pre-taught sentences, to slowly inserting his own variations in those sentences. He’s had a developmental spurt over the past two weeks in his spoken language; he’s increasingly using pro-nouns instead of just nouns, his sentence structures are getting better, and he’s creating more independently structured expressions instead of so often using pre-heard ones. And then there’s the um. Because he struggles to find the right words, there can be incredibly long pauses before he’ll answer a question, or in the middle of his sentences. (Which I must say, I prefer over the endless perserveration which often ends in melt-downs, but that’s for another post.) It’s hard to figure out whether those gaps mean he hasn’t heard us or whether it signals the end of his sentence. If we try to prompt him or continue the attempted conversation at the wrong times – having mis-read the pause – he can understandably find it very upsetting. He can’t yet say “I hadn’t finished” or “I’m thinking”. The “um” now fills those voids. We now have that vital social cue that there is more to come, that he is processing, that we need to be patient and let him find the way to turn his thoughts into words. No one taught him “um” (that I’m aware of – it would be an odd thing to intentionally teach a child). Yet there it is. So completely normal. So beautifully functional. So gosh darn helpful. I’ve never been so happy to hear ums, I never truly appreciated how awesome that little noise could be. Something we take for granted, and actively try to un-teach students, is making the communication in this house so much healthier, calmer and more effective. Autism makes you notice the little things, even the importance of the gaps between the little things.

"18176" "30" "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=473" "No, I’m Not a Horse: A Refutation of the Clever Hans Comparison to Autistic Typers" "
				 This is a horse. 
 
 This is a human. 
 
 This is Clever Hans. He was a horse in the early 1900s who looked like he was doing simple math equations by stomping his foot. Turns out he was just picking up cues from his handler. 
 
 Horses have no innate propensity to develop language, understand complex language or communicate in language. I love horses, but they are horses, not humans. Humans have an innate propensity to develop language, understand complex language and communicate in language; therefore even humans who lack typical access to verbal communication because of a disability still have the capacity to grasp language (except in extreme circumstances). 
 Humans who are deaf develop sign language. 
 
 Humans who can’t speak verbally type or use augmentative communication. 
 
 Humans with Down Syndrome understand and speak utilizing the complex patterns of language. 
 
 So, why is it so hard for some professionals to believe that humans with autism have innate language capacity? 
 
 For example, here is a course in the Applied Behavioral Analysis department at a university (instructor’s name removed), which is described this way: 
 Ever since Facilitated Communication (FC) crashed onto the shores of the U.S. in the early 1990s, remarkable claims of sophisticated communicative abilities in otherwise nonverbal people with autism have proliferated. FC itself has morphed into other forms, including the so-called Rapid Prompting method. However, regardless of the name, all of these techniques have one thing in common: They claim to show that previously nonverbal people with autism are in fact highly verbal and expressive so much so that the diagnosis of autism is sometimes questioned. This is not the first time in history in which remarkable claims of communication have been made about nonverbal individuals. Perhaps the most famous case was that of a horse in Germany around the turn of the 20th century, named Clever Hans. In this talk, Dr. X describes the story of Clever Hans, including the experiments carried out by the German psychologist, Oskar Pfungst, which revealed the nature of Hans’ cleverness, and its lessons for recent claims of remarkable communicativeness in people with autism. Dr. X urges the same level of scientific scrutiny regarding these claims as with Clever Hans, and suggest (sic) that all stakeholders in autism should approach remarkable claims skeptically and scientifically. 
 I will analyze this paragraph sentence by sentence. 
 Ever since Facilitated Communication (FC) crashed onto the shores of the U.S. in the early 1990s, remarkable claims of sophisticated communicative abilities in otherwise nonverbal people with autism have proliferated. 
 When I was in high school I learned in my English class about loaded language intended to bias the reader. FC “crashed on the shores.” Its claims of success are “remarkable,” because the typed communication of nonverbal people is “sophisticated.” Ha ha. You see, autistic people thinking and typing is a joke already. 
  FC itself has morphed into other forms, including the so-called Rapid Prompting method. 
 Here RPM is lumped with FC , the method that “crashed” on our shores, in an apparent attempt to discredit it. RPM is actually a different teaching method than FC, and though it is referred to as “the so-called Rapid Prompting Method,” that is the actual, copyrighted name of the method. 
 However, regardless of the name, all of these techniques have one thing in common: They claim to show that previously nonverbal people with autism are in fact highly verbal and expressive so much so that the diagnosis of autism is sometimes questioned. 
 This sentence is packed with disinformation. Nobody questions the autism of people who type except for those who don’t believe that severely autistic people understand language. By their logic, if an autistic person types he can’t be autistic. This is circular logic. 
 My old ABA supervisor said exactly this about Tito Mukhopadyhay because he communicates by typing independently. He stims. He has every autistic symptom in the books but since he is obviously communicating sophisticated thoughts he  can’t  be autistic. Ha ha. What would his correct diagnosis be then, and why was he diagnosed with autism as a young child before he typed? It is intriguing that these particular professionals don’t question whether their understanding of autism is correct when someone with autism comes along who challenges their theory. Rather, they claim that it’s the person who is incorrect.  My book  actually explains pretty thoroughly what it is like having autism. 
 
 This is not the first time in history in which remarkable claims of communication have been made about nonverbal individuals. 
 No, it is not. How can we present autistic communicators as a joke? 
 Perhaps the most famous case was that of a horse in Germany around the turn of the 20th century, named Clever Hans. 
 By comparing autistic people to animals. How witty. 
 In this talk, Dr. X describes the story of Clever Hans, including the experiments carried out by the German psychologist, Oskar Pfungst, which revealed the nature of Hans’ cleverness, and its lessons for recent claims of remarkable communicativeness in people with autism. 
 As I mentioned, I think a horse is an animal with no innate capacity for language and a person with autism is a human with innate capacity for language despite being severely hampered by bad theories, bad instruction and a severe mind/motor disconnect. (For more information on the mind/motor problem, please see my essay  Motor Difficulties in Severe Autism . 
 Dr. X urges the same level of scientific scrutiny regarding these claims as with Clever Hans, and suggest (sic) that all stakeholders in autism should approach remarkable claims skeptically and scientifically. 
 By all means, skepticism is good. I have dealt with and convinced skeptics for many years. Biased, hostile people are not skeptics, nor scientists.  (See  Scientific Un-Query   and  More on Scientific Un-Query ). By the way, people who have autism are stakeholders too, as are their parents. 
 Science is filled with stories of people who introduced new theories only to be treated with scorn by professionals who toed the line of the day, but the theories were ultimately  proven to be correct. Now we laugh at the obtuseness of the critics in these cases, but they actually ruined lives and reputations. 
 I’m an autism expert. I didn’t study it in class. I didn’t teach ABA to kids. I did however live and breathe it. I learned that experts and professionals can be well meaning but wrong. I learned that I, and others who type, have much to teach about the truth of the disability. My expertise is solely based on empirical evidence and anecdote. I never ran tests on myself. Nevertheless, I know my nonverbal autism inside and out. My autism is a mind/motor disconnect. It isn’t a language processing issue. It isn’t cognitive delay. It is a real disability, hard to live with, and mostly it is painful to be unable to speak, but not speaking is not the same as not thinking.

 IACC Reauthorized by Autism  CARES Act  to Continue Through 2019; HHS Seeks Nominations for Public Membership  (PDF – 94 KB) 
 On August 8, 2014, President Obama signed the  Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support (CARES) Act of 2014   (PDF – 256 KB)  into law, reauthorizing and expanding the provisions of the  Combating Autism Act of 2006   (PDF – 142 KB) . New provisions include an increased focus on services and supports, a report on the needs of transitioning youth and adults, and the creation of an Autism Initiative within the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure accountability and ongoing implementation of autism activities across the Department. The new law also reauthorizes the  Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)  to continue until September 30, 2019. 
 The IACC is a federal advisory committee composed of federal officials and non-federal public members, including autism self-advocates, family members, representatives of private autism organizations, and other public stakeholders. The committee is charged with: 
 
 Providing annual updates on its  Strategic Plan for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Research , which under the new law will be expanded to include recommendations on services and supports provision; 
 Providing annual updates on its  Summary of Advances in ASD Research , a document that summarizes each year’s top ASD research advances; 
 Providing advice and recommendations to the HHS Secretary regarding issues related to ASD; 
 Providing a forum for public discussion of issues related to ASD. 
 
 As a federal advisory committee, the IACC does not have authority or appropriations to fund research or services activities, nor to implement federal programs. The IACC’s role is to provide advice that can be used by federal agencies to guide them in setting program and funding priorities, and in developing partnerships with private organizations to address issues of importance to the autism community. 
 Under the  Combating Autism Reauthorization Act of 2011  (covering the period from 2011-2014,  PDF – 121 KB ), the IACC completed several important projects, including issuing: a  letter to HHS Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius regarding the need to fill critical gaps in health coverage for people on the autism spectrum; a  statement  from the Committee on the 2012 update in the ASD diagnostic criteria, which emphasized the importance of basing healthcare and service provision decisions on the need of the individual; and an in-depth  2013 IACC Strategic Plan Update  that analyzed progress made over a five-year period (2008-2012) toward implementing the recommendations in the IACC Strategic Plan. 
 Reflecting on the completion of the current IACC members’ terms on September 30, 2014, IACC Chair Dr. Thomas Insel stated, “We deeply appreciate the contributions and accomplishments of the IACC members who served on the Committee from 2012-2014, and we look forward to working with the new committee, starting in 2015, to address the community’s most pressing ASD research and services needs.” 
 The Autism CARES Act extends the work of the IACC another 5 years to 2019. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is currently seeking nominations of individuals to serve as non-federal public members on the next iteration of the committee. Members of the public are welcome to nominate individuals with personal and/or professional experience with ASD for public membership on the committee. The Office of Autism Research Coordination (OARC) at the National Institutes of Health, which manages the IACC, will assist the Department in collecting public member nominations. Selections and appointments of public members will be made by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
 For more information on the IACC public member nomination process, please see the  2014 IACC Call for Nominations Announcement .*** 
 The IACC is a federal advisory committee that was created by Congress in an effort to accelerate progress in ASD research and services. The IACC provides advice to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on activities related to ASD, and works to improve coordination and communication across the Federal government and work in partnership with the autism community. The Committee is composed of officials from many different federal agencies involved in autism research and services, as well as people with ASD, parents, advocates, and other members of the autism community. The documents and recommendations produced by the IACC reflect the views of the Committee as an independent advisory body and the expertise of the members of the Committee, but do not represent the views, official statements, policies or positions of the Federal government.

Should the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act (CARA) not pass (or another bill to continue the IACC), this will likely be the final IACC meeting. The conference call is only 2 hours.  It is worthwhile, in my experience, to listen in on what subjects are being discussed and how priorities are being set.  Safety and services subcommittees will likely discuss topics such as wandering, which has been a recent focus of the IACC and the subcommittees. Here is the announcement: Joint Meeting of Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) Subcommittee on Safety and IACC Services Subcommittee  Please join us for a conference call of the IACC Subcommittee on Safety and the IACC Services Subcommittee on  Monday, July 11, 2011 from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET  to discuss issues related to seclusion and restraint and autism  spectrum disorder (ASD).  The Services Subcommittee will also discuss  plans for the upcoming IACC Services Workshop/Town Hall that will take  place on September 15-16, 2011 in Bethesda, MD.

A few notes: The bill does include the “Combating” term that is the topic of controversy.  This is contrary to what  I wrote  in my previous article on the reauthorization. There are not two legislatively appointed representatives to the IACC as previously reported but four.  Two from the House.  Two from the Senate. There is a strong emphasis on focusing on adult autistics.  Consider the last section “REPORT TO CONGRESS ON DEMOGRAPHICS AND NEEDS OF ADULTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER” Much as I desperately would love to see this work done, I do not generally support legislative mandated research.  This is a report to congress to inform them on an area which, frankly, they need to hear about. The demographics and needs of autistic adults is a huge hole in the body of knowledge we have about autism.  And while politically active groups are wasting their time and money on congressional hearings to validate their failed views on vaccines,  —

Members of the public are invited to participate in the September 15 Services Subcommittee meeting by conference call; for more information, please consult the public notice posted on the U.S. Government Printing Office website. ======= Request for Information: Priorities for the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Services Subcommittee for Autism Spectrum Disorders Notice Number: NOT-MH-08-016 Key Dates: Release Date: August 11, 2008 Response Date: September 19, 2008 Issued by: National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Description The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to seek input from Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) stakeholders including individuals with ASD and their families, autism advocates, State officials, scientists, health professionals, therapists, educators, and the public at large about what they consider to be high-priority issues and concerns surrounding services and supports for children, youth, and adults with ASD. Background The Combating Autism Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-416) re-established the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) and, among other duties, requires that the IACC develop a strategic plan for ASD research. The IACC includes both members who are active in the area of ASD research funding, services, or advocacy, including several members who have family members with ASD, and one member with ASD. In March of 2008 the IACC established the Services Subcommittee, to assess and improve services and supports for people with ASD and their families. A previous IACC developed an ASD Services Roadmap, which is available on the IACC Website above. This RFI is a next step to obtain updated information about present and future services and supports to individuals with ASD, and their families across the lifespan. Information Requested The IACC is interested in receiving your input and ideas about high-priority questions and issues surrounding services and supports to people with ASD of all ages, and specific research initiatives on ASD services and supports.  For example, information is sought in the following areas that impact services and supports across the lifespan: education services, health and medical services (including dental), housing, transitions, employment, community inclusion, safety, older adults, finances, guardianship, and estate planning. Responses Please send responses to iaccservices@mail.nih.gov no later than September 19, 2008. Please limit your response to one page and mark with this RFI identifier, NOT-MH-08-016, in the subject line. The responses received through this RFI will be collated, summarized, and provided to the IACC Services Subcommittee and the public. Any proprietary information should be so marked. The collected information will be analyzed and may appear in reports. Although the IACC Services Subcommittee will try to protect against the release of identifying information there is no guarantee of confidentiality.

Should the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act (CARA) not pass (or another bill to continue the IACC), this will likely be the final IACC meeting.

It is interesting to see how the process works and what topics are discussed and prioritized.

The bill,  HR4631 , the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act of 2014, was introduced by Member of Congress Christopher Smith and has  80 cosponsors . The bill has already gone through  one round of modification  which is not, I believe, reflected below.  The bill retains much of the current structure, including the IACC. Some points from the bill 1) Like the newer Senate bill, the House bill requires the Secretary of HHS to designate a person to oversee the “National Autism Spectrum Disorder Initiative”. This person implement a strategic plan and “take into account” the IACC Strategic Plan is enacted and that research is not unnecessarily duplicative. 2) Adults are specifically mentioned more often in the new bill than the previous re-authorization. 3) Four public members of the IACC will be appointed by the legislature: “(E) one member appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives; 
“(F) one member appointed by the majority leader of the Senate; 
“(G) one member appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives; 
“(H) one member appointed by the minority leader of the Senate;  4) A report will be prepared by the Comptroller General on the demographics and needs of autistics in the US.  This will include the needs of autistic adults. 5) the bill does not specifically authorize appropriations for autism research. This bill will need to be reconciled with the Senate bill, and both need to pass their houses and the resulting bill needs to be signed by the president before it can become law.

New Brunswick Leads in Preschool & Student Autism Services But Adult Autism  Needs Must  Be Addressed
" "
 
 
 Autism expert Paul McDonnell Professor Emeritus (Psychology, UNB), Clinical Psychologist, and  a  major force behind the great progress that has been made in provision of preschool and school autism intervention and education services in New Brunswick,  has provided expert analysis of autism issues to the CBC. In two features, Paul's  analysis , and his  interview  by CBC reporter Dan McHardie, Paul speaks about the leadership role New Brunswick has taken on in providing excellent preschool and school autism services but also points to  the need to address youth and adult autism needs including adult care residential needs as set out in the  interview : 
 \" Our greatest need at present is to develop services for adolescents and adults,\" McDonnell writes. 
 \"What is needed is a range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be staffed with behaviourally trained supervisors and therapists.\" ... 
   \"In the past we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any gains to the individual, the family or the community 
 Among the reforms that the UNB professor is calling for is an enhanced group home system where homes would be connected to a major centre that would develop ongoing training and leadership. 
 The larger centre could also offer services for people who have mild conditions. But, he said, it could also be used to offer permanent residential care for individuals with more severe diagnoses. 
 \"Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional 'hospital' model but should, itself, be integrated into the community in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development,\" he writes. 
 \"The focus must be on education, positive living experiences and individualized curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and staff. \"

Dear Mr Alward, Cardy, Coon, Gallant:  New Brunswick Still  Needs A  Permanent Residential Care and Treatment Centre For Severely Autistic Adults
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Photo of my son Conor from a few years ago submitted
to the Aquinian for an article by  
 
 then Aquinian journalism student Karissa
Donkin. No progress in residential care and  
 
 treatment for severely autistic
adults in New Brunswick has been made since that 
 
  article or since Conor's
autism diagnosis 16 years ago at age 2 
 
 
 
June 18, 2014 
 
Dear Mr Alward, Mr Cardy, Mr Coon and Mr Gallant: 
 
A provincial election will soon be held and one of you will be premier, once again if it is Mr Alward, for the first time if it is Mr Cardy, Mr Coon or Mr Gallant.  I respectfully ask each of you to consider this request for adult autism residential care and treatment and provide a direct response. 
 
 
Prior to the commencement of the official election period early autism intervention issues have already received some needed attention in a new early intervention policy which provoked considerable reaction and vigorous discussion.  What was not mentioned, what has never been mentioned, what never gets any serious attention, is the desperate need for an adult autism centre that could assist in providing providing ongoing training, leadership and supervision for adult autism group homes and assisted living arrangements and would also provided permanent residential care and treatment for those with severe autism disorders.   
 
 
 
The significant changes that occurred in early intervention and autism education in  this province happened in direct response to strong parent advocacy primarily from parents with Autism Society New Brunswick. In our efforts we always sought credible evidence based services.  We were fortunate in having considerable guidance from Clinical Psychologist and Professor Emeritus (Psychology) Paul McDonnell Ph.D. an autism expert who has been very active in providing public education about autism in New Brunswick.  
 
 
 
During the  2010 New Brunswick election  Dr. McDonnell was interviewed by CBC on the subject of adult autism care. The interview and analysis posted on the site are no longer available but he stated: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Paul McDonnell, September 2010 
 
 
 
 
 \" Our greatest need at present is to develop services
for adolescents and adults.  What is needed is a
range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be
staffed with behaviourally trained supervisors and therapists. In the past
we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to
institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital
wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any
gains to the individual, the family or the community. 
 
 
 
 
 We need an   enhanced
group home system  throughout the province in which homes would be linked
directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and
supervision.  That major centre could also provide services for those who are
mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the
most severely affected.   Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional
\"hospital\" model but should, itself, be integrated into the community
in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development.The
focus must be on education, positive living experiences, and individualized
curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and
staff.\"   ( Bold highlighting added - HLD ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 If a major autism centre is not developed to help enhance the group homes and provide permanent residential care and treatment for those with severe autism as Professor McDonnell has advised people with severe autism, including my wonderful, happy 18 year old son,  will continue to be sent to live  out their lives in Campbellton at the Regional Psychiatric Hospital. Apart from the  hospital character of that facility it is also located in a corner of the province 3 to 4 hours drive from most communities in New Brunswick and has no direct access to autism expertise.   The ASNB polled our members on the desirable location for an autism centre and voted for Fredericton for several reasons, the two most critical being proximity to the autism expertise developed at UNB and the Stan Cassidy Centre, and the central location providing easier access for most families to their loved ones who would reside there temporarily and in some cases permanently. 
 
 
 
 As a very interested father of an 18 year old severely autistic son I ask each of you whether if elected  your government will develop,  during the next election term , the modern youth and adult autism centre described by Professor McDonnell and badly needed in New Brunswick. 
 
 
 
 Respectfully, 
 
 
 
 
 
 Harold L Doherty 
 
Fredericton

Adult Autism Care in New Brunswick: If Not During This Election  WHEN?
" "
 \"If you don't understand autism, things can become very bad very quickly.   We  have been pushing for (better facilities) in New Brunswick for several  years. This is not a crisis that has popped up in the last two days.  Residential care is a critical element for these people and it is not  being provided.\"  Harold Doherty, 2005 It has been five years since Canadians learned that an autistic youth who had committed no offence was being housed on the grounds of the Miramichi youth correctional facility (see article following)  solely because there was no adequate accommodation for him in New Brunswick while he waited admission to the Spurwink facility in Maine.  A residential care and treatment facility for autistic youths and adults still does not exist in New Brunswick. If the group homes are not adequate for the more severely autistic they are either sent outside of the Province, sent to the psychiatric hospital in Campbellton or in one case at least in Saint John live, at least temporarily on a hospital ward. In some cases severely autistic adults live in their parents home, sometimes wearing protective gear and with some assistance. But no decent residential treatment facility exists for New Brunswick's most severely autistic youths and adults. If we do not discuss adult and youth residential care during this New Brunswick election WHEN will we ever  get around to it?   WHEN will severely  autistic youths and adults have decent residential care and treatment in New Brunswick? 
 
 Autistic boy kept in New Brunswick jail 
 No other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital  No other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital 
The Toronto Star, KELLY TOUGHILL, ATLANTIC CANADA 
BUREAU, Oct. 19, 2005 HALIFAX—A 13-year-old autistic boy now living in a New Brunswick jail compound will be sent out of Canada because there is no home, hospital or institution that can handle him in his own province Provincial officials confirmed yesterday the boy is living in a visitor's apartment at the Miramichi Youth Centre and will be moved to a treatment centre in Maine by November. They stressed he is not under lock and key, has no contact with other inmates and is living outside the high wire fence that surrounds the youth detention centre.Nevertheless, the jailhouse placement and the transfer to Maine have outraged mental health advocates and opposition critics. \"They put this boy in a criminal facility because he is autistic,\" said Harold Doherty, a board member of the Autism Society of New Brunswick\"Now we are exporting our children because we can't care for them. This is Canada, not a Third World country.``We are supposed to have a decent standard of care for the sick and the vulnerable, but we don't.\"    
 Liberal MLA John Foran echoed his concern. \"This boy has done nothing wrong, is not the subject of any court order, but is in a penal institution.\" Provincial officials yesterday insisted critics are misrepresenting the nature of the boy's situation and that in fact the province has done everything it can to help him. \"This individual is not being held, and is not incarcerated,\" said Lori-Jean Johnson, spokeswoman for the family and community services department. \"He has housekeeping, bath and a separate entrance. We are just utilizing existing resources.\" Privacy laws prevent officials from discussing anything that would reveal the boy's identity, including details of his previous living situation and the whereabouts of his parents. This much is known: He suffers from a severe form of autism and is a ward of the state, under the guardianship of the minister of family and community services. He was living in a group home until recently, but became so violent that he was judged a danger to himself and others. At a psychologist's recommendation, he was moved to a three-bedroom apartment on the grounds of the Miramichi Youth Centre, a prison for about 50 young offenders. Two attendants from a private company watch the boy around the clock, at a cost to taxpayers of $700 a day. Johnson said she does not know any details of his care.  Doherty said the jailhouse placement and move to Maine highlight the desperate need for better services for autistic children in New Brunswick and across Canada. He said staff at most group homes in New Brunswick aren't trained to deal with autism and don't understand the disorder. \"If you don't understand autism, things can become very bad very quickly,\" said Doherty, who has a 9-year-old son with the disorder. \"We have been pushing for (better facilities) in New Brunswick for several years. This is not a crisis that has popped up in the last two days. Residential care is a critical element for these people and it is not being provided.\"  Johnson said the provincial system of group homes and institutions that care for children and adults with psychiatric disorders and mental disabilities works for most people. \"We do have existing resources, but once in a while, there will be an exception. Here, we are looking at a very extreme case.\" The boy will be moved to an Augusta, Me., treatment centre at the end of the month, said Johnson. The centre, run by a non-profit group called Spurwink, specializes in dealing with autistic adolescents. A Spurwink representative did not return a phone call from the Toronto Star. Provincial officials could not detail the cost to keep the child at Spurwink, nor did they have information about why he's being sent to Maine, rather than a Canadian facility in another province.

Autism Services in New Brunswick: We Lack Any Real Adult Autism Residential Care
" "
 The Restigouche Regional Hospital in northwestern New Brunswick is home for some of our adults with autism disorders 
 In  Autism resources in N.B. are a 'patchwork system'  Jacques Gallant of the Times & Transcript has reported on the state of autism services here in New Brunswick (Canada, not New Jersey).  As Mr. Gallant reports, our early autism intervention services have received justified praise and our schools have made significant progress although much improvement is needed especially in rural schools. I am interviewed and discuss, in particular, my concerns about the wholly inadequate state of adult autism specific residential care facilities in New Brunswick.  We have group homes with untrained staff who can't accommodate the most severely challenged autistic adults and we have psychiatric hospital in northern New Brunswick far from most of our population.  Other than that we have resorted to temporary housing in hotels, general hospital wards, youth prison grounds and shipping our autistic population out of the province and even out of the country to nearby Maine.  New Brunswick needs an autism specific residential care facility, based in Fredericton, close to the autism expertise that has been developed at the UNB-CEL Autism Intervention Training program and the Stan Cassidy Centre Autism team.  The center should have a variety of configurations and buildings to accommodate the differing needs of the range of autistic adults on the spectrum.  It should have the trained staff and quick access to the autism professionals in Fredericton to help provide continued adult education, recreation and life enjoyment opportunities for autistic adults in New Brunswick.

A young Saint John New Brunswick woman has, thankfully, found a new home in a special care facility as reported by CBC  in  Autistic Saint John woman finds new home . The article indicates that the young woman's mother is relieved but is still concerned about her daughter's future.  The mother's concerns are similar to my own concerns about my son and severely autistic adults in New Brunswick.  Everyone should be concerned.  New Brunswick governments, both Liberal and Conservative, have pretended to deliberate on this issue for years without providing a real solution for the long term residential care and treatment needs of adults with severe autism issues. 
 
 
 
There is a reference in the article to the review of youth mental health needs by former Ombudsman Bernard Richard.  What the article does not address is the fact that Mr. Richard and his advisers at the Office of the Ombudsman refused during the review in which I participated to give serious consideration to the possibility of recommending that the government establish a facility for the permanent residential care and treatment of youths and adult with autism disorders.  The need for such a facility has been highlighted by stories similar to the young SJ woman's story for many years but the problem is simply ignored.  
 
 
Any attempt to discuss development of  a facility is treated with disdain by adherents to the New Brunswick Association for Community Living philosophy  that dominate New Brunswick public policy making for persons with disabilities.  Rather than find a sustainable, systemic  residential care and treatment solution  for persons with serious autism issues who can not live in group homes the NBACL dominated public policy mindset is to let severely autistic adults live in Psychiatric and other hospital wards,  live temporarily on youth prison grounds and hotels and even send them out of the country to long term care and treatment, at considerable public expense in Maine. For public decision makers who adhere to this philosophy anything is better than acknowledging that the simplistic community ideology does not provide a realistic, sensible solution for youth and adults with severe autism disorder deficits. 
 
 
 
Autism experts have made submissions to the New Brunswick government on these issues and I have made representations as an autism society representative  to governments both Liberal and Conservative, about the need for a Fredericton based (close to NB's autism expert base) adult autism residential care facility, spoken with media and commented several times over the last decade all to no avail:

 Autistic boy kept in New Brunswick jail 
 
 No other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital. No other place for him to stay 
 
 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital 
 
 The Toronto Star, KELLY TOUGHILL, ATLANTIC CANADA BUREAU, Oct. 19, 2005 
 
 HALIFAX—A 13-year-old autistic boy now living in a New Brunswick jail compound will be sent out of Canada because there is no home, hospital or institution that can handle him in his own province. 
 
 Provincial officials confirmed yesterday the boy is living in a visitor's apartment at the Miramichi Youth Centre and will be moved to a treatment centre in Maine by November. 
 
 They stressed he is not under lock and key, has no contact with other inmates and is living outside the high wire fence that surrounds the youth detention centre. 
 
 Nevertheless, the jailhouse placement and the transfer to Maine have outraged mental health advocates and opposition critics. 
 
 \"They put this boy in a criminal facility because he is autistic,\" said Harold Doherty, a board member of the Autism Society of New Brunswick. 
 
 \"Now we are exporting our children because we can't care for them. This is Canada, not a Third World country. 
 
 \"We are supposed to have a decent standard of care for the sick and the vulnerable, but we don't.\" 
 
 Liberal MLA John Foran echoed his concern. \"This boy has done nothing wrong, is not the subject of any court order, but is in a penal institution.\" 
 
 Provincial officials yesterday insisted critics are misrepresenting the nature of the boy's situation and that in fact the province has done everything it can to help him. 
 
 \"This individual is not being held, and is not incarcerated,\" said Lori-Jean Johnson, spokeswoman for the family and community services department. 
 
 \"He has housekeeping, bath and a separate entrance. We are just utilizing existing resources.\" 
 
 Privacy laws prevent officials from discussing anything that would reveal the boy's identity, including details of his previous living situation and the whereabouts of his parents. 
 
 This much is known: He suffers from a severe form of autism and is a ward of the state, under the guardianship of the minister of family and community services. He was living in a group home until recently, but became so violent that he was judged a danger to himself and others. At a psychologist's recommendation, he was moved to a three-bedroom apartment on the grounds of the Miramichi Youth Centre, a prison for about 50 young offenders. Two attendants from a private company watch the boy around the clock, at a cost to taxpayers of $700 a day. 
 
 Johnson said she does not know any details of his care. 
 
 Doherty said the jailhouse placement and move to Maine highlight the desperate need for better services for autistic children in New Brunswick and across Canada. 
 
 He said staff at most group homes in New Brunswick aren't trained to deal with autism and don't understand the disorder. 
 
 \"If you don't understand autism, things can become very bad very quickly,\" said Doherty, who has a 9-year-old son with the disorder. 
 
 \"We have been pushing for (better facilities) in New Brunswick for several years. This is not a crisis that has popped up in the last two days. Residential care is a critical element for these people and it is not being provided.\" 
 
 Johnson said the provincial system of group homes and institutions that care for children and adults with psychiatric disorders and mental disabilities works for most people. 
 
 \"We do have existing resources, but once in a while, there will be an exception. Here, we are looking at a very extreme case.\" 
 
 The boy will be moved to an Augusta, Me., treatment centre at the end of the month, said Johnson. 
 
 The centre, run by a non-profit group called Spurwink, specializes in dealing with autistic adolescents. 
 
 A Spurwink representative did not return a phone call from the Toronto Star. 
 
 Provincial officials could not detail the cost to keep the child at Spurwink, nor did they have information about why he's being sent to Maine, rather than a Canadian facility in another province. 
 
 As I am quoted saying in the 2005 Toronto Star we (Autism Society NB) had been pushing for several years for better autism care facilities here in NB.  The 2005 incident did not result in action from the Liberal government of the day. 
 
 
 
 
 March 2011 - The Aquinian  (Karissa Donkin) - A Place for Conor 
 
 
 
 
 
 Doherty, a lawyer, is now in the fight of his life. As Conor nears adulthood, Doherty’s greatest worry is that the province doesn’t have the proper services for someone like Conor to maintain a high quality of life when they leave the public school system. He’s afraid Conor will fall through the cracks. 
 
 “My big fear is that he will simply be put into a room in Campbellton in the psychiatric hospital without any real life to live once I’m too old or deceased. 
 
 “On the other hand, I don’t want him dumped into one of the group homes they have. 
 
 “They don’t have staff trained to help him and they don’t have enough programs to really work with someone like my son.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Autism is a developmental disorder that affects a person’s communication and social skills. The severity of the disorder ranges from the severe form that Conor has to Asperger’s, a more mild form depicted in movies like Rainman. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention says one in 110 children have autism. 
 
 
 New Brunswick provides care both in a patient’s home and in residential facilities for more than 6,250 adults under 65 with disabilities, including autism, says Department of Social Development spokesman Mark Barbour. 
 
 But Barbour admits the province needs to do more to help autistic adults. 
 
 “There is a need for more specialized services for autistic youth and adults, whose behaviours or conditions are severely impaired. 
 
 “These individuals require services and supports designed to specifically meet their high care needs.” 
 
 The province wants to build an autism residential facility, which would provide permanent care for severely autistic adults who can’t live on their own, Barbour said.\" 
 
 
 Department of Social Development spokesperson Mark Barbour's March 2011 comments about the province's desire to build a permanent care for severely autistic adults have not been followed by any subsequent public statements to indicate that the stated intention was anything more than a public relations sound bite. 
 
 
 
 
 June 2011 - Facing Autism in New Brunswick   
 
 
 \"In  Autism resources in N.B. are a 'patchwork system'  Jacques Gallant of the Times & Transcript has reported on the state of autism services here in New Brunswick (Canada, not New Jersey).  As Mr. Gallant reports, our early autism intervention services have received justified praise and our schools have made significant progress although much improvement is needed especially in rural schools. I am interviewed and discuss, in particular, my concerns about the wholly inadequate state of adult autism specific residential care facilities in New Brunswick.  We have group homes with untrained staff who can't accommodate the most severely challenged autistic adults and we have psychiatric hospital in northern New Brunswick far from most of our population.  Other than that we have resorted to temporary housing in hotels, general hospital wards, youth prison grounds and shipping our autistic population out of the province and even out of the country to nearby Maine.  New Brunswick needs an autism specific residential care facility, based in Fredericton, close to the autism expertise that has been developed at the UNB-CEL Autism Intervention Training program and the Stan Cassidy Centre Autism team.  The center should have a variety of configurations and buildings to accommodate the differing needs of the range of autistic adults on the spectrum.  It should have the trained staff and quick access to the autism professionals in Fredericton to help provide continued adult education, recreation and life enjoyment opportunities for autistic adults in New Brunswick. \"  
 
 
 
 Costs have always been a challenge in establishing a permanent residential care facility for New Brunswick adults with severe autism.  That is a given and always will be.  There are however serious costs associated with the failure to build such a facility.  The primary consideration blocking the establishment of a residential care facility in Fredericton where autistic adults could receive some expert autism care during their adult years has been the overwhelming domination of social policy decision making by the \" community \", \" inclusion \" mindset of the NBACL and its partners in government.  It is simply not possible for those who subscribe to that belief system to consider alternatives.  
 
 
 
 During the last election UNB Psychology Professor Emeritus and Clinical Psychologist Paul McDonnell, New Brunswick's foremost autism expert, who has done more for autistic children and adults then anyone else in the province commented on CBC about the need for an adult autism residential and treatment facility: 
 
 
 
 September 2010, CBC, N.B. can be a leader in autism services (Analysis, Paul McDonnell) 
 
 \"Our greatest need at present is to develop services for adolescents and adults. 
 
 
 
 What is needed is a range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be staffed with behaviorally trained supervisors and therapists.Some jurisdictions in the United States have outstanding facilities that are in part funded by the state and provide a range of opportunities for supervised and independent living for individuals with various disabilities.The costs of not providing such services can be high financially and in terms of human costs. As a psychologist in private practice I know there are large numbers of older individuals who are diagnosed later in life with Asperger's Syndrome that have no access to professional services of any kind. 
 
 
 
 In the past we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any gains to the individual, the family, or the community. 
 
 We can do much, much better. 
 
 
 
 We need an enhanced group home system throughout the province in which homes would be linked directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and supervision. That major centre could also provide services for those who are mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the most severely affected.Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional \"hospital\" model but should, itself, be integrated into the community in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development.The focus must be on education, positive living experiences, and individualized curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and staff. \" 
 
The  realities facing severely autistic adults in NB have been clear for many years.  Periodically those realities show up in, usually unpleasant, media reports.  Our governments however have simply chosen to ignore those realities.  They are stuck, not on financial costs but on their ideological mindset, the refusal to implement a system as described by Professor McDonnell.  New Brunswick's autistic adults need a centralized, adult facility in Fredericton close to our autism expertise which could provide permanent residential care and treatment for severely autistic adults and could provide expert assistance to autism specific adult group homes, operating with autism trained staff, in communities around the province.   Such a system would actually address the adult care realities that surface periodically in media reports and help New Brunswick's severely autistic adults live and enjoy their adult years.

Green Party Says YES! To Investing In Adult Autism Residential Care in New Brunswick
" "
 On FaceBook   The Green Party of New Brunswick  has answered my question ``Does Green Party support autism expert advice to invest in adult autism residential care in NB? ``   with an emphatic   YES! 
 
 The  question included a link to the  CBC New Brunswick Votes 2010  expert commentary by NB Clinical Psychologist and  UNB Professor Emeritus (Psychology) Paul McDonnell Ph.D., who has provided advice and support for the establishment of the UNB-CEL Autism Intervention Training Program, the NB autism intervention program for preschoolers and the autism specific  training of teacher assistants and resource teachers in New Brunswick.  As stated in the  article  Autism services needed for N.B. adults   Dr. McDonnell emphasized the need for a  modern youth and adult autism care and residential treatment network in New Brunswick: 
 \"In the past we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any gains to the individual, the family or the community,\" he said. 
 Enhanced network 
 Among the reforms that the UNB professor is calling for is an enhanced group home system where homes would be connected to a major centre that would develop ongoing training and leadership. 
 The larger centre could also offer services for people who have mild conditions. But, he said, it could also be used to offer permanent residential care for individuals with more severe diagnoses. 
 \"Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional 'hospital' model but should, itself, be integrated into the community in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development,\" he writes. 
 \"The focus must be on education, positive living experiences and individualized curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and staff .\"

An Enhanced Autism Group Home System and Center is Needed to Fill the Gaping  Gap  in New Brunswick's Autism Service Model
" "
 
 
In  ASAT Responds to Canadian CBC's \"N.B. Can Be a Leader in Autism Services\"   New Brunswick, Canada  was recently described by David Celiberti Ph.D., BCBA-D, President Association for Science in Autism Treatment as being a leader in the provision of autism services. 
 
 Responding to the referenced  title of a  CBC article on the state of autism service delivery in NB  Dr. Celiberti expressed the view, with which this humble father and autism advocate agrees, that  NB is a leader in providing evidence based effective preschool intervention and  education of autistic children.  Dr. Celiberti goes on, however, to point out correctly, as did the  CBC article written by Paul McDonnell  a leading New Brunswick autism expert, Professor Emeritus (Psychology) and clinical psychologist working with autistic children, that New Brunswick is still lacking in adult autism services.  
 In fact New Brunswick has no autism specific youth and adult residential care system.  Instead NB autistic youth and adults who require residential care services are placed in general group homes with no autism specific staff and no professional autism specific expertise readily available.  For those who require autism specific treatment the situation becomes horrendous with some youth being placed on the grounds of correctional facilities, some youth and adults living in hotels, hospitals wards and psychiatric institutions. Some are exported out of the province and out of the country.   
 In his CBC comments Dr. McDonnell provides clear direction on what is needed to fill the adult service gap in New Brunswick's autism service delivery model: 
 
\" In the past we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any gains to the individual, the family, or the community. 
 
 
 We can do much, much better. 
 
 
 We need an enhanced group home system throughout the province in which homes would be linked directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and supervision. 
 
 
 That major centre could also provide services for those who are mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the most severely affected. 
 
 
 Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional \"hospital\" model but should, itself, be integrated into the community in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development. 
 
 
 The focus must be on education, positive living experiences, and individualized curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and staff. \" 
 
An enhanced autism specific group home system throughout the province with a major center, providing ongoing training, leadership and supervision, as recommended by Dr. McDonnell is exactly what is needed to fill the gaping gap in New Brunswick's autism service delivery.  Autism advocates, including me, have advocated for enhanced autism specific group homes and a center for several years but government has not responded. 
 
In New Brunswick, parents, politicians and civil servants stepped up to the plate and became a leader in helping autistic children.  Surely we can do the same for our autistic youth and adults.  Surely we can provide decent, secure, modern living environments for our vulnerable autistic youth and adults in need.

Will New Brunswick Ever Act To Provide Adult Autism Residential Care?
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Campbellton Based Restigouche Psychiatric Hospital 
 
  is  the Only NB Based Residential Care Option for Severely  
 
 Autistic Adults in New Brunswick 
 
 June 22, 2013 
 
 David Alward, Premier's Council on Status of Disabled Persons  
 Hugh J Flemming, Minister of Health  
 Madeline Dube, Minister of Social Development  
 Dorothy Shephard, Minister of Healthy and Inclusive Communities  
 
Dear Premier Alward and Honourable Ministers: 
 
 Re: Residential Care and Treatment for NB`s Autistic Youth and Adults 
 
 
I am the father of a 17 year old son with severe autism, developmental delays and epileptic seizures.  If his mother and I were to perish in an accident tomorrow my last thoughts would probably be filled with the knowledge that New Brunswick lacks anything resembling adequate residential care and treatment facilities for youths with severe autism and related disorders.  In that regard nothing has changed since the attached 2005 Toronto Star article, in which I am quoted,  concerning the youth who was housed on the grounds of the Miramichi youth correctional facility solely because he was severely autistic.  Shortly thereafter, in part at least because of Toronto media attention, he was moved to the Spurwink facility in Maine.  
 
 
 
As our son ages into adulthood we, his parents, will likely grow feebler and ultimately will die. No adult care facilities for severely autistic adults who require permanent residential care and treatment exist in New Brunswick.  I have worked on this issue over the past decade and met on several occasions during the Lord and Graham government eras with Ministers and even with former Premier Graham.  Even before the Miramichi youth situation arose I advocated with other parents to move an autistic adult out of the Saint John Centracare facility.  I have visited Centracare on more than one occasion and I have also been given a tour by the operators of the Campbellton psychiatric hospital where some autistic adults live out there lives.  
 
With that lengthy advocacy involvement on adult autism care, and lack of government response,  I did not honestly expect this administration, which repeats community and inclusion cliches in many government and official statements, and even pays for a new \"community\" government department, to actually take action on the issue of adult autism care and treatment.  I say this in the interests of candor not confrontation.   
 
 
Despite my skepticism about your philosophically driven approach to government I still have to hope, in the best interests of my severely autistic son and others, that you will, as the Lord and Graham governments did on early autism intervention, autism trained education assistants and reversal of the decision to close the Stan Cassidy tertiary care autism team, look realistically at the issues of adult autism care.  I ask you to take an evidence based approach to adult autism care issues. I ask you to take action.  I ask you to do something about the problem. 
 
 
 
In that regard I refer you, once again, to an interview with  New Brunswick autism expert Dr. Paul McDonnell, UNB professor emeritus (psychology) and clinical psychologist, in  2010  in which Dr. McDonnell commented on the need for an enhanced adult residential care network: 
 
 
 
 Autism services needed for N.B. adults 
 
 \"Our greatest need at present is to develop services for adolescents and adults,\" McDonnell writes.

\"What is needed is a range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be staffed with behaviourally trained supervisors and therapists.\" 
 
 
 The professor, who has spent 20 years studying children who have autistic spectrum disorders, said New Brunswick could look to the programs being implemented in the United States where local governments have funded facilities that provide independent living options for people with disabilities.  
 
 
 These facilities can be expensive, but McDonnell said the costs can be even higher in terms of the \"human costs\" if these reforms are not implemented.

\"In the past we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any gains to the individual, the family or the community,\" he said.  
 
 Enhanced network   
 
 
 Among the reforms that the UNB professor is calling for is an enhanced group home system where homes would be connected to a major centre that would develop ongoing training and leadership.

The larger centre could also offer services for people who have mild conditions. But, he said, it could also be used to offer permanent residential care for individuals with more severe diagnoses. 
 
 
 
 \"Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional 'hospital' model but should, itself, be integrated into the community in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development,\" he writes.

\"The focus must be on education, positive living experiences and individualized curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and staff.\"


 
 
 
The 2005 Toronto Star Article follows. It demonstrates clearly how long these autism youth and adult problems have been festering in New Brunswick. Please take steps now to address these issues that torment so many with autism and their families in New Brunswick. 
 Respectfully,

 Autistic boy kept in New Brunswick jail 
 
 No other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital.  
 
 The Toronto Star, KELLY TOUGHILL, ATLANTIC CANADA BUREAU, Oct. 19, 2005 
 
 HALIFAX—A 13-year-old autistic boy now living in a New Brunswick jail compound will be sent out of Canada because there is no home, hospital or institution that can handle him in his own province. 
 
 Provincial officials confirmed yesterday the boy is living in a visitor's apartment at the Miramichi Youth Centre and will be moved to a treatment centre in Maine by November. 
 
 They stressed he is not under lock and key, has no contact with other inmates and is living outside the high wire fence that surrounds the youth detention centre. 
 
 
 Nevertheless, the jailhouse placement and the transfer to Maine have outraged mental health advocates and opposition critics. 
 
 
 
 \"They put this boy in a criminal facility because he is autistic,\" said Harold Doherty, a board member of the Autism Society of New Brunswick. 
 
 
 
 \"Now we are exporting our children because we can't care for them. This is Canada, not a Third World country. 
 
 
 
 \"We are supposed to have a decent standard of care for the sick and the vulnerable, but we don't.\" 
 
 
 
 Liberal MLA John Foran echoed his concern. \"This boy has done nothing wrong, is not the subject of any court order, but is in a penal institution.\" 
 
 
 
 Provincial officials yesterday insisted critics are misrepresenting the nature of the boy's situation and that in fact the province has done everything it can to help him. 
 
 
 
 \"This individual is not being held, and is not incarcerated,\" said Lori-Jean Johnson, spokeswoman for the family and community services department. 
 
 
 
 \"He has housekeeping, bath and a separate entrance. We are just utilizing existing resources.\" 
 
 
 
 Privacy laws prevent officials from discussing anything that would reveal the boy's identity, including details of his previous living situation and the whereabouts of his parents. 
 
 
 
 This much is known: He suffers from a severe form of autism and is a ward of the state, under the guardianship of the minister of family and community services. He was living in a group home until recently, but became so violent that he was judged a danger to himself and others. At a psychologist's recommendation, he was moved to a three-bedroom apartment on the grounds of the Miramichi Youth Centre, a prison for about 50 young offenders. Two attendants from a private company watch the boy around the clock, at a cost to taxpayers of $700 a day. 
 
 
 Johnson said she does not know any details of his care. 
 
 Doherty said the jailhouse placement and move to Maine highlight the desperate need for better services for autistic children in New Brunswick and across Canada. 
 
 He said staff at most group homes in New Brunswick aren't trained to deal with autism and don't understand the disorder. 
 
 \"If you don't understand autism, things can become very bad very quickly,\" said Doherty, who has a 9-year-old son with the disorder. 
 
 \"We have been pushing for (better facilities) in New Brunswick for several years. This is not a crisis that has popped up in the last two days. Residential care is a critical element for these people and it is not being provided.\" 
 
 Johnson said the provincial system of group homes and institutions that care for children and adults with psychiatric disorders and mental disabilities works for most people. 
 
 \"We do have existing resources, but once in a while, there will be an exception. Here, we are looking at a very extreme case.\" 
 
 The boy will be moved to an Augusta, Me., treatment centre at the end of the month, said Johnson. 
 
 The centre, run by a non-profit group called Spurwink, specializes in dealing with autistic adolescents. 
 
 A Spurwink representative did not return a phone call from the Toronto Star. 
 
 Provincial officials could not detail the cost to keep the child at Spurwink, nor did they have information about why he's being sent to Maine, rather than a Canadian facility in another province.``

NB Adult Autism Residential Care Facility Needed: \"It Is More Than Overdue\" \"When Will They Ever Learn?\" 
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My 18 year old severely autistic son Conor waits for his slow poke Dad while we were out  
 
 on a trail walk (Fredericton North Riverfront Trail). NB has known for 11 years (at least) 
 
  that an adult autism residential care and treatment facility is badly needed.   
 
 We are still waiting.  
 
 
 
On June    18, 2014 I posted on Facing Autism in New Brunswick and on my Facebook page a letter I  sent to NB's political party leaders in which I commented on the long overdue need for an adult autism care facility in NB that could provide care for the most severely autistic and expertise to group homes around the province as articulated by Professor Emeritus Paul McDonnell whose 2010 comments are also re-posted herein:  
 
 
 Prior to the commencement of the official election period early autism intervention issues have already received some needed attention in a new early intervention policy which provoked considerable reaction and vigorous discussion.  What was not mentioned, what has never been mentioned, what never gets any serious attention, is the desperate need for an adult autism centre that could assist in providing providing ongoing training, leadership and supervision for adult autism group homes and assisted living arrangements and would also provided permanent residential care and treatment for those with severe autism disorders.  
 
 
 
On my personal Facebook page I received commentary from two people with considerable involvement and knowledge of autism issues from the government side of the discussion with former Education and Early Childhood Development Deputy Minister Wendy McLeod MacKnight and former Family and Community Services Minister Antoon (Tony) Huntjens 

 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Will Adult Autism Care Issues Be Considered During #nbvotes 2014?

 - it is an embarrassment to me that you and I started discussing this 
back in 2003 after the preschool program started and no one has yet 
addressed it.  We came close about 5 or 6 years ago, but got shut  down.
  it is more than overdue...

 Paul McDonnell, CBC Interview, September 20 10 
 
 
 
 
 
 \" Our greatest need at present is to develop services
for adolescents and adults.  What is needed is a
range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be
staffed with behaviourally trained supervisors and therapists. In the past
we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to
institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital
wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any
gains to the individual, the family or the community. 
 
 
 
 
 We need an   enhanced
group home system  throughout the province in which homes would be linked
directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and
supervision.  That major centre could also provide services for those who are
mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the
most severely affected.   Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional
\"hospital\" model but should, itself, be integrated into the community
in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development.The
focus must be on education, positive living experiences, and individualized
curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and
staff.\"   ( Bold highlighting added - HLD ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As I have stated many times if an  autism centre is not developed to help enhance the group homes 
and provide permanent residential care and treatment for those with 
severe autism as Professor McDonnell has advised people with severe 
autism, including my wonderful, happy 18 year old son,  will continue to
 be sent to live  out their lives in Campbellton at the Regional 
Psychiatric Hospital. Apart from the  hospital character of that 
facility it is also located in a corner of the province 3 to 4 hours 
drive from most communities in New Brunswick and has no direct access to
 autism expertise.   Previous ASNB member polls  on the desirable 
location for an autism centre saw votes for Fredericton for several 
reasons, the two most critical being proximity to the autism expertise 
developed at UNB and the Stan Cassidy Centre, and the central location 
providing easier access for most families to their loved ones who would 
reside there temporarily and in some cases permanently. As it is those with severely autistic adult loved ones currently travel out of province or to the Restigouche Psychiatric Hospital on NB's Quebec border. 
 
 Will NB ever learn to save money and help our severely autistic adults by building a residential care and treatment facility in Fredericton or will we continue to spend money sending them out of province or send them far from family on the NB-Quebec border?

Adult Autism Residential Care and Treatment in New Brunswick 2000-2010 and Beyond; In 2011 Will Autistic Adults Remain Forgotten?
" "
December 31 2010 
 
The Honourable David Alward  
Premier of New Brunswick and Minister 
Responsible for the Premier's Council  
on the Status of Disabled Persons 
 
The Honourable Madeleine Dubé  
Minister of Health  
 
The Honourable Sue Stultz 
Minister of Social Development  
 
The Honourable Jody Carr 
Minister Education and Early Childhood Development 
 
Dear Honourable Premier and Honourable Ministers 
 
 Re: Adult Autism Residential Care and Treatment in New Brunswick 2000-2010 and Beyond; In 2011 Will Autistic Adults Remain Forgotten? 
 
 As this year draws to an end and a new year approaches I  congratulate you on your victory in the recent election; on winning the trust of the people of New Brunswick. In facing up to the well known financial and economic challenges confronting New Brunswickers I hope, and trust, that this government will not neglect  the eduction, health and social needs of New Brunswickers,  of all New Brunswickers, including NB adults with autism disorders. In particular I hope, and ask in this open letter, that  this government begin serious efforts in 2011 to address the residential care and treatment needs of New Brunswick adults with autism disorders.  
 I am the father of a 14 year old boy with Autistic Disorder, assessed with profound developmental delays.  In plain language he is severely autistic.  I have, because of his condition,  been an active autism advocate in New Brunswick over the past 12 years. New Brunswick has enjoyed much success in addressing preschool and education needs of autistic children and youth in recent years taking an evidence based approach and we have done it in both of our official languages.  These advances began under the government of Premier Bernard Lord and grew during Premier Shawn Graham's term in office.  The success that has been enjoyed with autistic preschoolers and students stands in stark contrast, however, to the lack of progress in helping NB's autistic youth and adults  who are severely disabled by their disorders and who have need of residential care and treatment which have not been provided in any meaningful sense in New Brunswick.  
 In 2005 the national media reported that an autistic New Brunswick youth was being held on the grounds of the Miramichi youth correctional facility. At that time NB autism advocates had already been advocating for several years for a modernized residential care and treatment system for NB youth and adults. No significant progress has been made over the past 10 years. During the recent election campaign Professor Emeritus (Psychology) and Clinical Psychologist Paul McDonnell was interviewed by CBC and described a comprehensive modernized approach to autism residential care and treatment: 
 
 \"Our greatest need at present is to develop services for adolescents and adults. 
 
 
 What is needed is a range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be staffed with behaviorally trained supervisors and therapists. 
 
 
 Some jurisdictions in the United States have outstanding facilities that are in part funded by the state and provide a range of opportunities for supervised and independent living for individuals with various disabilities.\" 
 
 
 We need an enhanced group home system throughout the province in which homes would be linked directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and supervision. 
 
 
 That major centre could also provide services for those who are mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the most severely affected. 
 
 
 Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional \"hospital\" model but should, itself, be integrated into the community in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development. 
 
 
 The focus must be on education, positive living experiences, and individualized curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and staff.\" 
 
 The  model described by Paul McDonnell has been described and advocated for  in meetings with senior civil servants over the past decade but no action has resulted. Today we still have autistic adults living in facilities outside New Brunswick and in a variety of ad hoc accommodations.  The most seriously challenged persons live in the psychiatric hospital in Restigouche.  The  current group homes have untrained staff . We need a modernized, centrally located facility that could provide treatment and permanent residential care for those most severely disabled by autism disorders and  community based residential facilities around the province with properly trained staff. In 10 years there has been no progress in addressing the residential care and treatment needs of autistic youth and adults.  I respectfully ask that your government begin planning, in 2011, to provide an evidence based system, as described by Dr. McDonnell,  that will address these needs and provide a decent quality of life for our autistic youth and adult population. 
Respectfully, 
 
Harold L Doherty

Autism Youth and Adult Residential Care & Treatment Still Abysmal  in New Brunswick
" "
 In  October 2005  the Toronto Star reported on the case of a New Brunswick autistic youth who was being housed by the Province of New Brunswick on the gounds of a youth correctional facility. The youth had committed no crime.  The state of New Brunswick's youth and adult residential care and treatment facilities was so bad, virtually non-existent for those with more severe and challenging autism disorder, that the province felt it was the only place that could accommodate the youth while they waited for his admission to a facility in the United States.  The Toronto Star article follows this comment.  Unfortunately, as the letter from Stephen Robbins posted here a couple of days ago indicates things have not improved any since then.  In New Brunswick we must still export our autistic youths and adults out of the country for decent residential care and treatment.  From a personal perspective this issue weighs heavily on my mind. My son Conor was 9 at the time of the first story. He is now 11 and nearing the age of the two youths in these stories. In the meantime youth and adult residential care and treatment in New Brunswick have not moved a single steop forward. The bureaucracy does what the bureaucracy always does. It delays, it denies that problems exist, it worries about the careers of its members and whether they might be embarassed but it takes no significant action on critical issues affecting some of New Brunswick's vulnerable members.  \"  Autistic boy kept in New Brunswick jail No other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospitalNo other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital The Toronto Star, KELLY TOUGHILL, ATLANTIC CANADA BUREAU,  Oct. 19, 2005 HALIFAX—A 13-year-old autistic boy now living in a New Brunswick jail compound will be sent out of Canada because there is no home, hospital or institution that can handle him in his own province. Provincial officials confirmed yesterday the boy is living in a visitor's apartment at the Miramichi Youth Centre and will be moved to a treatment centre in Maine by November. They stressed he is not under lock and key, has no contact with other inmates and is living outside the high wire fence that surrounds the youth detention centre. Nevertheless, the jailhouse placement and the transfer to Maine have outraged mental health advocates and opposition critics. \"They put this boy in a criminal facility because he is autistic,\" said Harold Doherty, a board member of the Autism Society of New Brunswick. \"Now we are exporting our children because we can't care for them. This is Canada, not a Third World country. ``We are supposed to have a decent standard of care for the sick and the vulnerable, but we don't.\" Liberal MLA John Foran echoed his concern. \"This boy has done nothing wrong, is not the subject of any court order, but is in a penal institution.\" Provincial officials yesterday insisted critics are misrepresenting the nature of the boy's situation and that in fact the province has done everything it can to help him. \"This individual is not being held, and is not incarcerated,\" said Lori-Jean Johnson, spokeswoman for the family and community services department. \"He has housekeeping, bath and a separate entrance. We are just utilizing existing resources.\" Privacy laws prevent officials from discussing anything that would reveal the boy's identity, including details of his previous living situation and the whereabouts of his parents. This much is known: He suffers from a severe form of autism and is a ward of the state, under the guardianship of the minister of family and community services. He was living in a group home until recently, but became so violent that he was judged a danger to himself and others. At a psychologist's recommendation, he was moved to a three-bedroom apartment on the grounds of the Miramichi Youth Centre, a prison for about 50 young offenders. Two attendants from a private company watch the boy around the clock, at a cost to taxpayers of $700 a day. Johnson said she does not know any details of his care. Doherty said the jailhouse placement and move to Maine highlight the desperate need for better services for autistic children in New Brunswick and across Canada. He said staff at most group homes in New Brunswick aren't trained to deal with autism and don't understand the disorder. \"If you don't understand autism, things can become very bad very quickly,\" said Doherty, who has a 9-year-old son with the disorder. \"We have been pushing for (better facilities) in New Brunswick for several years. This is not a crisis that has popped up in the last two days. Residential care is a critical element for these people and it is not being provided.\" Johnson said the provincial system of group homes and institutions that care for children and adults with psychiatric disorders and mental disabilities works for most people. \"We do have existing resources, but once in a while, there will be an exception. Here, we are looking at a very extreme case.\" The boy will be moved to an Augusta, Me., treatment centre at the end of the month, said Johnson. The centre, run by a non-profit group called Spurwink, specializes in dealing with autistic adolescents. A Spurwink representative did not return a phone call from the Toronto Star. Provincial officials could not detail the cost to keep the child at Spurwink, nor did they have information about why he's being sent to Maine, rather than a Canadian facility in another province. \" .... Keep autistic children in the province Daily Gleaner (Fredericton NB) Published Wednesday  May 23rd, 2007 Appeared on page C7 This is a letter to Premier Shawn Graham. I am a father of a 13-year-old autistic boy. We had to fight for services for our son from the day he was born: to get diagnosed, to get Applied Behavioural Analysis therapy (before it was mandatory), to get teacher's aides in the classroom, to keep him in school, and to get hospital treatment when his compulsion to bite and pinch got to the point where he was covered in wounds and bruises. I am afraid my wife and I do not have much fight left in us these days. Our son has lived under constant supervision 24 hours a day for the last year. Two workers stay in our home with him during the day (two are needed to restrain him during his rages). While we commend them for all they have done, the workers are merely a Band-Aid solution. Our only option at this point is to send our son out of country to the U.S. for treatment that he desperately needs. Services at the two facilities, in Maine or Boston, will cost the government $200,000 to $300,000 a year. Right now my son is costing the government $15,000 to $20,000 a month because of the government's lack of direction when it comes to older autistic children. My question to you, Mr. Graham, is that it may have been cost effective at one time to send these children away (out of sight, out of mind). But now with it being 1 in 150 children being diagnosed within the autism spectrum disorder, maybe we should re-evaluate the direction our province is going in. I realize that there may be no other recourse for my son but to be sent to these facilities in the U.S. for treatment. I hope in the future we may be able to prevent our children from having to leave Canada to get the services they so desperately need. Stephen Robbins Woodstock, N.B.

Residential Care, Treatment,  Needed for New Brunswick Autistic Youths, Adults
" "
 In New Brunswick much progress has been made for pre-school autistic children. Some funding is now available for evidence based autism interventions and agencies have been established, and measures implemented, to provide accountability in delivery of intervention services. Improvements are also starting to be made to provide autism trained teacher assistants and resource teachers to provide autistic school children with a real education. But for youths and adults with autism who are in need of decent, competent residential care and treatment nothing has changed since the fall of 2005. That was when Canada became aware that New Brunswick is so lacking in residential facilites with properly trained personnel and in treatment for autistic youths and adults that we truly literally house some of our autistic residents on the grounds of penal institutions. There has been a provincial election in the period since 2005 and a new governing team is just now getting its full grip on the reins of power.  Nonetheless the time is long overdue for New Brunswick to start providing decent residential care and treatment for its autistic youths and adults - right here in New Brunswick.     Autistic boy kept in New Brunswick jail No other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital The Toronto Star, KELLY TOUGHILL, ATLANTIC CANADA BUREAU, Oct. 19, 2005 HALIFAX—A 13-year-old autistic boy now living in a New Brunswick jail compound will be sent out of Canada because there is no home, hospital or institution that can handle him in his own province. Provincial officials confirmed yesterday the boy is living in a visitor's apartment at the Miramichi Youth Centre and will be moved to a treatment centre in Maine by November. They stressed he is not under lock and key, has no contact with other inmates and is living outside the high wire fence that surrounds the youth detention centre. Nevertheless, the jailhouse placement and the transfer to Maine have outraged mental health advocates and opposition critics. \"They put this boy in a criminal facility because he is autistic,\" said Harold Doherty, a board member of the Autism Society of New Brunswick. \"Now we are exporting our children because we can't care for them. This is Canada, not a Third World country. ``We are supposed to have a decent standard of care for the sick and the vulnerable, but we don't.\" Liberal MLA John Foran echoed his concern. \"This boy has done nothing wrong, is not the subject of any court order, but is in a penal institution.\" ........ http://www.canadiancrc.com/articles/Tor_Star_Autistic_boy_kept_NB_jail_19OCT05.htm

8 Years Later: Autism Youth & Adult Residential Care & Treatment Still Abysmal  in New Brunswick
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In May 2007 I commented on this site about the abysmal state of Youth and Adult Residential Care in New Brunswick. That commentary included the October 2005 article by then Toronto Star journalist Kelly Toughill who is apparently now a  Director and Associate Professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Kings College  in Halifax, Nova Scotia. As an Autism Society New Brunswick representative and as the parent of a son with severe autism and profound developmental delays I have reminded the NB government, under both Liberal and Conservative administrations of the need for autism trained staff to work in group homes with autistic youth and adults.  I have also reminded them that we need an intermediate level facility based in Fredericton, close to the UNB Psychology department, the UNB-CEL Autism Intervention Training program and the Stan Cassidy autism treatment team.  Such a center could provide autism trained staff AND professional oversight and treatment for the more severely autistic youth and adults while also providing training and clinical visits as needed to group homes around the province. In the past year the government has indicated that one group home has received autism training for the staff as a pilot project.  8 years after a youth was sent to reside on the grounds of the Miramichi correcitonal facility, and with Autism Awareness month in Canada drawing to an end, there is still NO facility in place for those like my son with severe autism, the youth who had been sent to the correctional facility grounds in Miramichi, for those like the man sent to Spurwink Maine or the son of the letter writer from Woodstock whose letter appears at the conclusion of this blog post.  
 
As parents we fought hard for early evidence based autism intervention and for the quality program to provide the training to those working with young children.  We also advocated with some success for autism trained teacher aides and resource teachers and accommodation of some autistic students with placement outside the regular classroom over intense opposition from the powerful extreme inclusion \"community living\" forces in New Brunswick which typically have not been of assistance to severely autistic children, youth and adults.  Adult care autism facilities  have been very much more difficult to advance achieve in part because of money, in part because it is harder to motivate parents of younger children to look ahead to the adult years and in very large part because of the ideological objections of the community living movement.  There is no choice in the matter though, we must fight hard for decent, modern adult residential care in New Brunswick or send our severely autistic adults to other jurisdictions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 In  October 2005  the Toronto Star reported on the case of a New Brunswick autistic youth who was being housed by the Province of New Brunswick on the gounds of a youth correctional facility. The youth had committed no crime. The state of New Brunswick's youth and adult residential care and treatment facilities was so bad, virtually non-existent for those with more severe and challenging autism disorder, that the province felt it was the only place that could accommodate the youth while they waited for his admission to a facility in the United States. The Toronto Star article follows this comment. Unfortunately, as the letter from Stephen Robbins posted here a couple of days ago indicates things have not improved any since then. In New Brunswick we must still export our autistic youths and adults out of the country for decent residential care and treatment. 
 
 
 
 From a personal perspective this issue weighs heavily on my mind. My son Conor was 9 at the time of the first story. He is now 11 and nearing the age of the two youths in these stories. In the meantime youth and adult residential care and treatment in New Brunswick have not moved a single steop forward. The bureaucracy does what the bureaucracy always does. It delays, it denies that problems exist, it worries about the careers of its members and whether they might be embarassed but it takes no significant action on critical issues affecting some of New Brunswick's vulnerable members.

 The Toronto Star, KELLY TOUGHILL, ATLANTIC CANADA BUREAU,  Oct. 19, 2005 
 
 
 HALIFAX—A 13-year-old autistic boy now living in a New Brunswick jail compound will be sent out of Canada because there is no home, hospital or institution that can handle him in his own province. 
 
 
 Provincial officials confirmed yesterday the boy is living in a visitor's apartment at the Miramichi Youth Centre and will be moved to a treatment centre in Maine by November. 
 
 
 They stressed he is not under lock and key, has no contact with other inmates and is living outside the high wire fence that surrounds the youth detention centre. 
 
 
 Nevertheless, the jailhouse placement and the transfer to Maine have outraged mental health advocates and opposition critics. 
 
 
 \"They put this boy in a criminal facility because he is autistic,\" said Harold Doherty, a board member of the Autism Society of New Brunswick. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 \"Now we are exporting our children because we can't care for them. This is Canada, not a Third World country. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ``We are supposed to have a decent standard of care for the sick and the vulnerable, but we don't.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Liberal MLA John Foran echoed his concern. \"This boy has done nothing wrong, is not the subject of any court order, but is in a penal institution.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Provincial officials yesterday insisted critics are misrepresenting the nature of the boy's situation and that in fact the province has done everything it can to help him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 \"This individual is not being held, and is not incarcerated,\" said Lori-Jean Johnson, spokeswoman for the family and community services department. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 \"He has housekeeping, bath and a separate entrance. We are just utilizing existing resources.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Privacy laws prevent officials from discussing anything that would reveal the boy's identity, including details of his previous living situation and the whereabouts of his parents. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This much is known: He suffers from a severe form of autism and is a ward of the state, under the guardianship of the minister of family and community services. He was living in a group home until recently, but became so violent that he was judged a danger to himself and others. At a psychologist's recommendation, he was moved to a three-bedroom apartment on the grounds of the Miramichi Youth Centre, a prison for about 50 young offenders. Two attendants from a private company watch the boy around the clock, at a cost to taxpayers of $700 a day. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Johnson said she does not know any details of his care. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Doherty said the jailhouse placement and move to Maine highlight the desperate need for better services for autistic children in New Brunswick and across Canada. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 He said staff at most group homes in New Brunswick aren't trained to deal with autism and don't understand the disorder. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 \"If you don't understand autism, things can become very bad very quickly,\" said Doherty, who has a 9-year-old son with the disorder. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 \"We have been pushing for (better facilities) in New Brunswick for several years. This is not a crisis that has popped up in the last two days. Residential care is a critical element for these people and it is not being provided.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Johnson said the provincial system of group homes and institutions that care for children and adults with psychiatric disorders and mental disabilities works for most people. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 \"We do have existing resources, but once in a while, there will be an exception. Here, we are looking at a very extreme case.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The boy will be moved to an Augusta, Me., treatment centre at the end of the month, said Johnson. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The centre, run by a non-profit group called Spurwink, specializes in dealing with autistic adolescents. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Spurwink representative did not return a phone call from the Toronto Star. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Provincial officials could not detail the cost to keep the child at Spurwink, nor did they have information about why he's being sent to Maine, rather than a Canadian facility in another province. \"

 Keep autistic children in the province

 This is a letter to Premier Shawn Graham. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I am a father of a 13-year-old autistic boy. We had to fight for services for our son from the day he was born: to get diagnosed, to get Applied Behavioural Analysis therapy (before it was mandatory), to get teacher's aides in the classroom, to keep him in school, and to get hospital treatment when his compulsion to bite and pinch got to the point where he was covered in wounds and bruises. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I am afraid my wife and I do not have much fight left in us these days. Our son has lived under constant supervision 24 hours a day for the last year. Two workers stay in our home with him during the day (two are needed to restrain him during his rages). While we commend them for all they have done, the workers are merely a Band-Aid solution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Our only option at this point is to send our son out of country to the U.S. for treatment that he desperately needs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Services at the two facilities, in Maine or Boston, will cost the government $200,000 to $300,000 a year. Right now my son is costing the government $15,000 to $20,000 a month because of the government's lack of direction when it comes to older autistic children. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My question to you, Mr. Graham, is that it may have been cost effective at one time to send these children away (out of sight, out of mind). But now with it being 1 in 150 children being diagnosed within the autism spectrum disorder, maybe we should re-evaluate the direction our province is going in. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I realize that there may be no other recourse for my son but to be sent to these facilities in the U.S. for treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I hope in the future we may be able to prevent our children from having to leave Canada to get the services they so desperately need.

Autism Residential Care in NB from 2005-2010: Nothing Has Changed
" "
 I have been publicly proud of this beautiful province of New Brunswick when it comes to helping autistic school children and pre-schoolers.  For those age groups I would stack New Brunswick's autism services and real accommodation up against any jurisdiction in North America, even better funded jurisdictions like oil rich Alberta and traditional Canadian economic hub Ontario.  When it comes to taking care of autistic youths living with the challenges of autism and Aspergers though New Brunswick is in very bad shape and has absolutely nothing to brag about.   
In New Brunswick we have an  ad hoc  system of residential care which has seen New Brunswick adults with autism shipped out of province far from families who love them. We have seen some NB adults with autism living on a hospital ward (information conveyed to me but unconfirmed). We have seen NB autistic youth and adults whose aggressive behaviour even with family members end up in jail facing assault charges.  On some occasions family members are urged by Social Development workers to press charges since the Criminal process will often result in a psychiatric assessment not otherwise available from public funds. The most severely affected by autism reside in a psychiatric hospital in the non central, Northwestern corner city of Campbellton again far from most family members living out their lives. I have visited that hospital and saw caring people in charge but people who have to deal with limited resources. 
 
Things to day are not much different than they were 5 years ago for New Brunswick's autistic adults severely affected by autism who require residential care and treatment. 4 1/2 years ago New Brunswick was infamous for housing an autistic youth charged with no wrongdoing on the grounds of a youth correctional center in Miramichi pending his transfer to the Spurwink facility in the State of Maine.  As the Toronto media headlines faded away, so too did the apparent willingness of government to provide a decent residential care system for New Brunswick adults with autism. I have been part of a contingent of autism representatives that has surveyed the needs of our autistic population and presented our suggestions to government to consider on severeral occasions.  Still no action.  Still nothing to help our autistic  youths and adults in need of decent residential care and treatment. 
 
Following is a Toronto Star article on the incident 5 years ago that saw the autistic youth residing on the grounds of a correctional facility because there was nowhere else for him to go in the Province of New Brunswick.

HALIFAX—A 13-year-old autistic boy now living in a New Brunswick jail compound will be sent out of Canada because there is no home, hospital or institution that can handle him in his own province Provincial officials confirmed yesterday the boy is living in a visitor's apartment at the Miramichi Youth Centre and will be moved to a treatment centre in Maine by November. 
 They stressed he is not under lock and key, has no contact with other inmates and is living outside the high wire fence that surrounds the youth detention centre.Nevertheless, the jailhouse placement and the transfer to Maine have outraged mental health advocates and opposition critics.

 The political standings have changed during the past 5 years in New Brunswick.  Mr. John Foran has been part of a Liberal government in power for almost 4 years now.  The Liberal government of Premier Shawn Graham,  especially  former Education Minister Kelly Lamrock, has done much to improve the lives of New Brunswick autistic students and pre schoolers.  But for New Brunswick's autistic youth and adults in need of decent residential care and treatment it is a different story. 
 
5 years ago things were desperate. Little has changed since then for New Brunswick's autistic youth and adults who have been so badly in need, for so long,  of a modern comprehensive residential care and treatment system.

Is 2015 The Year New Brunswick Finally  Addresses Serious  NB Adult Autism Residential Care and Treatment Needs?
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the  2010 New Brunswick election  Dr. McDonnell, as noted above, was interviewed 
by CBC on the subject of adult autism care. The interview and analysis 
posted on the site are no longer available online but he stated at that time (bold highlighting added by me): 
 
 
 
 
 Paul McDonnell, September, 2010 
 
 
 
 
 \" Our greatest need at present is to develop services
for adolescents and adults.  What is needed is a
range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be
staffed with behaviourally trained supervisors and therapists. In the past
we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to
institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital
wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any
gains to the individual, the family or the community. 
 
 
 
 
 
 We need an   enhanced
group home system  throughout the province in which homes would be  linked
directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and
supervision .  That major centre could also provide services for those who are
mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the
most severely affected.   Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional
\"hospital\" model but should, itself, be integrated into the community
in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development.The
focus must be on education, positive living experiences, and individualized
curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and
staff.\"   ( Bold highlighting added - HLD ) 
 
 
 
 
 The autism residential care and network system described by Dr. McDonnell was raised with the parties during the 2014 election.  The Green and NDP parties responded positively to the matter with mentions in their election platforms.  The Liberal and Conservative parties ignored autism issues entirely so there is no reason to assume that the currrent Liberal government will address the needs of  New Brunswick's autistic adults particularly those with severe autism disorders and co-morbid conditions like my son Conor who will probably be forced to live out his life in the Restigouche Psychiatric Hospital in Campbellton's in NB's northern border with Quebec.  All the community cliches in the world will be of no assistance to my son and other severely autistic adults most of whom will be living many hours drive from their families. 
 
 
 
It is not clear for the reasons that follow why the government of New Brunswick has refused to addressed the serious health and residential care needs of autistic adults.  The usual suspects have been: 
 
 
 
1. Costs  
 
 
 
The network described above by Paul McDonnell could actually have resulted in government cost savings. Some of NB autistic adults have been sent to Spurwink Maine for many years at costs of several hundred thousand dollars per year per person.  With the current Liberal government dedicating millions to capital investment during its election term it would be a good opportunity to build the autism centre referenced by Paul McDonnell a centre which could provide quality residential care for those in need of such and professional expertise and oversight for community autism homes and assisted living environments around the province.   
 
 
 
2.  The Taboo Against \"Institutions\", \"Centres\", \"Bricks and Mortar\" 
 
 
In New Brunswick various groups and individuals have persisted in  repeating community cliches like \" no bricks and mortar \" when various special care needs are raised. (To my knowledge ALL of these individuals live in bricks and mortar buildings). These same people simply ignore the evidence that their total faith in undefined community solutions has not addressed the needs of autistic adults in NB. 
 
 
In the autism context a meeting was held several years ago with Ombudsman and Youth Advocate officials Bernard Richard and Christian Whalen.  I attended in the company of NB autism expert Paul McDonnell.  McDonnell's proposal for an autism center and network was raised with these gentleman, neither of whom has any known autism expertise, but was quickly dismissed, and not discussed in any meaningful way, by Mr. Richard or Mr. Whalen.  Mr Richard was interviewed recently on CBC when the government announced funding for a youth complex needs centre.  Mr Richard, of Moncton, once again, voiced the \" no bricks and mortar \" cliche before advocating for Moncton as the best location for a youth complex needs centre. 
 
There are in today's world existing examples in other areas of mental 
health care which could be borrowed to develop the physical structure 
necessary to accommodate residential care and treatment needs of 
autistic adults in a way that would allow for a range of environments to
 accommodate those with greater liberty needs and those with greater 
security, assistance and health care needs. The  Hogeway dementia care village facility  is one such example which is receiving world wide recognition. 
 
 
 
The costs and and community concerns would in fact be addressed by the autism network described by McDonnell.  Such a centre would see monies being spent constructively in New Brunswick which would save monies spent  outside New Brunswick and would provide New Brunswick autistic adults with residential care and treatment in their communities for those who are capable of living in a group home or assisted living environment and in a centre in Fredericton near the autism expertise of UNB, UNB-CEL and the Stan Cassidy Centre for those requiring permanent residential care and treatment.  Fredericton, an increasingly bi-lingual city, would also be able to provide centre services in French and English as demonstrated by the UNB-CEL autism intervention training program.  The  UNB-CEL autism program has received international recognition  as  a model early intervention program for training autism support workers and clinical supervisors and has done so in both French and English.  ( The Universite de Moncton was asked to participate in the initial stages of developing the UNB-CEL autism program but for reasons unknown to me declined the opportunity to participate and has developed no similar program ). 
 
 
 
The need for an adult autism care network can not be denied in New Brunswick.  With an estimated  population of 11,000 New Brunswick'ers with autism many are also adults living in a hodge podge of arrangements without badly needed professional oversight or assistance.  Others have been  sent to a variety of institutional care settings.  Some well known cases are the autistic youth living on the  grounds of the Miramichi  youth correctional centre (2005)  before being sent to Spurwink Maine, the adult who lived at  Centracare (2003)  before being sent to Spurwink and those who have resided, and continue to reside, at the Restigouche Psychiatric Hospital on the Quebec border far from most families in southern-central NB. Unconfirmed reports indicate that some autistic adults have lived for periods of time on general hospital wards. 
 
 
 
It is time to save money, provide assistance and positive, meaningful life development to those autistic adults who can not function independently in living accommodations near their home,  AND extend their life expectancies.   
 
 
 
It is time to walk away from the addiction to cliches while shipping autistic adults to locations far from families.  
 
 
 
It is time, it is long past time, since the events in 2003, 2005,  to seriously address NB adult autism residential care and treatment requirements and build the  autism network envisioned by NB autism expert Paul McDonnnell in 2010.

Dear Premier Elect Gallant: Please Develop the Adult Autism Care System NB Has Needed for So Long
" "
 
 
 
 
September 25, 2014  
 
Premier  Elect Brian Gallant 
Province of New Brunswick  
 
Dear Mr. Gallant: 
 
 
 \" We need an   enhanced
group home system throughout the province in which homes would be linked
directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and
supervision.  That major centre could also provide services for those who are
mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the
most severely affected.\"  2010, Professor Emeritus (Psychology), Clinical Psychologist,  Paul Mc Donnell. 
 
 
The people of New Brunswick, including those with autism disorders and their families, have entrusted you with the great responsibility of being our premier. According to recent figures of the US CDC approximately  1 in 68  persons are estimated to have an autism spectrum disorder, a spectrum that encompasses many with varied, complex, challenging needs.  In the absence of Canadian data that estimate applied to New Brunswick's population of approximately 750,000 ( Canadian Census, 2011 ) means that approximately 11,000 New Brunswickers have an autism disorder.    
 
 
 
At present there is no autism specific residential care system in place for New Brunswick youth and adults.  There is no autism specific treatment system in place for those with tertiary level  care needs  who are older than the Stan Cassidy autism tream age cutoff of 15.   Instead we have exiled severely autistic adults to the Restigouche Psychiatric Hospital in Campbellton, to general hospital wards, to facilities outside the province of New Brunswick and on temporary bases at least to the gounds of a youth penitentiary and to hotel rooms under supervision.  Higher functioning autistic youth and adults currently reside in group homes and a variety of apartment, supervised living arrangements. 
 
 
 
In an email sent to you and the other party leaders June 14, 2014 I outlined these needs as I have done many, many times to the governments and leaders of the day since 2003.  Apart from Dominic Cardy and the NDP and David Coon and the Green Party few have ever responded in any meaningful sense beyond acknowledging receipt of my correspondence whether sent on behalf of my severely autistic now 18 year old son,  as a former president of the Autism Society New Brunswick or as a persistent advocate for autism services in New Brunswick over the last 15 years.  
 
 
 
The fact that we  have to resort to such a wide variety of inadequate and inappropriate living arrangements for those adults with severe autism disorders is compelling evidence of the need for a  system of autism group homes, for those with the necessary functioning capabilities  built around an adult autism residential care and treatment centre for those over the age of 15 with more severe autism challenges.  This system was described in a 2010 CBC interview with NB autism expert Professor Emeritus (Psychology) and Clinical Psychologist Paul McDonnel from which the quote above was excerpted: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Paul McDonnell, September 2010 
 
 
 
 
 
 \" Our greatest need at present is to develop services
for adolescents and adults.  What is needed is a
range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be
staffed with behaviourally trained supervisors and therapists. In the past
we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to
institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital
wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any
gains to the individual, the family or the community. 
 
 
 
 
 
 We need an   enhanced
group home system  throughout the province in which homes would be  linked
directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and
supervision.   That major centre could also provide services for those who are
mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the
most severely affected.   Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional
\"hospital\" model but should, itself, be integrated into the community
in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development. The
focus must be on education, positive living experiences, and individualized
curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and
staff.\"   ( Bold highlighting added - HLD ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 If a
 major autism centre is not developed to help enhance the group homes 
and provide permanent residential care and treatment for those with 
severe autism as Professor McDonnell has advised people with severe 
autism, including my wonderful, happy 18 year old son,  will continue to
 be sent to live  out their lives in Campbellton at the Regional 
Psychiatric Hospital. Apart from the  hospital character of that 
facility it is also located in a corner of the province 3 to 4 hours 
drive from most communities in New Brunswick and has no direct access to
 autism expertise.   The ASNB had previously polled our members on the desirable 
location for an autism centre and voted for Fredericton for several 
reasons, the two most critical being proximity to the autism expertise 
developed at UNB and the Stan Cassidy Centre, and the central location 
providing easier access for most families to their loved ones who would 
reside there temporarily and in some cases permanently. 
 
 
 For many , including my  18 year ol d son ,  who se  father also grows  older , time  is running out. Please  ask your ministers of  social developm ent  and h ealth ,   to  begin working on the development of the adult care sy stem described by Professor McDonnell. New Brunswick has already dev eloped, in response to parent advocacy , guided by  informed professional expertise , particularly Professor McDonnell, and  with the commitment s made by P remier Lord and Premier Graham,  developed an early  autism intervention system which has achieved recognition by  informed sources in the US and Canada.   
 
 New Brunswickers  have already proven we can do more than  cut down trees, dig up  rocks and sip hon gas  .... we can develop the intellectual and professional resources in a beautiful natural environment  to develop  new concepts for living  for those in need. We didn 't w ait for neigh boring provinces to show us what to do , we forged ahead with a  made in New Brunswick system of early autism intervention  and school autism education which , while it still  needs  more work and improv emen t, is far ahead of  many provinces in Canada and states in the US.   
 
 W e   can do the same for adult  autism care and I ask you , this time, as P remier  Elect for the Province of New Brunswick, to begin work on the cost effective, hu mane  system that will allow this father to k now my son  and others with mo derate to severe autism disorders will be able to live their l ives   in a secure, nourishing environment.    
 
 Respectfully, 
 
 
 
 
 
 Harold L Doherty

Autism in New Brunswick Under Conservatives?  I Am Worried, Very Worried
" "
 I am very worried that the gains made for autistic children and students and work done towards a modern, decent residential care and treatment system for autistic youths and adults will be lost  if  the Conservatives are elected.   
 On his facebook page Jody Carr, who will have a prominent role on disability issues if the Conservatives are elected,  has made it very clear that the Conservative era of community cliches will replace evidence based, reality based, services and accommodations for autistic children, youth and adults.   
 Even worse Mr. Carr had the gall and audacity to dismiss the recommendations of autism expert Dr. Paul McDonell for  a rational, professional, adequate autism residential care system with the political sound bite that his party would not \"send them away\".  Mr. Carr's memory seems to have failed him.  He was a Conservative MLA during the last term of the Bernard Lord government when  autistic youths and adults  were sent away  to Centracare even to hospital wards.   It was that same Conservative party, of which Mr. Carr, and Mr. Alward, were members that formed the government when an autistic youth was sent to live on the grounds of the Miramichi Youth correctional facility. The youth had not committed a crime. He had not even been charged with or suspected of having committed a crime.  He was autistic and had very serious challenges and there was nowhere in Mr Carr's community for him.  He was housed in a youth jail facility while awaiting export to decent residential care and treatment out of the country in Maine.  
 Jody Carr did not speak out against the jail grounds placement, inadequacy of the autism residential care system or the need to export an autistic youth as I did;  as reported in this 2005  Toronto Star article: 
 
 
   Autistic boy kept in New Brunswick jail 
 
 
 
 No other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital  No other place for him to stay 13-year-old must go to U.S. hospital 
The Toronto Star, KELLY TOUGHILL, ATLANTIC CANADA 
BUREAU, Oct. 19, 2005 HALIFAX—A 13-year-old autistic boy now living in a New Brunswick jail compound will be sent out of Canada because there is no home, hospital or institution that can handle him in his own province Provincial officials confirmed yesterday the boy is living in a visitor's apartment at the Miramichi Youth Centre and will be moved to a treatment centre in Maine by November. They stressed he is not under lock and key, has no contact with other inmates and is living outside the high wire fence that surrounds the youth detention centre.Nevertheless, the jailhouse placement and the transfer to Maine have outraged mental health advocates and opposition critics. \"They put this boy in a criminal facility because he is autistic,\" said Harold Doherty, a board member of the Autism Society of New Brunswick\"Now we are exporting our children because we can't care for them. This is Canada, not a Third World country.``We are supposed to have a decent standard of care for the sick and the vulnerable, but we don't.\"   Liberal MLA John Foran echoed his concern. \"This boy has done nothing wrong, is not the subject of any court order, but is in a penal institution.\" Provincial officials yesterday insisted critics are misrepresenting the nature of the boy's situation and that in fact the province has done everything it can to help him. \"This individual is not being held, and is not incarcerated,\" said Lori-Jean Johnson, spokeswoman for the family and community services department. \"He has housekeeping, bath and a separate entrance. We are just utilizing existing resources.\" Privacy laws prevent officials from discussing anything that would reveal the boy's identity, including details of his previous living situation and the whereabouts of his parents. This much is known: He suffers from a severe form of autism and is a ward of the state, under the guardianship of the minister of family and community services. He was living in a group home until recently, but became so violent that he was judged a danger to himself and others. At a psychologist's recommendation, he was moved to a three-bedroom apartment on the grounds of the Miramichi Youth Centre, a prison for about 50 young offenders. Two attendants from a private company watch the boy around the clock, at a cost to taxpayers of $700 a day. Johnson said she does not know any details of his care.  Doherty said the jailhouse placement and move to Maine highlight the desperate need for better services for autistic children in New Brunswick and across Canada. He said staff at most group homes in New Brunswick aren't trained to deal with autism and don't understand the disorder. \"If you don't understand autism, things can become very bad very quickly,\" said Doherty, who has a 9-year-old son with the disorder. \"We have been pushing for (better facilities) in New Brunswick for several years. This is not a crisis that has popped up in the last two days. Residential care is a critical element for these people and it is not being provided.\" Johnson said the provincial system of group homes and institutions that care for children and adults with psychiatric disorders and mental disabilities works for most people. \"We do have existing resources, but once in a while, there will be an exception. Here, we are looking at a very extreme case.\" The boy will be moved to an Augusta, Me., treatment centre at the end of the month, said Johnson. The centre, run by a non-profit group called Spurwink, specializes in dealing with autistic adolescents. A Spurwink representative did not return a phone call from the Toronto Star. Provincial officials could not detail the cost to keep the child at Spurwink, nor did they have information about why he's being sent to Maine, rather than a Canadian facility in another province 
 Jody Carr was a Conservative MLA at the time of the Toronto Star article and events described  therein. He is not mentioned or quoted in the article speaking about the youth's plight.  He did not at that time state that a Conservative government should not \" send them away \".  Jody Carr  was silent and did nothing to denounce decisions to send youths to prison facilities and to facilities out of the country when he sat as an MLA for the governing Conservatives. Now he had the nerve to dismiss the recommendations of an autism expert who has been intensely involved in helping autistic persons in NB and shaping the autism policies that have made NB a Canadian leader in providing preschool and school services for autistic children and youths with the political hack statement that his party would not send autistic adults away.  Jody Carr is contradicted by his past record when he said nothing while his party did indeed  send them away . 
 If you care about an autistic child, brother, sister, grandchild or other  family member or friend please do not vote Conservative on Monday.

Conor's Fredericton 2012 - Part II
" "
 
The Autism Society New Brunswick met on several occasions with senior civil servants during the administration of successive provincial governments to advocate for a modern residential care facility and system. The concept was to have a  facility located in Fredericton because of its central location and proximity to the autism expertise of  UNB, UNB-CEL and the Stan Cassidy Centre. The centre would provide an alternative to the general psychiatric hospital facilities at Centracare in Saint John and at the Regional Hospital in Campbellton.  The professional advisers at the centre could then provide services on as needed basis to group homes situated in local communities around the province for those with more moderate impairment levels.   
 
 
I have personally suggested that an additional reason for locating the central residential care and treatment facility in Fredericton  is Fredericton's outstanding natural environment.  So far, no luck. So far, immobility of thought and action have prevailed.  The ideological rigidity of the current Alward government  further preclude any development as described above and on the CBC web site by  Clinical Psychologist and UNB Professor Emeritus (Psychology) Paul McDonnell .  The years long frustration though will not prevent me from continuing to advocate and do not prevent our family from enjoying the natural wonder of Fredericton.

Dear Elected Representatives: New Brunswick Needs Adult Autism Residential Care and Treatment
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dear Hon. Premier Gallant, Deputy Premier Horsman,Speaker Collins,  Ministers, Party Leaders and Government Advisers: 
 
 
 
 Re New Brunswick's Lack of Adult Autism Care: 
 
 
 
 I am sure that you are all grappling with important issues in these weeks following a provincial election. Many issues have generated intense discussion and serious attention from all of our public leaders.  The issue of adult autism care however was not one of those issues. Neither the current governing Liberal Party nor the previously governing Conservative party mentioned autism in their platforms.  The Green Party did propose regional autism group homes which would certainly help those with autism spectrum disorders who suffer from light to moderately severe autism challenges .  Only the NDP recognized the need for an autism center in New Brunswick which could provide treatment and permanent residential care for those, like my son, with severe autism disorder, profound developmental delay (intellectual disability) and epileptic seizures the latter two conditions being commonly associated with severe autism disorders.   
 
 
 
 It is difficult to understand why our governing parties and their leadership have refused to take the steps necessary to help adults with autism lived decent, secure lives in New Brunswick. There can be no dispute about the need to address this issue.  In a province where the expressions \"community\" and \"inclusion\" are used like currency the approach to adult autism care has been to banish autistic youth and adults to the Regional Psychiatric Hospital in Campbellton on our northern border with Quebec and in some cases out of the province to the Spurwink facility in Maine.  It would be much more humane, and much more in keeping with the values that I believe all New Brunswickers share, to keep our autistic adults closer to home, closer to their families in group homes as suggested by the Green Party and in cases of greatest severity in an autism specific center as indicated in the NDP election platform.  
 
 
 
 New Brunswick has achieved international recognition for the steps it has taken in early intervention autism services, most recently in the  Summer 2014 Newsletter of the Association for Science in Autism Treatment  which interviewed Professor Emeritus (Psychology) and practicing clinical psychologist Paul McDonnell the intellectual architect of NB's autism model.  The newsletter interview mentions the role of parents in advocating for the establishment of the early autism model.  As one of those parents I can also confirm that we advocated with some success for the autism specific training of teacher/education aides and resource teachers to work with autistic students.  The development of the  program for training our educational resources has included a leading world expert in the area  Dr. Eric V. Larsson . 
 
 
 
  In addition to these resources NB also has the  Fredericton based Stan Cassidy Centre autism team which has been a critical tool in addressing the needs of autistic children and youth with tertiary care level challenges. Fredericton is also the home of the UNB-CEL autism intervention program which developed the autism program that trained most of NB's early intervention workers and school aides.  These successes can provide the base for development of a decent, humane and secure adult autism care system in New Brunswick.  It would  save money  currently being spent in Maine and live up to the community and inclusion cliches which sound so very good and which do reflect NB values; values which unfortunately have not prevailed in providing for adult autism care in NB. 
 
 
 
 Paul McDonnell Ph.D. is the person without whom the early and school year autism successes for which this province has been recognized would not have happened. In 2010 in a CBC interview he described the need for a NB adult autism care system and what such a system should look like: 
 
 
 
 \"What remains to be done? While we need to celebrate the achievements to date, we need to make a commitment to the needs of all families and all age groups. Our greatest need at present is to develop services for adolescents and adults. 
 
 
 
 What is needed is a range of residential and non-residential services and these services need to be staffed with behaviorally trained supervisors and therapists.  Some jurisdictions in the United States have outstanding facilities that are in part funded by the state and provide a range of opportunities for supervised and independent living for individuals with various disabilities .\" 
 
 
 
 We need an enhanced group home system throughout the province in which homes would be linked directly to a major centre that could provide ongoing training, leadership and supervision. That major centre could also provide services for those who are mildly affected as well as permanent residential care and treatment for the most severely affected. Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional \"hospital\" model but should, itself, be integrated into the community in a dymamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development. The focus must be on education, positive living experiences, and individualized curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and staff. 
 
 
 
When we, as parents guided by Prof. McDonnell's autism expertise, advocated for early intervention services there were many naysayers who opposed our efforts both within and outside government advisory circles even some in our autism community. They were wrong.  We succeeded and we will continue the fight for decent youth and adult autism care and treatment services in NB.   
 
 
 
We ask all public decision makers on all sides of the legislative aisles to now show the initiative and leadership to get this job done to extend NB's internationally recognized model to provide care for NB's autistic youth and adults. 
 
 
 
Respectfully, 
 
 
 
Harold L Doherty 
 
Conor's Dad

DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder: 3 Domains Become 2 and Exclude Intellectually Disabled
" "
 
 In the DSM-5 the new Autism Spectrum Disorder will, for the most part focus on those with Aspergers' and high functioing autism. The vast majority of those with Autistic Disorder who are also intellectually disabled will be excluded. This is clear from the wording used in the proposed new Autism Spectrum Disorder and in the wording of the new Intellectual Developmental Disorder.  That interpretation is also confirmed by the official rationale for the new ASD. 
 The new Autism Spectrum Disorder, as I have previously written, is misnamed. It would be much more accurately described as New Asperger's Spectrum Disorder.  The new version, which will be rubber stamped, on final review by the APA DSM-5 work groups, will exclude persons with intellectual disability as the current DSM-IV Asperger's criteria does and will remove language delay and general communication impairment also making the ASD consistent with DSM-IV Asperger's criteria.  In addition the DSM-5 ASD criteria make it clear that although the New ASD must be  present from infancy or early childhood it   may not be detected until later because of minimal social demands and support from parents or caregivers in early years.   This consideration helps those on the milder end of the current autism spectrum.   
 As an example my son who is severely affected by his Autistic Disorder and profound developmental delays was diagnosed at age 2 several months after we had begun to seek medical attention for his lack of development.  We knew nothing about autism but his lack of development was apparent and disconcerting. By contrast the media is full of stories of very high functioning persons, some of whom are now quite famous self appointed spokespersons on behalf of all persons with autism who were diagnosed as teens or adults. The  \"may not be detected until later\" qualifier helps ensure that the New ASD captures those with Asperger's and High Functioning Autism. 
 I have previously noted that the criteria for the  New ASD  also excludes those with intellectual disabilities. It does so  by: 
 1. Establishing 4 mandatory criteria  each of which MUST be met  before ASD will be diagnosed: 
 
 2. Excluding fulfillment of mandatory criterion A where that criterion can be accounted for by general developmental delay: 
 
 If a child has general deficits in communication it seems obvious that the general communication deficit will include social communication deficit.  The DSM-5's new  Intellectual Developmental Disorder  confirms this assertion in mandatory Criterion B which specifically states that deficits in general mental ability impair functioning in various areas including communication and social participation: 
 
 The   DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder rationale  also confirms the exclusionary effect of the new Autism Spectrum Disorded Mandatory Criterion A by explaining why 3 domains will be collapsed into 2: 
 
 The explanation does continue on but the first example highlights why the reduction from 3 domains to 2 confirms that DSM-5 ASD mandatory Criterion A will exclude the intellectually disabled. As the DSM-5 description of Intellectual Developmental Disorder states the deficits in general mental abilities will impair functioning by limiting and restricting participation and performance in daily life activities such as communication and social participation.  The rationale offered for the new ASD meanwhile states the obvious:   deficits in communication and social behaviors are inseparable .  
 When a person suffers from general mental deficits sufficient to meet an Intellectual Developmental Disorder diagnosis he/she will suffer impairment in communication and social interaction.  They are inseparable.  In any instance where a persons meets the IDD criteria they will not meet criterion A of the New ASD because their  persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction will be accounted for by general developmental delay.   
 The description  of the DSM-5's new Autism Spectrum Disorder's mandatory Criterion A and the description of the new Intellectual Developmental Disorder combine to exclude from an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis those who are intellectually disabled.  That interpretation is confirmed both by common sense and by the DSM-5 rationale for the new ASD.  3 domains become 2.  Deficits in communication and social behaviors are inseparable.  Those with IDD will suffer deficits in communication and social behavior and will be accounted for by their IDD diagnosis thus excluding them from an ASD diagnosis.  
 In the brave new world of the DSM-5, as in the mainstream media, as in Hollywood, as in autism research generally, the Intellectually Disabled will be excluded from the autism spectrum.

DSM-5 Autism Shell Game
" "
 WordNet Dictionary    
 Noun 1. shell game  -  a   swindling   sleight-of-hand   game ;  victim   guesses   which   of   three   things   a   pellet   is   under 
 Synonyms:   thimblerig 
 
The DSM-5 treatment of autism amounts to little more than a shell game with autism, which once referred essentially to autistic disorder being replaced with Asperger's Disorder.  Look at the description of A 09 Autism Spectrum Disorder in the DSM-5 which is referred to in the DSM-5 as a proposed revision for the DSM-IV Autistic Disorder: 
 
 
 A click on the DSM-5 A 09 Autism Spectrum Disorder tab for DSM-IV refers the reader to Autistic Disorder as set out in the DSM-IV leading one to think that the new Autism Spectrum Disorder is in fact just a modified version of the DSM-IV's Autistic Disorder: 
 
 The most obvious difference is in paragraph 2 which refers in the introductory line to qualitative impairments in communication. One of the sub-paragraphs which assists in fulfilling that requirement for meeting an Autistic Disorder is \"delay in or total lack of the development of spoken language\".  The narrowing of communication deficits from general communication deficits to social communication deficits is not just a revision, it is a re-definition of autistic disorder.  Removing this important characteristic from \"autism\" constitutes an essential change from Autistic Disorder, at least from the perspective of this father of a son with autistic disorder who has had both delays in language development and a lack of full language development.  
 
As can be seen in the DSM-IV description of Asperger's Disorder removing any reference to general language delay or development renders the new Autism Spectrum Disorder much more like the DSM-IV description of Asperger's Disorder which states in paragraph D that there is no clinically significant general delay in language. The only reference to language deficit in the new ASD is in the reference to social communication, a specific not general language deficits. Again, I am a humble parent and small town lawyer not an Ivy League educated psychologist or psychiatrist but I have to assume that language and general communication developments are among the most fundamental aspects of any human's development. To remove the general language and communication deficits from Autistic Disorder and substitute social communication deficits appears to me to be a straight forward substitution of Aspergers for Autistic Disorder in defining the New Autism Spectrum Disorder in the DSM-5. 
 
 Consistent with substitution of Asperger's Disorder for Autistic Disorder is the  exclusion of persons from Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis where the mandatory social communication and social interaction deficits required under criterion A are \"accounted for by general developmental delay\" . I have commented on this exclusion several times and I see no other reasonable interpretation of the exclusionary language in Criterion A of the new Autism Spectrum Disorder. Criterion A effectively brings to the DSM-5's new Autism Spectrum Disorder criteria D and E of the DSM-IV's Asperger's Disorder description ... no clinically signficant delay in language and no clinically signficant delay in cognitive development. 
 A reasonable interpretation of the DSM-5's new Autism Spectrum Disorder is that it essentially substitutes Asperger's Disorder for Autistic Disorder. Asperger's Disorder IS the New Autism Spectrum Disorder of the DSM-5.  The language of the DSM-5 which purports to show Autism Spectrum Disorder as a revision of the DSM-IV's Autistic Disorder is misleading, whether intentional or not, and it helps conceal  under which shell the \"autism pellet\",  in the new DSM-5 is located. The DSM-5 new Autism Spectrum Disorder is located under the DSM-IV's Asperger's Disorder.  
 The DSM-5's new Autism Spectrum Disorder is no more than a glorified shell game with low functioning, intellectually disabled autistic persons and their families the unwitting victims. The new Autism Spectrum Disorder would be more accurately described as Asperger's Spectrum Disorder with the  many severely affected, low functioning, intellectually disabled autistcs of the DSM-IV excluded ..

CDC Autism Expert: 40% of Persons with an Autism Spectrum Disorder Also Have an Intellectual Disability
" "
 I have commented on several occasions about the fact that many persons with Autistic Disorder also have Intellectual Disabilities. That fact is a reference to Autistic Disorder as it currently exists in the DSM-IV and excludes, by definition, the many persons with Aspergers Disorder one of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders now commonly referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders. I have pointed out that the Canadian Psychological Association has referenced studies indicating that 80% of persons with autism ... excluding Aspergers .... have an intellectual disability or cognitive deficit. I have pointed out that two surveys conducted by the CDC (2004 and 2006) indicated that 41-44% of persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders,  also have intellectual disabilities.   Since the Autism Spectrum includes all those with Aspergers who, by diagnostic definition are not intellectually disabled, the CPA and CDC  approximate figures are consistent: approximately  80%  of those with  Autistic Disorder  are intellectually disabled and approximately  40%  of those  on the entire \"spectrum\" of ASD's  are intellectually disabled.   
 The reactions by  SOME  persons with High Functioning Autism and Aspergers and  SOME  parents of children with  High  Functioning Autism and Aspergers  to this information have not always been polite.  Some have claimed that somehow my use of these reported facts is wrong although I have never seen a coherent explanation for that claim.  In a recent  interview   in the CMAJ  Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp , a medi cal epidemiologist at the CDC,  confirms  t he information set out above.  Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp commented on the expansion of the autism definition changes that have taken place since the 1980's: 
 \" But  the autism umbrella has since widened to include milder forms , says Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. For example, it now includes Asperger syndrome, where the sufferer is socially impaired, but experiences typical language development. 
 Another difference between past and present autism diagnosis involves the presence of intellectual disabilities, adds Yeargin-Allsopp.  During the 1960s and 1970s, the vast majority of those diagnosed with autism had an intellectual disability but today, only about 40% have one . \"    
 Autistic Disorder is the current diagnostic category (although that will be changed in the DSM-5) which would include those who would have been diagnosed with autism in the 1960's and 1970's.  That is the category where the vast majority as Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp states also have intellectual disability.  It is only the inclusion  in the   broad definition of \"autism\"   of Aspergers Disorders, which  by definition includes no one with intellectual disability, that lowers the percentage of persons with autism who also have an intellectual disability from the 80% figure to the 40% figure. Those with Autistic Disorder are still in the 80% range of \"co-morbidity\".  
 It is crystal clear that these authorities assert that 80% of persons with Autistic Disorder are also intellectually disabled. By pretending that these conditions are \"co-morbid\", unrelated, coincidental conditions we are ignoring the obvious relationship between them.  We are ignoring the fact that classic autistic disorder is a form of intellectual disability.  
 The fact that 80%, even an unspecified \"vast-majority\", of those with Autistic Disorder also have an intellectual disability  is not a coincidence.  It is time now to acknowledge that fact before the DSM-5 arrives to further expand the definition of autistic disorder and further  obscure  the harsher realities of autistic disorder as we know it today.

On World Autism Awareness Day Please Be Aware That Autism Is A Disorder
" "
 
 
 On  World Autism Awareness Day, April 2, remember that autism is a disorder or more accurately a group of disorders.  It is not just a different way of thinking, a way of life or a political career path for a media savvy high functioning University student with little  exposure to, or actual knowledge of the realities of  severe Autistic Disorder.   
 There are indeed many very high functioning persons with Aspergers and some high functioning persons with other \"autism\" disorders.  There are also many persons with Autistic Disorder and Intellectual Disability and others who are generally very low functioning, who will self injure, be at greater risk from the ordinary dangers of daily life, remain unemployed throughout their lives and live in the care of others in a variety of residential and institutional settings. These are facts.   
\"Autism\", or what is described as autism varies.  Autistic Disorder is currently shown in the DSM IV as one of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders: 
 
 
 299.00   Autistic Disorder (A) 
 total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): 
 
 
 
 qualitative impairment in social interaction , as manifested by at least two of the following: 
 
 
 
 (a) 
 marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
 (b) 
 failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level 
 (c) 
 a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
 (d) 
 lack of social or emotional reciprocity 
 
 
 
 
 qualitative impairments in communication  as manifested by at least one of the following: 
 
 
 
   
 (a) 
 delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gestures or mime) 
 (b) 
 in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
 (c) 
 stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language 
 (d) 
 lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level 
 
 
 
 
 
 restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities , as manifested by at least one of the following: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) 
 encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
 (b) 
 apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
 (c) 
 stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) 
 (d) 
 persistent preoccupation with parts of objects   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (B)     
 
 
 
 
 
 Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 (C) 
 
 
 
 
 
 The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder . 
 
As currently described Autistic Disorder is exactly what it says. It is a disorder.  Not a social movement, not a culture and not just a different way of looking at the world. 
 
On World Autism Awareness Day please be aware that autism is a disorder, one that impairs and restricts the lives of many persons who carry the diagnosis of Autistic Disorder and to some extent those that are diagnosed with other Pervasive Developmental Disorders.

Barely Autistic Spokespersons of the Alleged Autism Rights Movement Misrepresent Their Constituency
" "
How many of the spokespersons for the alleged Autism Rights Movement are actually autistic? At best it can be said that, to the extent that they share symptoms with persons with severe Autistic Disorder, they are barely autistic, and not representative of those with severe  Autistic Disorder and they have no right to speak on their behalf. There are several disorders on the spectrum of Pervasive Developmental Disorders.  As a group these are casually referred to as the Autism Spectrum of Disorders.  But they are in fact the PDD spectrum of disorders.  The five distinct disorders on the PDD Spectrum are described in the addendum following this comment. There are similarities, and differences, between the five disorders.  Many of the leaders of the so called Autism Rights Movement actually have diagnoses of Aspergers and tend to have far greater abilities to function in the real world then some people with Autistic Disorder.   While some of the alleged ARM actually go to college have friends and even intimate relationships, appear in Magazines and on television, and claim that \"we autistics\"  do not want to be cured,  NONE of the persons with severe Autistic Disorder are represented by  these elites. The high functioning leaders of the ARM have little in common with the autistic children who wander away from their homes, sometimes to be lost forever in deadly traffic or drowned in neighborhood pools. The high functioning leaders of the ARM have little in common with the adults with severe Autistic Disorder who live in the care of others in group homes or institutional settings.  They mispresent the nature of their movement when they pretend to speak on behalf of  persons with severe Autistic Disorder. The Five Types of PDD (1)  Autistic Disorder .  Autistic Disorder, sometimes referred to as  early infantile autism  or  childhood autism , is four times more common in boys than in girls. Children with Autistic Disorder have a  moderate to severe range of communication, socialization, and behavior problems .  Many children with autism also have mental retardation.  The DSM-IV criteria by which Autistic Disorder is diagnosed are presented below. Diagnostic Criteria for Autistic Disorder A. A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3):   (1) qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following:  (a) marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction (b) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level (c) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) (d) lack of social or emotional reciprocity    (2) qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following:  (a) delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) (b) in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others (c) stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language (d) lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level  (3) restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following:  (a) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus (b) apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals (c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) (d) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects  B. Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. C. The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. (APA, 1994, pp. 70-71) (Reprinted with permission from the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition. Copyright 1994 American Psychiatric Association.) (2)  Rett's Disorder . Rett's Disorder, also known as Rett Syndrome, is diagnosed primarily in females. In children with Rett's Disorder, development proceeds in an apparently normal fashion over the first 6 to 18 months at which point parents notice a change in their child's behavior and some regression or loss of abilities, especially in gross motor skills such as walking and moving. This is followed by an obvious loss in abilities such as speech, reasoning, and hand use. The repetition of certain meaningless gestures or movements is an important clue to diagnosing Rett's Disorder; these gestures typically consist of constant hand-wringing or hand-washing (Moeschler, Gibbs, & Graham 1990). The diagnostic criteria for Rett's Disorder as set forth in the DSM-IV appear below. Diagnostic Criteria for Rett's Disorder A. All of the following:  (1) apparently normal prenatal and perinatal development (2) apparently normal psychomotor development through the first 5 months after birth (3) normal head circumference at birth    B. Onset of all of the following after the period of normal development  (1) deceleration of head growth between ages 5 and 48 months (2) loss of previously acquired purposeful hand skills between ages 5 and 30 months with the subsequent development of stereotyped hand movements (e.g., hand-wringing or hand washing) (3) loss of social engagement early in the course (although often social interaction develops later) (4) appearance of poorly coordinated gait or trunk movements (5) severely impaired expressive and receptive language development with severe psychomotor retardation. (APA, 1994, pp. 72-73) (Reprinted with permission from the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition. Copyright 1994 American Psychiatric Association.) (3)  Childhood Disintegrative Disorder . Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, an extremely rare disorder, is a clearly apparent regression in multiple areas of functioning (such as the ability to move, bladder and bowel control, and social and language skills) following a period of at least 2 years of apparently normal development. By definition, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder can  only  be diagnosed if the symptoms are preceded by  at least  2 years of normal development and the onset of decline is prior to age 10 (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). DSM-IV criteria are presented below. Diagnostic Criteria for Childhood Disintegrative Disorder A. Apparently normal development for at least the first 2 years after birth as manifested by the presence of age-appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication, social relationships, play, and adaptive behavior. B. Clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills (before age 10 years) in at least two of the following areas:  (1) expressive or receptive language (2) social skills or adaptive behavior (3) bowel or bladder control (4) play (5) motor skills    C. Abnormalities of functioning in at least two of the following areas:  (1) qualitative impairment in social interaction (e.g., impairment in nonverbal behaviors, failure to develop peer relationships, lack of social or emotional reciprocity) (2) qualitative impairments in communication (e.g., delay or lack of spoken language, inability to initiate or sustain a conversation, stereotyped and repetitive use of language, lack of varied make-believe play) (3) restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, including motor stereotypes and mannerisms  D. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder or by Schizophrenia. (APA, 1994, pp. 74-75) (Reprinted with permission from the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition. Copyright 1994 American Psychiatric Association.) (4)  Asperger's Disorder . Asperger's Disorder, also referred to as Asperger's or Asperger's Syndrome, is a developmental disorder characterized by a lack of social skills; difficulty with social relationships; poor coordination and poor concentration; and a restricted range of interests, but  normal intelligence and adequate language skills in the areas of vocabulary and grammar . Asperger's Disorder appears to have a somewhat later onset than Autistic Disorder, or at least is recognized later. An individual with Asperger's Disorder does not possess a significant delay in language development; however, he or she may have difficulty understanding the subtleties used in conversation, such as irony and humor. Also, while many individuals with autism have mental retardation, a person with Asperger's possesses an average to above average intelligence (Autism Society of America, 1995). Asperger's is sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"high-functioning autism.\" The diagnostic criteria for Asperger's Disorder as set forth in the DSM-IV are presented below. Diagnostic Criteria for Asperger's Disorder A. Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following:  (1) marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction (2) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level (3) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) (4) lack of social or emotional reciprocity  B. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following:  (1) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus (2) apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals (3) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) (4) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects   C. The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. There is  no clinically significant general delay in language  (e.g., single word used by age 2 years, communicative phrases used by age 3 years). E. There is  no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or in the development of age-appropriate self-help skills, adaptive behavior (other than in social interaction), and curiosity about the environment in childhood. F. Criteria are not met for another specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder, or Schizophrenia. (APA, 1994, p. 77) (Reprinted with permission from the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition. Copyright 1994 American Psychiatric Association.) (5)  Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified . Children with PDDNOS either (a) do not fully meet the criteria of symptoms clinicians use to diagnose any of the four specific types of PDD above, and/or (b) do not have the  degree  of impairment described in any of the above four PDD specific types. According to the DSM-IV, this category should be used \"when there is a severe and pervasive impairment in the development of social interaction or verbal and nonverbal communication skills, or when stereotyped behavior, interests, and activities are present, but the criteria are not met for a specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Schizophrenia, Schizotypal Personality Disorder, or Avoidant Personality Disorder\" (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, pp. 77-78). autism

Asperger's is the New Autism: No Intellectually Disabled Allowed in the DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder
" "
 \"the autism umbrella has since widened to include milder forms, says Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, it now includes Asperger syndrome, where the sufferer is socially impaired, but experiences typical language development.  Another difference between past and present autism diagnosis involves the presence of intellectual disabilities, adds Yeargin-Allsopp. During the 1960s and 1970s, the vast majority of those diagnosed with autism had an intellectual disability but today, only about 40% have one.\" 
 Dr.  Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp,  Canadian Medical Association Journal ,CMAJ • July 13, 2010; 182 (10). First published June 7, 2010; doi:10.1503/cmaj.109-3274   
 
 
Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp's description of the diminution of autism's vast majority, those with intellectual disability, is noteworthy today as we await the commencement of the DSM-5 era and the complete elimination from any autism diagnosis of persons with intellectual disabilities. That accomplishment will be achieved by the DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder definition and diagnostic criteria which expressly exclude an ASD diagnosis in instances of general developmental delay: 
 
 The New Autism Spectrum Disorder in the DSM-5 will eliminate any debates over the exent of intellectual disability amongst those with autism spectrum disorders.  The new definition will complete the process begun in the DSM-IV of diminishing the rates of ID amongst those with autism by changing the definition of autism to exclude those with intellectual disability.   The formula is simple and straight forward.  To be diagnosed with autism a person must meet all 4 criteria, A, B, C and D.  Criteria A requires the presence of \" persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts,  not accounted for by general developmental delays \".   If a person suffers from \"general developmental delay\" that will account for persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts and the person will not meet the mandatory Criterion A and will not  receive an autism spectrum diagnosis under the new DSM-5. 
 General developmental delays is a reference to the DSM-5 diagnostic category of Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD) which is described as including a current intellectual deficit and a deficit in adaptive functioning.  IDD is further described in two of the mandatory criteria for meeting and IDD diagnosis  as including deficits in general mental abilities. IDD mandatory criterion B refers expressly to impaired functioning in areas of daily life including communication and social participation.  An IDD diagnosis then would account for deficits in social communicaiton and social interaction and preclude an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis under the DSM-5 
 
  The exclusion of an autism diagnosis for persons who are generally developmentally delayed is a substantive change from the DSM-IV  which did not exclude an Autistic Disorder diagnosis in persons who suffered from  general developmental delay, intellectual disability or mental retardation: 
 
 The exclusion of persons with Intellectual Developmental Disorders from the New Autism Spectrum Disorder does have a precedent in the DSM-IV.  It is found in the  DSM-IV's Asperger's Disorder  which states in Criterion E that \" there is no  clinically significant delay in cognitive development or in the development of age-appropriate self-help skills \".  And there it is \"no cognitive development delay\" from the DSM-IV Asperger's Disorder criteria becomes not accounted for by general developmental delay in the DSM-5's Autism Spectrum Disorder.   Asperger's becomes the New Autism in DSM-5 World. 
Autism Speaks has long been aware of the APA intention to remove persons with intellectual disability from consideration for autism spectrum disorder diagnoses. Autism Speaks rarely mentions intellectual disability as an autism concern.   It has already been busy presenting Asperger's to the public as Autism  with the promotion of the careers and influence of John Elder Robison and Alex Plank.  
 
 Autism Speaks also helped fund the Korean \"autism\" prevalence study of Roy Richard Grinker who has been busy recasting Asperger's as autism and who went looking for \"autism\" amongst Korean students who functioned well in Korea's highly structured school environments.  No intellectually disabled were included amongst Grinker's findings of  large numbers of previously unknown autistics.  Of course Professor Grinker, the APA and \" Autism Without Intellectual Disability Speaks \" will have to readjust their autism prevalence numbers once the DSM-5 officially takes effect.  They will have to revise their autism rates downward to reflect the removal of persons with DSM-IV Autistic Disorder and intellectual disability from the DSM-5's Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Asperger's is the New Autism.

Confirmation DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder Will Exclude Intellectually Disabled
" "
 
 I have written previously that persons who presently have autistic disorder or PDD-NOS and who are also  intellectually disabled will be removed from the DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder . Whereas those with intellectual disability once constituted  autism's vast majority  as described by CDC autism expert Dr.  Marshalyn   Yeargin-Allsopp the 1994 addition of Asperger's Disorder reduced their numerical weight on the autism spectrum.  With the new DSM-5 wording has intentionally been added to the definition of autism to exclude persons with intellectual disability from autism diagnoses.  To be diagnosed with autism a person must meet all 4 criteria, A, B, C and D.  Criteria A requires the presence of \" persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts, not accounted for by general developmental delays.\"   Now, an email exchange between Lisa Jo Rudy of  About.com autism spectrum disorders  and Dr. Bryan King of the APA's DSM-5's Neurodevelopmental Work Group confirms that the effect of the DSM's New ASD will be to exclude at least some persons with intellectual disability from an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis: 
 
 
 \" My Question for Dr. King 
 There seems to be a desire to remove people with \"Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts, not accounted for by general developmental delays\" from the ASD category. Does this mean that a child with Mental Retardation (also called Intellectual Delays) no longer qualify for an Autism Spectrum diagnosis? Would that person wind up dually diagnosed with Intellectual Development Disorder and social communication disorder rather than with an ASD diagnosis? 
 
 His Response 
 There is no explicit desire , however, by creating more specificity we believe that people may be given diagnoses that better capture their individual conditions. The qualifier above about general developmental delays ensures that the social communication deficits are more specific, and also potentially allows for earlier diagnosis if appropriate. 
 Just as typically developing infants and toddlers are able to engage in very rich social communication and interaction across contexts, appropriate to their developmental level, so too most individuals with intellectual delays or disabilities are also able to communicate. On the other hand, significant deficits in social communication in toddlers may suggest the presence of autism. What the criterion above is meant to ensure is that clinicians take into account what is typical in terms of social communication abilities at a given age or developmental level, and not assume, for example, that a lack of social perception in a teenager with intellectual disability not automatically suggest the presence of autism. As is currently the case, some individuals with Down Syndrome may also meet criteria for autism; but most will not .\" 
 
 
 There may or may not be an \" explicit desire    to move anyone in to or out of specific diagnostic group s\"  but the wording is being added intentionally to achieve a specific result and it is clear that the intended result is that social communication deficits be more specific that is .... not part of social communication deficits arising in cases of general developmental delay. 
 
The DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder will add more persons on the high functioning Asperger's end of the spectrum and will reduce the numbers at the lower intellectually disabled end of the spectrum. The vast majority of the original autism described by Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsoop has been given the boot, kicked off the autism spectrum entirely, or nearly entirely. 
 
There will be no Intellectually Disabled allowed on the DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum.

DSM-5 Autism: Globe & Mail Ignores Invisible Intellectually Disabled Autistics, Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp's Vast Majority
" "
 
 
Canada's Globe & Mail is late to the discussion, once again, of major autism issues. This time,  Parents of autistic kids fear diagnostic changes will mean reduced services ,  the Globe is parroting the concerns of the major US corporate media over the possible impact of the DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder on persons with Asperger's and High Functioning Autism.  Like the US corporate media the Globe simply ignores the probable impact, on intellectually disabled autistic persons of the express exclusionary language of Mandatory Criterion A of the New Autism Spectrum Disorder.  
 
Mandatory Criterion A of the New Autism Spectrum Disorder states: 
 
 
 Autism Spectrum Disorder 
 Must  meet criteria A, B, C, and D: A.     Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction  across contexts,  not accounted for by general developmental delays , and manifest by all 3 of the following: 1.     Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity; ranging from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back and forth conversation through reduced sharing of interests, emotions, and affect and response to total lack of initiation of social interaction, 2.     Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction; ranging from poorly integrated- verbal and nonverbal communication, through abnormalities in eye contact and body-language, or deficits in understanding and use of nonverbal communication, to total lack of facial expression or gestures. 3.     Deficits in developing and maintaining relationships, appropriate to developmental level (beyond those with caregivers); ranging from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit different social contexts through difficulties in sharing imaginative play and  in making friends  to an apparent absence of interest in people. 
 The highlighted expression will exclude some from an autistm diagnosis where Criterion A can be  accounted for by  general development delay .  General developmental delay is not a separate category in the DSM-5 at least not under that title. It is found under the diagnosis  Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD): 
 A 00 Intellectual Developmental Disorder Proposed  Revision 
 Rationale 
 Severity 
 DSM-IV 
 Updated July 5, 2011 
 Intellectual Developmental Disorder is a disorder that includes both a current intellectual deficit and a deficit in adaptive functioning with onset during the developmental period. All three of the following criteria must be met. A.         Intellectual Developmental Disorder is characterized by deficits in general mental abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning and learning from experience. Intellectual Developmental Disorder requires  a current intellectual deficit of approximately 2 or more standard deviations in Intelligence Quotient (IQ) below the population mean for a person’s age and cultural group, which is typically an IQ score of approximately 70 or below, measured on an individualized, standardized, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound test.               AND B.         The  deficits in general mental abilities impair functioning in  comparison to a person’s age and cultural group by limiting and restricting participation and performance in one or more aspects of daily life activities, such as  communication, social participation,  functioning at school or at work, or personal independence at home or in community settings. The limitations result in the need for ongoing support at school, work, or independent life. Thus,  Intellectual Developmental Disorder also requires a significant impairment in adaptive functioning . Typically, adaptive behavior is measured using individualized, standardized, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound tests.              AND C.         Onset during the developmental period .   (Underlined dark bold highlighting added - HLD)  
 Impairment in communication and social participation will support a diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disorder. A person with Intellectual Developmental  Disorder and deficits in social participation and communication will  by definition have those deficits accounted for by his/her IDD and will be excluded from an autism diagnosis by operation of the exclusionary wording in Mandatory Criterion A of the DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder.   
 None of the spokespersons for the DSM-5 Neurodevelopmental Workgroup Committee have explained how these two provisions can exist in the DSM-5 without excluding  intellectually disabled persons from an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis.  To the contrary Dr. Catherine Lord has already  confessed  a clear intent on the committee's part to exclude from an autism diagnosis those with intellectual disabilities.  
 The Globe & Mail, in fairness, is not a frequent reporting source on autism disorders.  It is probably just following the corporate media trend in the US ... ignoring those described by CDC autism expert Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp as the  vast majority  of those diagnosed with DSM-IV Autistic Disorder (AD) ... those with AD and intellectual disabilities.

More Confirmation of Targeted Exclusion of Intellectually Disabled from DSM5 Autism Spectrum Disorder: But NO ONE CARES
" "
 
 
 
 
 
Emily Singer has published an article at SFARI,  Proposed guidelines won't miss autism cases, study says , which appears to suggest that persons who would meet DSM-IV PDD-NOS and Asperger's will \"only\" be reduced by approximately 10% under DSM5 criteria. The focus, as always, is on the HF end of the spectrum with no mention made of the intellectually disabled who will be excluded under the wording of mandatory criterion A of the DSM5. \" We didn't see any evidence that there would be dramatically lower diagnosis of people with Asperger's or PDD-NOS ,\" says Lord.\" 
 
Catherine Lord has previously confessed that the real targets for exclusion from the DSM5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder are the intellectually disabled: 
 
 
 
 - \" Catherine Lord, the director of the Institute for Brain Development at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and a member of the committee overseeing the [DSM-5 autism] revisions, said that the goal was to ensure that autism was not used as a “fallback diagnosis” for children whose primary trait might be, for instance, an intellectual disability or aggression.\"  [Bracketed terms added for context - HLD] 
 
 - Dr. Catherine Lord, as reported by NYT reporter, Amy Harmon,  A Specialists’ Debate on Autism Has Many Worried Observers , New York Times, January 20, 2012 
 
 
Persons with ID represented \" the vast majority \" of persons with autistic disorder according to CDC autism expert Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp. The DSM-IV addition of PDD-NOS and Aspergers reduced that figure to 41-44% according to recent CDC surveys.  The DSM5 exclusion under Criteria A for social communication even where  EVEN if all Critera A categories are otherwise exhibited will result in a further significant reduction in numbers of person with autism and ID. And that is the real aim of the DSM5 as Catherine Lord again confesses as reported in the Singer/SFARI article: 
 
 
 
\" Lord and her colleagues found that the DSM-5 is as sensitive as the DSM-IV, meaning it accurately identifies those who have autism. The DSM-5 criteria also have better specificity than those in the DSM-IV, meaning they can better distinguish between people who have autism and those who have other developmental disorders, the study found. \" 
 
 
 
As set out above the real targets for exclusion from the autism spectrum under the DSM5 autism do-over are the intellectually disabled who are targeted by the addition of the \" not accounted for by general developmental delay \" disqualifying criterion in mandatory criterion A. Studies by J Matson have confirmed that substantial numbers, as many as 35.5%, of intellectually disabled who would meet DSM-IV autism criteria, will be excluded under the DSM5 criteria.  
 
 
 
In the DSM5 the evolution of autism into Aspergers continues with the targeting for exclusion of the intellectually disabled. But no one cares. Not Dr. Lord,  not Dr. Geraldine Dawson of Autism Speaks whose organisation has expressed concern over the possible impact of the DSM autism do-over on those at the HF end of the spectrum but not on the intellectually disabled. Not the New York Times and other major media who have worried over the possible HF exclusions.   The exclusion of some HF is possible, the exclusion of many LF intellectually disabled is certain but apparently no one cares about the intellectually disabled and the impact this exclusion will have on them.

Autistic Disorder's Twin, Intellectual Disability, In The DSM5

 I have posted several times about  the high \"co-morbidity\" relationship between intellectual disability and autistic disorder (not autism spectrum disorder).   The Canadian Psychological Association 2006 Canadian Senate Brief indicated that 80% of persons with autism (exclusive of Aspergers) have an intellectual disability.  Two CDC surveys indicated that 44% and 41% of persons with an autism spectrum disorder have an intellectual disability. Since the autism spectrum includes Aspergers and persons who, by definition, do not have an intellectual disability the CPA and CDC figures appear to be fairly consistent.  With such a high number of persons with classic autism or autistic disorder having an intellectual disability it is shocking that very little is mentioned about the relationship between intellectual disability and classic autism.  The stigma associated with intellectual disability is so strong that the relationship is either ignored or outright disavowed.  
 For those who are ashamed of the large intellectually disabled segment of the classic autism population no information about intellectual disability and its role in autism will be allowed to breach the walls protecting their romanticized view of autism.  For those who are more intellectually honest though I thought it would be helpful to post the  DSM 5 definition of mental retardation which will now officially be called intellectual disability .

Congratulations \"Dr.\" Catherine Lord! APA's DSM5 Autism Targeted Exclusion of Intellectually Disabled Passed December 1, 2012.
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
The American Psychiatric Association's passage of the DSM5 and its New Autism Spectrum Disorder was passed Saturday  December 1, 2012  without any of the mainstream media taking noting of the real targets, the real victims of the new Autism definition: the intellectually disabled. The media continues the narrative of Amy Harmon and the powerful New York Times that raised concerns about the exclusion of Asperger's at the High Functioning end of the spectrum but ignored, as media and health care professionals so often do, the targeted exclusion of those with severe intellectual disabilities from the autism spectrum even where those ID's are accompanied by EVERY SINGLE CRITERION listed in the new ASD.  
 
 
 
It is true that Asperger's is now formally forced into the same spectrum as  persons with lower functioning autism and that the name disappears but with the removal of those with Intellectual Disability what remains is essentially Asperger's under the autism label. There is no substantial difference between the DSM-IV Asperger's and the DSM5 Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Both criteria are notable  for  the exclusion of those with intellectual disability.  In the DSM-IV persons with intellectual disability and autism were excluded from an Asperger's diagnosis but included in autism.  In the DSM5 those with Asperger's are rolled into autism but the severely intellectually disabled are forced out.  The ID'd are included in a separate intellectually disabled category but that does nothing to bring attention to address their autism symptoms. They are now excluded by the only targeted exclusion of the DSM5 Autism Spectrum Disorder: 
 
 
 
 \" \" Autism Spectrum Disorder 
 
 
 
 Must meet criteria A, B, C, and D: 
 
 
 
 A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts,  not accounted for by general developmental delays , and manifest by all 3 of the following: \" 
 
 
 
Dr. Catherine Lord leader of the APA team that redefines and streamlines autism to exclude those with severe intellectual disability confessed that very fact in the interview with the New York Times' Amy Harmon: 
 
 
 
 
 
 \" Catherine Lord,  the director of the Institute for Brain Development at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and a member of the committee overseeing the [DSM-5 autism] revisions,  said that   the goal was to ensure that autism was not used as a “fallback diagnosis” for children whose primary trait might be, for instance, an intellectual disability  or aggression.\"  [Bracketed terms added for context - HLD] 
 - Dr. Catherine Lord, as reported by NYT reporter, Amy Harmon,  A Specialists’ Debate on Autism Has Many Worried Observers , New York Times, January 20, 2012 
 
 
 
 In the DSM5 the APA is taking another giant step in its process of streamlining autism by excluding the intellectually disabled element of what is in fact a  pervasive  developmental disorder or grouping of symptoms. It is redefining autism, a grouping of symptoms which included intellectual disability in many cases, to remove it from that grouping.  Intellectual Disability is in fact present in the majority of cases of DSM-IV Autistic Disorder, the only specifically designated \"autism\" in the DSM-IV which also represents the classic, original autism: 
 
 
 
 
 
 \" the autism umbrella has since widened to include milder forms , says Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. For example,  it now includes Asperger syndrome, where the sufferer is socially impaired, but experiences typical language development. Another difference between past and present autism diagnosis involves the presence of intellectual disabilities,  adds Yeargin-Allsopp .   During the 1960s and 1970s,   the vast majority of those diagnosed with autism had an intellectual disability   but today, only about 40% have one . \" 
 
 CDC Autism Expert Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp 
 
 
 
 The 40% figure is for the entire autism spectrum, inclusive of those with Asperger Syndrome who are by definition not intellectually disabled.  It is in the original classic autistic disorder where the ID'd constituted the vast majority, estimated by the Canadian Psychological Association in its 2006 brief to a Canadian Senate committee as approximately 80% of those with autistic disorder. 
 
 The language of the new DSM5 autism clearly targets the exclusion of the intellectually disabled.  Catherine Lord acknowledge that the exclusion is intentional.  La Malfa, in one study concluded that the relationship should be explored, not ignored, as the DSM5 aims to do.   
 
 One possible reason for the exclusion is that autism research has often as Dr. Catherine Lord herself has acknowledged, tended to exclude the intellectually disabled as participants in autism studies:   
 
 \"\" However,  research in ASD  has tended to use overwhelmingly White, middle to upper middle class samples, and  has often excluded children with  multiple disabilities and/or  severe to profound intellectual disabilities \".  [underlining added - HLD] 
 
 Social Policy Report, Autism Spectrum Disorders Diagnosis, Prevalence, and Services for Children and Families 
 
 This trend has probably been enhanced by the use of technology like MRI's that are difficult, very difficult, to use with those who are severely intellectually disabled.  As a parent I have to confront that reality right now in terms of examinations of my son arising from his recent Grand Mal seizure.  Unlike parents, researchers aiming to get grant money and complete autism studies can ignore the realities presented by those with autism and severe and profound intellectual disabilities.   
 
 The great accomplishment of the DSM5 Autism Spectrum Disorder redefinition of autism will be to legitimize the exclusion of those with severe intellectual disability from autism research.   
 
 Congratulations APA! Congratulations \"Dr\" Catherine Lord!

Catherine Lord Confesses: DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder Intended To Exclude Intellectually Disabled
" "
 
 \"Catherine Lord, the director of the Institute for Brain Development at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and a member of the committee overseeing the  [DSM-5 autism]  revisions, said that the goal was to ensure that autism was not used as a “fallback diagnosis” for children whose primary trait might be, for instance, an intellectual disability or aggression.\"  [Bracketed terms added for context - HLD] 
 - Dr. Catherine Lord, as reported by NYT High Functioning Autism/Asperger's reporter, Amy Harmon,  A Specialists’ Debate on Autism Has Many Worried Observers , New York Times, January 20, 2012 
 The above reference to, and quote of, Dr. Catherine's Lord about the DSM-5 committee's intent to exclude intellectually disabled from further autism diagnosis was important journalism by Amy Harmon even if it was simply an inadvertent by product of her exploration of HFA and Asperger's in the DSM-5's New Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Ms Harmon has shown considerable interest in HFA and Asperger`s while largely ignoring those severely affected by autism disorders.  To here credit her article about worried observers relates primarily to those high functioning groups but did cough up the above confession by Dr. Lord.  Ms Harmon consistent with her slant towards covering High Functioning Autism  then moved on and glossed over the admission by Dr. Lord.  In Amy Harmon World as in Dr. Catherine Lord`s DSM-5 the intellectually disabled just don`t count and will be excluded from the Brave New Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
 To my knowledge I am one of the first, and few, persons to comment on the intentional exclusion of the intellectually disabled from the autism spectrum in the DSM-5; despite their historical presence on the \"spectrum\"` as a  vast majority  of those with classic Autistic Disorder. One person who pursued my concerns was Lisa Jo Rudy, then of the  About.com autism  site, who obtained the following information from Dr. Bryan King of the APA's DSM-5's Neurodevelopmental Work Group: 
 
 \" My Question for Dr. King 
 
 
 There seems to be a desire to remove people with \"Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts, not accounted for by general developmental delays\" from the ASD category. Does this mean that a child with Mental Retardation (also called Intellectual Delays) no longer qualify for an Autism Spectrum diagnosis? Would that person wind up dually diagnosed with Intellectual Development Disorder and social communication disorder rather than with an ASD diagnosis? 
 
 
 His Response 
 
 
 There is no explicit desire , however, by creating more specificity we believe that people may be given diagnoses that better capture their individual conditions. The qualifier above about general developmental delays ensures that the social communication deficits are more specific, and also potentially allows for earlier diagnosis if appropriate. 
 
 
 Just as typically developing infants and toddlers are able to engage in very rich social communication and interaction across contexts, appropriate to their developmental level, so too most individuals with intellectual delays or disabilities are also able to communicate. On the other hand, significant deficits in social communication in toddlers may suggest the presence of autism. What the criterion above is meant to ensure is that clinicians take into account what is typical in terms of social communication abilities at a given age or developmental level, and not assume, for example, that a lack of social perception in a teenager with intellectual disability not automatically suggest the presence of autism. As is currently the case, some individuals with Down Syndrome may also meet criteria for autism; but most will not. \" 
 
When I read Dr. King`s reply to Lisa`s question I was skeptical. I had difficulty rationalizing his answer with the express wording of mandatory criterion A of the DSM-5`s new Autism Spectrum Disorder which requires the presence of \" persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts, not accounted for by general developmental delays \" 
 
Dr. King stated that it was not the DSM-5 committees`s intent that children with mental retardation (now to be known as Intellectual Developmental Disorder) would be disqualified from receiving an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis.  Dr. Catherine Lord`s appears to say exactly the opposite.  Dr. Catherine Lord takes issue with the Volkmar data base and study that has prompted the current fears over exclusion of persons with HFA and Asperger`s from a DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis.  
 
Dr. Lord is undoubtedly correct and Amy Harmon and the New York Times need not worry.  The DSM-5 targets for exclusion from the new ASD diagnoses are not those with HFA and Asperger`s.  Those who will be excluded are the invisible autistics who are not featured in the NYT or in Hollywood movies.

"21199" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/02/11/coming-soon-the-dsm-v-no-more-pdd-nos-no-more-asperger/" "Coming soon, the DSM-V.  No more “PDD-NOS”, no more “Asperger”" "Yes, a new version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) is in the works.  You’ve probably heard “DSM-IV” or read it a number of times.  It is the manual used to describe the various “mental disorders” and the criteria for diagnosing them.  ( Pervasive Developmental Disorders or PDD’ s are described there.  These include Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger Syndrome, Rett Syndrome and Childhood disintegrative disorder.  If the proposed changes go into place, all that will be left is Autism Spectrum Disorder. It isn’t that people with diagnoses of Asperger or PDD-NOS will no longer will no longer be recognized as having a diagnosis.  It is just that the diagnosis name will be replaced with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Here is  are the proposed DSM-V criteria  for Autism Spectrum Disorder (299.00) Autism Spectrum Disorder 
 Must meet criteria 1, 2, and 3: 
 1.  Clinically significant, persistent deficits in social communication and interactions, as manifest by all of the following: 
 a.  Marked deficits in nonverbal and verbal communication used for social interaction: 
 b.  Lack of social reciprocity; 
 c.  Failure to develop and maintain peer relationships appropriate to developmental level 
 2.  Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least TWO of the following: 
 a.  Stereotyped motor or verbal behaviors, or unusual sensory behaviors 
 b.  Excessive adherence to routines and ritualized patterns of behavior 
 c.  Restricted, fixated interests 
 3.  Symptoms must be present in early childhood (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities) Compare this to the DSM-IV criteria 299.00 Autistic Disorder 
    1. A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): 
         1. Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
               1. marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction. 
               2. failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level 
               3. a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
               4. lack of social or emotional reciprocity 
         2. Qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
               1. delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) 
               2. in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
               3. stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language 
               4. lack of varied spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level 
         3. Restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least of one of the following: 
               1. encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
               2. apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
               3. stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g. hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole body movements) 
               4. persistent preoccupation with parts of objects 
   2. Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. 
   3. The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett’s disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder. For a good discussion, there is  an op-ed piece  in the New York Times by Prof. Roy Richard Grinker.  Prof. Grinker discusses about how the separate category of Asperger Syndrome really is not necessary in today’s culture.  The reduced stigma attached to Autism makes it less helpful to have a separate name for “less severe” autism. Professor Grinker was also interviewed for the United States’ National Public Radio.  You can  read  or  listen  on their site. Autistic Disorder, PDD-NOS, Asperger Syndrome and Childhood Disintigrative Disorder will all be a part of the new “Autism Spectrum Disorder”.  Rett Syndrome will not be in the DSM-V at all. One thing this will change is access to services–or possibly.  For example, the State of California has “autism” as an eligibility category in the Department of Developmental Disabilities.  This was put in place before the DSM-IV and the diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome was used.  The state has interpreted the law to mean that only Autistic Disorder is a qualifying diagnosis, denying people with PDD-NOS and Asperger diagnoses unless they meet the criteria for the “other category”.  This has put pressure to diagnose “Autistic Disorder” over PDD or AS. Given the current budget crisis in the State of California, it isn’t as though having a diagnosis of “autism” is a key to great services anyway. That all said, it will be interesting to hear the discussion of this change.  One point that is interesting is the removal of the age 3 limit.  Before, there had to be onset of symptoms before age 3.  Now it is a more general statement: “Symptoms must be present in early childhood”.  I find it interesting that the lack of imaginary play statement is gone as well. The DSM is not a checklist. In the end, it will be the diagnostic instruments like the ADOS that will determine whether someone qualifies for a diagnosis.  I wonder how they will modify these instruments?  The “imaginary play” requirement seems to be in the ADOS as it stands now, with the birthday party section for example.

"21039" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/01/28/proposed-dsm5-autism-diagnostic-criteria-made-public/" "Proposed DSM5 autism diagnostic criteria made public" "Below is the proposed  DSM5 revision to the diagnostic criteria for autism. 
Autism Spectrum Disorder 
 Must meet criteria A, B, C, and D: 
 A.    Persistent deficits in social communication and social 
interaction across contexts, not accounted for by general 
developmental delays, and manifest by all 3 of the following: 
 1.     Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity; ranging from abnormal 
social approach and failure of normal back and forth conversation 
through reduced sharing of interests, emotions, and affect and 
response to total lack of initiation of social interaction, 
 2.     Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social 
interaction; ranging from poorly integrated- verbal and nonverbal 
communication, through abnormalities in eye contact and body-language, 
or deficits in understanding and use of nonverbal communication, to 
total lack of facial expression or gestures. 
 3.     Deficits in developing and maintaining relationships, 
appropriate to developmental level (beyond those with caregivers); 
ranging from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit different social 
contexts through difficulties in sharing imaginative play and  in 
making friends  to an apparent absence of interest in people 
 B.    Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or 
activities as manifested by at least two of  the following: 
 1.     Stereotyped or repetitive speech, motor movements, or use of 
objects; (such as simple motor stereotypies, echolalia, repetitive use 
of objects, or idiosyncratic phrases). 
 2.     Excessive adherence to routines, ritualized patterns of verbal 
or nonverbal behavior, or excessive resistance to change; (such as 
motoric rituals, insistence on same route or food, repetitive 
questioning or extreme distress at small changes). 
 3.     Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in 
intensity or focus; (such as strong attachment to or preoccupation 
with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative 
interests). 
 4.     Hyper-or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest 
in sensory aspects of environment; (such as apparent indifference to 
pain/heat/cold, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, 
excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights or 
spinning objects). 
 C.    Symptoms must be present in early childhood (but may not become 
fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities) 
 D.         Symptoms together limit and impair everyday functioning.
 They have also added a section discussing the  rationale  for the revision: New name for category, autism spectrum disorder, which includes autistic disorder (autism), Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.  
     * Differentiation of autism spectrum disorder from typical development and other “nonspectrum” disorders is done reliably and with validity; while distinctions among disorders have been found to be inconsistent over time, variable across sites and often associated with severity, language level or intelligence rather than features of the disorder. 
    * Because autism is defined by a common set of behaviors, it is best represented as a single diagnostic category that is adapted to the individual’s clinical presentation by inclusion of clinical specifiers (e.g., severity, verbal abilities and others) and associated features (e.g., known genetic disorders, epilepsy, intellectual disability and others.) A single spectrum disorder is a better reflection of the state of knowledge about pathology and clinical presentation; previously, the criteria were equivalent to trying to “cleave meatloaf at the joints”.  
 Three domains become two: 
 1)     Social/communication deficits 
 2)     Fixated interests and repetitive behaviors 
     * Deficits in communication and social behaviors are inseparable and more accurately considered as a single set of symptoms with contextual and environmental specificities 
    * Delays in language are not unique nor universal in ASD and are more accurately considered as a factor that influences the clinical symptoms of ASD, rather than defining the ASD diagnosis 
    * Requiring both criteria to be completely fulfilled improves specificity of diagnosis without impairing sensitivity 
    * Providing examples for subdomains for a range of chronological ages and language levels increases sensitivity across severity levels from mild to more severe, while maintaining specificity with just two domains 
    * Decision based on literature review, expert consultations, and workgroup discussions; confirmed by the results of secondary analyses of data from CPEA and STAART, University of Michigan, Simons Simplex Collection databases  
 Several social/communication criteria were merged and streamlined to clarify diagnostic requirements. 
     * In DSM-IV, multiple criteria assess same symptom and therefore carry excessive weight in making diagnosis 
    * Merging social and communication domains requires new approach to criteria 
    * Secondary data analyses were conducted on social/communication symptoms to determine most sensitive and specific clusters of symptoms and criteria descriptions for a range of ages and language levels 
 Requiring two symptom manifestations for repetitive behavior and fixated interests improves specificity of the criterion without significant decrements in sensitivity. The necessity for multiple sources of information including skilled clinical observation and reports from parents/caregivers/teachers is highlighted by the need to meet a higher proportion of criteria. 
 The presence, via clinical observation and caregiver report, of a history of fixated interests, routines or rituals and repetitive behaviors considerably increases the stability of autism spectrum diagnoses over time and the differentiation between ASD and other disorders. 
 Reorganization of subdomains increases clarity and continues to provide adequate sensitivity while improving specificity through provision of examples from different age ranges and language levels. 
 Unusual sensory behaviors are explicitly included within a sudomain of stereotyped motor and verbal behaviors, expanding the specfication of different behaviors that can be coded within this domain, with examples particularly relevant for younger children 
 Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder and must be present from infancy or early childhood, but may not be detected until later because of minimal social demands and support from parents or caregivers in early years. And a “severity” scale : Severity Level for ASD 
 Level 3 ‘Requiring very substantial support’ 
 Social Communication 
Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause severe impairments in functioning; very limited initiation of social interactions and minimal response to social overtures from others.   
 Restricted interests & repetitive behaviors 
 Preoccupations, fixated rituals and/or repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres.  Marked distress when rituals or routines are interrupted; very difficult to redirect from fixated interest or returns to it quickly. 
 Level 2 ‘Requiring substantial support’ 
 Social Communication 
Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions and reduced or abnormal response to social overtures from others. 
 Restricted interests & repetitive behaviors 
RRBs and/or preoccupations or fixated interests appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts.  Distress or frustration is apparent when RRB’s are interrupted; difficult to redirect from fixated interest. 
 Level 1 ‘Requiring support’ 
 Social Communication 
Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments.  Has difficulty initiating social interactions and demonstrates clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others.  May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions.  
 Restricted interests & repetitive behaviors 
Rituals and repetitive behaviors (RRB’s) cause significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts.  Resists attempts by others to interrupt RRB’s or to be redirected from fixated interest.

Asperger's Spectrum Disorder in the DSM-5: Why the Concealment?
" "
 One of the great DSM-5 puzzles to this father of a severely autistic son is the use of the label Autism Spectrum Disorder to describe what appears to be little more than a tweaked version of the DSM-IV's Asperger's Disorder.  The APA's DSM-5 team has replaced Autism with Aspergers, removed the most seriously intellectually disabled to the General Developmental Disorder category and further diluted the requirements for an autism diagnosis. Why not be open and transparent about the Aspergers substitution for Autism and the removal of the intellectually disabled from the Autism category? 
 
 
The APA has purportedly merged the three Pervasive Developmental Disorders into one Autism Spectrum Disorder.  It would appear to be much more accurate though to refer to the new combined disorder as Asperger's Spectrum Disorder.  There is no signficant difference between the DSM-IV Aspergers Disorder and the DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder. The DSM-5 converts autism into Asperger's by: 1)  Collapsing   three requirements for an autistic disorder into two  for the DSM-5's new \"Autism\" Spectrum Disorder. The two categories are the two main requirements for a DSM-IV Asperger's Disorder diagnosis: qualitative impairment in social interaction and restrictive, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities.  The spoken language deficits  of the DSM-IV'S communication category are subsumed under social communication eliminating spoken language impairment in itself as a diagnostic feature of autism. 
 
 2)  Precluding an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis for persons with Intellectual Disabilities.  Mandatory Criterion A in the DSM-5's brave new Autism Spectrum Disorder which precludes an ASD diagnosis where accounted for by \"general developmental delays\" which is the DSM-5 diagnostic terminology for Intellectual Disability. Mandatory Criterion A's.   The Asperger's Spectrum Disorder masquerading as Autism Spectrum Disorder will accomplish three things: 
 
 1) It will further impair \"autism\" research. The 1994 DSM-IV autism changes are still being used to explain dramatic increases in autism diagnoses. The 2013 DSM-5 changes could permanently impair our understanding of autism causes and increases. This will prevent any serious epidemiological based research into possible environmental causes including substances, air, drugs, diet and water supplies, vaccines and vaccine ingredients,  affecting the pre-natal environment. 
 2) It could reduce public service costs for children with autism disorders by removing the most challenging cases of autism disorders: very low functioning intellectually disabled autistic children. The possible expansion on the other end of the Asperger's Spectrum may offset this reduction or may be affected by more serious emphasis on impairment of daily functioning levels in the DSM-5 era. 
 3) Legitimization of claims by very high functioning persons with current autism disorder and Asperger's diagnoses to speak on behalf of those most severely affected by autism.  The Neurodiversity movement is based for the most part on persons from this group and tends to be very supportive of efforts to  resist any serious environmental focused autism research including vaccine autism research. 
 The DSM-5 debates currently raging, spearheaded by Dr. Allen Frances,  will have no impact on the Asperger's (Autism) Spectrum Disorder category in the DSM-5. It is a  fait accompli . Current autism research tends to exclude, for matters of convenience of the researchers involved, use of severely autistic study participants. The mainstream media reports serious tragic incidents involving the severely autistic but its features invariably focus on high functioning autistic\Asperger's\savant success stories.  
 When looking at challenges the mainstream media tends at most to look at the social awkwardness of those with HFA\Asperger's. The recent Amy Harmon NYT \"navigating love\" feature is the perfect example of this aspect of MSM representation of autism.  
 
 Asperger's Spectrum Disorder is already with us; having unofficially taken over the  Autism label. Why the APA feels the need to officially hide that fact in the DSM-5 is puzzling.

Invisible Autistics: Intellectual Disability and the CDC's New Autism Figures
" "
 
 co·mor·bid·i·ty   (k môr-b d -t )   
 n. 
 A concomitant but unrelated pathological or disease process. 
 
 medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com 
 
 Intellectual Disability is rarely mentioned in public discussions of autism spectrum disorders.   It is sometimes mentioned dismissively as a co-morbid condition ,  an unrelated condition which coincidentally occurs in some cases of autism. In fact Autistic Disorder and Intellectual Disability also known as Mental Retardation and Cognitive Impairment, are just different aspects of the- same disorder. 
 
 Intellectual Disability is also hidden from public view by a mainstream media (CBC, CNN, the New Yorker, Time, Newsweek etc) that like to focus on the feel good stories with features about persons with Aspergers and High Functioning Autism,  all very intelligent people who communicate very well.  What the \"feel good about autism\" mainstream media don't like to do is actually visit institutions where some severely autistic persons live out their lives.  What the mainstream media does not like to do is present to the world the truth about the severely autistic , the Intellectually Disabled reality,  of Autistic Disorder.   
 
 Professionals don't expressly mention Intellectual Disability as a factor in diagnosing autism disorders. High functioning autistic persons and persons with Aspergers for whom \"autism\" is a way of life, something to belong to, don't like to associate themselves with Intellectual Disability.  They prefer to associate autism, and thereby themselves, with Einstein, Van Gogh,  Mozart and every other historical figure of exceptional talent or ability. 
 
 All these groups scarcely mention autism and intellectual disability in the same breath and when they do they refer to autism as an occasionally coexisting but unrelated condition.  All are  hiding  the truth. All are  obliterating from public understanding of autism disorders the reality that autism, as in actual Autistic Disorder, and Intellectual Disability,  also know as mental retardation, or cognitive impairment, are in fact related aspects of Autistic Disorder. 
 
 Intellectual disability, mental retardation or cognitive impairment, are not listed as express diagnostic features in the DSM definition of autism disorders although it is mentioned by implication in the definition of Aspergers disorder. 
 no significant delay in language development 
 no significant delay in  cognitive development , self-help skills or  adaptive behaviors  (other than social interaction)  
 
 The reason the DSM found it necessary to mention that there must be an  absence of any delay in cognitive development and language development before an Aspergers Disorder diagnosis can be made is that  so many persons with Autistic Disorders in fact have serious intellectual and communication  deficits. It is these factors which distinguish Aspergers from Autistic Disorder. 
 
When an Ari Ne'eman or an Alex Plank purport to speak on behalf of autistic people and say We Don't Want to be Cured they are speaking on behalf of people who often have severe intellectual and language difficulties  that persons with Aspergers do not share.  They want to speak on behalf of these people because they identify with the word \"autism\" but they don't want to be associated with Intellectual Disability, Cognitive Impairment or Mental Retardation. 
 
 
 
 The number of persons with Autistic Disorder and Intellectual Disability  is extremely high.  They are far too high for the two conditions to be characterized as separate, coincidental, unrelated disorders.  This is clear from the recent  CDC autism prevalence report  which reported that between  29.3 to 51.2%  of children with  Autism Spectrum Disorders  also had an  Intellectual Disability : 
 
 \" 2006 
 
 
 From 29.3% (Colorado) to 51.2% (South Carolina) (overall average: 41.0 %) of the children identified with an ASD also had an intellectual disability (an IQ ≤70, at the sites that had test results on intellectual ability for at 
least 75% of the children identified) .\" 
    
 The range of 29.3 to 51.2% refers to children with Autism Spectrum Disabilities who also had an Intellectual Disabilty defined as IQ less than 70%. The ASD includes children with Aspergers Disorder who, by definition, do not have intellectual disabilities.   If  children with Aspergers are excluded  from the calculation then it is likely that children with actual Autistic Disorder and Intellectual Disabilities will range somewhere from 60% to 100%.  
 
 As startling as that last estimate may sound it is consistent with previous estimates of the number of persons with Autistic Disorder and mental retardation, intellectual disability or cognitive impairment.  The Canadian Psychological Association in its autism brief to the Canadian Senate Committee examining autism issues,  Autism Brief to the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology November 9, 2006 , stated that the number of persons with autism (Autistic Disorder) and Intellectual Disabilities (Cognitive Impairment) was 80% : 
 
 \"Cognitive impairment is present in about 80% of persons diagnosed with Autism and general intellectual functioning is most often below average. Persons diagnosed with Asperger’s Disorder have average to above average intellectual functioning.\" 
 
The CPA 2006 estimate that 80% of persons with Autism (Autistic Disorder) also have intellectual disabilities is consistent with the  new CDC range of estimated intellectual disabilities of persons with ASD which, once adjusted by removing Aspergers Disorder, places the CPA estimate right in the middle of the CDC range of 60-100%. 
 
 It is time to end the prejudice against autistic persons with intellectual disability. It is time to end the intellectual dishonesty of pretending that it is just a coincidence that so many persons with Autistic Disorder also have Intellectual Disabilities. It is time to stop treating persons with Autistic Disorder like invisible autistics.  Their intellectual disability is part of their autistic disorder, a very serious, disabling part which makes their lives much different than the high functioning media stars who wrongly pretend to speak on their behalf.   
 
It is time to stop hiding the truth about autistic disorder and intellectual disability. It is time to start including the Invisible Autistics, the intellectually disabled persons with severe Autistic Disorder, in public discussions of \"autism\".

Will Criteria D Actually Be Required in Diagnosing the New Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1?
" "
 
 In order for the New Autism Spectrum Disorder to be diagnosed pursuant to the DSM-5, Criteria A, B, C, and D must all be met.  That is what the DSM-5 says according to the dsm5.org web site.  But will Criteria D, Symptoms together limit and impair everyday functioning actually be present in practice?  Or will psychiatrists and psychologists diagnose Level 1 Autism Spectrum Disorder without any real limit or impairment in everyday functioning? 
 I had previously asked if any of the well known, apparently very high functioning persons with autism or Asperger's Disorder would lose their diagnoses under the new criteria.  The other side of the coin, of course, is the possibility that Criteria D will not be required in practice.   
 I have met persons with Aspergers who clearly have limitations in everyday functioning and I am not suggesting that anyone with Aspergers could not really meet a limited and impaired everyday functioning test.  There are, however, some very successful persons with a high functioning autism or Aspergers disorder who do not have any obvious limit or impairment including some who can function in high level government, legal and media settings. Presumably everyday functioning is an everyday, common sense, criterion. But how some of these people were diagnosed with an ASD even under the current DSM-IV criteria is beyond my understanding as a layperson. Given the careers that some have built as spokespersons for the autism community, will public pressure  be exerted for professionals to go easy on Criteria D in diagnosing the New Autism Spectrum Disorder? 
 Will Critieria D actually be required in practice in diagnosing the New Autism Spectrum Disorder under the DSM-5?  I guess the answer will be found in future prevalence studies and debates.

Autism Disorders  and Intellectual Disability:  Sources #1
" "
 The term comorbid is used to deny that there is any relationship between Autism Disorders, particularly Autistic Disorder and Intellectual Disability. The Neurodiversity ideological movement disdains any mention of Intellectual Disability in connection with \"Autism\" which is romanticized and its reality as a mental disorder downplayed. \"Autism\" research is routinely conducted using participants with Aspergers and HFA, those with Autistic Disorder and Intellectual Disability are excluded.  
 The DSM-5 will continue the process of separating Intellectual Disability  from Autistic Disorder without any apparent regard  as to whether an imporant  element of autism disorders ... the relationship between ID and Autistic Disorder will be ignored to the possible long term detriment to persons with Autistic Disorder and ID and to  our understanding of \"autism\" and Intellectual Disabilities.  Following are some starting sources for consideration of this important  issue.  
 
     Autism and intellectual disability: a study of prevalence on a sample of the Italian population. La Malfa G ,  Lassi S ,  Bertelli M ,  Salvini R ,  Placidi GF . Psychiatry  Unit, Department of Neurological and Psychiatric Sciences, University  of Florence, Hospital of Careggi, Florence, Italy.  gplamalfa@videosoft.it Abstract BACKGROUND:  In  1994, the American Association on Mental Retardation with the DSM-IV  has come to a final definition of pervasive developmental disorders  (PDD), in agreement with the ICD-10. Prevalence of PDD in the general  population is 0.1-0.15% according to the DSM-IV. PDD are more frequent  in people with severe intellectual disability (ID). There is a strict  relationship between ID and autism: 40% of people with ID also present a  PDD, on the other hand, nearly 70% of people with PDD also have ID. We  believe that in Italy PDD are underestimated because there is no  agreement about the classification system and diagnostic instruments. 
 
 METHOD:  Our  aim is to assess the prevalence of PDD in the Italian population with  ID. The Scale of Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Mentally Retarded  Persons (PDD-MRS) seems to be a very good instrument for classifying and  diagnosing PDD. 
 
 RESULTS:  The  application of the PDD-MRS and a clinical review of every individual  case on a sample of 166 Italian people with ID raised the prevalence of  PDD in this population from 7.8% to 39.2%. 
 
 CONCLUSIONS:  The  study confirms the relationship between ID and autism  and suggests a  new approach in the study of ID in order to elaborate a new integrated  model for people with ID. 
 
 
 
 Canadian Psychological Association Autism Brief to the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology November 9, 2006 
 Definition:  Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder, first identified by Kanner in 1943. Decades later, Autism came to be viewed as the more severe of the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) which also include Asperger’s Disorder. ASD is a heterogeneous disorder that includes a range of developmental impairments in the areas of social skills, verbal and non-verbal communication as well as restricted or repetitive interests or behaviours. 
 
 Symptoms and Impairments: 
 
 • Cognitive impairment is present in about 80% of persons diagnosed with Autism and 
 general intellectual functioning is most often below average . Persons diagnosed with 
Asperger’s Disorder have average to above average intellectual functioning. 
 
 
 
 CDC Medical Epidemiologist Dr. Marshalynn Yeargin-Allsopp -  CMAJ Interview  
 
 
 \" But   the autism umbrella has since widened to include milder forms , says Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. For example, it now includes Asperger syndrome, where the sufferer is socially impaired, but experiences typical language development. Another difference between past and present autism diagnosis involves the presence of intellectual disabilities, adds Yeargin-Allsopp.   During the 1960s and 1970s, the vast majority of those diagnosed with autism had an intellectual disability but today, only about 40% have one . \" 
 [Note: Dr. Yeargin-Allsopp's figure of \"about 40% with an ID is for the entire Autism Spectrum and is lowered because of the inclusion of Aspergers which, as a diagnosis, excludes ID] 
 
 
 
 
 Department of Health & Human Services - Center for Disease Control   Counting Autism  
 
 
 CDC’s   most recent data   show that between one in 80 and one in 240 children with an average of one in 110 have an ASD. This is a prevalence of about one percent of children. These results reflect data collected by CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network in multiple communities throughout the U.S. in 2006.   
 
 
 Estimates are based on health and education records from participating communities, which includes eight percent of the U.S. population of eight year olds. All children in the studies were eight years old because previous research has shown that most children with an ASD have been identified by this age for services. 
 
 ... 
 
 Cognitive Functioning (from the pdf version) 
 
2004   From 37.9% (Arizona) to 63% (Alabama) ( overall average: 43.8 %) of the children identified with an ASD also had an intellectual disability   (an IQ ≤70, at the sites that had test results on intellectual ability for at least 75% of the children identified). 
2006 
  From 29.3% (Colorado) to 51.2% (South Carolina)   (overall average: 41.0 %) of the children identified with an ASD also had an intellectual disability   (an IQ ≤70 , at the sites that had test reults on intellectual ability for at least 75% of the children identified) 
 The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders World Health Organization, Geneva, 1992 
 
 F84.0 Childhood Autism 
 
 
 A pervasive developmental disorder defined by the presence of abnormal and/or impaired development that is manifest before the age of 3 years, and by the characteristic type of abnormal functioning in all three areas of social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviour. The disorder occurs in boys three to four times more often than in girls.   
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 All levels of IQ can occur in association with autism, but   there is significant mental retardation in some three-quarters of cases.   
 
 
 F84.1 Atypical Autism 
 
 
 A pervasive developmental disorder that differs from autism in terms either of age of onset or of failure to fulfil all three sets of diagnostic criteria. Thus, abnormal and/or impaired development becomes manifest for the first time only after age 3 years; and/or there are insufficient demonstrable abnormalities in one or two of the three areas of psychopathology required for the diagnosis of autism (namely, reciprocal social interactions, communication, and restrictive, stereotyped, repetitive behaviour) in spite of characteristic abnormalities in the other area(s).   Atypical autism arises most often in profoundly retarded individuals   whose very low level of functioning provides little scope for exhibition of the specific deviant behaviours required for the diagnosis of autism; it also occurs in individuals with a severe specific developmental disorder of receptive language. Atypical autism thus constitutes a meaningfully separate condition from autism.   
 Includes: 
 * atypical childhood psychosis 
 *   mental retardation   with autistic features

DSM-5 Sweeps Intellectual Disability Under the Autism Rug

 The DSM-5 revisions to what will now be officially known as the Autism Spectrum Disorders are not without merit.  The American Psychiatric Association's     DSM-V Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group April 2009 Report    emphasizes for the first time that there are different degrees of severity on the autism \"spectrum\" of disorders.  That is a good thing, one that many parents of severely autistic children will appreciate as the public consumes movie after movie about brilliant, talented persons with High Functioning Autism and Aspergers.  
 Having handed out that token of recognition of reality at the severe end of the autism spectrum, however, the Report then goes on to take it back by intentionally hiding the fact that approximately 80% of persons with what are currently known as Autistic Disorder also have  intellectual disabilities  or cognitive impairments.  It is true that intellectual disability and cognitive impairment do not receive much overt recognition in the current edition of the DSM but they are there in the description of Aspergers Disorder: 
 290.80 Asperger's Disorder   
 
   (E) 
 
 There is  no clinically significant delay in cognitive development  or in the development of  age-appropriate self-help skills ,  adaptive behavior  (other than in social interaction), and curiosity about the environment in childhood. 
 The description of Asperger's Disorder in the current DSM-IV results in a division between Aspergers and Autistic Disorder based on cognitive delays.  This division is not expressly mentioned at all in the proposed DSM-5.  But the 80% of persons with Autistic Disorder and intellectual disabilities or cognitive impairment will still be there ... hidden without any express mention in the severe ASD category.  There just won't be any  mention of  intellectual disabilities  and autism in polite company ... in the New Yorker Magazine ... in Hollywood movies ...  in society generally ... or in the Autism Spectrum Disorders category of the  DSM-5. 
 
 
 The Report also appears to broaden the Autism Spectrum,  yet again, at the high functioning end of the spectrum, by including a category called  Subclinical AS Symptoms  and, in what could have been drawn directly from a Neurodiversity ideological manual, a category called  Normal Variation . 
 
 The Subclinical category expressly states that the category is comprised of persons with no significant interference or impairment while the Normal Variation simply refers to socially isolated or \"awkward\".   There is no explanation why such categories are included in a description of neurodevelopment  disorders   if there is no significant interference or impairment; if they are just normal variations of behavior.  
 The DSM-5 removes any express reference to intellectual disability or cognitive impairment and adds new sub-clinical categories of high functioning persons with no significant impairment or interference. Autism,  once a neuro-developmental disorder as set out in the DSM-III,  will become increasingly seen as a  mild condition full of Temple Grandins, Ari Ne'emans and Alex Planks and a host of talented and quirky historical geniuses.   
 The DSM-5 has succumbed to Neurodiversity ideology, Hollywood movies and a form of  discrimination by omission against the most severely affected by autism disorders - those with  intellectual disabilities  requiring the most attention and assistance.  They are the invisible autistics, the ghosts of the new Autism Spectrum of Disorders about whom the DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorders category will make no mention. 
 The DSM-5 may become a useful tool ... at concealing the reality that intellectual disability and cognitive impairment are more than just co-morbid conditions associated with autism in some instances ... they are part of what it means to be severely autistic. Unfortunately the DSM-5 Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group has chosen to sweep intellectual disability and cognitive impairment under the Autism Spectrum Disorder carpet.

ThreeLac Or How Biomed Is Getting Out Of Hand
" "
ThreeLac is an alternative treatment for candida/yeast/fungal infections which seems to be receiving considerable attention as a biomed autism treatment thanks to Jenny McCarthy. I wouldn't be surprised if it soon overshadows other treatments currently in vogue, such as Chelation Therapy or Me-B12 injections. ThreeLac is unproven, of course. There are no published studies on its effectiveness as it relates to any condition, never mind autism. However, there is one \"study\" underway which purports to demonstrate its effectiveness as an autism treatment. I'm not going to link to its web page but it's easy to find if you're interested. It is not a controlled study, as you can imagine. It's reminiscent of the uncontrolled work  Amy Holmes  did in the early days of Chelation Therapy for autism. In any such uncontrolled \"studies\", you will find that the children \"improve\", some markedly. I would go as far as to say, frankly, that non-controlled treatment studies are worse than useless in autism for reasons that should be well known by now. What caught my attention about the ThreeLack \"study\" was the \"existing supplement routine prior to and during the study.\" It's jaw-dropping. The following is a selected list of existing supplements taken by some of the children in the study. Child #2: Magnetic clay baths finished, transdermal DMPS – ongoing. Other supplements: H.

Parent's comments: \"She was off ThreeLac and all supplements completely for 8 weeks, and her diarrhea (of > 1yr) never returned. She also showed no regression and her behavior is that of a recovered autistic child (no behavioral symptoms). She is now able to tolerate moderate amounts of sugar, and we just started her on 1 packet/day maintenance and the rest of her supplements ½ dose. I think she's completely normal except for needing to stay on the diet and supplements. She still has a bit of a speech delay, but improved so much that it doesn't get in her way of making friends. She's one of the friendliest kids in her class. If you were to observe the class and guess which one is autistic, you probably wouldn't guess (my daughter). She's 90% potty trained.\" Child #12: TD-DMPS ongoing.

Other supplements: Transfer Factor Advanced, Trace Mins, Pic Mins, Zinc Picolinate, Vit E with Tocotrienols, Evening Primrose oil, Black Currant, CoQ-10, Cod liver oil, Eskimo oil, Magnesium Malate, L-Tyrosine, D-Plex, Customized Amino Acids, Selenium, Biotin-8, B Complex #3, MB-12, Melatonin, 5HTP, GABA, Buffered C Powder, Calcium C, Taurine, Multi Vit Pro Support. Parent's comments: \"Fine motor skills 50% improved. He is almost 100% toilet trained (90% improved).\" Child #16: Clay baths – ongoing. Other supplements: AFP-Peptizyde, B-12 shot, Black Currant Oil, Carnosine, Cod Liver Oil, Custom Amino Acid Base, DMG w/Folinic Acid, D-Plex, EFA, Epsom S Cream, Eskimo-3 Oil, Hydrosoluble CoQ-10, L-Carnitine, L-Glutamine, Lipoceutical Glutathinoe, L-Methionine, Lycopene, Magnesium Malate, Micel-A, NAC N-Acetyl-Cysteine, No Fenol, Nu-Thera/Everyday Companion, Pantethine, Pic-Mins, Super Nu-Thera, Taurine, Vital-10, Vitamin E w/ Tocotrienols, Zinc, Zinc Monomethionine, Zyme Prime. Parent's comments: \"He went from being mostly non-verbal to a \"chatter box.\" He enjoys talking and singing.

Parent's comments: \"She has always been a \"chatter box.\" We have seen amazing changes in her as well. On her annual IQ tests she scored 39 points higher than last year... and 49 points on the other IQ test. If she was reevaluated today, the psychologist expects that she would lose her diagnosis.\" Damn. I hope the reason most children in the study take so many supplements is because the study self-selects for curebie parents. Additionally, I hope these kids make it through all that. This reminds me of a supplement soup JB Handley was giving his kid, but I couldn't find the link to that.

Overview of Chelation Agents
" "
From the Schafer Autism Report: Chelation Agents  Some pros and cons in three of the most commonly used chelating agents in autistic children:       DMSA Sodium 2,3 dimercaptopropane- 1 sulfate In the oral form, approved by the FDA for treating lead poisoning in children as young as 1. It can remove a wide range of metals, including lead and mercury. Long- term use can potentially cause bonemarrow suppression or liver damage. It strips zinc, a beneficial mineral, and supplements may be needed. It can cause gastrointestinal problems to worsen.       DMPS 2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid It causes fewer gastrointestinal problems than other agents and may be more effective at eliminating mercury than DMSA. It now comes in a cream form, which is easier to use. DMPS is not FDA-approved although physicians can have it individually compounded for patients. It has potentially serious side effects and blood and urine need to be regularly monitored.       TTFD Thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide In studies, it had a good safety record. In a small study of 10 children on the autism spectrum, most improved clinically. It comes in cream form. It is not approved by the FDA, although physicians can have it individually compounded for patients. It has a strong odor described as \"skunklike\" even in cream form, and has a bad taste in powdered form making it difficult to give to children who cannot swallow a capsule.

"21076" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/10/14/fda-chelation-not-proven-safe-or-effective-in-treating-autism/" "FDA: Chelation not proven safe or effective in treating autism" "Chelation is a process whereby metals are removed from the body using a drug, a chemical which binds to the metals and allows them to be excreted.  Because of the incorrect notion that autism is caused by mercury or is a “novel” form of mercury poisoning, chelation is one of the more common alternative medical therapies applied to autistics. The FDA has recently issued a warning to many of those who market unapproved chelators.  Two articles appear on the FDA website today: FDA Tightens Reins on Unapproved ‘Chelation’ Drugs and a press release FDA issues warnings to marketers of unapproved ‘chelation’ products . They have also issued a printer-friendly pdf:  FDA chelation warning pdf From that pdf: Federal regulators are warning eight companies to stop selling so called ‘chelation’ products that claim to treat a range of disorders from autism to Alzheimer’s disease by removing toxic metals from the body. 
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the companies have not proven their products are safe and effective in treating autism spectrum disorder, cardiovascular disease, macular degeneration, Parkinson’s disease or any other serious illness. Some of the companies also claim their products can detect the presence of heavy metals in the body in an attempt to justify the need for chelation therapy. The groups that have been warned are: 
• World Health Products, LLC: Detoxamin 
Oral, Detoxamin Suppositories, and the 
Metal Detector test kit 
• Hormonal Health, LLC and World Health 
Products, LLC: Kelatox Suppositories, 
and the METALDETECTOR Instant Toxic

• Dr. Rhonda Henry: Cardio I wonder how the FDA chose these groups for the first round of warnings.  I also wonder if/when there will be more warning letters. Also from the FDA pdf: FDA says consumers should avoid nonprescription products offered for chelation or detoxification. FDA-approved chelating agents are available by prescription only and are approved for use in specific indications such as the treatment of lead poisoning and iron overload. The agency says even the prescription medications carry significant risks, and they should only be used with medical supervision. I don’t know why the FDA has taken so long to step in and take action.  Chelation has been going on for years, and has never had a sound basis in science or even a good rationalization for the treatment of autism. Trine Tsuderous has an article on the Los Angeles Times website,  FDA warns about treatments for autism, heart disease .

"21895" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/08/13/chelation-challenge-testing-not-scientific-not-beneficial-may-be-harmful/" "Chelation challenge testing: not scientific, not beneficial, may be harmful" "Who knows about the toxic effects of mercury?  Toxicologists.  The premier toxicology group in the U.S, the  American College of Medical Toxicologists ,  represents the doctors who test and treat people suffering from real heavy metal poisoning. By contrast, many doctors have added chelation to their treatment options due to the false theory that autism is caused by heavy metal poisoning (specifically, mercury).   These alternative-medicine practitioners usually depend on non-standard test to “prove” heavy metal poisoning.   The favorite seems to be the “challenge” chelation test.  In this test, a chelator is given to a person before a urine test.  Chelators are chemicals which bind to metals in the body and allow them to be excreted more easily.  Thus, if you give a chelator to a person, you expect their urine to show higher levels of heavy metals. This has been discussed on this blog and elsewhere for a long time.    And now the American College of Medical Toxicologists has come out with an  official position statement . The practice is not scientific.  There are no reference values for post-challenge urine metal testing.  There is no correlation between actual metal exposure and post-challenge test results.   It is, therefore, the position of the American College of Medical Toxicology that post-challenge urinary metal testing has not been scientifically validated, has no demonstrated benefit, and may be harmful when applied in the assessment and treatment of patients in whom there is concern for metal poisoning. It’s time for post challenge urine testing to end.  It is time for chelation as a “treatment” for autism to end.  It is time for those who promoted the “autism is mercury poisoning” theory to step forward and admit their mistakes.

 FDA:  Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS): Product as consumed produces a potent bleach  
 
 
 FDA warned consumers not to consume or use Miracle Mineral Solution, an oral liquid solution also known as \"Miracle Mineral Supplement\" or \"MMS.\" The product, when used as directed, produces an industrial bleach that can cause serious harm to health. The product instructs consumers to mix the 28 percent sodium chlorite solution with an acid such as citrus juice. This mixture produces chlorine dioxide, a potent bleach used for stripping textiles and industrial water treatment. High oral doses of this bleach, such as those recommended in the labeling, can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms of severe dehydration. 
 RECOMMENDATIONS : Consumers who have MMS should  stop using it immediately and throw it away . The FDA advises consumers who have experienced any negative side effects from MMS to consult a health care professional as soon as possible.

"20985" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/07/12/boyd-haley-discusses-osr-1-in-the-lexington-harold-leader/" "Boyd Haley discusses OSR #1 in the Lexington Harald-Leader" "As noted here on LeftBrainRightBrain , OSR #1 is currently under scrutiny by the FDA.  Our post followed a report by the Chicago Tribune,  FDA warns maker of product used as alternative autism treatment . OSR stands for Oxidative Stress Relief.  It is a chemical invented at the University of Kentucky for chelating soil from mining operations.  It was originally discussed at autism parent conferences as a chelator, but the focus has changed to “oxidative stress relief” over time.  It has not been marketed, to my knowledge, by CTI Science for its chelator properties. Today, Mr. Boyd Haley, who has been marketing OSR #1 through his company CTI Science, has made a public statement as an Op-Ed piece in his local newspaper, the Lexington Harold-Leader: Dietary supplement safe for right use 
chemical name might be confusing; toxic effects low First, I note that previous statements have indicated that OSR is “totally” without toxicity.  Now the statement is “toxic effects low”. Mr. Haley starts his piece on the offensive: This is just one of several Chicago Tribune articles focusing on criticism of doctors who treat autistic children, raising similar concerns to that of a fringe group called Neurodiversity, which thinks autism should be celebrated instead of treated. He then defends his product: It is critical to be noted that there has been no report of any significant adverse effect for OSR#1. Our legal representation has contacted the Food and Drug Administration and we are working with the agency to resolve its concerns. Mr. Haley is apparently unaware of the potential adverse effects reported on internet forums for his product.  Kathleen Seidel of neurodiversity.com  has a piece up  OSR: A Bevy Of Adverse Events  today which may be enlightening. Mr. Haley notes that his company has made no medical claims about the efficacy of OSR.  He then offers a statement about the compound he is marketing: The letter from the FDA might also have been caused by a naming misconception. The chemical name of OSR#1 is N1N3-bis-(2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide, which might imply a complex chemical with no natural components. 
 However, the structure of OSR#1 contains a benzoate group (found in cranberries) and two cystamines (a metabolite of cysteine and found in all meats). 
 The FDA description of a dietary supplement extracted from their warning letter is: “a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, or dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.” 
 It is apparent that OSR#1 bears and contains one or more dietary ingredients and is why OSR#1 was submitted over two years ago to the FDA for consideration as a dietary supplement. It might be that the chemical name we placed on the label has confused this issue. I don’t think it is the chemical name which has confused the issue.  But maybe that is just me.  When I read the patent that the University of Kentucky (Mr. Haley’s former institution) has licensed for use as OSR, I read this: 
 
Multidentate sulfur-containing ligands ,  patent 6,586,600 Which states that (a) the compound is “novel” and (b) it has the function of a chelator. Novel sulfur-containing ligands for binding of heavy metals are disclosed. The ligands incorporate a central ring structure and pendant alkyl-thiol chains. The ligands are of the general structure: ##STR1##where n is an integer from 1-4, and X is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium. The ligands of the present invention are suitable for binding any metal in or capable of being placed in a positive oxidation state, such as cadmium, lead, nickel, zinc, mercury, copper, and the like. Additionally, methods for removal of heavy metals from various substances are disclosed, comprising separating selected heavy metals from selected substances by contacting the substances with an effective amount of the novel sulfur-containing chelate ligands for a sufficient time to form stable, irreversible ligand-metal precipitates, and removing such precipitates. In one of the Chicago Tribune pieces on OSR #1 a pharmacologist was quoted: The company that makes the supplement, CTI Science, describes it as an antioxidant. But pharmacologist Dr. Arthur Grollman, director of the Laboratory for Chemical Biology at State University of New York at Stony Brook, said it is obvious from the product’s chemical structure that it is also a “powerful chelator,” a compound that binds to heavy metals such as mercury. I will await the FDA’s review of whether a “novel” compound “might imply a complex chemical with no natural components”.  Also, I will await whether under the law one can state that because a chemical has subgroups found in foods, it is a “combination of dietary ingredients”.    It strikes this reader as unlikely that the FDA will agree with Mr. Haley’s position, however. Consider this–take vitamin C powder and Vitamin D powder.  Mix them up in whatever ratio you want.  Put it in a pill.  This is a combination of vitamins C and D.  However, the molecules in the mixture exist in original form and can be considered to act in the body in their expected manners.  The pill will work as vitamin C and vitamin D. Now consider OSR #1.  Assume that the molecule can be described as segments of various chemicals found in foods.  However, the resultant molecule is “novel”, i.e. not found or synthesized previously.  The resulting molecule will act in the body in a different manner than the sub-units.   Another way to look at this–if a person were to eat cranberries and meats (which contain the subunits of OSR #1 according to Mr. Haley), would one get the same results in the body?  Is OSR “supplementing” the benzoate groups (found in cranberries) and two cystamines one would get from one’s diet? Is OSR #1 safe or toxic?  I don’t think the data are available to answer that question.  And  that  presents a big question here: has sufficient study been performed?  Is it appropriate to market this compound as a “supplement”?  That will go a long way towards determining whether there is sufficient safety data.   The FDA warning letter claimed that OSR #1 is not a supplement but a drug .

"One of the marketing ploys for MMS* is that it somehow attacks viruses, bacteria, parasites, heavy metals, toxins and more but doesn’t affect human tissue.  It’s safe! Of course this is from the same people who said that it isn’t a bleach.  Emily Willingham did a very simple and elegant demonstration that,  MMS: Yes, It Is Bleach .  Put a few drops on a black cloth and, lo an behold, it bleaches it. I thought about taking this to the next step–putting some drops on raw meat to see how much tissue would be bleached.  Then I thought, I wonder if there’s a study on this already?  Consider this paper,  Comparison of Organic Tissue Dissolution Capacities of Sodium Hypochlorite and Chlorine Dioxide  (full paper  here ). Organic tissue dissolution capacity.  In other words: how well do these solutions dissolve tissue. According to the main site promoting MMS as an autism cure: What is MMS? 
 MMS stands for Master Mineral Solution.  It’s chemical name is Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2). ClO2 is a gas that is produced as a result of combining 2 liquids, Sodium Chlorite (NaClO2) and citric acid.  When added to the sodium chlorite, the citric acid brings the combined pH level to under five, causing the sodium chlorite to become unstable and release chorine dioxide. (ClO2) Chlorine dioxide is an oxidizer with a lower oxidation potential (.95 V) than any of the other oxidizers in the human body. MMS starts out as sodium chlorite, not the hypochlorite as mentioned in the paper.  But the final solution contains ClO2, the same as one tested in the above paper.  In that paper they were exploring whether these solutions (sodium hypochlorite and ClO2) could be used in dental work.  They wanted to test whether ClO2 solutions would have an effect on tissue, in this case the pulp from the inside of teeth.  They already knew that sodium hypochlorite dissolved tissue. What did they find?  When they put tooth pulp (taken from cows) into these solutions, after 20 minutes about 28% of the tissue was dissolved. Dissolved.   In ClO2 solution. But wait, you say. That’s a paper using cow teeth, published in Turkey.  Realizing that this argument would come up, I searched for more papers.  Such as  Effect of chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite on the dissolution of human pulp tissue e An in vitro study .  Which concludes 5% Chlorine dioxide is capable of dissolving human pulp tissue but sodium hypochlorite was more effective. Or Comparison of Organic Tissue Dissolution Capacities of NaOCl and ClO2 Conclusion: Within the limitations of this in vitro study, it was concluded that ClO2 is efficient as well as NaOCl in dissolving organic tissue. Not all tissues are the same.  Skin, especially the dead skin in the outer layer, is likely more resistant than tooth pulp.  But, how about the intestinal lining (a consideration for those using this as an enema solution)?  Or once absorbed in the stomach (for those taking an oral route) or the esophagus? OK, it dissolves tissues.  But why go to these papers? How about just looking at the MSDS?  People have long brought out the MSDS for thimerosal to tell us that it should be removed from vaccines.  The MSDS for thimerosal shows that the LD50 level (the exposure where 1/2 of the test animals died, lethal dose 50) is  Acute oral toxicity (LD50): 75 mg/kg [Rat]  for thimerosal.  A chlorine dioxide solution of 0.054 weight% Chlorine Dioxide is less toxic than thimerosal, with an  LD50 (oral) rats: 292 mg/kg .  So, it would take about 4 times as much chlorine dioxide solution at this concentration to kill a rat as thimerosal. The thing is, people don’t drink thimerosal solutions.  Or do so repeatedly.  People are encouraged to drink MMS. Consider what happens if we increase the concentration of ClO2.  Up the concentration to 3% ClO2 in water and it  is as toxic as thimerosal .  But, again, dose makes the poison and the dose of ClO2 from MMS is much higher than the dose of thimerosal from a vaccine. The idea that MMS, or CD or Chlorine Dioxide is somehow a magical solution which rids the body of harmful substances while having no effect on human tissues is just flat out incorrect.  It dissolves organic tissue.  It’s toxic and the doses are significant. (*MMS is “miracle mineral solution”, a relatively new bit of alternative medicine that is being sold as an autism cure.  It has been promoted at parent conventions such as Autism One and by the blog The Age of Autism.  It is a scam and if the discussion above wasn’t clear: it should be avoided.) —

Mayo Clinic - No Evidence to Support Chelation Autism Treatment - Can Be Dangerous
" "
In this comment Dr. Hoecker of the Mayo Clinic states that there is no evidence to support Chelation as an autism treatment. Chelation can be dangerous - even deadly. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/autism-treatment/AN01488 There's no scientific evidence that chelation therapy is an effective autism treatment. In recent years, some doctors and parents have recommended chelation therapy as a potential treatment for autism. Proponents believe that autism is caused by mercury exposure, such as from childhood vaccines. Chelation therapy supposedly removes mercury from the body, which cures autism. But extensive studies have revealed no evidence of a link between mercury exposure and autism. In addition, chelation therapy is not approved as an autism treatment and can be associated with serious side effects, including liver and kidney damage that can result in death. There is no cure for autism. As a result, unproven alternative therapies are often suggested to parents who — frustrated by the lack of effective medical treatment for autism — are desperate to find something that will help their children. However, in clinical studies, these alternative therapies are usually found to be ineffective and sometimes harmful. Talk to your son's doctor before starting any alternative autism treatment. Although no cure for autism exists, early behavioral and educational interventions can help children with autism improve their communication and social skills.

"21104" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/03/05/lawsuit-against-alternative-medical-practitioners-usman-and-rossignal/" "Lawsuit against alternative medical practitioners Usman and Rossignal" "A lawsuit has been filed in Chicago claiming that a child has been harmed by the treatments prescribed by Dr. Dan Rossignol and Dr. Anju Usman. This is being reported in a story,  Father of 7-year-old autistic boy says treatment harmed son . (also now on the  Chicago Tribune’s website ) Doctor’s Data has also been named:  Coman also alleged that Doctor’s Data Inc., the St. Charles laboratory that performed the tests Usman and Rossignol used to justify these treatments, was negligent for using an “improper method” of testing. We here at LeftBrainRightBrain have commented many times about the concept of “challenge” testing to “prove” heavy metal toxicity.   The suit spotlights a test often used to diagnose metal poisoning in children with autism. To conduct the test, doctors give children a chelation drug that forces the body to let go of some of the metals that exist in everyone – healthy or sick – in trace amounts. Those metals show up in urine, which is sent to a lab for screening. 
 In the case of Coman’s son, Doctor’s Data then compared those drug-provoked results to a reference range calculated for people who had never been given a chelation drug. Based on this apples-to-oranges comparison, Coman’s son was found to have elevated levels of lead, aluminum, tin and mercury – some with results Doctor’s Data listed in the “90% range of metal contamination,” according to the lawsuit. According to the story, there are no comments from Doctor’s Data, Dr. Rossignol’s office nor Dr. Usman’s office.

Details: 
Doctor's Data, a lab that caters to chelation therapists, has sued Dr. Stephen Barrett. [Barrett S. Why Doctor's Data is trying to muzzle me. Quackwatch, July, 2010].  http://www.quackwatch.org/14Legal/dd_suit.html
 

 
The suit is primarily concerned about Barrett's article, \"How the urine toxic metals test is used to defraud patients,\" which describes how chelationists mislead patients into believing that they need treatment for heavy metal toxicity. [ http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/urine_toxic.html ] 

 The heart of the deception is \"provoked\" testing, in which the practitioner administers a chelating agent before the urine specimen is obtained. This artificially raises the levels of lead, mercury, and/or other heavy metals in the urine. The test report states that its \"reference values\" are for non-provoked specimens. However, if a provoked test level exceeds the reference values-which it usually does-it is reported as \"elevated,\" even though it should not be considered significant. Dr. Barrett's article also tabulates disciplinary actions, court decisions, and lawsuits related to provoked testing.  

 Doctor's Data is asking for damages exceeding $10 million and a sweeping injunction against further criticism. Although it is unlikely to prevail, defending against the lawsuit could be costly. Contributions to Barrett's defense fund can be made through the Quackwatch donations page:  http://www.quackwatch.org/00AboutQuackwatch/donations.html

			 Update July 1 2010  

 Doctor Barrett has been sued by a laboratory discussed in the following article:  How the \"Urine Toxic Metals\" Test Is Used to Defraud Patients , which describes how chelationists mislead patients into believing that they need treatment for heavy metal toxicity.

 ChelationWatch  is a part of the  Quackwatch  family of websites.  \"Quackwatch  is now an international network of people who are concerned about health-related frauds, myths, fads, fallacies, and misconduct. Its primary focus is on quackery-related information that is difficult or impossible to get elsewhere.\" 
 
Chelation therapy is a series of intravenous infusions containing EDTA and various other substances. It is falsely claimed to be effective against cardiovascular disease, autism, and many other diseases and conditions. Because chelation has valid use in some cases of heavy metal poisoning, many practitioners falsely diagnose lead, mercury, or other heavy metal toxicity to trick patients into undergoing chelation. This Web site explains why doctors who advocate the general use of chelation therapy should be avoided.

"22809" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2014/07/22/is-boyd-haley-resurrecting-osr1-as-a-chelator/" "Is Boyd Haley resurrecting OSR#1 as a chelator?" "Boyd Haley  was a professor of chemistry who was very active in the failed thimerosal-causes-autism movement.  He earned extra notoriety for trying to coin the phrase “ mad child disease ” (yes, a variation of  mad cow disease ) for autistic children. He also found notoriety for marketing a  synthetic chemical  as a “nutritional supplement”, calling it OSR#1.  Prof. Haley is certainly persistent.  He’s working on a clinical trial. How did this come to pass?  Well, one of the professors in Prof. Haley’s department found that a certain compound could effectively treat mining waste, removing mercury.  Given his own interests, Mr. Haley started a company with an investor with the intent  to bring this chelator to the public.  The chelators used in medicine today were developed for lead and have been expanded to also treat mercury. I.e. there is no mercury specific chelator and this new compound would fill that gap. All well and good, but in his zeal to bring this product to market, Prof. Haley cut a few corners.  Chelators are drugs.  The compound he was working on was synthetic.  But Prof. Haley chose to rush the product to market as a “nutritional supplement”.  Instead of calling it a chelator, he called it OSR#1.  OSR standing for “oxidative stress relief”. Mr. Haley skipped the process to prove that his drug was safe and effective. Supplements have a much lower standard for safety and efficacy testing.   The FDA was not fooled.  Mr. Haley and his company were given a  warning letter  which pointed out that the compound is not a supplement, it is a drug: Your firm markets OSR#l as a dietary supplement; however, this product does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement in section 201(ff) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(ff). To be a dietary supplement, a product must, among other things, “bear[ ] or contain[ ] one or more … dietary ingredients” as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.§ 321(ff)(1). Section 201 (ff)(1) of the Act defines “dietary ingredient” as a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, or dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories. The only substance listed as a dietary ingredient on the labeling of OSR#1 is N1,N3-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide. N1,N3-bis(2mercaptoethyl) isophthalamide is not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, or dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. Further, N1,N3-bis(2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide is not a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any such dietary ingredient. Thus, because OSR#1 does not bear or contain a dietary ingredient as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act, this product does not qualify as a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the Act. Also that the company was making claims that the drug could treat medical conditions and that the labeling was misleading in this regard.  Further, that the toxicity was not adequately tested nor reported. Your website states that” [s]ome reports of temporary diarrhea, constipation, minor headaches have been reported but these are rare and the actual causes are unknown,” as well as “OSR#1 is without detectable toxicity” and “OSR#1® … has not exhibited any detectable toxic effects even at exceptionally high exposure levels.” However, animal studies that you conducted found various side effects to be associated with OSR#1 use, including, but not limited to, soiling of the anogenital area, alopecia on the lower trunk, back and legs, a dark substance on lower trunk and anogenital area, abnormalities of the pancreas, and lymphoid hyperplasia. Based on these animal studies and side effects known to be associated with chelating products that have a similar mechanism of action to OSR#1, we believe the use of your product has the potential to cause side effects, and the before-mentioned website statements falsely assert that the product does not have the potential to cause side effects. Therefore, these statements render your product’s labeling false or misleading. As such, OSR#1 is misbranded under section 502(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(a). That was in 2010.  Prof. Haley and his company are now back, trying to get a clinical trial started on their compound.  Essentially, they are trying to do what they should have done in the first place: get proper approval for a drug.  An article in  Chemical & Engineering News  discusses this effort.  Actually, it’s part of the cover story, “Building Pharma Molecules” The story on Mr. Haley’s Company, CTI Science, has contracted with another company, PCI Synthesis, to manufacture the new compound. The article is, well, a bit of a sales pitch and gets a few facts wrong.  There’s a bit of spin on the FDA warning letter, for example:  “The effort to develop the compound as a mercury poisoning therapy accelerated in 2010 when the company received notification from FDA that it couldn’t market NBMI as a nutritional supplement until it underwent the full drug approval process”. As we’ve just seen above, the compound is  not  a nutritional supplement at all.  It needs the drug approval process because  it is a drug . The CEO of PCI is quoted as stating: “The main starting material is cysteamine hydrochloride, which is basically an amino acid and found naturally. So it has attributes that could qualify it as a natural product.” Which was part of the sales pitch for the OSR#1 in the old days and, again, the FDA disagreed.  Just because something is synthesized from a natural product, that doesn’t make it a natural product.  Otherwise there would be no synthetic products at all.  Everything at some level comes from a natural product. The article discusses how to qualify for a clinical trial the product must meet  current Good Manufacturing Practices  (cGMP). The article states: The primary challenge was the removal of impurities to a level that meets cGMP standards Think about that a moment.  Apparently OSR#1 was sold with more impurities than would meet this standard–a standard for food and dietary supplements. The article notes that, yes, this compound was sold as a product at one time Sales to date: $1.5 million, as a nutritional supplement $1.5M in sales.  And the only reason it wasn’t higher was because the FDA stepped in.  It was only out for about a year, as I recall. I found this statement interesting, from the  Wikipedia page for the compound : In animal experiments, the amount of mercury in brain tissue was not increased, but also not decreased So, even if you believe in the failed mercury hypothesis.  What exactly were you supposed to get from this compound?  I somehow doubt that even the strong believers in the mercury hypothesis think that removing mercury from, say, your liver will cure autism. It does seem that Mr. Haley and his company are doing some of the right things now.  Show that this drug is safe and effective for its intended purpose: chelation.  There are some problematical statements that they may market this not as a drug but as a nutritional supplement, which is a non-starter. —

The Age of Autism: Gold Salts Pass A Test
" "
 The Age of Autism: Gold salts pass a test By  Dan Olmsted Dec 23, 2005, 19:16 GMT In a Striking Follow-up to Our Reporting on the First Child Diagnosed with Autism -- and His Improvement After Treatment with Gold Salts -- a Chemistry Professor Says Lab Tests Show the Compound Can 'reverse the Binding' of Mercury to Molecules. 'This does lend support to the possible removal of mercury from biological proteins in individuals treated with gold salts,' Boyd Haley, professor and former chemistry department chair at the University of Kentucky, said Thursday. The potential significance: Donald T. -- Case 1 among children diagnosed with autism in the 1930s -- showed marked improvement in his autistic symptoms after being treated with gold salts for an attack of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. That`s according to his brother, who we interviewed earlier this year in the small Mississippi town where he and Donald, now 72, still live. One theory of autism -- strongly dismissed by federal health authorities and mainstream medical groups -- is that the disorder is primarily caused by a mercury preservative called thimerosal that was used in vaccines beginning in the 1930s. Some parents and researchers who believe autism is, in essence, mercury poisoning are using treatments designed to remove mercury from the body or offset its neurological effects. Haley is among a minority of scientists who holds this view, and after reading about Donald`s improvement he set out to test whether gold salts have any effect on mercury. 'You follow your nose in research, and when I saw that I thought, yes, this is a possibility,' said Haley. Haley`s experiment was quite simple: He began with a colored thiol-containing compound. Thiols are the class of molecules that contain a sulfhydryl group (a sulfur and hydrogen atom bound together) and, because of the affinity of mercury for sulfur, these molecules bind tightly to mercury. Thiols are found in most enzymes, and when mercury binds to them, these enzymes lose their biological activity, which is needed to maintain healthy cells, he said. Haley performed two tests involving inorganic mercury -- the type of mercury thimerosal breaks down to in the brain, he said. Haley`s compound was designed to turn colorless when mercury binds to it. In the first test, he added the mercury, and the 'optical density' measurement went from 0.23 units down to 0.11 units immediately, and down to 0.03 units in half an hour -- a clear sign that the mercury had bound to the thiol. In the second test he premixed the mercury with gold salts for two minutes, then added it to the same solution. This time the optical density dropped to 0.11 but then slowly increased back up to 0.23 within about 30 minutes -- 'totally the opposite of the situation with mercury alone,' Haley said. 'The only way this could happen would be for the gold salts to remove mercury from the thiol-containing compound.' The advocacy group SafeMinds -- which opposes the use of mercury in medicines and provided Haley with the $142 prescription of gold salts to test -- called the results potentially significant but cautioned against premature use of the compound to treat autistic people. 'Clinicians have shown that some autistic children show strong recovery from their symptoms after biomedical treatment,' said SafeMinds` Mark Blaxill. 'So any time we discover a treatment that works in a child, we need to take it seriously. 'According to his brother`s unprompted report, Donald T. recovered from autism after treatment with gold salts. We should be all over that, especially after Boyd`s work. But we need to proceed with care to make sure that this is a safe treatment.' Haley made the same point. 'Please note that I am not recommending using gold salts to treat autistics, but it would certainly be worth a project if carefully monitored by a physician in a good clinic.' In August Donald`s brother described to us his 'miraculous response' to gold-salts treatment for a life-threatening attack of juvenile arthritis. Donald was given injections of the salts over a two- to three-month period at the Campbell Clinic in Memphis at age 12 in 1947. The arthritis cleared up, and so did the 'extreme nervousness' and excitability that had afflicted him, his brother said. Donald also became 'more social.' He went on to college, where he was invited to join a fraternity; worked as a bank teller; and now, in retirement, pursues his love of golf and travels the world. Most of those early patients -- and thousands since -- were institutionalized when they got older or lived in extremely sheltered circumstances, according to follow-up reports. (Donald did not respond to our request for an interview, and we are not identifying him at this time beyond information in the original case study and follow-up.) Before Haley tested the gold salts, he told us why he thought it was worth investigating. 'Nothing has a higher affinity for mercury than elemental gold. They form bonds that are very tight,' Haley said. Devices designed to detect and filter out mercury routinely use gold, he noted -- and they obviously would employ a less expensive element if gold weren`t so effective. Mercury was also used to extract gold from ore in mining operations. In the body, Haley said, gold likely is 'attracted to the same places as mercury. They would probably make it to the same spot in the body. It (gold) would probably cross the blood-brain barrier like mercury. There are reasons to think that if you put it in, it would chase mercury down because they`re very similar in their chemistry. 'So you might be able to displace it with the gold. The chemistry gets complicated here, but gold does not do as much oxidative stress as does mercury. The gold isn`t nearly as toxic as the mercury. ... It could take it off the enzyme it`s inhibiting and reactivate that enzyme.' Haley said he was intrigued that the treatment may have benefited Donald when he was 12 -- old for such a positive response, according to proponents of biomedical therapies. The most controversial such treatment is chelation, which uses drugs in an attempt to pull toxic metals -- mercury in particular -- from the body. 'It doesn`t seem to work with the older kids,' Haley said. 'These older kids are just lost.' But, Haley emphasized: 'Don`t jump on this. Be careful. You can hurt kids.' That concern was underscored when a 5-year-old autistic child died this year while undergoing chelation in Pennsylvania. Federal officials say it is not a responsible practice, although one advocacy group says more than 10,000 families have tried it, with significant benefit.

HBOT has not been shown to cure or be an effective treatment for autism, among the myriad conditions for which HBOT is touted. The  warning  is quoted below. No, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has not been clinically proven to cure or be effective in the treatment of cancer, autism, or diabetes. But do a quick search on the Internet, and you’ll see all kinds of claims for these and other diseases for which the device has not been cleared or approved by FDA. 
 HBOT involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared hyperbaric chambers for certain medical uses, such as treating decompression sickness suffered by divers. 
 HBOT has not, however, been proven to be the kind of universal treatment it has been touted to be on some Internet sites. FDA is concerned that some claims made by treatment centers using HBOT may give consumers a wrong impression that could ultimately endanger their health. 
 “Patients may incorrectly believe that these devices have been proven safe and effective for uses not cleared by FDA, which may cause them to delay or forgo proven medical therapies,” says Nayan Patel, a biomedical engineer in FDA’s Anesthesiology Devices Branch. “In doing so, they may experience a lack of improvement and/or worsening of their existing condition(s).” 
 Patients may be unaware that the safety and effectiveness of HBOT has not been established for these diseases and conditions, including: 
 AIDS/HIV 
Alzheimer’s Disease 
Asthma 
Bell’s Palsy 
Brain Injury 
Cerebral Palsy 
Depression 
Heart Disease 
Hepatitis 
Migraine 
Multiple Sclerosis 
Parkinson’s Disease 
Spinal Cord Injury 
Sport’s Injury 
Stroke 
Patel says that FDA has received 27 complaints from consumers and health care professionals over the past three years about treatment centers promoting the hyperbaric chamber for uses not cleared by the agency.

 How HBOT Works 
HBOT involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber in which the atmospheric pressure is raised up to three times higher than normal. Under these conditions, your lungs can gather up to three times more oxygen than would be possible breathing oxygen at normal air pressure. 
 Patel explains that your body’s tissues need an adequate supply of oxygen to function. When tissue is injured, it may require more oxygen to heal. “Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen dissolved in your blood,” says Patel. An increase in blood oxygen may improve oxygen delivery for vital tissue function to help fight infection or minimize injury. 
 Hyperbaric chambers are medical devices that require FDA clearance. FDA clearance of a device for a specific use means FDA has reviewed valid scientific evidence supporting that use and determined that the device is at least as safe and effective as another legally U.S.-marketed device. 
 Thirteen uses of a hyperbaric chamber for HBOT have been cleared by FDA. They include treatment of air or gas embolism (dangerous “bubbles” in the bloodstream that obstruct circulation), carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness (often known by divers as “the bends”), and thermal burns (caused by heat or fire). 
 What are the Risks? 
Patients receiving HBOT are at risk of suffering an injury that can be mild (such as sinus pain, ear pressure, painful joints) or serious (such as paralysis, air embolism). Since hyperbaric chambers are oxygen rich environments, there is also a risk of fire. 
 “If you’re considering using HBOT, it’s essential that you first discuss all possible options with your health care professional,” Patel says. “Whatever treatment you’re getting, you need to understand its benefits and risks. Your health care professional can help you determine which treatment is your best option.” 
 In addition, any problems experienced with these devices can be reported to MedWatch, the FDA safety information and adverse events reporting program.

			 Update: July 22, 2010: Mr. Haley has removed OSR#1 from  the market.  Details at  Neurodiversity. .  More discussion at  Respectful Insolence . 

 Back in 2008 I told you about the scandal of Boyd Haley  marketing a powerful industrial decontaminant as a \"dietary supplement\" used to \"heal\" autism.  Kathleen Seidel of Neurodiversity did the groundwork with her articles A  Fine White Powder , the  Industrial Treatment  and  An Inquiry Emerges .  

 The Food and Drug Administration took their time, but finally, June 17 2010, issued a warning letter to Haley and his company.  As reported in  the Chicago Tribune :

 
 
A product promoted to parents of children with autism is not a harmless dietary supplement, as claimed, but a toxic unapproved drug that lacks adequate warnings about potential side effects, including hair loss and abnormalities of the pancreas, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned in a letter to its maker.
 

 
The FDA's June 17 letter to Boyd Haley, a retired Kentucky chemist and hero to the autism recovery movement, details five violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act related to his product, OSR#1. Failing to correct such violations can result in fines, seizure of products and even criminal prosecution.
 
 

 

Kathleen Seidel at Neurodiversity has a  summary and the entire warning letter .  

 
Remember, the product marketed as OSR#1 was developed to be an industrial decontaminant. In  Fuel for Thought , Seidel analyzes a paper on the product's primary use, comparing it to Haley's use as a \"food supplement\".  

 

Prof. Haley's  first response to the FDA warning  claimed the product was safe. In  A Bevy of Adverse Events , Seidel  collates online discussions of OSR's side effects .  

 The company marketing OSR,  CTI Science ,  lists the following dosages and warning:  
“Recommended dose of OSR#1 for adults is 100 mg once daily… Recommended dose of OSR#1 for children 55-100 pounds is 100 mg once daily.  OSR#1 is not recommended for children under 55 pounds or under 4 years of age.“ 

 

In  The Littlest Consumers , Seidel reports that DAN! practitioners (who may be nurses or chiropractors in addition to physicians) have been providing OSR to children as young as 20 months and as light as 26 pounds.

Seidel closes with:
 
	
	 Needless exposure of children to inadequately tested, potentially hazardous substances is indefensible , regardless of whether the instigator is a multinational corporation, an academic research center, a public residential institution, or a powder-peddling moonshiner working the alternative autism treatment hero circuit.

"23507" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/11/11/autism-a-killer-app-and-a-drug-of-choice/" "Autism, A Killer App., And A Drug Of Choice" "Below is the content from the post of a guest blogger Do’C invited onto Autism Street recently. It concerns the death of Tariq from chelation and the spurious claim that his death was simply down to a bad choice of drugs. I have shut comments off on this post.  Please go to Autism Street to comment. Part One: A Drug Of Choice Reading here and there on web, one may notice people still scratching their heads about why Dr. Kerry used the drug he did to treat Tariq Nadama. Science blogger, Orac ( Respectful Insolence ), did an excellent job  explaining  why there is no right or wrong drug in this case, but there is another bit – Dr. Kerry quite likely used the drug he did,  because this is the drug specified in the EDTA chelation “protocol” published by the American College for Advancement in Medicine, a chelation proponent organization . When CDC scientist Mary Jean Brown recently said “No medical professional would ever have intended to give the child Disodium EDTA”, she was likely unaware of what’s often referred to as the ACAM protocol. Roy Kerry  is a member  of ACAM. The  American College for Advancement in Medicine  (aka ACAM) is the chelation proponent organization related to the protocol described below. Protocol citation: 
Rozema TC.The Protocol for the Safe and Effective Administration of EDTA and Other Chelating Agents for Vascular Disease, Degenerative Disease, and Metal Toxicity. 
The Journal of Advancement in Medicine. 1997;10(1):5-100. Note : ACAM’s journal is apparently no longer known as  The Journal of Advancement in Medicine , and is now known as  Clinical Practice of Alternative Medicine. The protocol is republished in: E Cranton Ed. A Textbook of EDTA Chelation Therapy. 2nd Edition Hampton Roads  (2001). The ACAM protocol for so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy specifically prescribes the use of Endrateâ„¢, the disodium salt of EDTA. Endrateâ„¢ lowers blood calcium. More information about Endrateâ„¢ Edetate Disodium Injection USP safety and professional prescribing is available at this  link . Examples of specification of the use of Endrateâ„¢ (DISODIUM EDTA) for so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy within the ACAM protocol include: 
 P. 9 I. OVERVIEW OF EDTA CHELATION THERAPY 
 […EDTA is an abbreviation for the compound Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid.  The form approved by the FDA for the treatment of lead poisoning is calcium EDTA.  (1,2,3,4,5)  The form of EDTA used to treat atherosclerotic conditions, on the other hand, is disodium EDTA , for reasons that will become apparent later. (6,7,8,9) EDTA chelation therapy is part of a comprehensive therapeutic program for the treatment of atherosclerosis.  Other components include nutritional and dietary recommendations, oral nutritional supplements, an exercise program, a stress management program, if necessary, and medication, if necessary.  On rare occasions, surgical intervention may be beneficial, but the vast majority of patients can be effectively managed without surgical intervention. 
 P. 10 II. PROTOCOL OBJECTIVES 
[… The purpose of this treatment protocol is to assure maximum clinical efficacy and patient safety in the use of Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid, (otherwise known as EDTA or disodium Edetate or the disodium salt of Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid) , and other chelating agents in a comprehensive therapeutic approach to the treatment of arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and other disorders in which chelating agents have been shown to be beneficial.  A knowledge of biochemistry, pharmacology and the basic clinical sciences is assumed . This protocol is also intended to establish international standards for the safest and most effective use of chelation therapy in a comprehensive multi-modality treatment program.  In this protocol the use of the term EDTA will refer to the disodium form of the molecule as distinguished from the calcium disodium or magnesium disodium forms . Where appropriate, these other forms of EDTA will be identified as such.  Written and oral examinations are offered periodically by the American and International Boards of Chelation Therapy (ABCT-IBCT), to assure that sufficient comprehension of this discipline has been attained . 
 P. 11 III. CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF EDTA 
 A. Chemical Structure 
 The EDTA discussed in this protocol is the disodium salt of EDTA . It occurs as a white crystalline powder, soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol and mildly acidic. (10) 
 pp. 43-45 3. Supplies and Equipment 
 e. Disodium EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid), NOT the calcium-disodium salt) , is readily available in the United States in 20 ml (3 gram) vials, and is best tolerated without a chemical preservative. 
 Part Two: Confusion The protocol clearly indicates Endrateâ„¢ is the drug to be used. Elsewhere, and especially in information readily available to the public, this is unclear and often confusing. ACAM, for all its reassurance about the safety of so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy, rarely identifies Endrateâ„¢ by its proprietary or generic name as the drug prescribed by their members according to the protocol – rather ACAM apparently refers to the drug as â€œEDTA.â€ For example, a  recent ACAM press release  announced a new program to credential chelationists: 
 The next twelve months will be a most important time for the staff and membership of the American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM). With the help of Applied Measurement Professionals, Inc. of Lenexa, Kansas, ACAM will be undertaking the development, validation, and administration of a national program for use in credentialing individuals as Certified Chelation Therapy Practitioner (CCTP). Chelation therapy is currently used as a treatment for blocked blood flow in arteries (atherosclerosis) by administering ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), a man-made amino acid, into the veins. While EDTA has been used in the past to treat lead toxicity, EDTA also â€œchelatesâ€ calcium, a component of atherosclerotic plaque. This therapy has been employed to improve blood flow through previously narrowed blood vessels, help restore lost bodily function and reduce pain. 
 This is unusual because there is no drug named â€œEDTAâ€. In fact, it ‘s not necessarily clear that the compound exists except as a disodium or calcium disodium salt. This brings up an important point: Endrateâ„¢ is trade name for the disodium salt of EDTA, and Versenate is the trade name for the calcium disodium salt of EDTA. Versenate is labeled for treatment of lead poisoning; because it contains calcium (unlike Endrateâ„¢), Versenate binds with lead preferentially, and leaves calcium alone. More information about Calcium Disodium Versenate (Edetate Calcium Disodium Injection USP) safety and professional prescribing is available at this  link . Itâ€™s also unusual that physicians would use the generic term â€œEDTAâ€ when there is a possibility that doing so might increase the likelihood of confusing Endrateâ„¢ with Versenate. Sound-alike drug names are widely known to be a serious threat to patient safety. Several organizations work to prevent situations in which drugs have similar sounding names, as does the Food and Drug Administration. The sentence “While EDTA has been used in the past to treat lead toxicity, EDTA also â€œchelatesâ€ calcium, a component of atherosclerotic plaque” conflates Endrateâ„¢ and Versenate into a single product – “EDTA.” This is precisely what not to do.  In fact the CDC  recently reported  a two year-old child died  after the unintentional administration of Endrateâ„¢ instead of Versenate. Source: Deaths Associated with Hypocalcemia from Chelation Therapy – Texas, Pennsylvania, and Oregon, 2003â€“2005. MMWR Weekly. March 3, 2006 / 
55(08);204-207.  The  “ Position Paper on EDTA Chelation Therapy ” published by the American College for Advancement in Medicine is sort of baffling. “Disodium magnesium EDTA” is used once, while  “EDTA” is used 25 times. The following passage exemplifies the confusion because it seems to suggest Endrateâ„¢ and Versenate are one and the same thing, called “EDTA”. 
 Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (“EDTA”) is a synthetic amino acid first used in the 1940’s for treatment of heavy metal poisoning. It is widely recognized as effective for that use as well as certain others, including emergency treatment of hypercalcemia and the control of ventricular arrhythmias associated with digitalis toxicity. 
 In point of fact,  Versenate  was “first used in the 1940’s for treatment of heavy metal poisoning” and is currently labeled for use in treatment of lead poisoning. On the other hand,  Endrateâ„¢, the drug specified in the protocol , is indicated for use in “emergency treatment of hypercalcemia and the control of ventricular arrhythmias associated with digitalis toxicity.” The assertion below is misleading because it refers to the use of Versenate to treat lead poisoning in children, yet the ACAM protocol appears to direct physicians  to use Endrateâ„¢  while apparently emphatically directing them  not to use Versenate . 
 Whenever chelation is used in its widely-accepted role to combat lead poisoning, the dosages given even to children are administered much more rapidly than those administered to adults under this protocol. 
 How peculiar is it that that ACAMâ€™s telephone number is 800-532-3688 or 800-LEAD-OUT? What’s the point of this? Part Three: Safety In Death Broad claims of safety are made for so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy in the ACAM position paper. For example: 
 The Food and Drug Administration determined that EDTA chelation therapy was safe prior to approving the Investigational New Drug protocol for the ongoing double-blind placebo-controlled studies. 
 It may (or may not) be true that FDA determined “EDTA chelation therapy 
was safe” preparatory to beginning research subject to an Investigational New Drug application, but it’s undoubtedly true that a “safe” drug doesn’t carry a “black box warning” on its label. Endrateâ„¢, however, does: 
 WARNING The use of this drug in any particular patient is recommended only when the severity of the clinical condition justifies the aggressive measures associated with this type of therapy. 
 The position paper emphatically argues that “restriction to FDA package insert guidelines is inappropriate” with the obvious implication that the use of Endrateâ„¢ for so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy is simply an off-label use of the FDA-approved drug Endrateâ„¢, and as such ought not be restricted. While it’s generally true that FDA doesn’t regulate the off-label use of marketed drugs by physicians, it’s not clear that the use of Endrate in so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy is an “off-label” use. The drug label includes a  contraindication  warning physicians that Endrateâ„¢ “is not indicated for the treatment of generalized arteriosclerosis associated with advancing age.” Under what circumstances is a contraindicated use an off-label use? The ACAM  position paper  incorporates a long quote by JAMA editor John Archer supporting the right of physicians to use approved drugs for off-label or unlabeled indications, ostensibly to hammer the argument home. Ironically, FDA assistant commissioner Stuart Nightingale wrote a response to Dr. Archer in a subsequent issue of the journal and used the example of Endrateâ„¢’s contraindication for use in arteriosclerosis to make the point that physician freedom was not absolute. Archer agreed with Dr. Nightingale in his reply. Source: Nightingale SL. The FDA and drug uses: Reprise. JAMA.1985;253:632.  The claim that there have been no fatalities is difficult to accept in the face of evidence to the contrary: 
 The safety of this therapy, when properly administered, is not an issue. It is estimated that over 500,000 patients nationally have been safely treated with this therapy by physicians utilizing the protocol developed by the American College for Advancement in Medicine. No reported fatalities have occurred in the United States when the ACAM protocol has been followed. 
 Following the deaths of fourteen people treated with Endrateâ„¢ in so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy the federal government sued to enjoin a notorious chelationist from all use of the drug –  Source : United States v. An Article of Drug*** Diso-tate, et al. It might be objected that this physician used a higher dose than that specified by the ACAM protocol, but the report of expert medical reviewer J. David Spence, M.D. identified the dose used as 3 g. (p. 3), the same dose indicated in the protocol, and in the FDA-approved label for Endrateâ„¢ –  Source . There are other deaths associated with the use Endrateâ„¢ in so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy in addition to these fourteen patients. For example, in March of 1995 Jerry Osuch died the day after receiving his tenth session of so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy as the patient of Dr. Neil Ahner, a physician with “board certification” in chelation therapy, and a member of the ACAM board of directors. On February 25, 1992 Louis Labbe died following so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy administered by Dr. Daniel Roehm. According to the Sun-Sentinel: 
 Labbe’s case outraged Dr. Stephen Nelson, then a Broward associate medical examiner. Nelson complained to the state’s medical licensing board that, given the gravity of Labbe’s illness, Roehm should have hospitalized him on his first visit. The Florida Board of Medicine agreed. In June 1992, a three-member panel found probable cause to believe Roehm’s care of Labbe fell below accepted standards. Roehm’s medical records “failed to demonstrate that the doctor even understood how serious and how sick this patient was and how important it was to get some intensive care and some aggressive therapy,” argued Larry McPherson, a state health care agency attorney. The state went on to accuse Roehm of gross malpractice in treating Labbe. Roehm relinquished his medical license in July 1993 to avoid further board action against him. He died in 1996.

The survivors of Susan Alexander, a 56-year-old woman who died in 2002, filed suit against Progressive Medical Group (PMG), several of its staff members, and Metametrix (a laboratory that offers nonstandard tests). The suit accused the defendants of negligence, fraud, racketeering, and wrongful death. According to the complaint, Ms. Alexander’s heart stopped beating during chelation therapy for alleged lead poisoning that had been diagnosed with a fraudulent test –  Source . On October 31, 1993, the man identified as “W.L.H” died during a course of treatment with Endrateâ„¢ for so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy prescribed by Dr. Eleazar Kadile –  Source . Part Four: What About Autism? How is it possible for former president and long-time ACAM member Ralph Miranda, M.D. to make like a statement like the following after the death of Tariq Nadama? 
 “If the child’s death is tied to chelation therapy, it would be the first associated with the procedure since the 1950s”, said Dr. Ralph Miranda of Greensburg. Miranda is the former president of the American College for Advancement in Medicine, a group that sets clinical practice and education standards for chelation and other, similar therapies.

Inconsistent statements about the safety of Endrateâ„¢ and confusion over the identity of the drug used in so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy tends to cast doubt on the integrity of ACAM and its members and their commitment to provide accurate, factual information to the public. Patients considering so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy would do well to remember the case brought by the Federal Trade Commission charging ACAM with “false advertising over promotion of chelation therapy.” This brief synopsis is taken from the FTC press release announcing the consent agreement on December 8, 1998: 
 ACAM, based in Laguna Hills, California, is an association comprised principally of physicians who administer traditional and complementary/alternative medical therapies including chelation therapy. ACAM promotes chelation therapy in brochures and promotional materials and by maintaining a Web page on the Internet. Chelation therapy involves the intravenous injection of a prescription drug,  ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) , which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the limited use of ridding the human body of excess heavy metals. 
 According to the FTC’s complaint detailing the charges, ACAM’s advertisements and promotional materials for chelation therapy contained such statements as: 
 Chelation therapy is a safe, effective, and relatively inexpensive treatment to restore blood flow in victims of atherosclerosis without surgery; 
 
 Every single study of the use of chelation therapy for atherosclerosis which has ever been published, without exception, has described an improvement in blood flow and symptoms; and 
 
 Chelation therapy promotes health by correcting the major underlying cause of arterial blockage. Damaging oxygen free radicals are increased by the presence of metallic elements and act as a chronic irritant to blood vessel walls and cell membranes. EDTA removes those metallic irritants, allowing leaky and damaged cell walls to heal. Plaques smooth over and shrink, allowing more blood to pass. Arterial walls become softer and more pliable, allowing easier expansion. Scientific studies have proven that blood flow increases after chelation therapy. 
 Through the use of such statements, the FTC alleged, ACAM has represented that EDTA chelation therapy is an effective treatment for atherosclerosis, and that ACAM possessed and relied upon a reasonable basis when making the representations. The FTC charged that the representations are false and misleading because ACAM did not possess and rely upon a reasonable basis to substantiate the claims –  Source . Six years later in response to the death of Tariq Nadama, ACAM issued a  press release  in which they invite the public to believe so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy is safe on the basis of the safety and efficacy of “EDTA” for treatment of lead poisoning. ACAM apparently forgot to mention they’re referring to Versenate – the drug their protocol apparently directs physicians NOT to use for so-called “EDTA” chelation therapy. ACAM asserts, “millions of infusions have been administered … without any deaths being noted.”  Nevertheless deaths have occurred. 
 However, it is important to note that IV EDTA is an FDA approved treatment for lead toxicity in children and adults, with an excellent track record for safety. Millions of infusions have been administered over the last 30 + years, without any deaths being noted, when used in accordance with established guidelines. These guidelines were developed by experts in the field and include the intravenous administration of Magnesium Disodium EDTA. 
 ACAM asserts  that, “Chelation Therapy has been clinically helpful for many autistic children who have evidence of heavy metal burdens, and have an impaired ability for detoxification.” Shouldn’t ACAM explain to the scientific community and to the public why we should believe that lowering blood calcium would lead to clinical improvement in autistic children? Shouldn’t ACAM explain to the scientific community and to the public why we should believe Endrateâ„¢ would be safe and effective in removing “heavy metals” – like the implied mercury – when the pharmacology of Endrateâ„¢ is sufficiently well known to permit experts to conclude Endrateâ„¢ doesn’t bind effectively bind and remove mercury. In simple terms, if Endrateâ„¢ doesnâ€™t get to the places where mercury accumulates in the body, how would it bind and remove it? Shouldn’t ACAM provide evidence to the scientific community and to the public proving that “many autistic children … have evidence of heavy metal burdens” (bona fide experts using valid laboratory tests have been unable to do so)? Shouldn’t ACAM provide evidence to qualified specialists in pediatrics and toxicology that autistic children can be diagnosed with an “impaired ability for detoxification” and explain how correcting this impairment would lead to clinical improvement? Is it possible that the parents of Tariq Nadama had no idea what they might really be getting into when their son was brought to the U.S. for chelation therapy that turned out to be a fatal attempt to treat him?

"22984" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/05/30/mms-or-how-to-cure-autism-with-bleach-brought-to-you-by-autismone/" "MMS, or how to cure autism with bleach.  Brought to you by AutismOne" "There are so many strange theories about autism which come and go that one doesn’t have the time to read up on all of them. Such is the case with MMS, which I now know stands for  Miracle Mineral Solution . Recently the chatter on some of the yahoo groups I subscribe to increased with discussions of MMS and I just didn’t read what they were talking about. Dr. David Gorski  at  Science Based Medicine  did look into this. His article  Bleaching away what ails you  goes into detail about MMS. To put it simply, “Miracle Mineral Solution” is bleach. Like many alternative medicine treatments, proponents of MMS claim it can help almost anything. Including autism. If you unfamiliar with it, AutismOne is a parent convention with a large focus on claims of vaccine causation and alt-med therapies for autism. When Andrew Wakefield lost his medical license for unethical practices, he was given a standing ovation at the following AutismOne conference. When Mark Geier’s medical license was suspended, he also was given a standing ovation. Year after year one can hear discussion of the failed idea about how mercury in vaccines caused an autism epidemic. There are some presentations at AutismOne which appear useful (such as special education law), but the fact that they have such low standards for science and treatment topics trumps whatever good they might do. As in the talk this year on MMS ( 38 Children Recovered in 20 months: Autism Treatment with MMS ).   Slides for the talk are online . The talk has a lot of the usual warning signs: 1) claims of recovery substantiated by anecdotes and testimonials. 
2) pseudo-scientific claims (in this case discussion of the chemistry of the molecules) 
3) reliance on non-scientific explanation of autism (in this case that autism can be cured by ridding the body of parasites) 
4) re-defining adverse reactions as expected and helpful. And it is this last point that is particularly troublesome. Many alt-med therapies result in adverse reactions. Read yahoo groups and you will see them frequently. For MMS you will see vomiting and diarrhea. Parents discuss ramping up the dose of MMS until the child starts to vomit, then backing off. The presentation from AutismOne includes: It is common to find that the child gets a fever. This is very good. As well as a claim that the adverse reactions are “Herxheimer reactions”. Herxheimer reactions exist–search the Mayo Clinic website and you will find it for when  syphilis is treated with penicillin . You won’t find it for when a child is made to drink bleach. Why would a child have an adverse reaction to MMS?  Because it’s bleach . Here is an  FDA warning on MMS : FDA Warns Consumers of Serious Harm from Drinking Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) 
Product contains industrial strength bleach 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to take Miracle Mineral Solution, an oral liquid also known as “Miracle Mineral Supplement” or “MMS.” The product, when used as directed, produces an industrial bleach that can cause serious harm to health. 
 The FDA has received several reports of health injuries from consumers using this product, including severe nausea, vomiting, and life-threatening low blood pressure from dehydration. 
 Consumers who have MMS should stop using it immediately and throw it away. 
 MMS is distributed on Internet sites and online auctions by multiple independent distributors. Although the products share the MMS name, the look of the labeling may vary. 
 The product instructs consumers to mix the 28 percent sodium chlorite solution with an acid such as citrus juice. This mixture produces chlorine dioxide, a potent bleach used for stripping textiles and industrial water treatment. High oral doses of this bleach, such as those recommended in the labeling, can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms of severe dehydration. 
 MMS claims to treat multiple unrelated diseases, including HIV, hepatitis, the H1N1 flu virus, common colds, acne, cancer, and other conditions. The FDA is not aware of any research that MMS is effective in treating any of these conditions. MMS also poses a significant health risk to consumers who may choose to use this product for self-treatment instead of seeking FDA-approved treatments for these conditions. 
 The FDA continues to investigate and may pursue civil or criminal enforcement actions as appropriate to protect the public from this potentially dangerous product. 
 The FDA advises consumers who have experienced any negative side effects from MMS to consult a health care professional as soon as possible and to discard the product. Consumers and health care professionals should report adverse events to the FDA’s MedWatch program at 800-FDA-1088 or online at  http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm . One has to question whether AutismOne spent any thought about promoting giving bleach orally or  rectally  to disabled children before accepting this speaker. Seriously, how hard is it to consider that forcing anyone, and especially disabled children, to drink bleach is a bad idea?

"21299" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/30/boyd-haley-comments-on-the-fda-warning-letter/" "Boyd Haley comments on the FDA warning letter." "Below is a communication attributed to Boyd Haley .  He is the president of CTI Science which is marketing “OSR#1”. OSR#1 is a chemical which was originally invented to chelate wastewater from mining operations.  Mr. Haley’s company markets it, not for its chelating properties, but as a source of “oxidative stress relief” (OSR).  The FDA has recently sent him a  warning letter  noting that it is likely that OSR is (a) not a supplement and (b) is a drug. Jaquelyn:  Below is my response to the Chicago Trib article.  We have also had our legal help contact the FDA and explain our position.  They have extended our time to respond in detail until the end of July and implied that they are willing to work with us on this issue.  
 The article by the Chicago Tribune and the warning letter from the FDA are fueled by a misconception.  The chemical name of OSR#1 is N1N3-bis-(2-mercaptoethyl)isophthalamide which makes it sound to many like an exceptionally complex chemical with no natural components.  However, looking at the structure of OSR it is easily seen that it contains a benzoate group (found in cranberries) and two cystamines (a metabolite of cysteine and found in all mammalian cells and on the terminal end of Coenzyme-A). The coupling of cystamine to benzoate is through the same type of amide linkage found in connecting amino acids to produce protein. 
 The FDA description of a dietary supplement as extracted from their letter is: To be a dietary supplement, a product must, among other things, “bear [ ] or contain [ ] one or more…dietary ingredients” as defined in section 20 I (11)( I) of the Act, 21 U.S.c.§ 321 (ff)( I). Section 20 1(11)( 1) or the Act defines “dietary ingredient” as a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, or dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.   Using this description it is obvious to a biochemist that OSR#1 bears and contains two dietary ingredients.  It appears as if the chemical name (which we had to place on the label) has confused this issue.  Hopefully this can be cleared up. 
 Regarding the toxic effects the FDA and Chicago Tribune comment on.  The diarrhea and pancreas problems reported occurred during an UP/DOWN study to determine the LD-50 of OSR, that is “what amount of OSR would cause 50% of the test animals to die?”.  Problem was that during the experimentation, even to reach the 5 grams/kg body weight they finally achieved, the researchers had to give the OSR (dissolved in corn oil) at three different times during the day.  Even then the test animals showed no weight loss or ataxia or other signs of toxicity except diarrhea and a pancreas abnormality.  They were giving these animals massive doses (e.g. 1,000 to 5,000 times the recommended level for humans) trying to kill them.  Almost all supplemental materials would cause some problems at these levels and the LD-50 of OSR (decided to be greater than 5 g/kg) is considerably above the LD-50 of some commonly used supplemental compounds used today. 
For example, a 220 lb (100 kg) person would have to take 500 grams/day or 5,000 OSR capsules/day to reach the 5 g/kg body weight level.  We recommend 1 capsule or 0.1 gram/day level usage (i.e. 100mg) which is 5,000 times below the 5 gram/kg level in this example.  When the long term study was done and the maximum amount tested was 1 gram/kg body weight the diarrhea and pancreas issues disappeared.  At 1 gram/kg a 220 lb person would have to take 1,000 capsules/day to reach a level where no toxic effects were noted.  In it’s initial letter responding to our Premarket Notification the FDA did not mention these test animal toxicity studies as being of any concern.  I don’t know what changed their minds to make them go back and review this, but their review and the comments in this recent letter do not reflect a concern I would agree with. 
 Also, OSR has never been promoted by CTI Science as a treatment for any specific disease and FDA disclaimers are on every package. 
 I would point out that the FDA warning letter was not based on any reported adverse effect.  Since CTI Science has been selling OSR (about 2 years) we have not had one severe adverse effect reported to our FDA based adverse effect reporting system.  We have had many very positive responses from physicians and parents regarding the use of OSR.  However, the fact is that I have to obey the FDA directive or risk damage to my co-workers as well as myself, and/or spend the funds to legally counter the FDA decision.  What to do is under study.  But from the above, you can see why I strongly believe that OSR is a dietary supplement by FDA criteria and that it is without detectable toxicity at the levels recommended.

 CTI Science, Inc. It appears to this reader that Mr. Haley’s defense hinges on the part of the law which defines a supplement as “…or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories”.  In particular, he appears to be claiming that his compound, which is apparently in the same form in a food, is a “combination” of other ingredients. Mr. Haley can point to the various constituents of the molecule he is producing and marketing and state, “that part is from a food”.    But, is that a valid argument?  Does the law really intend that “combination” means “mixture” as in, say, a multivitamin? Here is the full section of the law defining a “supplement” ff) The term “dietary supplement”— 
 (1) means a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: 
 (A) a vitamin; 
 (B) a mineral; 
 (C) an herb or other botanical; 
 (D) an amino acid; 
 (E) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or 
 (F) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in clause (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E); 
 (2) means a product that— 
 (A)(i) is intended for ingestion in a form described in section 411(c)(1)(B)(i); or 
 (ii) complies with section 411(c)(1)(B)(ii); 
 (B) is not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet; and 
 (C) is labeled as a dietary supplement; and 
 (3) does— 
 (A) include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 or licensed as a biologic under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) and was, prior to such approval, certification, or license, marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food unless the Secretary has issued a regulation, after notice and comment, finding that the article, when used as or in a dietary supplement under the conditions of use and dosages set forth in the labeling for such dietary supplement, is unlawful under section 402(f); and 
 (B) not include— 
 (i) an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505, certified as an antibiotic under section 507  7, or licensed as a biologic under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), or 
 (ii) an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, which was not before such approval, certification, licensing, or authorization marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food unless the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, has issued a regulation, after notice and comment, finding that the article would be lawful under this Act. 
 Except for purposes of section 201(g), a dietary supplement shall be deemed to be a food within the meaning of this Act. I’m trying to find some sort of case-law that would help define the word “combination” here.  But I feel that Mr. Haley’s interpretation is not likely to hold.  Mr Haley has in the past described OSR#1 as “totally without toxicity”.  Now, “Even then the test animals showed no weight loss or ataxia or other signs of toxicity except diarrhea and a pancreas abnormality. ”  Yes, those animals were given massive doses.  But, once again, it comes down to definition of words.  Is Mr. Haley using the word “totally” appropriately?  Is OSR#1 “totally” without toxicity?

Treatment of Tariq Nadama" "This post was sent to me, as is by someone who wanted to write about this. I was happy to ‘host’ it. Does the DAN! ‘Protocol’ have more to do with an autistic child’s death than meets the eye? Why does the newly re-designed Autism Research Institue’s (ARI) website still contain a statement about the death of Tariq Nadama, by Bernard Rimland (1928-2006), that appears to be based on old information and doesn’t amount to much more than logical fallacy? Does it matter that two physicians who treated Tariq Nadama are ARI-listed as DAN! practitioners? The ARI website appears to have recently undergone some serious change. While such change may certainly have some supporters (after all, even Michael Jackson has die-hard supporters), in my opinion, it seems to call attention to the possibility that there are more flaws visible now (links to Generation Rescue), than there were to begin with. Perhaps some of the “less than pretty” parts stand out just a little bit more than they used to. The apparent involvement of DAN! practitioners in the “treatment” of Tariq Nadama, and a mother convinced that her child was “autistic due to immunization shots” is a good example. I actually find it hard to believe that this statement is still up on the ARI website, given  what is now known about the story : A DAN! practitioner (and endorser of ARI’s “Treatment Options for Mercury/Metal Toxicity in Autism and Related Developmental Disabilities: Consensus Position Paper”)  apparently  referred the Nadamas to Roy Kerry , it doesn’t appear to be the case that Tariq had “been mistakenly been given a ‘look-alike’ drug” since Roy Kerry’s apparently prescribed  the use of IV disodium EDTA , ENDRATEand Roy Kerry  apparently became  a \" DAN!  \"  after  the death of Tariq Nadama.

The Safety and Efficacy of Chelation Therapy in Autism 
Statement by Bernard Rimland, Ph.D., Director, Autism Research Institute regarding death on August 23, 2005 of 5 year-old Tariq Nadama Of Pittsburgh, who was given intravenous EDTA chelation I have received many media calls regarding the above, very unfortunate matter.Although the autopsy conducted immediately after Tariq’s death was inconclusive, the medical community and the press quickly leaped to the (incorrect) conclusion that Tariq’s death was due to chelation therapy. A later formal report by Mary Jean Brown of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that Tariq’s death was not caused by properly administered chelation, but was instead a result of a drug error. He had mistakenly been given a ‘look-alike’ drug, Disodium EDTA, instead of Calcium Disodium EDTA.Here is some additional information about chelation: 
1.	Chelation is not used to treat autism, but rather to treat heavy metal overload (lead, mercury, cadmium, etc), which is a major cause of autism and retardation. 
2.	Tens of thousands of children and hundreds of thousands of adults have been treated safely with chelation therapy for many decades. 
3.	The child’s mother, Marwa Nadama, said that her son showed such remarkable improvement after the first few chelation treatments that if she had a choice, she would choose chelation again. 
4.	Conventional physicians, who have been critical of chelation, routinely use drugs such as Risperdal and Clonidine in treating autism. Death is a known side-effect of such drugs (read the labels!). Such deaths get no media attention. In 2005 the Food and Drug Administration reviewed the research literature on Risperdal in autistic individuals. They decided not to approve Risperdal because of the number of deaths associated with it. Despite this deadly “side-effect” of Risperdal, it continues to be the most frequently prescribed drug for autistic individuals. 
5.	Most autistic children who are chelated are chelated orally or transdermally (by gel, through the skin), as suggested in our Defeat Autism Now! (DAN!Â®) document available at our website  http://www.autism.com . 
6.	Thousands of parents of autistic children, treated safely with chelation, report, like Tariq Nadama’s mother, that their children have shown remarkable improvement after chelation was initiated. Formal data collection is just getting underway, but the initial data, on several hundred children is very encouraging: 
7.	Since 1967 The Autism Research Institute has collected “Parent Ratings of Behavioral Effects of Biomedical Interventions.” To date, over 24,500 parent responses have been collected. Chelation is a recent addition to our list of interventions. So far, of the first 470 parents who reported on the efficacy of chelation, 75% report “good” results, which is by far the highest “good” percentage reported for any of the 88 biomedical interventions (including 53 drugs) the parents have rated. See:  http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/treatment/form34q.htm . See related article titled “Chelation: The story behind the headlines” Okay, now that it’s refreshed in your memories, let’s take a much closer look at this statement. Although the autopsy conducted immediately after Tariq’s death was inconclusive, the medical community and the press quickly leaped to the (incorrect) conclusion that Tariq’s death was due to chelation therapy. A later formal report by Mary Jean Brown of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that Tariq’s death was not caused by properly administered chelation, but was instead a result of a drug error. He had mistakenly been given a ‘look-alike’ drug, Disodium EDTA, instead of Calcium Disodium EDTA. What the ARI website doesn’t tell you, is that the  Order To Show Cause  by The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs before the Pennsylvania State Board Of Medicine (the complaint against Dr. Roy Kerry, the Pennsylvania doctor who prescribed the chelation therapy drug that resulted in the death of Tariq Nadama), leaves very little question about what apparently really happened: 
“69. Respondent spoke to Professional Conduct Investigator of the Bureau of Enforcement and Investigator concerning his treatment of Tariq.” 
“70. Respondent admitted that EDTA is very rare to use on children.” 
“71. Respondent admitted to using Disodium EDTA to chelate Tariq.” 
“72. Respondent stated to Investigator Reiser that Disodium EDTA is the only formula of EDTA he stocks in his office.” 
“73. Respondent admitted that CaNa2EDTA is available but that he has never used this agent.” Mary Jean Brown’s statement to the press was apparently  made in January of 2006 . The Order To Show Cause was not made public until September of 2006, so it’s understandable that ARI’s statement from March of 2006 does not reflect this new information. Isn’t it time for ARI to update their statement? Here is some additional information about chelation: 
 1. Chelation is not used to treat autism, but rather to treat heavy metal overload (lead, mercury, cadmium, etc), which is a major cause of autism and retardation. Okay, so this is probably a statement of belief on the part of Bernard Rimland. I am not aware of any science supports the notion that heavy metals are “a major cause of autism” let alone that autistic children in general are “overloaded” with such metals.  Why not just leave the explanation at, “Chelation is sometimes used to treat heavy metal toxicity”, or re-phrase it as a clear statement of belief? It also seems clear from the Order To Show Cause that there doesn’t appear to be any evidence that Tariq was “overloaded” with heavy metals. “44. Respondent obtained a “post provocative” urine sample from Tariq on July 22, 2005.” 
“45. A “post provocative” sample is a urine sample taken after the patient has been subject to drug therapy or chelation.” 
“46. The laboratory report of this sample was completed on July 29, 2005 and sent to Respondent.” 
“47. This laboratory report listed Tariqâ€™s lead level as “elevated” but not in the “very elevated” reference range.” 
“48. It should be noted that this laboratory report has a notation in bold print that reads â€œReference ranges are representative of a healthy population under non-challenge or nonÂ¬provoked conditions.”” 
“49. Tariq had a minimal elevation of his lead level.” 2. Tens of thousands of children and hundreds of thousands of adults have been treated safely with chelation therapy for many decades. Apparently,  death is not as uncommon  as ARI’s website might have readers believe, but aside from that, an appeal to the number of people treated with chelation therapy says absolutely nothing about the appropriateness (or major lack thereof) of chelation therapy for autism. While Rimland’s statement is clear that chelation is used to treat heavy metal toxicity, it seems pretty obvious from the Order To Show Cause that this probably was not the case given the lab results discussed and apparent desire on the part of the mother for the procedure. 16. The current complaint notation reads “wants to have iv … edta injection … an iv push. mother states Tariq is autistic due to immunization shots he was a normal pregnancy .. 1st shots were given the day he was born … no sx noted until age 18 mo … has had 12 other inoculation by time he was 18 mo old/…” 3. The child’s mother, Marwa Nadama, said that her son showed such remarkable improvement after the first few chelation treatments that if she had a choice, she would choose chelation again. Hmm. Apparently it was the third treatment that killed Tariq, so to say he showed remarkable improvement after the first “few” chelation treatments would seem rather difficult. I suppose it’s possible that she may have been referring to other previous chelation attempts which may fall under the: 
 “has not been responding 10 other types of therapies and therefore she is recommending EDTA”  described in the Order To Show Cause, but that doesn’t make sense that she would view them as having been responsible for “remarkable improvement”. I guess we’ll just have to chalk this one up to “appeal to testimonial”. 4. Conventional physicians, who have been critical of chelation, routinely use drugs such as Risperdal and Clonidine in treating autism. Death is a known side-effect of such drugs (read the labels!). Such deaths get no media attention. In 2005 the Food and Drug Administration reviewed the research literature on Risperdal in autistic individuals. They decided not to approve Risperdal because of the number of deaths associated with it. Despite this deadly “side-effect” of Risperdal, it continues to be the most frequently prescribed drug for autistic individuals. Tu Quoque! Two “wrongs” do not make a “right”. Risperdal is irrelevant to the safety or efficacy of chelation.  5. Most autistic children who are chelated are chelated orally or transdermally (by gel, through the skin), as suggested in our Defeat Autism Now! (DAN!) document available at our website  http://www.autism.com . Ah the good old appeal to popularity. Are readers to assume that because most autistic children who are chelated are chelated orally or transdermally, that it acutally does anything for autism itself, or that chelation is safe? Are readers to assume that because this is what’s popular, that the (DAN!Â®) document available at their website  http://www.autism.com  will appropriately caution about IV EDTA chelation? The (DAN!Â®) document discusses three common chelators. It does mention IV adminstration of “many different agents”, but it doesn’t appear to mention, exclude, or warn about EDTA by name at all. _”There are many different agents for detoxification of metals, and some agents can be administered in different ways (IV, oral, rectal suppository, transdermal). The three major ones we will discuss include DMSA, DMPS, and TTFD. “_ It should be tempting to think that a document devoted to chelation, and endorsed by thrity-three professionals, would exclude EDTA. After all, the name “EDTA” is not specific to either of the two types of EDTA (Endrate or Versenate), and it’s use is notably cautioned by its own package insert. 6. Thousands of parents of autistic children, treated safely with chelation, report, like Tariq Nadama’s mother, that their children have shown remarkable improvement after chelation was initiated. Formal data collection is just getting underway, but the initial data, on several hundred children is very encouraging: I don’t expect that this is any kind of data that would be peer-reviewed and published in mainstream scientific literature, but I suppose I could be wrong. 7. Since 1967 The Autism Research Institute has collected “Parent Ratings of Behavioral Effects of Biomedical Interventions.” To date, over 24,500 parent responses have been collected. Chelation is a recent addition to our list of interventions. So far, of the first 470 parents who reported on the efficacy of chelation, 75% report “good” results, which is by far the highest “good” percentage reported for any of the 88 biomedical interventions (including 53 drugs) the parents have rated. See:  http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/treatment/form34q.htm . 
See related article titled “Chelation: The story behind the headlines” Parent Ratings? Please read what  Prometheus had to say  about this. But what’s one to make of “88 Biomedical interventions (including 53 drugs)!? Fifty-three? Holy experimentation Batman! 
Let’s recap. 1) According to documents from Roy Kerry’s office, Tariq’s mother apparently came to believe her autistic child is autistic “due to immunization shots”. 
2) Somewhere along the way, the parents seek treatment from DAN! practitioner, and endorser of the DAN!Â® “Treatment Options for Mercury/Metal Toxicity” document,  Anju Usman. 
3) While under the care (or prior to being under the care) of DAN! practitioner Anju Usman, some 10 odd therapies apparently fail to produce desired results. (This may or may not have included oral and or transdermal chelation as well). 
4) The DAN! document makes no warning about IV EDTA. In fact, DAN! practitioner Anju Usman apparently refers Nadama family to Dr. Roy Kerry for IV EDTA chelation (she may have actually been the physician who recommended CaNa2EDTA – line 43 of the Order To Show Cause). 
5) Roy Kerry (not a DAN! practitioner at the time according to Bernard Rimland), is the physician who prescribed Endrate. 
6) Tariq Nadama is dead. 
7) Roy Kerry is now listed as a DAN! practitioner.

 We got out of the car at a little dirt parking lot at the side of the road in Jersey horse country and as Jim took down the bikes and Charlie hopped out of the car, I went to the trunk to retrieve the helmets and the green bag with the gloves. 
 Two helmets, check. Green bag, zero. 
 Charlie had gleefully put the helmets and the two big warm  yellow jackets  -- he always put them in the car, even on 90-plus degree days in the summer -- and, assured in his creature of habit ways, I was sure he had included the green bag too. I'm not sure why, but he hadn't and we hadn't thought to check (creature of habit child turns his parents into creature of habits too). 
 Jim and I exchanged looks and accepted the inevitable: (1) It must be a bike ride without gloves. (2) Charlie might get upset as getting out the green bag and  donning his gloves is all part of the riding routine . (And Charlie wore his gloves all through the hottest days of summer.) 
 We said twice or thrice that we didn't have the bag and the gloves and that he could ride without them. Charlie's eyes opened wide and he said 'gloves. gloves' and then Jim set Charlie's bike by the road and go onto his own and Charlie, a bit balkily, started moving into the routine. 
 They did 11 miles into the wind. The temperature hovered around 50, or going gloveless would have been far more difficult -- as it was, after a good lunch, both Jim and Charlie conked out soundly for a bit. 
 Charlie was ready for another good-paced bike ride on waking. Afterwards, on seeing me put two Capri Sun juices into the refrigerator, he took out his old beat-up blue book bag from the chair where he had kept it for the past week and stuck in it the notebook that his teacher and I write in. Both his old lunch boxes and the new ones he had used last week were on the kitchen table and I asked Charlie if he'd like 'these' (old) or 'those' (new). 
 'These,' said Charlie. 
 I put the juices in and some fruit and a pack of sushi and Charlie took both lunch boxes, put them in the blue bag and buckled it shut. 'School tomorrow?' asked Jim. 'School tomorrow,' Charlie responded with a grin, the polar opposite of  last Sunday's all-out return-to-school anxiety attack . 
 I guess Charlie needed a whole week, after the unexpected week off, to get back into going-to-school mode. Some changes can be more readily processed than others.

 Friday night, as Charlie was taking off his shoes after we came in from getting him a burrito, he said 'Gong Gong,' the Cantonese word for (maternal) grandfather. He definitely knows things are different with my dad; after seeing that  my dad  is bald (his hair is growing back), Charlie kept looking at my mom's head, I guess to make sure she still has her hair. 
  Charlie said 'Gong Gong' again, I said 'he's your pal; we had good times.' Charlie put his shoes in his socks and lined them up. 
  He was in a merry mood after that, running his usual circuit back and forth from our kitchen to the living room (not a huge space, especially as his legs are so long now). But after going to bed, Charlie couldn't sleep and, around 10 pm, asked for a walk. 
  As we had already done two, not to mention a solid neighborhood bike ride, Jim and I said it was late. Charlie went up to bed then did not sleep for quite awhile. 
  Then at 3am we heard the distinctive sounds of Wags the dog liking to tango which he calls Wango. 
  Charlie came down the stairs a couple of times then went back to bed at Jim's suggestion. I'm not sure if Charlie actually went to sleep though as he was back down the stairs at 5am. He alternated sitting in his brown chair, standing and going up the stairs and then, at 6am, he and I went for a walk as the sun was rising. We came home, Charlie had something to eat, then sat in his chair and is sleeping now. 
  He did not get upset at either my parents' arrival or departure on this visit but of course still has to process a lot of feelings.

 Charlie was in a great mood all day Monday, even though -- who knows, maybe because! -- he woke at 1.30am, 2.30am or 5am: He was awake (as signalled by knuckle-cracking and turning on his iPad) at all those times. By 5.45am, he and I were out for a walk. 
  By 8.30pm, Charlie was in bed after the usual good rounds of his routine: Bus, school, home, waiting for dad to come home, bike ride, dinner. 
  I think he may be on the verge of waking right now: If these very early wake-ups are going to be the new sleep pattern for awhile, good thing they've coincided with the end of Jim's and my semesters of teaching.

 Wednesday has been decidedly unpopular around here as it's  the day Jim teaches all day . 
  Meaning that (taking a more Charliesque view of things), it is the Day Without A Bike Ride. 
  Happily, with the spring semester almost over, there remains but one more Wednesday, next week's. I was feeling wary after  last week's book throwing and fit of soda dumping . That Wednesday had begun with Charlie in smiles and so did this one: Would these remain? 
 For the most part, yes. There were two walks without too much running, in very pleasant cool spring weather. There was a moment of mild panic/worry when Charlie, around 8.30pm (about a half-hour after I had given him some melatonin), asked to go to the convenience store. This meant one thing: He wanted to get ice cream -- something we have been completely avoiding since realizing the very bad effect it has on his stomach and, subsequently, his head. 
  I talked about waiting for Jim to come home, maybe going tomorrow (but really, maybe not; Charlie being Charlie, going to the convenience store and getting vanilla ice cream are one and the same activities). Then I went to the kitchen as Charlie stood standing and thinking and whisked out a  secretly concealed box of brownie mix . 
  We made those and I cut up some fruit and asked if he'd like the timer? 
  'Yes, timer,' said Charlie and ran upstairs to get his iPad. 
  He spent a good deal of the rest of the evening with iPad to ear, for over two hours. After 10.30pm we heard Jim's voice (he was on his cell phone) and I opened the door. 'Dad, dad!' said Charlie. 
  Once Jim stepped inside Charlie insisted that he immediately take off his shoes and socks. Charlie arranged them neatly, then stood looking at his iPad. I figured the timer still had a few more minutes. But what would Charlie request once the timer went off? 
  I readied 'why it's too late to go out now' explanations. The timedrbuzzed. 
 'Bedtime,' said Charlie and went up to his room without any further ado. 
 He was asleep at midnight after some video watching.

 Sometimes (especially after  some craziness ) things happen a bit like clockwork. 
 Like Charlie getting out of bed and getting dressed just as the schoolbus was pulling up at 7.45am, and running on (without his bookbag, which I gave to the driver). 
 Like him, after a good day at school and another bus ride home, taking out the garbage without me asking. 
 Like him asking for two bike rides, and readily assenting to don his reflective vest for the second one. 
 Like him shooing me out of the kitchen so he could grab a huge half-watermelon and eat it \"his way,\" by scooping out frosty, sweetly dripping pieces, and then grabbing a towel to wipe up all the juice on the counter and carefully hanging it over a kitchen chair. 
 Like Charlie announcing 'bedtime' at 9.30pm and running up the stairs and, for the second straight night in a row, just going to sleep, and before 11 pm, to the sound of ocean waves on his iPad.

 Counting the one ride they did on Sunday, Jim calculated that he and Charlie biked 106 miles since Thursday.  
 So no big surprise that the two of them spent a good chunk of Sunday conked out on the couch. 
  It rained, rained, and rained for most of Sunday. Charlie had slept in till 9am and was ready to go out but waited seven hours (wearing his bicycle helmet) to get on his bike. In the course of waiting, he ceased his pacing to sit on the couch and, as it turned out, to catch up on his sleep (still wearing that helmet, and his biking gloves). 
  After calling for 'camp!' and packing his lunchboxes in the early evening, Charlie ran down the stairs and emptied both. Then it became 'no camp,' very seriously uttered: Charlie working through his anxieties about  something entirely new . 
 He wanted another bike ride but it was getting dark and it was raining. So we both donned rain jackets and walked through puddles, occasionally pelting rain and a very soggy grassy field. Charlie has become a real trooper about enduring all sorts of weather conditions and moved at his usual steady, fast pace with me following up the rear and musing about how once I used to worry about him getting just a little wet.

 In the past, after a  big storm , Charlie has woken up still stormy and we've slugged through the day(s) together until things calm -- sometimes it has taken a week, plus. 
  Sunday he slept in till 10am. We all went on a walk, draggily. Then he called for a bike ride, off he and Jim went, I dashed to the store, Jim texted me Charlie was teary. Then Jim said Charlie had called to go to the hamburger stand they pass on the ride -- which we once used to go to all the time when Charlie was younger -- so he and Jim had burgers 'n' fries on the metal counter amid a number of bikers (of the other kind of bikes). Charlie cheered up. 
  Was it a sort of conciliatory, nostalgia gesture? 
  He was tired but gradually cheerier throughout the day. He seemed on the verge of a nap in the afternoon then woke after I made another fast dash to the pharmacy (it's only 3 minutes away). He wanted his favorite burrito and we got him one and then, after a walk, he must have run down the stairs from his room to check that I had indeed put his lunchboxes, with the juices, in the shelf on the refrigerator a half-dozen times at least. 
 When I called this morning that I saw the bus, Charlie ran out (in mid-processing mode) and stationed himself on the sidewalk, looking ardently up the street and he ran as eagerly on.

    We had talked about going to the beach on Sunday but our emphasizing to Charlie that swimming would only be possible with lifeguards following  his Easter adventure  led to him saying a definite NO about a beach bike ride. Instead, we went back to New Jersey horse country. While he could hardly wait to do 20-something miles  on Saturday , on Sunday his enthusiasm lagged and seeing a leashless dog at the start did not help. Charlie rode quietly off with Jim and was unsettled and pedaling slow. Jim decided to try something different and led Charlie down by the river; this perked out boy up. Something about being near the water does him good. Unfortunately more dogs and dog owners were espied so Jim cut the ride short. Later in the afternoon, he and Charlie attempted a second bike ride, the start of which you can see above. Charlie again lacked his usual pep in riding. Jim kept them going, albeit slowly, and when they came back around 6.30 pm, they had done 16 miles and gone through five towns,  Charlie had that glow of accomplishment. Sticking with it is the way to go.

 The watchman whose speech opens Aeschylus'  Oresteia  has been on the lookout for ten years for his ruler, Agamemnon, to return from the Trojan War. So what's one Thursday night of keeping watch to herald in (hopefully) a peaceful easy Friday, Charlie's second day of school? 
 He had a major spell of full-laced anxiety starting around 8pm. His mind became locked into having to go to the 'closed permanently' Mexican restaurant. Jim drove us hither and yon as Charlie called to go 'this way' and 'that way' to this and that place. Then after Charlie had said NO to every suggestion he'd just said yes to, we went home. Then Charlie refused to get out of the car for over an hour. Jim brought out his laptop and got some work done, sitting in the backseat beside Charlie who was now calling for 'Jersey City.' I went in and out to do laundry,cut up an apple that Charlie seemed glad to eat after telling me NO to apples all day, and sat on the porch to eat dinner. After Charlie came in we added up the reasons for his being in heavy-duty anxiety mind-lock mode for some time: 1. The closure of said Mexican restaurant. 2. My parents returning home on Tuesday. 3. School starting. 4. No school on Thursday for Rosh Hashanah. 5. School on Friday. 6. Jim back to teaching. 7. Me back to teaching. 8. A change in the weather to lovely cooler temperatures. 9. Lag from #1, making it through summer, etc.

 Despite being tired and weary on a Monday when, the majority of the leaves being off the trees and brown instead of yellow or orange or red, you know it is the later part of autumn, Charlie got up on his own for the 7.35am bus; went through the day with  extra anxiety  noted; came home and snacked and waited for Jim to get back; rode bikes in the dusk with reflective vests and bike lights blinking and with some rain, but nothing like the downpours they've been through; ate dinner and moved various things (a black fleece vest, Jim's shoes with socks tucked neatly in them) around to  his systematic liking ; went, very pleasedly, to bed. 
 And fell so soundly asleep at 8.30pm that he slept through Jim leaving to get my parents at the airport, my parents arriving, us talking. 
  Once again,  having that much anxiety takes a lot of energy . 
  (On the part of the parents too.)

  We continue to experience insomnia in all possible manifestations.  It's the second night in a row  that Charlie has, after falling asleep around 10.30/11pm, woken a few hours later, at 2am this time (signaled by the chipper voice of Baby Bop being heard from his room), He had a watermelon and fries snack and then turned on the Pogues, then Barney and we are all bunking out on our first floor where it's a lot cooler. He and Jim had a great 23 mile day. He was really really good about going to lie down, with a timer on, from about 3 - 7.30am, Saturday morning. It's been humid and in the 90s with thunderstorms brewing -- there was one in the afternoon that brought a spot of rain so Jim and Charlie came back from an afternoon local ride, waited about 20 minutes until the sky was getting blue, then went out again. Happily, the skies were clearish in the evening so we could go for the last night of the local firemen's carnival we've patronized for years.  Am wagering, weather conditions (with a dash of teenager round-the-clock hunger pangs) are a factor in the latest curious sleep pattern. As those are predicted through Monday, and this is a transition week with ESY ending Wednesday and camp starting Thursday, I anticipate quite a few more nights of on and of sleep!

 Sunday is always an anticipatory day for Charlie as he readies himself for Monday and the return to school. Charlie being Charlie, the anticipating starts about 18 hours before the actual event, i.e., 7.30am Monday when the bus arrives. He calls for his meals early (dinner becomes more like mid-afternoon snack), as if doing so will speed up the day and pouf, it will already be time to get onto that bus. 
 He slept in a little (past 8am) Sunday morning. Keeping in mind  his weepiness in the car Saturday morning , we decided to 'stay local,' at home. 
 Charlie didn't object. There was a morning bike ride, fast and strong, though he was edgy on returning home and until after lunch. He spent a good hour wandering around the house, standing, staring and making curious (and distinctively Charlie) noises. 
 By the latter part of the afternoon and after a run-walk, Charlie was far more at ease and ready for a long bike ride of 11 miles on a course he and Jim had not done since the fall, on a bike path that starts in our town and takes them past a golf course in another town and, somehow (I guess they went quite off the path), beside the exit for the Garden State Parkway two towns over. Charlie wanted to keep going but Jim was not sure of the streets (and didn't want to call me should they end up in some unknown place and good thing because my Jersey driving skills are far better than they were when I came out here to college 25 some years ago but hardly at any sort of masterful level). So they came home. 
 After some dinner and a walk (that was more of a walk), Charlie headed up to his room. He asked me to help him type in the YouTube search box for some Teletubbies videos. 
 Then, until just before he went to sleep, the sounds of Jimi Hendrix (including a bit of an album I just added to Charlie's iPad,  Axis Bold As Love ) could be heard. Indeed, when I glanced in Charlie's room, he was stretched out with the iPad to his ear and  Electric Ladyland  blasting away. 
 How he is growing and growing up!

 After  missing a day , Charlie made sure he and Jim got in their  three bike rides  on Thursday, 100 degree heat be d**d. 
 
 It was still sunny and really warm by bike ride #2. 
 
 The sun was setting as they ventured out for #3, which maybe made it cooler? 
 Charlie and I finished up the daily round of exercise with a 60 percent run / 40 percent walk. After all that, he still couldn't sleep until past midnight, due to the heat but also his anxieties, which led to him running down the stairs at intervals to check that Jim was indeed on the couch and not wearing socks: Sure signs that Dad's here at home with his boy.

 One of the great things about living in New Jersey? 
 You get to see the above view should you, as Charlie insisted, drive east on the  Pulaski Skyway  towards the Holland Tunnel and Manhattan. We stopped short of heading into the city, opting for the twisting familiarity of Jersey City streets. 
 Charlie was bedeviled by stomach trouble and sniffles for much of the day, even conking out for an hour after school and foregoing his usual bike ride (though I had taken the bikes out; Charlie, at my request, put them nicely back into the shed). But Charlie was definitely smiling when Jim drove the white car up into the Skyway. 
 He knows where you go to get the best.

      Charlie had a very high level of energy  Saturday  and, consequently (as you may have noted), needed an awful lot of physical activity in the form of 7 walks in our neighborhood, 1 long walk in  Liberty State Park , 1 shorter walk on the Hoboken waterfront, and 2 fast fast bike rides with Jim. He still didn't fall asleep till 1am, and woke up at his usual time Sunday morning, around 8am. We had decided to break up the Spring Break routine of a walk, ride for bagels, walk, bike ride, hanging around the house (or trying to, as Charlie wants to gogogo), going on a longer outing. So took off for the oceab just around 9.30am. Charlie fell asleep on the ride down and woke just as we were nearing the beach. It takes him a good hour to fully wake up when he's home in his own bed. Sleeping in the back seat of the car isn't, of course, as comfortable, especially when you're Charlie's height, with long gangly legs. While he knew we were going to the ocean, it must have been disorienting to wake up and realize,  we're here !.   We wanted to go for a longer walk---the weather was amazing, mid-70s with the sun out and the light not as harsh as it was further inland---and went to a spot where you can walk through some dunes to the beach. Due to  all the rain we had earlier in the week , the wooden walkway was flooded. Of course, I had remembered to bring extra everything except for socks. We considered urging Charlie to take off his socks and shoes (and, indeed, someone had carefully placed a pair of sneakers and socks just at the edge of the puddle on the ramp) but, a couple of weeks ago, he'd done this and expected he'd be able to swim in the ocean as he does in the summer and, though it was a warm day, the ocean needs a couple more months to warm up.   Turning back when we're headed in one direction has been known to irk Charlie, as if he can't quickly process the abrupt change in our trajectory, physically and in his thinking. He assented to walking back, getting into the car and driving to another spot---and then, after getting out of the car again, he cried out, grabbed at us, threw himself on the ground. Jim and I got Charlie right back up on his feet and started walking on the sand: Nothing like a big wide open space to walk things out. We turned back after a bit and walked towards a diner and got some lunch, and went to another spot (fortunately Jim really knows his way around). Charlie got right out and led the way through some tall reeds. It was the beach where  he'd run into the wind  so happily last weekend and Jim and I followed, only to see Charlie hesitating after going a few hundred feet. A brown and white dog was running with its owner on the sand. Of late, Charlie will walk by a dog if he or she is on a leash, but this dog was definitely not. Jim and I tried walking a little further and coaxing Charlie, but he kept walking back, occasionally looking over his shoulder.   So it was back in the car. Jim drove us to yet another spot on the beach---we wanted to get in one peaceful moment!---though Charlie's often wanted to stay in the car when we've gone there. But this time, he wanted out and he walked and hung out on the sand with the sandpipers. This part of the beach is a bit of a cove and we stood and watched three surfers in the waves. After all that, it was time to head home. Charlie again asked to take a local route and we made good time and then we found ourselves going the wrong way on a bigger road, turned back, and decided just to keep driving until we ended up on the Garden State Parkway. This meant a much longer ride than anticipated but there was one definite advantage: We ended up heading back east, towards the ocean. Once home, Charlie wanted a bike ride. He really wanted to go out again in the car after that but Jim and I knew we'd all had enough. I wrote out a schedule (ocean--ride--home--bike--dinner at home--computer--bedtime). \"No bedtime,\" Charlie said and sat down by the open front door. I started cooking, Jim did some work on his computer, and then we decided on a really fast trip out, just to get gas. Charlie told us \"order to go\" and \"this way, this way\"; we  uh-huh'd  and nodded and noted we had food at home. Once there, Charlie rummaged in the fridge and cabinets and got the things he wanted. He sat on the couch and munched away, waiting while the computer started up and I went over his Spring Break social story and calendar with him. Charlie looked, finally, peaceful, not tense. Ten minutes on the computer and Charlie said \"bedtime.\" I tucked in a smiling boy and went downstairs.  Jim and I anticipated hearing the thumping of feet and a request for one more walk but, before 8pm, Charlie was definitely out like the proverbial light.  And so ends yet another Spring Break.  After which, all three of us could use some extra rest.  Or maybe even a vacation.

 Wednesday was the  third day   in a row  for Charlie not feeling so good and having a tough day at school and, after a good bike ride, strugging at home. He's seemed caught in a glum rut; it's certainly happened before, that he has had a series of tough days and sometimes I think the only thing to do is to wait for things, for time, to pass. 
 After getting suddenly, very upset in the early evening, we found ourselves all sitting in a rather tense way, Charlie in the black chair. He kept saying 'iPad' and it seemed time for him to hear something besides the few albums (Disney in particular) he has been playing over and over (a sign of him being troubled). I turned on 'The Who, why not and we all sat together for several minutes, just listening to (as Charlie echoed our words) 'different music.'  
 'It's the Who,' said Jim.  
 'Who,' said Charlie. 
 Good, if not easy, to introduce a break in the  order .

 This photo was  taken on Thanksgiving . By the end of Monday, Charlie had that bright smile, though it was bike ride-less day.  
  He was not smiling at all on Monday morning, when he took  for-ever  to get out the door for the bus as he was again wrapped up in lining up his feet and looking at them and making throaty vocalizations. But he did board the bus (somberly), made it through the school day, enjoyed an after school car ride with me (it involved a stop to the Golden Arches -- a little comfort food), a rest, a walk in the soggy, muddy, leafy field. Jim had stayed late at work and after the  travails of Sunday , Charlie was ok with a bike hiatus. 
  By day's end -- even a bit before -- he was smiling as seen in the photo above, running around the house, grinning intermittently. He still lined up  my parents' suitcases  in a neat line like oversized toy train cars and there were throaty noises and stomping. Sometimes you just have to have  one of those days  to get on to the next thing.

   Around 2pm, I saw I had just missed a call from Charlie's teacher and knew he must have had an incident. It's been several weeks since Charlie got upset at school -- it's really been a good school year for him behavior-wise (which is not to say there have not been some intense storms). I emailed his teacher and, besides Grandparent Anticipation (and possibly birthday anticipation too) and chronic sleep woes, thought to mention a change in our household, Jim and me being done teaching.    Meaning that, Jim will be home every day for a bike ride.    Meaning, a change -- and, even though it's a good change, Charlie was wary.    This was apparent to me as soon as he got off the bus. His face had the troubled look and when I said we could wait for Jim to be home, he called for the car.    At first, as Jim wouldn't be home for an hour, I said ok. Jim texted it would be best not to get in the car. I mentioned waiting again, Charlie pressed for the car.    Then he stood at a certain spot in the kitchen and called for a long local bike ride.    Smiling, we made brownies and Charlie had a big snack and then a long slow bike ride with Jim.

       Charlie could hardly wait to go for a bike ride on the Jersey horse country bike trail on Sunday morning. He burst out of the car and quickly put on his yellow jacket, helmet, gloves, and whatever you call the little Velcro strap thing that goes around his right ankle to keep his pants from catching in the bike chain.    Alas! He and Jim only did four miles as the trail that a week ago had been blooming with new growth on the trees in sunshine was now coated with ice and snow, with a river sporting ice floes beside it. When they came upon a huge tree branch that had fallen in the middle of the trail, Charlie moved to turn around and Jim was hardly going to disagree.    Charlie waited till he was home and safe in his room to get upset at the reality of the trail not being what he had envisioned. He cried and wailed, kneeling on his bed, looking at a photo of him biking on the trail from last summer with my mom and dad taking photos of him. After a half-hour, he was ok. After another half-hour, he wanted another bike ride and he and Jim did 10 miles (it was warmer, and iceless, in our neighborhood), for a total of 35 miles this past weekend.    Perhaps in the hopes of restoring a little order to a day that hadn't quite turned out as he had been envisioning, Charlie made a point of packing his lunch boxes (one contains his morning snack) himself after dinner. Charlie was still working out something about the day even as he set his thoughts ahead to Monday. He went upstairs around 9pm and we heard a dull thud-crash, and found a shelf had been knocked over. Charlie was standing in his room looking warily, and sadly, at us from under his eyebrows, already feeling remorseful. We didn't make a big deal about it and that was that--- a great little thing  in our household. There have been many such 'incidents' (often on a Sunday night, just when we thought the weekend could be pronounced a good one) and many have become extended 'bout of unhappiness.' This one happened, and was over.     Crackers, watermelon, juice: That's at least two of the four food groups, right?

 Charlie, per his teacher's note home, was smiles all day on Friday (and, indeed, for a good part of the school week). After a breezy bike ride and an early dinner, Charlie asked  over and over about going for yet another car ride. Jim suggested Charlie take a seat and, after a couple rounds of 'ride yes' / 'no ride,' a peaceful Friday night at home followed.

"34011" "53" "http://www.squidalicious.com/2011/07/making-reusable-ipad-worksheets-leos.html" "Making Reusable iPad Worksheets: Leo's Learning Revolution Continues" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Leo's room is usually a flurry of worksheets -- for matching, sight reading, writing practice, basic math, dot-to-dot puzzles, all sorts of learning. I used to laminate the most frequently used sheets so as to reduce paper use, but now we're managing to do without many of those paper worksheets entirely -- we're porting the worksheets to Leo's iPad, cobbling a process together via the free apps  DropBox ,  iBooks , and  DrawFree . 
 
Leo enjoys his iPad worksheets, whether he uses them  with a stylus  or in traditional touchscreen mode. The iPad format makes them easier for him to use than paper ones, and fun, too -- once again our boy is learning in ways no one anticipated. 
 
 Here's how I've been making Leo's reusable iPad worksheets: 
 
 Short version 
 Create worksheets in .doc or PDF format, on a computer 
 Upload them to the iPad using a shared DropBox folder 
 Save them on the iPad in an iBooks collection, so they're all in one place 
 Open worksheets in iBooks, then take a screenshot 
 Open that screenshot as a DrawFree background. Voila: fresh new worksheet. 
 Long version 
 
1) Leo's program supervisor creates curriculum worksheets on her computer, in Word. (We use .doc or .pdf format files.) 
 
2) Everyone on Leo's team installs  DropBox  (a Cloud storage service) on their desktops, and I install the  DropBox app  on Leo's iPad.  
 
3) I create a Leo's Activities folder on my desktop, and formally invite everyone on Leo's team to access it via  DropBox Sharing  (which lets the Leo's Activities folder and any changes we make to it appear on everyone's desktops). 
 
4) Leo's program supervisor uploads a Numeral Matching sheet to the Leo's Activities DropBox folder. 
 
5) I open the DropBox app on Leo's iPad, find the Numeral Matching sheet, and choose to open it in iBooks. 
 
 
6) I save the Numeral Matching worksheet to a Leo's Activities collection I've created in iBooks, so we can use his worksheets whether the iPad has online access or not. 
 
 
7) Now for the reusable part. Whenever it's time for Leo to work on one of his worksheets, I open it in iBooks, then  take a screenshot by pressing the iPad's home and on/off buttons  (note: every image in this post is a screenshot). The screenshot will be saved as the last image in the iPad's Photo Library.  
 
8) I open the simple drawing app DrawFree, and click Background. I choose Photo Library Background, and select the worksheet image I just created. 
 
 
9) Leo uses DrawFree to go to town on his totally reusable and replaceable worksheet.  
 
 
If anyone has similar iPad worksheet processes -- especially more streamlined ones -- please do share them.

"21430" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/03/17/creating-a-dynamic-opml-file/" "Creating A Dynamic OPML File" "When I created  Autism Hub  I wanted to give its users as many options as possible. Obviously,  rolling my own RSS feed  was a priority but I also wanted to create an OPML file for people to import all the blog details straight into their readers. Its an easy process – first declare the structure of your OPML file: 
$top= \"n\"
      . \"n\"
      . \"n\"
      . \"autismhub.opmln\"
      . \"\" . date(\"D, j M Y H:i:s\") . \"n\"
      . \"Kevin Leitchn\"
      . \"admin@autism-hub.co.ukn\"
      . \"n\"
      . \"n\";

$bottom = \"n\"
      . \"\";

$data = \"\";
 $data  will be used to build up our feed details. Again, this is easy. I have a database table which contains all my feed details. All you need to do is connect to this table in the usual way and loop through like so: 
if ($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql)) {
  do {	
   $blogurl = $row['blogurl'];
   $feedurl = $row['feedurl'];	
   $name = htmlentities($row['name'], ENT_QUOTES);			
   $data .= \"n\";
  }
 while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql));	
}
 
$all = $top . $data . $bottom;
 Now, all you need to do is check for the presence of a file called autismhub.opml and if it exists, empty it of data and write new all the data to it. If it doesn’t exist, create it and then append all the data into it. 
$file = \"autismhub.opml\";   
if (!$file_handle = fopen($file,\"w+\")) { echo \"Cannot open file\"; }  
if (!fwrite($file_handle, $all)) { echo \"Cannot write to file\"; }  
fclose($file_handle);  

$filename = \"/path/to/file/autismhub.opml\";
$filename = realpath($filename);

if (!file_exists($filename)) {
 die(\"NO FILE HERE\");
}
 and finally, present this compiled file as a download: 
header(\"Pragma: public\");
header(\"Expires: 0\");
header(\"Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0\");
header(\"Cache-Control: private\",false);
header(\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\");
header(\"Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"\".basename($filename).\"\";\");
header(\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\");
header(\"Content-Length: \".@filesize($filename));
set_time_limit(0);

"21433" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/03/17/domajaxphp-file-browser/" "DOM/AJAX/PHP File Browser" "Time for a change of pace. Recently,  the HR Dept  where I work, approached me as they wanted to be able to update their section of the company Intranet as easily as possible. After looking at their requirements it became clear that what they needed was an area where they could replace old files with new versions of the same file, or add new directories/files, or edit existing directory/file names. Practically, this was easy – they had write access to the main HR directory on the Intranet so it would be a simple case of them dragging and dropping files/directories from their local drives to the HR directory on the Intranet. The technical challenge for me came from the subsequent need to create a ‘HR file browser’ which would allow all company Intranet users to browse this directory and download selected files in a usable, aesthetically pleasing manner i.e. not just hardlink to the directory and allow them to browse a list of directories. The obvious answer was to create a DOM driven file browser that would pick up file/directory data from a PHP script. However, I must allow for users that might’ve disabled Javascript or who hadn’t got a certain feature set (getElementById etc). The script would have four main components: 1) A markup file that contained the actual page and file browser 
2) A CSS file to style the elements on this page 
3) A Javascript file to manipulate the behaviour of these files 
4) A PHP file to read and control access to files and directories The PHP File This file contains the ‘guts’ of the webapp. It must be able to: a) Allow a directory to be defined which is the ‘base’ of the application i.e. the main HR directory in my case. Users should not be able to browse above this base. 
b) Get a list of all directories and files within the current directory. 
c) Get the file extension of every file so I can dynamically apply a class name and hence style for each file type. 
d) Allow a reverse path to be built to display the current path and to build a working ‘back’ button. 
e) Make all displayed directories browsable and all displayed files downloadable. 
f) It must work and be usable even if the user does not have Javascript/requisite DOM capabilities. 
g) Disregard the files that drive this app. I was lucky enough to already  know of the existence of a PHP script  that did approx 60% of the work I needed it to so I set about cannibalising and rebuilding this script, taking out the bits I didn’t need and writing in bits I did need. The script as it stood met requirements a), b) and e) so I needed to work on refining those areas and adding in new bits. I won’t go through the whole thing but I do want to discuss certain aspects of it: Getting the file extension is not difficult: 
function get_extension($Filename) {
   $Extension = explode (\".\", $Filename);
   $Extension_i = (count($Extension) - 1);
   return $Extension[$Extension_i];
}
 And neither is reversing the path: 
function reverse_strrchr($haystack, $needle){
   $pos = strrpos($haystack, $needle);
   if($pos === false) {
       return $haystack;
   }
   return substr($haystack, 0, $pos);
}
 I also had to split the  foreach  blocks in two as I wanted to rpesent the directories first, then the files – directories have a set style whereas files have a style dependant on their file extension: 
echo \"<ul>
foreach ($file_array as $file_name) {
      $is_file = DOWNLOAD_PATH . \"/$final_path/$file_name\";
      if (is_dir($is_file) &amp;&amp; $file_name != \"browser-images\") {
        print \" <li><a class='dir' href='\" . $_SERVER&#91;\"PHP_SELF\"&#93; . \"?go=list&amp;
               path=\" . urlencode($final_path) . \"/\" . urlencode($file_name) . \"'>\" 
               . $file_name . \"</a></li>n\";
      }
}
echo \"</ul>\";

echo \"<ul id='filepath'>n\";
foreach ($file_array as $file_name) {
  $is_file = DOWNLOAD_PATH . \"/$final_path/$file_name\";				
  if (is_file($is_file) &amp;&amp; $file_name != \"browser.php\") {
    if(get_extension($file_name) == \"css\"){
      $ext = \"code\";
    }else if(get_extension($file_name) == \"php\"){
      $ext = \"php\";
    }
   
   ....

   }				
   print \" <li><a class='\" . $ext . \"' href='\" .  $_SERVER&#91;\"PHP_SELF\"&#93; . \"?
           go=download&amp;path=\" . urlencode($final_path) . \"&amp;file=\"
           . urlencode($file_name) . \"'>\" . $file_name . \"</a></li>n\";
 }
		
}
echo \"</ul>n\";
 You might also notice these lines: 
if (is_dir($is_file) && $file_name != \"browser-images\") {

...

if (is_file($is_file) && $file_name != \"browser.php\"
 This tells the script to disregard the file if the directory name is ‘browser-images’ or file name is ‘browser.php’ which is the name of _this_ script – you don’t want people downloading these! (NB: ‘browser-images’ is where I stuck all the images relating to this app). Most importantly, you need to declare this line: 
define(\"DOWNLOAD_PATH\", \"/var/www/html/intranet/download\");
 This must be the ‘base’ path i.e. where you want to start browsing _from_ – users will not be able to browse _above_ this directory but they can browse anywhere within it (recursively). To check this was working (and to ensure it would work independantly of Javascript) I ran this in the browser – wasn’t very pretty, wasn’t very usable but it was there and it would allow people without JS or the right DOM facilities to use the script. Onward. The DOM/Javascript/AJAX Script This script needed to: a) Connect to the PHP script above (hereafter referred to as ‘browser.php’) and call the right function to generate the right directory/file list for the directory that browser.php was currently ‘looking’ at. 
b) Create animation to allow the file browser itself to appear and disappear as per user requirements. 
c) Create a working ‘back’ button (also from the PHP script) 
d) Degrade gracefully for those users who were Javascript or DOM-less. My first issue was that I’d never used Javascript to animate movement before so I relied heavily on  a code snippet of Jeremy Keith’s  for that. His function allows you to pass in the values of the element you want to animate movement for, where on the x axis, where on the y axis and finally what the movement interval should be). The settings you may need to change are in these lines: 
if(!hr.style.left){
  hr.style.left=\"-300px\";
}
	
if(!hr.style.top){
  hr.style.top=\"70px\";
}
 Which you need to reflect the starting position of the selected element. The rest of the code is fairly self explanatory and basically creates an AJAX connection to the PHP script and points the script to the ‘next’ directory and/or file. NB: You will need to specify the path to the file ‘browser.php’. There are three  onclick  events in this function too – one to browse the files, one to trigger the ‘back’ button and one to trigger the ‘home’ button. The Stylesheet The stylesheet is simplified (apologies for any redundancy in it – I think I stripped most of it out after testing but I may have missed the odd thing), but basically, the markup file contains a  
 
  with an id of ‘wrap’ to which I applied this style: 
div#wrap {
  position: absolute;
  top: 73px;
  left: -300px;
  width: 1170px;
}
 A quick glance back at the Javascript code reveals that I specified these are the starting points for my animation. What the animation will do therefore is scroll ‘wrap’ to the right, from its starting point at -300px (i.e. off the screen) and thus reveal it. The ‘close’ button will do the opposite. You’ll also find all the styles I used for the HR File Browser itself. The Markup Finally, there is the markup. A standard XHTML page, its only wrinkle is the presence of two elements: firstly is the empty  
 
  with an id of ‘hrResponse’ – this is where I will ‘pipe’ all my dynamic content into. Secondly is the link element that starts the whole thing off: 
<li><a title=\"Browse HR documents\" id=\"openBrowser\" href=\"http://localhost/intranet/download/browser.php\">Browse HR documents</a></li>
 as you can see the URI is not empty – it contains the path to the ‘browser.php’ file. This is to ensure graceful degradation. If the user has Javascript/DOM capabilities they will get the DOM scripted environment. If the don’t they’ll get sent to the ‘browser.php’ file with no enhancements. And thats that. You can  download it all from here  – use it, improve it, distribute it – whatever you like.

"21428" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/09/19/unobtrusive-accessible-collapsible-content/" "Unobtrusive, Accessible Collapsible Content" "I’m stretching my Javascript legs a bit at the moment and am beginning to really enjoy the freedom that decent DOM support across the major browsers offers. I recently had occasion to create an ‘events’ page which will be inserted into an upcoming project. As there will be a lot of events being added to this page I wanted to create it as a collapsible unordered list. But as a Javascript ‘workout’ for myself I resolved that I would only use Javascript that was unobtrusive, degraded gracefully and was accessible as possible. that meant no  onclick  attributes, no ‘#’ in  href  attributes and code that was valid and clean. Here’s the markup: 
<h1>Events Listing</h1>	
	
<p>Browse the listing for upcoming events</p>
			
<ul class=\"open\">
	
<li>
		
<h2>4th Annual &ndash; Summit</h2>
			
<ul id=\"ul_item1\" class=\"opensub\">
<li id=\"item1_1\">
<h3>22nd September 2005, Main Campus</h3>
<p>blah blah blah....</p>
</li>
</ul>
		
</li>
					
<li>
		
<h2>Managing the Market Or Some Such Bollocks</h2>
			
<ul id=\"ul_item2\" class=\"opensub\">
<li id=\"item2_1\">
<h3>24th November 2005. The Conference Centre</h3>		
<p>etc etc etc...</p>
</li>
</ul>					                             
		
</li>
	
</ul>
 Fairly self-explanatory markup. The sublists hold the content but users with Javascript and CSS enabled will get a clickable link (not shown in this markup – patience my precious…) whilst those without will just get this. I then wrote three fairly simple javascript codeblocks (two functions and one class). Function number one I called ‘toggle’ and thats what it does. When a specific link is clicked, it either shows or hides an element. Like so: 
function toggle(id){
var ul = \"ul_\" + id;
var img = \"img_\" + id;
var ulElement = document.getElementById(ul);
var imgElement = document.getElementById(img);
if (ulElement){
 if (ulElement.className == \"closed\"){
  ulElement.className = \"opensub\";
  imgElement.src = \"opened.gif\";
  }else{
  ulElement.className = \"closed\";
  imgElement.src = \"closed.gif\";
  }
 }
}
 So, the function is passed a value referenced as ‘id’ (more on that later). It then appends that passed value onto the end of two elements and applies a class of ‘closed’ or ‘opensub’ as appropriate.  What I wanted to do next was ensure that if the user didn’t have Javascript then the ‘opensub’ CSS class was applied (as we need to present the whole page to them) and if they do have Javascript then we need to apply the ‘closed’ class to the element. I also wanted to ensure that if the user did have Javascript then he existing markup above was annotated with markup that will make each heading a clickable link and provide a little feedback in the form of an image. Hence: 
function initState () {
var lists = document.getElementsByTagName(\"ul\");
for (var j=0; j<lists.length; j++) {
 if(lists[j].className == \"opensub\") {
  lists[j].className = \"closed\";
 }
}	
var subHeads = document.getElementsByTagName(\"h2\");
for (var k=0; k<subHeads.length; k++) {
 var arrImg = document.createElement(\"img\");
 arrImg.src=\"closed.gif\";
 arrImg.id=\"img_item\" + [k+1];
 subHeads[k].appendChild(arrImg);
 var holdText = subHeads[k].firstChild.data;
 subHeads[k].firstChild.data = \"\";
 var placeAnchor = document.createElement(\"a\");
 placeAnchor.href = \"test.htm\";
 placeAnchor.id = \"item\" + [k+1];
 placeAnchor.className = \"ddown\";
 placeAnchor.appendChild(document.createTextNode(holdText));
 subHeads[k].appendChild(placeAnchor);
 }
}
 This function has two main parts. The first part (knowing that the user does have javascript installed – we'll see how later) turns all instances of 'opensub' (which displays to the page by default) to 'closed' – meaning a user with Javascript gets the 'rolled up' items. The second part hunts for all  h2  elements and creates the markup for both the image and the clickable text in the heading element. These two lines: 
var holdText = subHeads[k].firstChild.data;
subHeads[k].firstChild.data = \"\";
 firstly, get the value of the text in the  
 
  element, stores it for later use and then gets rid of it – if it didn’t we’d have both the existing text plus the clickable text. Which would be crap. Once all this is coded we need a way to fire this whole process. I did this in the class below: 
window.onload = function() {
  if (!document.getElementsByTagName) return false;
  initState();
  var lnks = document.getElementsByTagName(\"a\");
  for (var i=0; i<lnks.length; i++) {
    if(lnks[i].className == \"ddown\"){
      lnks[i].onclick = function() {
        toggle(this.getAttribute(\"id\"));
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
}
 The crucial line is line 2: if (!document.getElementsByTagName) return false; This says that if the browser doesn't support the prerequisite method then the whole things off, the extra markup doesn't get created and everything appears on the page all at once. This function also passes the 'id' value to the 'toggle' function by getting the id attribute value of the link thats been clicked. To complete this whole thing we lastly need to create the CSS that will do the actual showing and hiding: h2 a { 
	display: inline; 
} .open { 
	display: block; 
} .closed { 
	display: none; 
} ul li, 
ul { 
	list-style-type: none; 
	padding: 0; 
	margin: 0; 
} .open li img { 
	vertical-align: middle; 
} And thats that – job done.  See it in action  or download the  whole thing  here. Amended I thought it might be nice to see if we could close every other entry when one entry is clicked – this means only one entry is ever displayed which might be preferable for some. All this needs is some minor tweaks to the Javascript. For the function  initState()  I added the line: 
arrImg.className=\"ddImg\";
 Immediately below this one: 
arrImg.id=\"img_item\" + [k+1];
 So I have a class to hook myself into in the next function –  toggle(id) . I’ve added two new  if  statements here that firstly close up all the  ul  elements with the class name ‘opensub’ and then closed all the  img  elements with the (see above) class name ‘ddImg’. What’ll happen later in this function is that the selected id will be passed in exactly the same manner as it was before thus opening the correct list and image. Here’s the annotated code for  toggle(id) 
var allLists = document.getElementsByTagName(\"ul\");
for (var x=0; x<allLists.length; x++) {
if(allLists[x].className == \"opensub\") {
 allLists[x].className = \"closed\";
 }
}
var allListImg = document.getElementsByTagName(\"img\");
 for (var y=0; y<allListImg.length; y++) {
 if(allListImg[y].className == \"ddImg\") {
  allListImg[y].src = \"closed.gif\";
 }
}
 I put this code right at the very start of the function. And thats that. Whenever you click on an entry, all other open entries will shut automatically.  The  example’s here  and the  download is here . Amendement No II And its only now of course that I remember that screenreader users invariably _do_ have Javascript turned on and that  display: none  hides things from the screenreader. One frantic search later, I find the answer in the  Off-Left  technique. So the code for the  closed  class now reads: 
.closed {
 position: absolute;
 left: -999px;
 width: 990px;
}

"21357" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/11/10/e-commerce-with-php-creating-unique-download-areas/" "E-commerce With PHP: Creating Unique Download Areas" "I’ve posted a few snippets from the client-side that have touched on a project I’ve been working on recently. This project is an e-commerce based website that takes a payment (via WorldPay) and then generates a download of the product the shopper has just purchased. Offering paid-for downloads via the web is a tricky proposition. There are lots of security factors that need to be considered. You don’t want your product to be actually on the webserver for example as its possible for someone to stumble across it and download it. On the other hand, you don’t want to make it very difficult for a user to get to the right place to download their product from – that would defeat the whole point. The product we’re downloading is approaching 60mb in size so we have another issue – that PHP doesn’t handle downloads of big files very well. So we need to find some way of making sure PHP doesn’t choke. Further complicating this particular solution was the fact that WorldPay doesn’t offer a ‘download’ solution – it only offers solutions for objects that are sent offline (books, CD’s, clothes, whatever) so I was limited in that respect. The whole process is complicated. The shopper fills out their details (name, billing and shipping address, email, tel etc) on our site. These details first get input to our database and then get sent to WorldPay along with a unique id for this purchase. The shopper then fills out their card details which WorldPay then process. If the transaction is successful then a variable called ‘transStatus’ is set to ‘Y’. If its declined its set to ‘C’. This variable is sent via POST to a callback script which sits on our server (this part of the process is invisible to the shopper). The appropriate markup is generated via this callback script and sent back to the shopper at WorldPay. Part of this generated markup (assuming a successful transaction) includes a link with a variable appended to it (the unique id for this purchase) which points to a script back on our server. When the shopper clicks this link they get returned to our server and the download process starts in earnest. At this point the script needs to do the following. First, it needs to compare the sent back value to a value in the db and pull out the purchase details that apply to that value. It then needs to generate a unique serial number (quick side note: this is returned to my script via an  XML-RPC  script that connects to a Java web service one of the developers wrote). It also needs to create a PDF invoice (quick side note no. 2: I used the rather marvelous  R & OS PDF Class  to generate the PDF). What it also needs to do is create a new directory, copy a file from an old directory to this newly created directory and then send the newly created URI to the user. As a point of interest, you should note that the file that is being copied is _not_ the downloadable file. As this is over 60mb in size it makes no sense to copy this across for every shopper. Instead we copy across a very small file that triggers a download of the downloadable product file. OK so first of all I uploaded the downloadable file _and_ the file to be copied into a directory _above_ the web root, thus ensuring they can’t be browsed to. I then set about creating the PHP to store the download script: 
$oldPath = \"/home/somedir/\";
$filename = \"myscript.php\";
 So, first we set two variables; the path to the directory above the web root that contains the download script and the name of the download script itself. 
if (file_exists($oldPath . $filename)){
	
		$mdy = date(\"mdy\");
		$hms = date(\"His\");	
		$rightnow = $mdy.$hms;
		$dir = md5($rightnow);		
 Next we open a check to ensure the file exists,r eferencing the two variables we set up first. If the file _does_ exist then we create a fairly random string of letters and numbers by taking the current date, current time, appending them together (no spaces or punctuation marks) and then hashing them using the  md5()  function. This pretty randomised string of letters and numbers will be the name of the directory we’re going to create. 
$newDir = \"/home/somedir/public_html/dowmloads/\" . $dir;	
mkdir($newDir, 0777);
 So here we actually create the new directory – first we use the new name and append it to the location we want the new directory to live in and then we do the actual creation using  mkdir() . Note that we set the access rights to this new directory in the second parameter of the function. 
$newLoc = $newDir . \"/\" . $filename;		
$oldLoc = $oldPath . $filename;
			
copy ($oldLoc, $newLoc) or die (\"Could not copy file\");	
$uri = \"http://www.blah.co.uk/downloads/\" . $dir . \"/\" . $filename;

echo $uri;
 Next we create two variables which contain a string referencing the new and old locations (i.e. where the file to copy exists now and where we want it to be copied to) and we then go ahead and actually copy the file over. After that its a simple case of building the URI from a string and then doing what you want with it. Your original file (myscript.php) will now have been copied into the newly created directory. Just put an ‘else’ clause in to tidy up and the code in full is: 
$oldPath = \"/home/somedir/\";
$filename = \"myscript.php\";

if (file_exists($oldPath . $filename)){
	
  $mdy = date(\"mdy\");
  $hms = date(\"His\");	
  $rightnow = $mdy.$hms;

  $dir = md5($rightnow);		
  $newDir = \"/home/somedir/public_html/dowmloads/\" . $dir;	
  mkdir($newDir, 0777);
		
  $newLoc = $newDir . \"/\" . $filename;		
  $oldLoc = $oldPath . $filename;
			
  copy ($oldLoc, $newLoc) or die (\"Could not copy file\");	
  $uri = \"http://www.blah.co.uk/downloads/\" . $dir . \"/\" . $filename;
		
  echo $uri;
		
} else {

  echo \"Uh-oh, it went bad.\";

}
 So what about the file ‘myscript.php’? What does this do? Well, its there to actually grab the file that needs to be downloaded. Using lots of small files instead of lots of large ones makes a lot of sense. It also means we can script solutions for large files. 
$filename = \"/home/somedir/myprogram.exe\";
$filename = realpath($filename);

if (!file_exists($filename)) {
 die(\"NO FILE HERE\");
}

header(\"Pragma: public\");
header(\"Expires: 0\");
header(\"Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0\");
header(\"Cache-Control: private\",false);
header(\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\");
header(\"Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"\".basename($filename).\"\";\");
header(\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\");
header(\"Content-Length: \".@filesize($filename));
set_time_limit(0);
@readfile(\"$filename\") or die(\"File not found.\");
 The first two lines are straightforward.  First create a reference to where the file to be downloaded resides. then use  realpath()  to get the absolute path. Now, after that we perform a simple check to ensure that the file is there. if not, error out. If yes, then proceed. The interesting bits of this script are the  Header  declarations. These are necessary for various thigns to make sure the download is fetched properly. header(\"Pragma: public\")  works with  header(\"Content-Disposition\")  as a known issue with IE6 is that the  filename  attribute of  Content-Disposition  is not always recognised. Using  Pragma: public  resolves this. Cache-Control: must-revalidate  and   Cache-Control: private, false ensures the file is never cached. Content-Type: application/octet-stream  is the content type for application files and  Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary  ensures the correct transfer type is used (binary in this case). The all-important line here is  set_time_limit(0); . The time limit refers to the amount of seconds that PHP allows a script to execute. The default is 30 seconds which is obviously no good for a 60mb file. By setting the time limit to zero we set no upper limit on script execution time. Lastly, we use the  readfile()  function to actually start the download off. Job done.

"21447" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/10/21/splitting-ajax-returned-data/" "Splitting AJAX Returned Data" "I’m working on a new product site for the company I work for at the moment and am trying to utilise as much sensible AJAX as possible in order to enhance the usability of the pages without destroying the IA or accessibility. One of the intriguing challenges I came across today was using  innerHTML  in a more refined way. Lets say I have data I need to return from a PHP script that I need to funnel into separate markup elements when they’re returned to the page. How to do this perplexed me for awhile – my experiences of  innerHTML  was that results are returned in a big chunk. First lets have a look at the PHP: 
$type = $_GET['type'];

if($type == \"1\"){
	echo \"Vat No\";
        echo \"\";
}
 And the markup I wanted to receive each of these two strings was as follows: 
<p id=\"label\"></p>
<p id=\"inputElem\"></p>
 *NB: No, I didn’t really put my form elements into p tags, this is a smaller example of what I did.* Obvious what I want to do isn’t it? I want the phrase to go in the ‘label’ id element and the field to go in the ‘inputElem’ element. Here’s the Javascript I started with. First we set up the AJAX connection: 
// 'xmlhttp' variable will hold the XMLHttpRequest object
var xmlhttp = false;
        
// If the user is using Mozilla/Firefox/Safari/etc
if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
        xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xmlhttp.overrideMimeType('text/xml');
}

// If the user is using IE
else if (window.ActiveXObject) {
        xmlhttp = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\");
}
 And after that I declare a function that can be called onclick later: 

function getUK() {
	var lB = document.getElementById(\"label\");
	var iE = document.getElementById(\"inputElem\"); 
 
	var url = \"_inc/vat.php?type=1\";    
	xmlhttp.open(\"GET\", url, true);
    
	xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
		if(xmlhttp.readyState == 4) {

			var r = xmlhttp.responseText
			lB.innerHTML = r;

		}else{
			lB.innerHTML = \"Error\";
		}				
	};
	xmlhttp.send(null);  
}
 Which is crap. I can’t get both elements in and seperate them. So what we need to do is make our string passed through from PHP to actually be an array object that we can split. So we change the above PHP to this: 
$type = $_GET['type'];

if($type == \"1\"){
	echo \"Vat No|\";
}
 Now we can refer to the responseText as an array like so: 

function getUK() {
	var lB = document.getElementById(\"label\");
	var iE = document.getElementById(\"inputElem\"); 
 
	var url = \"_inc/vat.php?type=1\";    
	xmlhttp.open(\"GET\", url, true);
    
	xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
		if(xmlhttp.readyState == 4) {

			var r= xmlhttp.responseText.split(\"|\");
			lB.innerHTML = r[0];
			iE.innerHTML =  r[1];

		}else{
			lB.innerHTML = \"Error\";
		}				
	};
	xmlhttp.send(null);  
}
 The important lines are: 
var r= xmlhttp.responseText.split(\"|\");
lB.innerHTML = r[0];
iE.innerHTML =  r[1];
 in which we split the string on the ‘|’ character (or any other character you care to use yourself) and then refer to individual elements in the array in the appropriate place.

"21708" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/06/09/safe-redirects-for-seo/" "Safe Redirects for SEO" "We all know that Search Engines hate change. Whenever we decide to do a total restructural change of any site we run the risk of pissing off search engines. And when we piss off search engines, we start to drop down the rankings. Why? Because when we change the structure of a site (i.e. add or remove pages from the existing structure) Google doesn’t know where to find the new pages until we tell them. Now we could just use a meta refresh but search engines have to come to view these as spamming tactics and you run the risk of being penalised. So instead you need to permanently redirect your bots (and human visitors!) to the new page, straight from the old page and create a safe association in the consciousness of Google between those two pages. You can set up server side methods to  allow for 301 redirects on both Apache and IIS but sometimes you’re on a shared hosting account that doesn’t allow access to these methods. So what do you do? You script the changes manually. You can use PHP, or ASP or .NET to script a 301 page very easily. PHP ASP VB.NET So you simply paste this code into your old pages, remove the content that used to be in there and adjust the target URI to point to the new page – job done. Google now associates the new page with the old and you should keep your hard-fought for PR and rankings. What about when you have a *lot* of pages that are being redirected? For example, an old version of the Group site I work on changed from trad ASP to .NET and hence all our pages needed rebuilding and the site structure changed a lot. The old version of the site ran off the index.asp page with pages being called in depending on the values in the query string e.g. …/index.asp called in the home page obviously but …index.asp?TYPE=02 called in the Mortgage pages and …index.asp?TYPE=02&aid=5 called in the first time mortgages page in the mortgage section. So I had to allow for all these pages which were indexed in search engines and working nicely. I did this like so: I  saved that page as index.asp (which didn’t conflict with my new index.aspx page) and then every time a search engine sent a visitor to an old page the  case  statements sorted out where to send the visitor in the new structure. Job done!

"21353" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/11/07/two-little-snippets/" "Two Little Snippets" "Part of my continuing quest to use Javascript in responsible, degradable ways is documented below. I’m coming to the end of a development period that involved building an e-commerce solution and sign up procedure. I saw two possible uses for some nice unobtrusive Javascript here. In the first example (and this is one is very simple indeed) I wanted a way to have a value in a form field as per  WCAG 1.0  guidelines dictate. However, whenever I see these implemented, the author fails to clear the form when the field in question gains focus meaning a user has to manually clear the placeholder value themselves – something of a pain. The solution in this case is as simple as: 
window.onload = function() {
	if (!document.getElementById) return false;	

	var e = document.getElementById(\"email\");
	e.onfocus = function() {
		e.value = \"\";
		return false;
	}	
}
 And the markup: 

 So, the Javascript first checks that the function we need is supported by the browser. If its not then thats that – it won’t work but nothing is visually affected and no error alerts will appear. The worst case scenario is that the user muse clear the field manually. If getElementByID() _is_ supported then we declare an  onfocus()  function that clears the value – and thats that. Job done. My second idea was to aid the process of filling out address details. In most cases when you are buying from an online shop you must specify and billing address _and_ a shipping address. Obviously, its easy to grab the values of one set of fields and marry them up with another set but all the solutions I’d seen had no non-js fallback position and most had loads of JS attrtibutes in the markup which is something I really want to avoid. So, first lets look at out form: 
	

	

		<h2>Billing Address</h2>
	
		Address
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		Town
		
		
		County
		
		
		Post Code
		
		
		Area
		
  		  United Kingdom
                  Australia
                  Belgium                     
                  Canada
                  Denmark
  		  France
                  Sri Lanka
                  Venezuela
                  Zimbabwe
				
			
		<h2 id=\"addLnk\">Shipping Address</h2>
	
		Address
		
			
		
		
			
		
		
			
		Town
		
			
		County
		
			
		Post Code
		
			
		Area
		
			
	
	

 *NB: No, thats not the whole form, this is just the bit we’re interested in.* Now, what I wanted was an easy way for the billing address details to be copied to the correct shipping address sections but if the user had no JS then to leave the form exactly as it was. Here’s what I did: 
window.onload = function() {
	if (!document.getElementById) return false;
	if (!document.createElement) return false;
	if (!document.createTextNode) return false;
	if (!document.getElementsByTagName) return false;

	var h = document.getElementById(\"addLnk\");
	var p = document.createElement(\"p\");
	var a = document.createElement(\"a\");
 	a.href = \"#ready\";
	a.className = \"ditto\";
 	a.appendChild(document.createTextNode(\"Shipping address is the same as the Billing address\"));
 	h.appendChild(p);
	p.appendChild(a);

	var z = document.getElementsByTagName(\"a\");
	var x = document.getElementById(\"buyFrm\");
	for (var i=0; i<z.length; i++) {
		if (z[i].className == \"ditto\") {
			z[i].onclick = function() {
				x.sh_add1.value = x.add1.value;
				x.sh_add2.value = x.add2.value;
				x.sh_add3.value = x.add3.value;
				x.sh_town.value = x.town.value;
				x.sh_county.value = x.county.value;
				x.sh_pcode.value = x.pcode.value;
				x.sh_area.value = x.area.value;
				return false;
			}
		}
	}
}
 The first four lines check that all the functions we need are available in the users browser. If they're not then nothing gets executed, nothing happens and the suer has the markup above presented to them. The next section firstly looks for an element with an id of 'addLnk' (look in the markup above for it) and when it finds it, it dynamically creates then appends the following bit of markup: Shipping address is the same as the Billing address The link to ‘#ready’ simply moves the user down to the submit button (not shown in the above markup) for another added usability wrinkle. The meat of what this link does is triggered from the class ‘ditto’. Take a look at the last section of Javascript. This basically says that when a link with a class name of ‘ditto’ is clicked then copy the contents of one set of fields to the other. And thats it – job done here too. These are both very simple bits of scripting but I hope they demonstrate real world practical use but executed in a way that ensures that the code is graceful in its degradation, accessible and separate from the semantic level.

"21717" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/08/16/easy-sub-menu-building-with-php/" "Easy Sub Menu Building With PHP" "One of the things I love most about server side scripting is the little snippets of code you can write that are not necessarily big applications like phpMyAdmin but just very small 5 or 6 liners but which nonetheless make your life ten times easier. One of the simplest little snippets I wrote allows you to call a script in via an include which displays sub menu items for a specific menu item depending on which menu you’re viewing. Basically the way it works is like this: First you build the structure of your site on the server: Now, on every single one of those php pages we call the script ‘menu_by_directory.php’ in via an include (note that this script is in its own subdirectory called ‘inc’. I always put included files in their own subdirectory for easier housekeeping). So ‘menu_by_directory.php’ is a script that does all the work. It orients itself in the structure of the site and then displays the correct submenu for the area of the site its been included into. Here’s how: On the first line we set the root directory of our website. We then use  dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])  to grab a load of information about the directory the script currently resides in. because this info is returned as an array object we need to iterate through it to get the one thing we need – the current directory name which we finally assign to   $TheDIR . Then we use this to do a simple comparison using case selects (case selects run faster and are less server intensive than if…else statements): All we do here then is say: ‘If  $TheDIR  holds the value ‘about’ then use the first menu. If it carries the value ‘portfolio’ then use the second. If it carries neither of these then use the third.  As part of that script, in order to build the links we use the  $root  and  $TheDIR  values to write out the link targets – this makes updating easy if we change the site location/domain at some point. Now, there’s nothing earth shattering here but its things like this – little bits of code – that I love. Very unobtrusive, a massive labour saver and easy to understand and implement time and time again. Here’s a  working example .

It was a rather hastily written blog piece, its true. Anyway, I’ve written an example which you  can find here . Simply click the ‘browser HR documents’ link to get going. You can grab the source from there too if you want. I even wrote a little readme to allow you to set up exactly what I’ve got working on that page. But thats a pretty meagre blog entry so I’ll pass on a little tip for getting an easy Linux browser testing environment running in Windows – no OS intalls required. First, download  Damn Small Linux  – just the ISO. Its only about 50mb or so, hence the name. Once you’ve grabbed it, put it somewhere out the way. OK, now download the free  Microsoft Virtual PC  app. Won’t take long.  When this is downloaded, install it as per normal. When its installed launch it. First click ‘new’ as we’re going to create a new virtual PC.  1) Choose ‘create a virtual machine’ 
2) Give it a name and choose a location to save it to. I called mine ‘DSLinux’. 
3) From the list of OS’s choose ‘other’. 
4) Allocate RAM as required. 
5) Choose ‘a new virtual disk’ 
6) Specify location or accept defaults. Up to you. 
7) Click ‘finish’ That’s the machine set up. Now we need to setup our Linux ISO. Your new virtual machine should be listed in the Virtual PC window’. 1) Choose ‘start’ 
2) When the box pops up choose ‘CD’ and then ‘capture ISO image’ 
3) Browse to the location you put your Damn Small Linux ISO in 
4) You might need to choose ‘Action’ and then ‘reset’ 
5) The Linux setup starts – job done! Wait for it to complete. You’ve now got a functional, web accessible Linux package to test sites in.

"21351" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/05/30/the-flash-rss-reader/" "The Flash RSS Reader" "A few people have expressed curiosity in it so I thought I’d run through how its done. At this stage its really very simple but I have plans to extend its operation to automate more of the running of it. Macromedia first introduced the ability for the SWF format to parse XML data back in the days of Flash 5 (2000? 2001?). It was pretty basic was pretty shoddily implemented as well. It was never quite resolved whether it was an issue with the actual actionscript events or the Flash Player failing to parse these events (my money was on the latter) but suffice it to say, whilst it was great to be able to introduce another area of flexibility to SWF, it wasn’t until the release of Flash MX and the version 7 player that SWF/XML integration became a more reliable process. It was around that time that Actionscript Guru,  Sam Wan  released his RSSDataFactory object  which made coding the integration of RSS feeds very easy. He claims it only works with RSS 0.92 but it works fine with RSS 2.0 also. So, I turned to this RSS object to handle the laborious work of processing the RSS. It was originally built to handle just one feed so I had a few tasks to make it operational for multiple feeds. I also had the thorny issue of the infamous Flash Sandbox to negotiate. More on that later. Customising the RSSDataFactory is a doddle. First of all I simply inserted another keyframe and moved the DataFactory code to the second keyframe and applied a universal  stop();  action to all keyframes. So, now I had two frames to play in I could put all my top level links in frame one and the parsed RSS feeds would display on frame two. Easy. In frame one then I simply  listed all the feeds I was going to be utilising as buttons and coded them appropriately . Now you may notice at this stage that I’m not calling the feed directly. This is due to the pernicious influence of the Flash Sandbox. The Sandbox is a security measure. It doesn’t allow movies or scripts from servers on domains other than the one the SWF exists on to be accessed directly from the SWF.  So what we have to do is build a sort of proxy – a script that _can_ access remote files and, as this proxy script exists on our domain, we can access anything it returns. Problem solved. Now you can see why calling remote XML files is pointless – nothing would be returned due to the Sandbox – so instead I call the proxy script. And because I have multiple feeds, I append a name/value pair ( ....php?feed=1 ) to each separate button. I can then detect these in my proxy script and hence return the desired script: Now we turn our attention to this proxy script (which I called ‘antisandbox.php’). What we’re doing here is detecting the incoming value of the variable ‘feed’ fetching the appropriate RSS feed and opening it up for our SWF to process. There are a few ways to do this, notably using  readfile()  but they are mostly (and again, notably  readfile() ) badly insecure. The way to securely get the feeds is to use (in PHP anyway)  CURL . CURL opens a decent, protocoled connection to the remote RSS script. Its syntactically very like using a session in that you initialise it, use it then close it: I should really have used  switch  to do the evaluation of the feed variable as its quicker. Probably will implement that soon. So now we’ve got our data, we have to parse it in. Thankfully all this is done in Sam’s excellent Factory. All I had to do was pass it the value of the proxy script with the right name/value pair. The last line of this script rssObj.parseFeed(_root.theFeed, this, \"receiveRSSObject\"); calls the SWF variable I set in the previous frame that specified which value to send to the proxy script (and thus which RSS feed to fetch). These are quite interesting: In fame two I built a movieclip template. This template contains an empty dynamic text holder and an empty URL variable. When the RSS feed comes in, depending on how many posts each author specified their feeds help, each one of these posts would duplicate the movieclip and send the title of each post in the feed and the correct permanent link to these posts. It also spaces out each newly generated movieclip below the previously generated one. My last problem was the ‘back’ button. Going back a frame in Flash doesn’t affect whats in the frame you’ve just left so I had to clear these newly generated movieclips, clear  theFeed  and reset the whole shebang everytime someone clicked the ‘back’ button. Note I simply hide the ‘old’ buttons off stage – this speeds up regeneration if a user wants to revisit a certain feed in the same session. And thats it for now. I will be extending this to make my life easier. For now, if I want to add a new feed I have to edit the FLA and ‘antisandbox.php’ which is a bit of a pain. What I hope to do is write a plug-in for WordPress that will create an XML file from a link category in the WordPress database architecture. I can then use this XML file to auto generate the feed list in frame 1. The second half of this plug in will drag these details from the database and execute them in ‘antisandbox.php’.

"21272" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/03/23/structuring-your-client-drive/" "Structuring Your Client Drive" "Wherever I’ve worked in the past, there’s always been ‘issues’ about structuring client data to make it easy for the Design team to get at and share. An example: Back in the 90’s, I worked for an agency where one of my colleagues method of storing client data was to save everything to his desktop then, when his desktop was covered in icons, save the contents of the desktop in a directory called ‘desktop’ which he’d then keep on his (you guessed it) desktop! When he was away it was a fucking nightmare trying to find stuff if an old client called up. The rest of us therefore took it upon ourselves to formulate a client drive directory structure which we’d adhere to for every client. Its proved so easy to implement and use I’ve suggested its implementation at every place I’ve worked at since and I thought I’d share it with you and maybe get your suggestions on ways to tweak it or better it. First of all is to get a private share setup to lock off the rest of the company – you don’t want Chardonnay from HR stumbling into your carefully organised structure and dropping files off left right and centre. Obviously, if you’re implementing this as a freelancer then you’re pretty much safe. The first level of directories should be the names of your clients. Simply that, nothing else. Within each client directory you create a new directory for every seperate project you’ve done/are doing/are about to start for that client. So far, so pretty obvious I suspect. I’d be surprised if most designers didn’t do this. However, the next stage is where the difference lies. A lot of design teams and freelance designers I’ve worked with in the past simply chuck everything to do with that project in the project directory and hence are making life more tricky than it needs to be. My next level is comprised of four directories; first is the  Production  directory. In fact, most of the time this isn’t even a directory its actually a shortcut to a corresponding directory on my local web server. As its a production directory, this is obviously where all files that make up the resultant website live. Next up is a directory called  Documentation . In this directory I have a number of sub-directories: 
 Content . This is where I place all the textual content that pertains to the project. I also keep a very simple spreadsheet file that I use to track versions of the same file. I would recommend making the date and a number part of the file name e.g. homepagecontent_23_3_05_v1.doc and then if the client sent an update to the content for that section I would create another file like so: homepagecontent_28_3_05_v2.doc 
 Technical . In this directory I keep all the details of the technical info I may need for this project such as FTP details, database connection string usernames, passwords etc. I also keep wireframes, workflows and any usability reports in this directory, possibly in sub-directories of their own. 
 Correspondance . This is where I keep all formal correspondance such as job spec, the completed brief, client sign-off sheets, invoices, colour specs, font specs etc 
 Next up is the  Source  directory. In this directory I create a sub-directory that corresponds to every single source filetype created during the course of the project. So typical sub-directories may be: PSD, EPS, FLA. NB:  No outputted flat files must be in here . If they’re outputted files they should be somewhere else, probably the Production directory. Really, the sub-directories in this directory are completley dependant on the project you’re working on e.g. you won’t need a FLA directory if you’re not going to use Flash. The only constant for this directory is the  Concepts  directory where you store the source files that are used to create the design concepts. Lastly is the  Imagery  directory. In this directory there are three sub-directories: 
 Stock . In here (obviously) I put all the stock imagery I get whether it comes from the client or whether I’ve sourced it myself. I also maintain a file naming system for my files in this directory e.g. sxc_800_600_72_100891234.jpg which to me indicates that the file came from  stock.xchng  that its dimensions are 800×600 and its resolution is 72. The long string of numbers is simply the filename as it was on the site I got it from. I also maintain a simple spreadsheet that lists the exact URI of the file on the originating stock site (if applicable). 
 Flat_logo . I keep all the flattened versions of any logos associated with the projcet in this directory, whether this is a logo I helped with or whether it comes from an external source. 
 Flat_concepts . Similar to the above except these are flattened versions of any design concepts associated with the project. I also insist on a good file naming structure for this directory e.g. aboutus_kl_v1.png which lists the name of the section the design concept relates to, the initials of the designer and the version of this concept. 
 This structure meets my needs very well and always has. I’d be very interested in hearing your thoughts, how you do things, what improvements you would make etc. And of course I’m well aware I’ve either told you what you already know, or helped you or simply revealed myself as an obsessive control freak.

"21567" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2005/05/13/php-variables-into-flash/" "PHP Variables Into Flash" "I read a  post over at BD4B  on getting javascript data into Flash today. A lot of people expressed surprise that this wasn’t common knowledge. It is to  some  people. It occured to me that if people don’t know you can get client side variables into Flash then they probably don’t know you can get serverside variables in either. Well you can. Very easily. All you have to do is URLEncode any name/value pairs you wish to pass in and you’re away. Lets take a very small example: Go to  the test page . You should see a page with a SWF in it and thats it. The movie is just a single button. Click the button and hey presto, up pops my name and email address. Those two values were inserted from a PHP script. Here’s how. First, set up your Flash movie with a button and two dynamic text fields. I called my textfields  theName  and  theEmail  respectively. Turn your attention to your button. This is where I’m placing all the code for this very simple example. In a real life production you’d never do what I’m about to and place all the function code in the button action. This is simple to illustrate whats happening. OK, so on the button is the following code: Quite simple really. First we declare a new  loadVars()  object. We then tell our new  loadVars()  object (which I called ‘addressVars’) which script to load via the  load  method. I told it to load the script ‘addressbook.php’.  Lastly, we specify an  onLoad  function to tell our movie what to do with the loaded data. I told it to put the passed in values from the PHP script into our waiting dynamic textboxes. This function is vital. If you try and just match up the values without the  onLoad  function then Flash never knows they’ve been successfuly loaded. Now we turn our attention to our PHP script. We have to make this script prepare our name/value pairs in a format that Flash is able to deal with – we need to URLEncode them. In other words we need to make them appear like so: theName=Kev&theEmail=kevleitch@gmail.com Here’s the PHP to do this: Again, this is very straightfoward as this is a simple example. First we set our values. We then essentially build a querystring to wrap these name/value pairs up and finally we echo them out. A good way of testing to make sure you have this stage right is to run the script by itself –  try it now for yourself . And thats that! Simple. Obviously you can extend the functionality to grab data from databases or pass in arrays to build navigable recordsets within Flash. I’m quite happy to go through these more advanced capabilities if anyone so desires but for now,  grab the source files for yourself .

Wall Street Journal Former FDA Head Held Shares In Regulated Firms as Late as '04 By SARAH LUECK and ANNA WILDE MATHEWS Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL October 26, 2005; Page A2 WASHINGTON – As late as 2004, former Food and Drug Administration head Lester Crawford or his wife owned stock in companies that make or distribute products regulated by the agency, a factor that may have led to his abrupt departure last month. For most of 2004, Dr. Crawford was the FDA's acting commissioner, and prior to that he had been a deputy commissioner at the agency. Financial disclosure forms released under the Freedom of Information Act show that during at least part of that time, he or his wife held stock in companies that have some of their business regulated by FDA, including Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Teleflex Inc., which make medical devices, food distributor Sysco Corp. and Embrex Inc., an agricultural biotechnology company on whose board Dr. Crawford once sat

Clevland Clinic: Ties to Industry Cloud a Clinic's Mission
" "
 Ties to Industry Cloud a Clinic's Mission By REED ABELSON and STEPHANIE SAUL December 17, 2005 Dr. Eric J. Topol, a cardiologist, has been perhaps the most public face of the prestigious Cleveland Clinic Foundation, a prominent medical center regarded as one of the nation's best. Not shy in the media spotlight, Dr. Topol has cultivated the persona of a Naderesque crusader against drugs he deems dangerous, as well as their makers. Some of his most impassioned criticism has been aimed at Merck and its drug Vioxx, the painkiller the company withdrew from the market over questions about its safety. But he has also been outspoken recently about other drugs. Now, Dr. Topol's bluntness - refreshing to his admirers, startlingly unscientific to his targets and his critics - has drawn a bright spotlight to his own conduct and that of the Cleveland Clinic. In the last month, he has been demoted and the clinic's image has been tarnished in what has become an unusually public dispute pitting him against the clinic's chief executive, Dr. Delos Cosgrove. Dr. Topol, who retains the position of chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the clinic, suggested in a Webcast on Thursday (http://www.theheart.org) that his unabashed willingness to take on Merck was a principal reason for his removal this month as head of the clinic's medical college. In what Merck lawyers have suggested is a vendetta, he described the company's behavior as \"appalling\" in recent testimony in a Vioxx lawsuit. But his demotion has drawn attention to the mounting tensions between the clinic's research mission and its deep ties to the businesses that finance that research. Both Dr. Topol and Dr. Cosgrove refused to comment for this article, but associates say Dr. Topol may decide to leave the clinic. The dispute at the Cleveland Clinic goes far beyond a simple power struggle between strong-willed men who competed for the clinic's top job. Dr. Topol severed his ties to industry after being embarrassed last December by an article in Fortune magazine. But the continued controversy has focused attention on the many longstanding corporate ties at the clinic. Those business links involve not only staff doctors and researchers, but also Dr. Cosgrove and the clinic's board. The Cleveland Clinic is emblematic of the way the drug and medical device industries and the investment community work closely with medical researchers and doctors to develop and promote new medicines and technologies. Almost inevitably, such relationships raise concerns about possible conflicts of interest that could lead doctors to favor some treatments over others or to bias the results of medical research. \"It's not just the Cleveland Clinic,\" said Les Funtleyder, a health care strategist at the investment company Miller Tabak & Company in New York. He says other high-profile academic medical centers also have numerous financial ties that raise the potential for conflicts of interest. Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, a former editor in chief for The New England Journal of Medicine, describes the potential conflicts at the clinic \"as extremely serious ones\" but notes that the Cleveland Clinic is \"not unique at all.\" It was Dr. Topol's criticism of Merck that indirectly brought the clinic's conflicts to the fore. After the drug was withdrawn in September 2004 by Merck, Dr. Topol, who in journal articles had questioned the drug's cardiovascular safety, criticized the company's conduct. Dr. Topol soon found himself under attack. He was the subject of the Fortune magazine article, which contended he had a conflict of interest. A hedge fund that listed Dr. Topol on its advisory panel had been a short seller of Merck's stock before the Vioxx withdrawal. Dr. Topol said he had nothing to do with the fund's action, which was a financial bet that the share price would fall. Dr. Topol also found himself under fire at the clinic, where he would later claim that the chairman of the trustees, Malachi Mixon, had been contacted by Merck's chief executive at the time, Raymond V. Gilmartin. In any event, the clinic investigated Dr. Topol's business dealings, according to people briefed on the inquiry. Dr. Topol suggested in his Webcast that the clinic's pique might be related to the relationship between Mr. Gilmartin and Mr. Mixon, who attended Harvard Business School together. Mr. Mixon, in an interview, would not discuss any conversations he had with Mr. Gilmartin on the subject. A Merck spokeswoman, however, denied that Mr. Gilmartin had ever contacted the Cleveland Clinic. After the Fortune article, Dr. Topol publicly announced that he would cut all ties to industry, which included relationships with Eli Lilly, deCode Genetics and the Medicines Company - despite the fact that many doctors at the clinic and elsewhere had similar consulting deals. \"I think there's a real problem in academics today,\" he told The New York Times in January. \"There's a very close-knit relationship with industry, and it's too close when any individual can derive a profit from that relationship.\" The Cleveland Clinic itself was at the time finishing a set of ethical guidelines in which physicians and researchers were encouraged to continue working with industry, but were told that their ties would require reviews. When his contract came up for renewal at the clinic at the end of last year, the clinic put Dr. Topol on a form of probation, giving him a six-month contract rather than the usual yearlong agreement, according to associates. It was a largely symbolic move, but associates said it angered Dr. Topol, who in 15 years at the clinic had been responsible for establishing the clinic's medical school and elevating the reputation of its cardiovascular medicine unit. On the Webcast, Dr. Topol said the conflict-of-interest committee, on which he served, had looked into the financial arrangements of other doctors, including Dr. Cosgrove, as well as the fact that clinic patients were being used in tests of medical devices made by companies in which the clinic had financial interests. Some of the clinic's perceived conflicts begin at the very top. Mr. BR Mixon, for example, is chief executive of Invacare, a major health care supply company. The company not only conducts about $200,000 a year in business with the clinic, but several people with clinic ties are on the Invacare board. They include Dr. Bernadine Healy, the former head of the Red Cross who is married to Dr. Floyd D. Loop, the cardiac surgeon who led the clinic until he retired last year and was replaced by Dr. Cosgrove. Dr. Healy, who could not be reached for comment, owns options for 41,570 shares of stock in Invacare, according to a securities filing from earlier this year. Mr. Mixon, who would not address other issues in this article, said his company's business dealings with the clinic constituted \"peanuts\" in the context of his company's overall annual revenue of about $1.5 billion. A clinic spokeswoman, Eileen Sheil, said the clinic would not respond to questions about Mr. Mixon's company or Invacare's other board members. Nor would the clinic address questions involving a number of Dr. Cosgrove's financial arrangements, although Ms. Sheil said he had severed those ties. In a statement, the clinic said it had begun an independent review of conflicts, to be conducted by an outside group. Dr. Cosgrove, a well-regarded cardiac surgeon, is intimately familiar with the role physicians play in industry. His inventions include the Cosgrove-Edwards heart device, marketed by Edwards Lifesciences. The devices are used at the Cleveland Clinic, although the clinic would not discuss how or whether patients are informed of Dr. Cosgrove's connection when they are used. Dr. Cosgrove also spearheaded the clinic's entrepreneurial efforts through a venture capital fund. In an article last January, The New York Times described various companies in which the clinic had a financial interest, including AtriCure, the maker of a heart device. The Wall Street Journal featured AtriCure in a front-page article about the Cleveland Clinic this week. All of this attention threatens to tarnish the clinic's image as an institution conducting world-class medical research. \"All of these pieces of information coming out bit by bit are potentially damaging to the clinic's reputation,\" said Dr. Mildred K. Cho, a medical ethicist at Stanford University. The clinic says its board of trustees has appointed an independent group to review the clinic's conflicts. But, in the meantime, Dr. Topol has been removed from the conflict-of-interest committee, a position he held by virtue of his leadership role at the medical college. The publicity may prompt change, said Dr. Kassirer, the former medical journal editor. \"The only question is whether it will really embarrass anyone. The clinic is so powerful, it has so much clout.\"

As I am three years older than him, and have put more hours in as a therapist as he has has a doctor, I plan on submitting my resume for consideration for the number 2 position at the APA on Monday. Wall Street biotech insider gets No. 2 job at the FDA By Alicia Mundy Seattle Times Washington bureau Only a month ago, Dr. Scott Gottlieb was a Wall Street insider, promoting hot biotech stocks to investors. Now Gottlieb holds the No. 2 job at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency that approves new drugs, oversees their safety and affects the fortunes of companies he once touted. Wall Street likes the appointment of Gottlieb, 33, who believes in faster drug approval and fewer news-release warnings to the public about potential side effects of drugs. But some medical experts are shocked by his July 29 appointment, coming at a time when the public is increasingly concerned about the safety of popular medicines. In addition, the federal government has just begun scrutinizing the growing financial ties between Wall Street firms and doctors researching new drugs. Gottlieb's new job \"further impedes the independence of the FDA,\" said Dr. Jerome Kassirer, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. \"Gottlieb has an orientation which belies the goal of the FDA.\" \"I've never heard of anything like this,\" said Merrill Goozner, a director at the liberal Center for Science in the Public Interest. \"If he's had dealings regarding companies whose products are up for review at the agency, it strikes me as a potential conflict of interest. You want a barrier between the regulated and the regulators. It's fundamental,\" Goozner said. Dr. Scott Gottlieb FDA deputy commissioner for policy Age: 33 Salary: About $140,000 1994: Bachelor's degree in economics, Wesleyan University 1994-1995: Alex. Brown & Sons, investment bank 1995-1999: Mount Sinai Medical School, New York 1996-2001: Wrote for The Journal of the American Medical Association 1997-2005: Staff writer, British Medical Journal 2000-2002: Author, Gilder Biotech Report 2003-2005: Medical internist, Stamford (Conn.)

Until last month, Gottlieb was editor of a popular biotechnology investor newsletter, Forbes / Gottlieb Medical Technology Investor. Forbes touted Gottlieb's stock-picking success on its Web site in mid-May: \"Special Offer: In the last few months, Dr. Scott Gottlieb recommended two cancer cure stocks to subscribers that have already climbed 38%. Click here for the latest report from Forbes / Gottlieb Medical Technology Investor, 'Three Biotech Stocks To Buy Now.' \" Now, as one of three deputy commissioners, Gottlieb will help oversee such major policies as the FDA's fast-track approval process for drug and biotech products, a priority for many Wall Street funds and the pharmaceutical industry. Gottlieb said he has cut his ties to Wall Street and discontinued his newsletter. He doesn't see a conflict between that work and his new role as a high-ranking regulator. \"What I learned while working on Wall Street has informed almost everything that I have done since, but especially my work in the government,\" he responded in an e-mail to questions from The Seattle Times. (The FDA would not allow the Times to interview Gottlieb or provide answers to questions about his background. The FDA has not released his financial-disclosure forms.) \"[It] has helped me appreciate where regulatory policy can be improved upon to help enable medical innovation and to turn scientific breakthroughs into practical medical solutions that can help patients.\" Gottlieb was an analyst for a Wall Street investment firm before going to Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York. He earned a medical degree in 1999, then did an internal-medicine residency. From 2003 until a few weeks ago, he saw patients during weekend shifts two or three times a month at Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Conn., he said. Since becoming a physician, he has worn many hats. From 2000 to 2002, Gottlieb wrote the Gilder Biotech Report, an investment newsletter, reporting on potential FDA decisions, drug and biotech developments. He also worked as a staff writer for the British Medical Journal. In 2003, he was a full-time resident scholar working on FDA policy issues at Washington, D.C.'s most formidable conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). Along the way, he became a leading proponent of doctors increasing their income by selling their understanding of drugs and the federal regulatory process to stock analysts and investment firms — \"Moving your Career from Main Street to Wall Street,\" as Gottlieb wrote in an investment column in the American Medical Association newsletter. He joined the Food and Drug Administration in March 2003 as a senior adviser on policy and soon made an impression. Later that year, the SG Cowen brokerage house sent a report to subscribers, \"A Recap of What's Gone Right at the FDA,\" that praised Gottlieb and other new FDA officials under then-Commissioner Dr. Mark McClellan for working to streamline the drug-approval process. \"Should McClellan's team succeed in getting their strategies adopted into the framework of the approval process, the team's impact on FDA policy could last well beyond the current administration.\" Gottlieb moved with McClellan, brother of White House spokesman Scott McClellan, to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in June 2004 and left that October. He then returned as a full-time scholar at the AEI and started the Forbes / Gottlieb Medical Technology Report. Gottlieb, a Bush administration appointee making about $140,000, comes to the FDA with an agenda. In addition to advocating faster drug approvals, he has complained the FDA sends out too many \"shotgun warnings\" on any particular drug's emerging side effects, which he said may cause patients to overreact. He wants the warnings to be sent to doctors first, and without \"overstating a product's risk.\" He also has urged that the FDA change longstanding policy and release data on experimental drugs at different stages of the research, from animal tests to final patient studies. Releasing more data at each stage would help investors put money behind promising drugs and products earlier and would better protect patients in the clinical trials, he has explained. Three years ago, Gottlieb wrote about an issue that was spotlighted last month in a Seattle Times investigation — the practice of doctors leaking details of ongoing drug research to investment firms, which can then profit from the information by selling or buying stocks. The Times found 26 cases in which doctors leaked confidential and critical details of their ongoing drug research to Wall Street firms. The report has led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. \"Traders will go to great lengths to get market signals from medical researchers,\" Gottlieb wrote in Barron's, an investor publication, \"and the tight lid the FDA keeps on clinical-trials data has spawned a thriving niche of boutique investment-research firms that link money managers with medical experts capable of giving investors a wink and a nod.\" Gottlieb is against such leaks. But he did not call for better enforcement of confidentiality agreements that should preclude such behavior. He instead urged that the FDA open up its drug-approval process to investors and the public. \"Bizarre FDA rules allow companies to hide clinical information practically in perpetuity. Something needs to change,\" he wrote in the Gilder Biotech newsletter in 2002. \"The FDA could and should release data contained in a company's (FDA) filings at each stage in the process. ... Why shouldn't markets know what bureaucrats and insiders do?\" Kassirer, the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, said early release of clinical-trial information \"strikes me as potentially good for investors but bad for the validity of clinical research.\" \"Releasing data early could result in premature and erroneous conclusions about the drug or device being tested, premature ending of clinical trials and even inappropriate enrollment of patients,\" he said. The FDA would not comment on Gottlieb's ideas on changing policy to allow for earlier release of clinical trial information, except to note that the articles were written before Gottlieb joined the agency. He also has consulted for, and written positively about, a major matchmaking firm that links doctors with Wall Street investors, the Gerson Lehrman Group in New York. He has known founder Mark Gerson for several years, and both are part of the conservative establishment in D.C. With his pro-market views \"Scott is popular with some people at the White House,\" said Robert Goldberg of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. He is a friend of both men. Gottlieb highlighted Gerson's firm in investment columns he wrote for the AMA newsletter, and encouraged doctors to join Gerson's network and others. Not only can doctors increase their income, but they can help Wall Street investors decide which new technologies to put their money behind, he wrote. Gottlieb said by e-mail that he was not paid to recruit physicians for Gerson's group. He added he had recommended a handful of policy-makers to Gerson Lehrman and was paid for probably fewer than eight hours of work. Gottlieb said he also did a little work for the SG Cowen brokerage house but has not taken part in any conference calls between drug researchers and investors discussing ongoing clinical research. When the FDA announced Gottlieb's hiring last month, it noted Gottlieb had been a practicing physician, a scholar at AEI and correspondent for the British Medical Journal. The agency did not mention Gottlieb's stints as editor of the two popular biotech investment newsletters or his work with Wall Street firms.

Poul Thorsen Indicted on 13 Counts of Fraud and 9 Counts of Money Laundering

 Dane indicted for defrauding CDC  | Atlanta Business Chronicle  
 
 A Danish man was indicted Wednesday on charges of wire fraud and money laundering for allegedly concocting a scheme to steal more than $1 million in autism research money from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 
The indictment charges Poul Thorsen, 49, with 13 counts of wire fraud and nine counts of money laundering. The wire fraud counts each carry a maximum of 20 years in prison and the money laundering counts each carry a maximum of 10 years in prison, with a fine of up to $250,000 for each count. 
 
The federal government also seeks forfeiture of all property derived from the alleged offenses, including an Atlanta residence, two cars and a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
 
According to U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates, the charges and other information presented in court, Thorsen worked in the 1990s as a visiting scientist at the CDC Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, when the CDC was soliciting grant applications for research related to infant disabilities. 
 
Thorsen promoted the idea of awarding the grant to Denmark and provided input and guidance for the research. From 2000 to 2009, the CDC awarded more than $11 million to two governmental agencies in Denmark to study the relationship between autism and exposure to vaccines, between cerebral palsy and infection during pregnancy and between childhood development and fetal alcohol exposure. 
 
In 2002, Thorsen moved to Denmark and became the principal investigator for the grant, responsible for administering the research money awarded by the CDC. 
 
Once in Denmark, Thorsen allegedly began stealing the grant money by submitting fraudulent documents to have expenses supposedly related to the Danish studies be paid with the grant money. He provided the documents to the Danish government, Aarhus University and Odense University Hospital, where scientists performed research under the grant. 
 
From February 2004 through June 2008, Thorsen allegedly submitted more than a dozen fraudulent invoices, purportedly signed by a laboratory section chief at the CDC, for reimbursement of expenses that Thorsen claimed were incurred in connection with the CDC grant. The invoices falsely claimed that a CDC laboratory had performed work and was owed grant money. 
 
Based on these invoices, Aarhus University, where Thorsen also held a faculty position, transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to bank accounts held at the CDC Federal Credit Union in Atlanta -- accounts that Aarhus University believed belonged to the CDC. The CDC Federal Credit Union accounts were instead personal accounts held by Thorsen, the federal government said. 
 
After the money was transferred, Thorsen allegedly withdrew the fraud proceeds for his own personal use to buy a home in Atlanta, a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and Audi and Honda vehicles, and to get numerous cashier’s checks. 
 
Thorsen allegedly pocketed more than $1 million from the scheme. 
My prediction?  Another attack will be launched on Wakefield.  ;)

"22972" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/10/30/oig-fugitive-poul-thorsen/" "OIG Fugitive: Poul Thorsen" "The  Office of the Inspector General  (OIG) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lists Paul Thorsen as their number one  fugitive  and states that he is in his home country of Denmark awaiting extradition to the U.S. to stand trial.  The OIG statement on Paul Thorsen is below. He is alleged to have defrauded the U.S. government by diverting funds intended to support research contracted by the CDC.  While he is indicted on multiple counts of wire fraud and money laundering, there is no crime involved in the massive breach of the public trust involved. Poul Thorsen’s group’s work included studies into the alleged link between vaccines and autism. His indictment has been and is being exploited by groups who wish to cast doubt on his entire group’s efforts and the results they found. There is no charge, no crime for the damage potentially done to public health efforts.  Here is the OIG statement: From approximately February 2004 until February 2010, Poul Thorsen executed a scheme to steal grant money awarded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC had awarded grant money to Denmark for research involving infant disabilities, autism, genetic disorders, and fetal alcohol syndrome. CDC awarded the grant to fund studies of the relationship between autism and the exposure to vaccines, the relationship between cerebral palsy and infection during pregnancy, and the relationship between developmental outcomes and fetal alcohol exposure. 
Thorsen worked as a visiting scientist at CDC, Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, before the grant was awarded. 
The initial grant was awarded to the Danish Medical Research Council. In approximately 2007, a second grant was awarded to the Danish Agency for Science, Technology, and Innovation. Both agencies are governmental agencies in Denmark. The research was done by the Aarhaus University and Odense University Hospital in Denmark. 
Thorsen allegedly diverted over $1 million of the CDC grant money to his own personal bank account. Thorsen submitted fraudulent invoices on CDC letterhead to medical facilities assisting in the research for reimbursement of work allegedly covered by the grants. The invoices were addressed to Aarhaus University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The fact that the invoices were on CDC letterhead made it appear that CDC was requesting the money from Aarhaus University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital although the bank account listed on the invoices belonged to Thorsen. 
In April 2011, Thorsen was indicted on 22 counts of Wire Fraud and Money Laundering. 
According to bank account records, Thorsen purchased a home in Atlanta, a Harley Davidson motorcycle, an Audi automobile, and a Honda SUV with funds that he received from the CDC grants. 
Thorsen is currently in Denmark and is awaiting extradition to the United States.

Doc Testifies Against Merck, Gets Fired
" "
The doctor that figured out that something was wrong with Vioxx, tried (to no avail) to get Merck to run clinical trials on it in 2001, and testified to that effect during the trial, has been fired from his job as provost at the Cleveland Clinic 2 days after testifying.  This despite the fact that he was a founding member of the clinic and has been responsible for bringing in a 40 million dollar increase in funds to the clinic.  \"On Monday, the clinic's board will review Topol's removal from the leadership posts by chief executive officer Delos Cosgrove\" I am going to give Dr. Cosgrove a call and encourage him to give this \"restructuring\" decision a hard second look.  Here is his contact information in case any one wants to do the same. Cosgrove, Delos, M.D.  Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Governors, CCF Phone: (216) 444-2300 Here is the link to the Cleveland Clinic's contact page: http://www.clevelandclinic.org/contact/form.asp This morning I sent them this email: Dear Sirs, I read the Bloomberg story today on Dr. Topol's firing and I was extremely disturbed by it.  From where I sit, it seems like he may being punished for being an honest doctor and protecting patients because he spoke out against a powerful  pharmaceutical company.  I truly hope that  this is not the case. I understand this decision will be reviewed  on Monday by Dr. Cosgrove.  I hope that he takes a very hard second look at  this decision as it is potentially a huge miscarriage of justice.  I have tried to reach Dr. Cosgrove this morning to share my thoughts over the phone, but there was no answer.  I am assuming that the office is not staffed as it is a Saturday. I will try to reach him again Monday morning. Thank You, Ginger Taylor, M.S. From Teresa Binstock: Another honest doc put out to pasture.

Boston Globe, Massachusetts. 10 December 2005. * * * * Vioxx witness fired from top posts The medical school leader criticized Merck recently at a federal trial. He has often warned of the pain reliever. By David Voreacos and Jef Feeley BLOOMBERG NEWS Dec. 10, 2005 A cardiologist who testified at a federal trial in Houston that Merck & Co. Inc.'s Vioxx pain reliever posed an \"extraordinary risk\" of causing heart attacks has been removed from two leadership positions at the Cleveland Clinic medical school. Eric Topol, 51, criticized Merck in testimony Dec. 3 at the trial of a lawsuit by the widow of Richard \"Dicky\" Irvin, who blames her husband's fatal heart attack on Vioxx. Two days later, Topol was removed as provost and chief academic officer at the medical school. He remains chairman of the clinic's cardiovascular medicine department. Federal jurors began deliberating Thursday on whether Merck, which has significant operations in the Philadelphia area, failed to warn of Vioxx's risks before pulling it off the market last year. The jury is to return today to resume deliberations. In August, a Texas state jury ordered Merck to pay $253 million to the widow of a Vioxx user, an amount that will be reduced to $26 million under state law. Last month, a New Jersey jury ruled that Merck was not liable for the heart attack of an Idaho postal worker. Topol's removal from the academic posts had \"absolutely\" nothing to do with his testimony or his views on Vioxx, said Eileen Sheil, a spokeswoman for the Ohio hospital system. \"We've had a series of changes in the administration and the way things are structured. Dr. Topol is a key physician here at the clinic, and he's done a tremendous amount that has contributed to the success of the clinic.\" Topol did not immediately return a phone call or e-mail seeking comment. He has been a professor at the Cleveland Clinic since 1991, and assumed the medical school posts in 2001. Topol has been a central figure in the scientific debate over Vioxx - which generated $2.5 billion in annual sales before Merck withdrew it last year - saying it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes in long-term users. Topol wrote a paper in 2001 highlighting the risks of Vioxx, concluding that patients experienced sharply higher rates of heart problems four to six weeks after starting the drug. Merck says Vioxx poses a risk only after 18 months of daily use. Topol testified that he and his colleagues urged Merck to conduct clinical trials on the risks and that the company refused. Topol told jurors in the Irvin case that Merck researchers visited him before he published his paper and said \"we had gotten it wrong, and we'd be embarrassed if we published it.\" In a videotaped deposition, he said former Merck chief executive officer Raymond Gilmartin called Malachi Mixon, chairman of the Cleveland Clinic's board, in October 2004 to question why Topol had targeted Vioxx. As Topol recalled it, Gilmartin said: \"What has Merck ever done to the Cleveland Clinic to warrant this?\" Topol testified that the approach by Gilmartin \"appalled\" him. In 2002, Topol helped found the medical school, which accepted its first students in 2004, Sheil said. On Monday, the clinic's board will review Topol's removal from the leadership posts by chief executive officer Delos Cosgrove, Sheil said. Topol created the clinic's division of clinical research, and oversaw an increase in National Institutes of Health grants from $50 million in 2001 to $90 million in 2005, Sheil said. Shares of Merck fell 55 cents to $29.13 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

FBI Investigating Attack on Senate Staffer
" "
This week Emilia DiSanto, top staffer for Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), was attacked in front of her home by a large, masked man wielding a baseball bat.  The police are investigating it as an attempted murder.  The FBI is looking into the possibility that the attack was work related and perpetrated by someone who did not like the Senator's \"aggressive oversight of the public and private sector\".  The FDA and Big Pharma are among those in Grassley's cross hairs for not being vigilant enough with product safety. I hate to think things have actually gotten that ugly, but thought it was something to keep an eye on. Thanks to researcher Teresa Binstock putting these articles together. FBI called in on Hill By  Bob Cusack and Jackie Kucinich November 8, 2005 The FBI and Capitol Police are investigating the vicious attack of a top Senate staffer at her home last week amid concerns that the assault might be related to her work on the Finance Committee. Emilia DiSanto, chief investigator for committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), arrived at her suburban Virginia home after work Wednesday about 6:30 p.m. As she was unloading belongings from her car, a 6-foot-1-inch white man dressed in black struck her repeatedly with an unidentified object believed to be a baseball bat. After she screamed to her family inside the house, the assailant fled. DiSanto was transported to Inova Fair Oaks Hospital, where she was treated for significant upper-body injuries. Nine staples were needed to close her head wound. DiSanto, who declined to comment, has reported back to work. The attack and the possibility that it was motivated by congressional business have made some people anxious on Capitol Hill. \"This is of obvious concern to anyone working here,\" a Senate staffer said. \"It’s very disconcerting when you worry about someone resorting to violence. This could be intimidation, and you wonder whether it’s safe to do your job.\" The attack on DiSanto came two days before a bomb threat caused alarm at an Iowa veterans home where Grassley was scheduled to appear. According to the Iowa Times Republican, an anonymous caller told a switchboard operator Friday that a bomb would detonate in the center’s cemetery shortly before 1 p.m. The threat was not in the area where Grassley was scheduled to appear and later was deemed a false alarm. Grassley made the visit to the center as planned. No evidence has surfaced that definitively points to DiSanto’s work on the Finance Committee as the trigger for the attack, but sources say there are a number of clues that suggest it could be. The assailant was trying to hide his identity, wearing a hood and black gloves. He also did not make any demands before attacking the 49-year-old staffer. A working assumption among investigators is that he was waiting for her to arrive home. Sources say acts of violence in DiSanto’s neighborhood are rare. Grassley is known for his aggressive oversight of the public and private sector. Over the past year, he has scrutinized healthcare fraud, organ-donation procedures used by hospitals, drug-safety matters and the use of nonprofit groups related to former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. In her line of work, DiSanto \"doesn’t make a lot of friends,\" an aide said. Grassley spokeswoman Jill Kozeny said federal and local law-enforcement officials have not ruled out the possibility that the attack was work-related. She said Grassley and DiSanto have discussed the incident. The only reason why the FBI is involved is because the assault may have been work-related. There is no indication that the bomb threat and the DiSanto event are related. Fairfax County police are treating the attack as an attempted homicide. Some Senate staffers said Capitol Police did not initially treat the attack as work-related late last week. \"We don’t do law enforcement, but that one was a really hard one to swallow,\" a Senate aide said. Capitol Police said they were deferring to Fairfax County police, who are taking the lead on the probe. In response to the attack, Ken Cunningham, Grassley’s chief of staff, sent an e-mail to Grassley employees urging them to report any suspicious activity or incidents to the Senate sergeant at arms. Cunningham noted in the e-mail that Grassley had asked the FBI to investigate. Grassley is one of Capitol Hill’s most vocal critics of the FBI. Capitol Police Chief Terrence Gainer said the unit is looking at the possible relationship between the attack on DiSanto and her position at the Capitol. \"I think all the agents involved are looking into the motive,\" he added. Gainer said three agencies conferred Friday and yesterday to discuss the ongoing investigation. An FBI spokeswoman confirmed the agency is looking into the attack. Senate aides say they have been rattled by the incident, and some have taken extra precautions after hearing of it. DiSanto has worked on the Hill for more than a decade. In July 2000, she was identified by Fortune magazine as one of the \"Power 30\" in Washington as the staff director for then-Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Kit Bond (R-Mo.). She also worked for the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities in the mid 1990s. Grassley Demands Answers on Safety of U.S. Experimental Drugs by  Kristen Hallam Nov. 9 (Bloomberg) -- The head of the U.S. Senate committee that oversees the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs is demanding to know whether the government is doing enough to ensure safety during clinical trials of experimental drugs. Citing what he called an \"alarming\" report by Bloomberg News, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said federal agencies responsible for the drug trials owe the American people a better accounting of how the testing is conducted. A report in the December issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine found conflicts of interest and lax oversight in the drug-testing industry. Over the past 14 years, the article said, private companies have largely taken over the job of conducting studies on experimental treatments, supplanting universities. Scores of people have died or been injured, the article said. \"Not only is this treatment of participating patients and their families alarming, but it also undermines the credibility of the pharmaceutical research and development process and places the value of new pharmaceutical products in question,\" Grassley, an Iowa Republican, wrote in a letter to the Health and Human Services Department's inspector general. Grassley said Inspector General Daniel Levinson should quickly compile a list of recommendations his office has made since 1995 and determine whether the appropriate agencies are heeding them. The agencies include HHS, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. \"We must take every possible step to ensure that our clinical trial system is in fact the 'gold standard' that we expect it to be,\" Grassley said. He asked for a briefing by Levinson's staff \"at the earliest opportunity.\" Tightening the Rules Grassley said Levinson's office should examine the role of so-called institutional review boards that oversee the tests, with an eye toward adopting tougher oversight. The largest, Western Institutional Review Board of Olympia, Washington, is a for-profit company that oversees 17,000 trials. Don White, a spokesman for Levinson, declined to say whether his boss has received the letter. \"We are aware of Chairman Grassley's great interest in this area,\" White said. \"We've obviously done work on this before and already have work plans for the future.\" While Grassley's committee doesn't have direct jurisdiction over the FDA, he said its oversight of Medicare and Medicaid makes him responsible for ensuring medicines are safe. Grassley last year began an investigation of the FDA's handling of drug- safety issues after the withdrawal of Merck & Co.'s Vioxx painkiller. Industry-Sponsored Tests University medical faculties conducted 80 percent of industry-sponsored drug tests in 1991, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. Today, more than 75 percent of trials are done in doctors' offices or private test centers such as those run by SFBC International Inc., according to CenterWatch, a Boston-based compiler of clinical trial data. In many cases, the people who volunteer for the drug trials are no longer protected by review boards at universities and now must rely on for-profit review boards. Drugmakers pay for both the private testers and the boards monitoring the trials, raising a potential conflict of interest, Grassley said. Citing the Bloomberg article, Grassley wrote that test participants aren't always adequately warned of the risks. \"Some are dying as a result of the trials,\" Grassley said. In Houston, the Fabre Research Clinic has been reviewed by an oversight company set up by Louis Fabre, the owner of the clinic. In Miami, SFBC International, which runs the largest private testing center in North America, has used a review company owned by the wife of an SFBC executive. Shares of Miami-based SFBC dropped 26 percent after the Bloomberg report was published Nov. 2. 'Distortion of Our Work' SFBC Chairman Lisa Krinsky said last week the report was a ``severe distortion of our work.'' She said the company complies with all regulatory standards and never has been issued a warning letter by the FDA. A day after the Bloomberg report was published, Grassley said the FDA must do more to oversee clinical trials. In response to his comments, the FDA said last week in a statement that the agency ``is evolving our approach to clinical trial oversight. The protection of patients' rights is a fundamental focus.'' FDA spokeswoman Julie Zawisza yesterday declined to comment on Grassley's letter, saying she hasn't seen it. \"We do take very seriously our responsibility to protect people involved in clinical trials,\" she said. The FDA also said it is examining its reporting rules and the other issues raised by the article. Laboratory Rats Because experiments on laboratory rats can't reliably predict how a chemical will affect people, human testing of new drugs is vital. Helped by extensive clinical trials, drugmakers have developed antibiotics capable of curing life-threatening infections and come up with revolutionary treatments for diseases like cancer and AIDS over the years. \"The vast majority of clinical trials conducted in the United States meet high ethical standards,\" the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a Washington-based trade group, said last week in a written response to questions. \"The U.S. regulatory system is the world's gold standard, and the Food and Drug Administration has the best product-safety record.\" Ken Johnson, senior vice president for the trade group, said it would be inappropriate to provide detailed comments until the group reviews the practices in question. \"That review is now under way,'' he said. ``We are confident that our member companies are committed to conducting all clinical trials to the highest ethical standards.\" The organization's members include Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson. To contact the reporters on this story: Kristen Hallam in Washington khallam@bloomberg.net Philadelphia Inquirer Examines Grassley Investigations of FDA, Pharmaceutical Industry http://www.medicalnewstoday.com July 6, 2005 The Philadelphia Inquirer on Sunday examined how Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) \"has increasingly turned his spotlight on [FDA] and the global pharmaceutical industry.\" According to the Inquirer, Grassley has said that pharmaceutical companies and FDA moved too slowly to address safety problems of some drugs, including COX-2 inhibitors and antidepressants, in order to protect senior officials at the agency and possibly industry profits. His \"investigators have swarmed over the FDA,\" and the finance committee \"has become a favorite stop for agency whistleblowers,\" the Inquirer reports. Grassley said,  \"If it looks like I am going after the pharmaceutical industry, it is probably because the FDA is not doing its job of faithfully executing the laws and carrying out their function of making sure that drugs are safe and effective.\"  He added, \"I guess it all comes down to making sure that Medicaid and Medicare dollars are spent on safe drugs.\" Grassley ranks 30th in Congress in receiving campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. He said those contributions are made to support his positions on low taxes and pro-business policy (Mondics, Philadelphia Inquirer, 7/3). Sen. Grassley Calls for Investigation Into Reports That Drug Researchers Sold Early Drug Data to Wall Street Firms, USA http://www.medicalnewstoday.com August 10, 2005 Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Monday sent a letter to US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales urging the Department of Justice to investigate whether doctors participating in clinical trials are selling confidential information to stock analysts and investors, the New York Times reports. Grassley also sent the letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Christopher Cox, whose agency already is examining possible insider trading involving the approval of prescription drugs...  Update:  Apparently  Liberty Post  thinks that the oil companies are behind the hit, while  Kos  believes that this is the Republican party eating itself.

U.S Attorney General Issues Press Release on Poul Thorsen
" "
 Gotta admit... I truly never thought I would see Thorsen held responsible for this. 
 
So here is the next question... the DOJ lawyers used Thorsen's research in the Autism Omnibus hearings as evidence that vaccines don't cause autism.  Now the DOJ is prosecuting him for fraud.  Conflict of interest? 
 
Can-O-Worms. 
 
Here is the DOJ's statement:

 AUTISM RESEARCHER INDICTED FOR STEALING GRANT MONEY 
 
Thorsen Allegedly Absconded With Over $1 Million 
 
ATLANTA, GA -  POUL THORSEN, 49, of Denmark, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of wire fraud and money laundering based on a scheme to steal grant money the CDC had awarded to governmental agencies in Denmark for autism research. 
 
United States Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said of the case, “Grant money for disease research is a precious commodity.  When grant funds are stolen, we lose not only the money, but also the opportunity to better understand and cure debilitating diseases.  This defendant is alleged to have orchestrated a scheme to steal over $1 million in CDC grant money earmarked for autism research.  We will now seek the defendant’s extradition for him to face federal charges in the United States.” 
 
“Stealing research grant money to line his pockets, as Poul Thorsen stands accused of here today, cheats U.S. taxpayers and will simply not be tolerated,” said Derrick L. Jackson, Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta Region for the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health & Human Services.  “HHS/OIG will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to bring these criminals to justice.” 
 
Reginael D. McDaniel, Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta Region for Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation said, “Today’s global economy demands a high-level coordinated approach by multiple agencies and authorities in the investigation of financial crimes.  While schemes often become more sophisticated over time, fortunately, so do our investigative techniques.  IRS Criminal Investigation is proud to have shared its hallmark expertise in following the money trail in the scheme alleged in this indictment.” 
 
According to United States Attorney Yates, the charges and other information presented in court:  In the 1990s, THORSEN worked as a visiting scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, when the CDC was soliciting grant applications for research related to infant disabilities.  THORSEN successfully promoted the idea of awarding the grant to Denmark and provided input and guidance for the research to be conducted.  From 2000 to 2009, the CDC awarded over $11 million to two governmental agencies in Denmark to study the relationship between autism and exposure to vaccines, between cerebral palsy and infection during pregnancy, and between childhood development and fetal alcohol exposure.  In 2002, THORSEN moved to Denmark and became the principal investigator for the grant, responsible for administering the research money awarded by the CDC. 
 
Once in Denmark, THORSEN allegedly began stealing the grant money by submitting fraudulent documents to have expenses supposedly related to the Danish studies be paid with the grant money.  He provided the documents to the Danish government, and to Aarhus University and Odense University Hospital, where scientists performed research under the grant.  From February 2004 through June 2008, THORSEN allegedly submitted over a dozen fraudulent invoices, purportedly signed by a laboratory section chief at the CDC, for reimbursement of expenses that THORSEN claimed were incurred in connection with the CDC grant.  The invoices falsely claimed that a CDC laboratory had performed work and was owed grant money.  Based on these invoices, Aarhus University, where THORSEN also held a faculty position, transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to bank accounts held at the CDC Federal Credit Union in Atlanta, accounts which Aarhus University believed belonged to the CDC.  In truth, the CDC Federal Credit Union accounts were personal accounts held by THORSEN.  After the money was transferred, THORSEN allegedly withdrew it for his own personal use, buying a home in Atlanta, a Harley Davidson motorcycle, and Audi and Honda vehicles, and obtaining numerous cashier’s checks, from the fraud proceeds.  THORSEN allegedly absconded with over $1 million from the scheme. 
 
The indictment charges THORSEN with 13 counts of wire fraud and 9 counts of money laundering.  The wire fraud counts each carry a maximum of 20 years in prison, and the money laundering counts each carry a maximum of 10 years in prison, with a fine of up to $250,000 for each count.  The indictment also contains a forfeiture provision seeking forfeiture of all property derived from the offenses, including an Atlanta residence, two cars, and a Harley Davidson motorcycle.  In determining the actual sentence, the Court will consider the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which are not binding but provide appropriate sentencing ranges for most offenders. 
 
This case is being investigated by Special Agents of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health & Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division. 
 
Assistant United States Attorneys Stephen H. McClain and Michael J. Brown are prosecuting the case. 
 
Members of the public are reminded that the indictment contains only allegations.  A defendant is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the government’s burden to prove a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.

Drug Firms Need You To Fully Vaccinate Now More Than Ever
" "
 If you won't vaccinate for the sake of your kids, then good god man... do it out of pity for Pfizer and Sanofi. Profits are down and going to drop like a stone soon, and Japan just dropped two of their vaccines because they killed 4 children. 
 
Good news for Merck though... even though 93 girls have died after Gardasil, the US FDA still doesn't give a damn.  Thank god for corruption and revolving doors... am I right fellas? 
 
 
 
 
 Japan drops two vaccines after four deaths

Pfizer, Inc. 
TOKYO, March 6 (UPI) -- Japan's Health Ministry says it has suspended use of two vaccines after four children died after receiving them, Kyodo News reported. 
 
Sources told the Japanese news agency the ministry decided Friday to stop administering the Hib vaccine to prevent bacterial meningitis and a vaccine to protect against streptococcus pneumoniae. 
 
So far, no direct causal relationship has been established between the vaccines and the children's deaths, but the ministry intends to convene an expert panel in the coming days to look into the issue, the sources said. 
 
The four fatalities were a 3-month-old girl in Kawasaki who died Feb. 20, a 2-year-old boy in Takarazuka who died Tuesday, a 1-year-old girl in Nishinomiya who died Wednesday and a 6-month-old girl in Kyoto City who died Friday. 
 
Some of the children had underlying illnesses and others did not. 
 
Kyodo said all four children received a vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae manufactured by Pfizer Inc., based in New York, and all but the girl in Nishinomiya received ActHIB, made by Sanofi Pasteur Inc., based in Lyon, France. 
 
Except for the boy in Takarazuka, all also received a mixed vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus the same day they received other vaccines. 
 
Millions of doses of the vaccines have been administered in Japan in recent years.

 Drug Firms Face Billions in Losses in ’11 as Patents End 
 
By DUFF WILSON 
 
At the end of November, Pfizer stands to lose a $10-billion-a-year revenue stream when the patent on its blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor expires and cheaper generics begin to cut into the company’s huge sales. 
 
The loss poses a daunting challenge for Pfizer, one shared by nearly every major pharmaceutical company. This year alone, because of patent expirations, the drug industry will lose control over more than 10 megamedicines whose combined annual sales have neared $50 billion. 
 
This is a sobering reversal for an industry that just a few years ago was the world’s most profitable business sector but is now under pressure to reinvent itself and shed its dependence on blockbuster drugs. And it casts a spotlight on the problems drug companies now face: a drought of big drug breakthroughs and research discoveries; pressure from insurers and the government to hold down prices; regulatory vigilance and government investigations; and thousands of layoffs in research and development. 
 
Morgan Stanley recently downgraded the entire group of multinational pharmaceutical companies based in Europe — AstraZeneca, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche — in a report titled “An Avalanche of Risk? Downgrading to Cautious.” The analysts wrote, “The operating environment for pharma is worsening rapidly.” 
 
The same concerns apply to drug giants in the United States. They are all struggling with research failures as they scramble to replace their cash cows, like Pfizer’s multimillion-dollar gamble on a replacement for the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which failed miserably in clinical trials. Drug companies cut 53,000 jobs last year and 61,000 in 2009, far more than most other sectors, according to the outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
 
“This is panic time, this is truly panic time for the industry,” said Kenneth I. Kaitin, director of the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. “I don’t think there’s a company out there that doesn’t realize they don’t have enough products in the pipeline or the portfolio, don’t have enough revenue to sustain their research and development.” 
 
While industrywide research and development spending has nearly doubled to $45 billion a year over the last decade, the Food and Drug Administration has approved fewer and fewer new drugs. Pfizer and Eli Lilly had major setbacks last year in once-promising Alzheimer’s drug experiments. Merck discontinued one of two major clinical trials testing its top acquisition from its merger with Schering Plough, a blood thinner that caused dangerous amounts of bleeding in some patients. 
 
Drug company executives have begun addressing the calls for reinvention. 
 
“We have to fix our innovative core,” Pfizer’s new president, Ian C. Read, said in an interview recently. To do that, the company is refocusing on smaller niches in cancer, inflammation, neuroscience and branded generics — and slashing as much as 30 percent of its own research and development spending in the next two years as its scientists work on only the most potentially profitable prospects. 
 
Consumers should see a financial benefit as lower-cost generics replace the expensive elite drugs, but may suffer in the long term if companies reduce research and do not produce new drugs that meet the public’s needs. 
 
“You don’t lay off R&D if it’s just a cycle,” says Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan business school who follows the pharmaceutical industry. “That kills progress.” 
 
The federal government is also concerned about the slowing pace of new drugs coming from the industry. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, recently proposed a billion-dollar drug development center at the agency. 
 
“We seem to have a systemic problem here,” Dr. Collins said, adding that government research efforts were intended to feed the private sector, not compete with it. 
 
Mr. Read of Pfizer says new products can replace some but not all of the patent losses. 
 
“The hurricane is making landfall,” said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, but he added that Pfizer is among several drug companies giving solace to shareholders by returning money through stock buybacks and dividends. Pfizer’s best asset, he said, is its $20 billion stockpile of cash. Yet since 2000, Pfizer’s and Merck’s share prices dropped about 60 percent, while the Dow rose 19 percent. 
 
Several of the drug titans have bought competitors with newer products to fill their own sales gaps, essentially paying cash for future revenue as their own research was flagging. In the last two years, Pfizer paid $68 billion for Wyeth, Merck paid $41 billion for Schering-Plough, Roche paid $46 billion for Genentech, and Sanofi-Aventis paid $20 billion for Genzyme. 
 
Henry G. Grabowski, a professor of economics and director of the Duke University program in pharmaceutical health economics, likened the recent pharmaceutical megamergers to those that occurred in the banking and telecommunications industries when they were hit by financial shocks in the 1990s. 
 
But he warned that this wave would not guarantee significant research developments in the long term. 
 
“It’s never been shown that these big horizontal mergers are good for R&D productivity,” Dr. Grabowski said. “I’m in a show-me mode that they get you any real advances other than some short-term cost efficiencies that wear out.” 
 
As they move beyond the blockbuster model, companies are refining their approach toward personalized medicines and forming more partnerships. Using genetic or other tests, the plan is to sell new drugs not to millions and millions of people, but to those who would most clearly benefit. 
 
Still, the industry faces intense pressure from generic competition and has tried every tactic to ward it off, including extended-release versions of the same medicine and new pills that combine two ingredients. But 75 percent of all prescriptions in the United States are now low-price, low-profit generic drugs. 
 
At the same time, pharmaceutical companies are being urged by managed care and government health programs to cut prices and improve reimbursement terms for their most profitable pills. 
 
That follows similar practices in Europe, where Germany and the Britain, among other countries, are all increasing pressure for lower drug prices. 
 
“Europe is an ugly place to do business today and will be in five years’ time,” Christopher A. Viehbacher, chief executive of the French drug giant Sanofi-Aventis, said in an interview. 
 
In the United States, Mr. Viehbacher said generic drugs were taking over the primary care market, leaving the best growth potential in specialty markets and in emerging nations like China, Brazil and Indonesia. 
 
Even in those markets, health systems will not be the profit centers that the United States has been. China, emerging this year as the third-largest pharmaceutical market behind the United States and Japan, plans to cut hundreds of drug prices by an average of 40 percent. 
 
The drug industry has long said that Americans fueled the research engine, spending much more per capita on prescriptions than in any other nation, and paying the highest prices for prescribed medicines. 
 
Drug industry lobbyists have beaten back Democratic proposals to set prices at the lower levels of nations like Canada or to allow Medicare to directly negotiate prices. The industry, by supporting President Obama’s health care overhaul, capped its contribution at $90 billion over 10 years in return for the promise of up to 32 million newly insured customers starting in 2014. 
 
The new law also contains a major threat to drug industry profits in a little-known section that would allow centralized price-setting. Beginning in 2015, an independent board appointed by the president could lower prices across the board in Medicare unless Congress acted each year to overrule it. Medicare pays more than 20 percent of the nation’s retail drug bills. 
 
The industry has also been unsettled by the scores of fraud, bribery and kickback cases involving conduct that federal investigators contend have added billions to the nation’s drug bill. The penalties have been stiff, and the settlements steep. 
 
In 2009, Pfizer paid the largest criminal fine in the nation’s history as part of a $2.3 billion settlement over marketing drugs for unapproved uses. Some analysts say larger fraud and foreign bribery cases will come. The drug companies are responding with extra-careful sales training and vows to restrain marketing zeal. But the change in corporate culture could cost them: internal documents show some of the companies have profited spectacularly from seeking federal approval of a new drug for a limited use, then marketing it far more widely off label. 
 
Other changes are afoot that will no doubt affect the bottom line. They include growing restrictions on gifts, fees and trips to influence doctors to use their products; curbs on the ghost writing of medical journal articles and a push for more disclosure of negative study results. As the golden age of blockbuster drugs fades, so are some of the marketing excesses of the past two decades — the tactics that helped bring in immense profits. 
 
Some analysts see the industry’s decline as an investment opportunity. They say drug stocks are good buys because of low price-to-earnings ratios, which typically reflect industry decline or investor pessimism, and high dividend yields averaging more than 4 percent a year.

 Biased Much? The New York Times recently published  an article  describing parents who are hell-bent on blaming thimerosal as an autism cause/trigger, despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary. Now, I'm not in the thimerosal camp myself. I think Leelo's autism stems from a genetic predisposition set off by environmental factors (which means, as I've so often written, privately, that if you geeks are going to fuck each other, then drink bottled water, avoid seafood, and go organic). Even so, I find it hard to take the article seriously when so many seats on the NYT board of directors are sat on by big pharmaceutical industry-linked bottoms. Raul E. Cesan he became president of Schering Laboratories, the U.S. pharmaceutical marketing arm, and in 1994, became president of Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals. Ellen R. Marram Ms. Marram also serves on the board of directors of the Ford Motor Company and Eli Lilly and Company. William E. Kennard Mr. Kennard joined The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, in May 2001 as a managing director in the global telecommunications and media group. Henry B. Schacht Mr. Schacht also serves on the boards of Alcoa (Aluminum Company of America), Johnson & Johnson and Lucent Technologies Inc.[Johnson & Johnson is one of the companies that makes rhogam] Cathy J. Sulzberger She was also an editor of Consumer Drug: Digest: American Society of Hospital Pharmacists and Medication Teaching Manual: National Association of Retail Druggist, and a Consumer Editor of the Journal of the National Association of Retail Druggists. More information: http://www.nytco.com/company-directors.html FYI, I got this breakdown from a slow/no vaccinations egroup. The original researcher's name was not listed in the post. And no, I don't know why my HTML is all crazy-wonked.

I have no words. Alliance For Human Research Protection Promoting Openness, Full Disclosure, and Accountability http://www.ahrp.org and http://ahrp.blogspot.com America's health care oversight agencies are running amok wasting taxpayer money while undermining the public health instead of protecting it. Below are the highlights of the 115 page review issued by The United States Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information and International Security, Minority Office, Under the Direction of Senator Tom Coburn, Ranking Minority Member, June 2007. U.S federal healthcare oversight agency, it appears are being run by reckless and irresponsible administrators. Previous reports confirmed this sorry state of affairs at the Food an Drug Administration--which is largely under the control of the pharmaceutical industry that it is mandated to oversee; at the National Institutes of Health financial conflicts of interest and scientist' double dipping has undermined the integrity of science and the safety of human subjects; the Environmental Protection Agency is headed by an administrator who would conduct a pesticide experiment on African American toddlers were it not for the public outcry and the intervention of several senators http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/05/09/07.php and http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/05/11/30.php The latest indictment is contained in an extraordinary report just published by the US Senate assessing the performance of the Centers for Disease Control: \"CDC Off-Center: A review of how an agency tasked with fighting and preventing disease has spent hundreds of millions of tax dollars for failed prevention efforts, international junkets, and lavish facilities, but cannot demonstrate it is controlling disease.\" CDC spokesman: \"We strive day in and day out to fulfill our commitment to the American taxpayer.\" The report, CDC Off-Center is found at: found at: http://coburn.senate.gov/ffm/index.cfm?FuseAction=OversightAction.Home&ContentRecord_id=bf7e1789-802a-23ad-42e1-57d542e77901 Dr. Coburn indicated that this is the First in a Series of Oversight Reports on Federal Agencies. Contact: Vera Hassner Sharav 212-595-8974 http://coburn.senate.gov/ffm/index.cfm?FuseAction=OversightAction.Home&ContentRecord_id=bf7e1789-802a-23ad-42e1-57d542e77901 June 12, 2007 The First in a Series of Oversight Reports on Federal Agencies \"CDC Off Center,\" a 115-page oversight report authored by the Minority Office of the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee, under the direction of ranking member Senator Tom Coburn, examines how CDC has tilted off center and makes recommendations about how it might get back on track. The American people expect CDC to spend its $10 billion budget this year treating and preventing diseases and dealing with public safety threats, including the threat of bioterrorism. While CDC will meet some of those expectations, if history is any guide, it will also waste millions of dollars. As part of his commitment to oversight of how Washington spends taxpayer dollars, Senator Coburn plans to release a series of oversight reports on federal agencies. Senator Coburn's hope is that more and better oversight will assist federal agencies and those in Congress with responsibility for overseeing agency budgets, with reigning in wasteful spending; demanding measurable results from programs and grantees; and with reevaluating current spending before asking politicians and taxpayers to send more scarce tax dollars. \"CDC Off Center\" is not an effort to discredit the good work that the CDC and those who work for it have carried out and the good work that will continue in the future. The report will hopefully be seen for what it is: an effort to shine some light on prevention efforts and funding decisions that may be holding the agency back from fulfilling its central mission of fighting and controlling disease. Some examples in the report of CDC's spending: $1.7 million - including terrorism funds - on a Hollywood liaison program, which happens to be run by a former employee (pg. 87); $45 million for conferences, including those featuring prostitutes, protests, and beach parties (pgs. 48 - 60); $30,000 employee saunas in a new $200,000 fitness center that also includes mood-enhancing light shows and $3,500 worth of zero-gravity chairs (pg. 15); $5 billion spent over seven years on HIV/AIDS prevention funding, and yet the U.S. still sees 40,000 new cases each year, with no decrease in infection rates for over a decade (pgs. 23-37); Syphilis prevention funds used to feature a porn star's presentation (pg. 44); HIV/AIDS prevention funds spent on a transgender beauty pageant (pg. 45); $250,000 spent so two former employees could help build staff morale, (pgs. 100 - 101); $5.1 million on \"audio visual integration\" in the new Thomas R. Harkin communications and visitor center, including a giant 70-foot-wide by 25-foot-tall video wall of plasma screen TVs showcasing agency vignettes (pg. 8); 110 CDC employees traveled to two international AIDS conferences, when buying retroviral drugs with the trip funds could have prevented mother-to-child AIDS transmission for more than 115,000 infants (pgs. 50 & 52); New Hawaii office opening soon, announcement made by Senator from Hawaii who oversees agency's funding (pg. 18); $335 million on ads to fight childhood obesity. kids saw the ads, whether or not the ads affected their behavior is another question (pgs. 69 - 71); $128,000 in CDC bioterrorism funds spent by L.A. County on trinkets such as letter openers, whistles, magnets, mouse pads, flashlights, pens, and travel toothbrushes (pgs. 106 - 110). The report also includes: *A detailed graph showing CDC's yearly budget from 1995-2007, which has increased by more than 350% (pg. 7); and  *A chart showing yearly CDC's HIV/AIDS funding from 2001-2007, which has more than doubled during that time (pg. 115). *Do you know of examples of government waste, fraud or abuse?

Up To $16 Million In Drug Company Stock Investments Conflict 42 U.S. Senators Out of Vaccine Vote

Up To $16 Million In Drug Company Stock Investments Conflict 42 U.S. Senators Out of Vaccine Vote, Says FTCR SANTA MONICA , Calif., Dec. 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Forty-two U.S. Senators hold stock in pharmaceutical companies even as they vote on legislation to benefit the drug industry, according to an analysis released today by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights (FTCR). The Senate is expected to vote this week on an eleventh-hour amendment to immunize vaccine makers for dangerous drugs. Senators should not participate in votes from which they will financially benefit, said FTCR. FTCR's analysis of Senate personal financial disclosures reveals that 42 senators -- 27 Republicans and 15 Democrats -- held pharmaceutical stock worth between $8.1 and $16 million in 2004. Senators earned an additional $2.5 to $7.2 million in capital gains and dividends, and two senators' spouses also earned salaries from pharmaceuticals. View the analysis at:  http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/SenPharma.pdf . \"Senators can't ethically support a giveaway deal for the pharmaceutical industry when their own financial interests match those of the drug companies,\" said Carmen Balber, consumer advocate with FTCR. \"A financial interest in the outcome of legislation should conflict any politician out of the vote.\" The GOP-backed amendment would grant immunity to drug companies for any vaccine or product, classified by the Bush Administration as necessary to respond to a public health threat, when patients are harmed by dangerous drugs. The amendment is so broad that any product considered a \"countermeasure,\" not just vaccines, could be protected. Senate Majority Leader Frist aims to make the provision an amendment to a conference report that cannot be altered. Frist's blind trust included stock in drug companies Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson through 2004, each worth $15,000 to $50,000 when the trust was created. In July, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (news, bio, voting record) (R-Wis.) recused himself from a vote on medical malpractice legislation that would have benefited the pharmaceutical industry because his millions in drug company stock create the appearance of a conflict of interest. \"It's time the U.S. Senate met the Sensenbrenner standard,\" said Balber. The pharmaceutical industry was the largest industry donor to Frist's National Republican Senatorial Committee, and the industry has given 64 percent to 74 percent of its federal contributions to Republicans every year for the last decade according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Congressional leaders tried to provide liability protection for the makers of the vaccine additive Thimerosal in 2002 with an amendment to Homeland Security legislation based on legislation Frist carried. Frist denied involvement, but public backlash forced the Senate to remove the immunity provision. FTCR filed an ethics complaint with the Senate Select Ethics Committee last April charging Frist with a conflict of interest for promoting medical malpractice liability limits while retaining stock worth millions in the hospital corporation, HCA. HCA owns the nation's fourth largest malpractice insurer. Read the complaint at:  http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/malpractice/pr/?postId=1882 . FTCR called for an SEC investigation this summer when Sen. Frist ordered the well-timed sale of his HCA stock. The Justice Department and SEC are investigating the Senator's stock sale for insider trading. Read the SEC letter at:  http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/Frist_SEC.pdf .

 Warning:  Chemicals in the packaging, surfaces or contents of many products may cause long-term health effects, including cancers of the breast, brain and testicles; lowered sperm counts, early puberty and other reproductive system defects; diabetes; attention deficit disorder, asthma and autism.  A decade ago, the government promised to test these chemicals. It still hasn't.   Chemical Fallout: A Journal Sentinel Watchdog Report Autism is certainly not the only possible negative consequence of the untested chemicals which surround us and lurk inside each of us.   Anyone interested in getting up to speed quickly on these common dangerous products and how protective agencies such as the FDA and the EPA failed their responsibilities and   subordinated their roles to the companies that manufactured and profited from these harmful materials should consult the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel On Line Series,  Chemical Fallout , which has been published over the past year and a half.  In a recent entry published May 16, 2009 the JSOnline  reports direct evidence of the degree to which the FDA worked hand in hand with the chemical industry lobbyists and failed to protect the public: \"As federal regulators hold fast to their claim that a chemical in baby bottles is safe, e-mails obtained by the Journal Sentinel show that they relied on chemical industry lobbyists to examine bisphenol A's risks, track legislation to ban it and even monitor press coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In one instance, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's deputy director sought information from the BPA industry's chief lobbyist to discredit a Japanese study that found it caused miscarriages in workers who were exposed to it. This was before government scientists even had a chance to review the study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \"I'd like to get information together that our chemists could look at to determine if there are problems with that data in advance of possibly reviewing the study,\" Mitchell Cheeseman, deputy director of the FDA's center for food safety and applied nutrition, said in an e-mail seeking advice from Steven Hentges, executive director of the trade association's BPA group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The FDA relied on two studies - both paid for by chemical makers - to form the framework of its draft review declaring BPA to be safe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The Journal Sentinel reported last year that the trade group wrote entire sections of that draft. But the revelations contained in these e-mails show a pattern of preferential treatment over the past nine years that was not afforded to independent scientists.\" If anyone thinks there is no such thing as conspiracies they should read the JSOnline series and think again. Dangerous chemicals inhabit our bodies and the bodies of our children.  And regulatory agencies  in the US have worked with the chemical industry lobbyists to prevent the public from knowing of these dangers.

 FDA Hid Names of Melamine Contaminated Infant Formula Products from the Public 
 
by  Mike Adams 
November 27, 2008 
 
When the FDA discovered melamine in U.S. infant formula products, it made a conscious decision to withhold that information from the public. Instead, it called a teleconference with the infant formula manufacturers to warn them about its findings! 
 
The truth about the melamine only became public after the Associated Press filed a Freedom of Information Act request, demanding the test results from the FDA. Absent that request, this whole issue would have continued to remain an FDA secret. 
 
In the aftermath of that decision, the FDA is now under intense fire for once again betraying the public trust and acting to protect the interests of corporations rather than the people. Congress, public health groups and consumer advocate (like me) are blasting the FDA for utterly disregarding public safety and catering (once again) to the financial interests of the companies it regulates...

Congressmen and 9/11 Responders Pissed at Bush/Gerberding for Firing John Howard
" "
 Congress Members, Responders Decry NIOSH Director’s Firing 
 
... and if our Julie responds like usual, she will just ignore them. 
 
 \"Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), accompanied by World Trade Center responders gathered Tuesday at Ground Zero to demand that the Bush administration reverse its decision to fire Dr. John Howard, Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. As NIOSH director, Howard administered federally funded health care programs for 9/11 first responders exposed to Ground Zero toxins. 
 
Also yesterday, Maloney, Nadler, and Reps. Eliot Engel and Edolphus Towns sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Julie Gerberding demanding a meeting this week to discuss Howard’s firing. In a related effort, New York Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer also on Tuesday sent a letter to Leavitt urging him to reconsider the termination of Howard and calling for a detailed account of the reasons he was removed from his position. 
 
“Only the Bush Administration would fire a respected public servant who has received near-universal praise for doing a good job,” Maloney said. “Dr. Howard is out of a job because he wanted to help the heroes of 9/11 and his superiors didn’t. We demand that the administration take back this outrageous slap at sick 9/11 responders and reappoint Dr. Howard to a well-deserved second term.”...\" 
 
Gerberding should have been fired years ago.  I have lost track of all the things people have wanted her fired for. 
 
Why does she still have a job? 
 
Oh... because she does whatever the administration tells her to, even if it is completely unethical, constitutes lying to the American Public and endangers the health of those it is her job to protect. 
 
 Cheney's staff censored EPA, ex-official alleges 
 
Has anyone noticed that there is a thread running through all her malfeasance? 
 
All of it is in defense of  toxins  in one form or another.

Council of Europe Committee Report Denounces Unjustified Swine Flu Scare, Waste of Public Money
" "
 
Attached is the press release from the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) outlining the conclusions of the provisional PACE report,  The handling of the H1N1 pandemic: more transparency needed . The Press Release  denounces the unjustified Swine Flu scare and waste of public money. Fiona Godlee, Editor-in-Chief of the British Medical Journal,  told the Council that, according to an investigation by her journal, scientists who drew up key WHO guidelines on stockpiling flu vaccines had previously been paid by drug companies which stood to profit. 
 Meanwhile, here in New Brunswick, Canada, on the same day the Council of Europe report was released questioning the handling of the H1N1 flu our Department of Health announced plans to expand  our seasonal flu vaccination program to cover all children under 18 \" after the success of last fall's H1N1 campaign . \"  The Department of Health Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Van Buynter measured success solely by the large numbers of New Brunswickers who received the H1N1 shot.  There is no mention of the many credible voices, in Canada and in Europe who have questioned whether the scare campaign launched in Europe and elsewhere including here in New Brunswick was justified.  
 Press release - 455(2010) PACE Health Committee denounces ‘unjustified scare’ of Swine Flu, waste of public money 
 Strasbourg, 04.06.2010 – The handling of the H1N1 pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), EU agencies and national governments led to a “ waste of large sums of public money, and unjustified scares and fears about the health risks faced by the European public ”, according to a report by the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) made public today in Paris. 
 The report, prepared by Paul Flynn (United Kingdom, SOC) and approved today by the committee ahead of a plenary debate at the end of this month, says  there was “overwhelming evidence that the seriousness of the pandemic was vastly overrated by WHO”, resulting in a distortion of public health priorities. 
 Presenting his report, Mr Flynn told the committee: “ this was a pandemic that never really was ”, and described the vaccination programme as “ placebo medicine on a large scale ” (see video below). 
 In its adopted text, the committee identifies what it calls “ grave shortcomings” in the transparency of decision-making about the outbreak, generating concerns about the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on decisions taken . Plummeting confidence in such advice could prove “disastrous” in the case of a severe future pandemic, it warns. 
 In particular, the WHO and European health institutions were not willing to publish the names and declarations of interest of the members of the WHO Emergency Committee and relevant European advisory bodies directly involved in recommendations concerning the pandemic, the parliamentarians point out. 
 However, attending the meeting was Fiona Godlee, the  Editor-in-Chief of the British Medical Journal, who told the parliamentarians that, according to an investigation by her journal, scientists who drew up key WHO guidelines on stockpiling flu vaccines had previously been paid by drug companies which stood to profit. 
 The WHO has been “highly defensive”, the committee said, and unwilling to accept that a change in the definition of a pandemic was made, or to revise its prognosis of the Swine Flu outbreak. 
 The committee sets out a series of urgent recommendations for greater transparency and better governance in public health, as well as safeguards against what it calls “undue influence by vested interests”. It also calls for a public fund to support independent research, trials and expert advice, possibly financed by an obligatory contribution of the pharmaceutical industry, as well as closer collaboration with the media to avoid “sensationalism and scaremongering in the public health domain”. 
 The report is due to be debated by parliamentarians from all 47 Council of Europe member states on Thursday 24 June during PACE’s summer session in Strasbourg.

FDA to Examine New Ways to Study ADD Drugs Jan 4, 7:35 PM (ET) By ANDREW BRIDGES WASHINGTON (AP) - Reports of sudden deaths, strokes, heart attacks and hypertension in both children and adults taking drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are spurring new government study into the medications' safety. Sales of drugs to treat ADHD have increased sharply in recent years, with use growing at a faster rate among adults than children, according to a recent study by Medco Health Solutions, a prescription benefit manager. Spending on ADHD drugs soared from $759 million in 2000 to $3.1 billion in 2004, according to IMS Health, a pharmaceutical information and consulting firm. The Food and Drug Administration said it had received reports of what it called \"serious adverse events\" - including deaths - in association with the therapeutic use of the drugs. The agency considers the reports \"rare though serious,\" FDA spokeswoman Susan Bro said Wednesday. The FDA's Canadian counterpart, Health Canada, yanked the ADHD drug Adderall XR from the market for six months last year in response to reports of 20 sudden deaths and 12 strokes in adults and children using the drug. A number of the cases involved children with structural heart defects. The panel eventually concluded there was inadequate evidence of increased harm from Adderall XR compared with other available therapies - a conclusion the FDA also reached based on data on hand. Now the U.S. regulatory agency is asking its Drug Safety and Risk Management advisory committee to examine ways of studying further the potential cardiovascular risks of the drugs. The few studies that have looked at longer-term use of ADHD drugs provide little information on those risks, the FDA said. \"It almost sounds like cox-2 inhibitor redux,\" said committee chairman Dr. Peter Gross, referring to cox-2 painkillers like Vioxx and Bextra pulled from the market because of evidence they can raise the risk of a heart attack or stroke. The committee is to meet Feb. 9 and 10 in Gaithersburg, Md. \"The issue of drug treatment of attention deficit disorder in children has been a controversial one without this issue of cardiovascular risk too. It adds another concern to what will certainly be an interesting conversation,\" said Arthur Levin, the FDA committee's consumer representative. A posting to the FDA Web site did not identify any of the drugs by name. However, the most commonly used ADHD drugs include Adderall XR, made by Shire Pharmaceuticals, and Ritalin, made by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. Various other companies make generic versions of Ritalin as well. Shire spokesman Matthew Cabrey said the company hadn't been told of the meeting but added it may send representatives. Novartis did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The committee's Feb. 10 meeting will include updates on FDA actions on cox-2 drugs as well as a recently begun patient, doctor and pharmacist registry program for the anti-acne drug Accutane and its generic competitors. Separately, the committee also will discuss the FDA's Drug Safety Oversight Board, an internal, government employee-only panel created nearly a year ago. The board is supposed to monitor FDA-approved medicines once they're on the market and update physicians and patients with emerging information on risks and benefits. Gross said he had concerns about the board's impartiality and independence, as well as its relationship to his committee and the very similar work it does.

Black Box Warning for ADHD Drugs
" "
Strongest warning suggested for ADHD drugs 2 million children are prescribed the drugs every month WASHINGTON  (AP) -- Ritalin and other stimulant drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder should carry the strongest warning that they may be linked to an increased risk of death and injury, federal health advisers said Thursday. The Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted in favor of the \"black box\" warning after hearing about the   deaths  of 25 people, including 19 children , who had taken the drugs. The vote was 8-7, with one abstention. One committee member, Dr. Curt Furberg, a professor of public health sciences at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, said it would be \"inappropriate, unethical behavior\" not to disclose that there was uncertainty about the safety of the drugs. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees but typically does. \"The committee plainly wanted to tell us certain things ought to be in labeling in a more forceful way,\" Dr. Robert Temple, director of the FDA's Office of Medical Policy, told reporters after the meeting. Doctors prescribe the drugs to about 2 million children and 1 million adults a month. Drugs that would have to carry the warning labels are methylphenidates, which are sold as Ritalin, Concerta, Methylin and Metadate. The labels for Adderall and Adderall XR, both amphetamines, have included the warnings since 2004. The Drug Safety and Risk Management advisory committee also recommended that the drugs include a medication guide for patients and parents. The vote was 15-0, with one abstention. Adderall is made by Shire Pharmaceuticals; Ritalin by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.; Concerta by Johnson & Johnson; Methylin by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals; and Metadate by UCB. Various other companies make generic versions of Ritalin. Novartis said Ritalin, approved by the FDA in 1955, is safe and effective. A company review of more than 50 years of records shows no apparent increase in cardiovascular problems associated with the drug's use, according to Novartis' medical safety director, Dr. Todd Gruber. He told the committee that the drug's label advises caution in patients with certain pre-existing heart conditions. The FDA had asked the advisers to consider ways of studying the drugs because agency data suggested the drugs were linked to an increased risk of sudden death and serious cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks. The committee, however, quickly began debating whether it should consider new warnings for the drugs rather than the need for more studies. Dr. Steve Nissen, medical director of the Cardiovascular Coordinating Center at The Cleveland Clinic, told fellow committee members they should recommend the black box warning. Nissen said his suggestion was meant partly to slow what he characterized as the \"out of control growth\" use of the drugs. The drugs already carry warnings related to the possible risk they could pose to patients with heart defects. \"We feel this warning is appropriate given our current knowledge of these drugs,\" said Dr. Gerald DalPan, a division director in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The FDA review that found 25 reports of deaths among the drugs' users between 1999 and 2003 also uncovered 54 cases of serious cardiovascular problems, including heart attack, stroke, hypertension, palpitations and arrhythmia. Some of these ADHD drug-treated patients had pre-existing heart conditions or hypertension. \"There's smoke. Does that mean there's fire?\" asked Dr. David Graham, a medical officer at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"We wouldn't be going through this exercise if we didn't think there was a real possibility of increased risk,\" Graham told reporters. The FDA's review found fewer than one reported death or life-threatening injury for every 1 million prescriptions filled for the drugs. \"The decision has been apparently made, and if it's been made, I agree with it, that the reports are not enough to warrant regulatory action,\" committee member Sean Hennessy said. Hennessy, an assistant professor of epidemiology and pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, ended up voting against recommending additional warnings. The FDA said the few studies that have looked at longer-term use of ADHD drugs provide little information on those risks. Also, the agency's analysis of the reports of death and injury only suggests a possible link between the drugs and cardiovascular problems, said Dr. Kate Gelperin, a medical officer in the agency's Office of Drug Safety. She said the link is not conclusive, nor is it clear whether there is an increased incidence of death or serious injury among people treated with the drugs. That \"is really a question we'd like to have answered,\" she said. Sales of ADHD drugs rose to $3.1 billion in 2004 from $759 million in 2000, according to IMS Health, a pharmaceutical information and consulting firm. About 2.5 million children between age 4 and 17 take ADHD drugs, according to federal survey data cited by Dr. Andrew Mosholder, a medical officer in the Office of Drug Safety. The survey found 9.3 percent of 12-year-old boys and 3.7 percent of 11-year-old girls take the drugs, Mosholder said. Adult use of the drugs alone grew 90 percent between March 2002 and June 2005, he said.

Cylert, ADHD Drug Withdrawn by FDA
" "
 FDA Withdraws Approval for ADD Drug Mon Oct 24, 8:37 PM ET WASHINGTON - The FDA has withdrawn approval for a drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder because it has been associated with liver problems, including death, agency officials said Monday. The move means drug manufacturers will no longer produce generic versions of pemoline, which was developed by Abbott Laboratories and sold under the name Cylert. Abbott discontinued the drug earlier this year, but generic versions have remained available. FDA is not recalling the drug, instead allowing pharmacies to sell their remaining stock as doctors still using it switch patients to alternative treatments, the agency said in a statement. The lack of a recall drew fire from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. \"It is reckless and insensitive to the health and lives of children and adults using this drug for the FDA and the involved drug companies to fail to institute an immediate recall of these dangerous products,\" said Drs. Sidney Wolfe and Peter Lurie, who lead the organization's Health Research Group, in a letter to the FDA. In a statement, the FDA said it has 13 reports of liver failure resulting in transplant or death among people who took the drug, which has been available for 30 years. There are additional reports of less serious problems. Although that is a small number, it is well above what the normal rate of such problems among the general population, the FDA said. \"FDA has concluded that the risk of liver failure with this drug outweighs the potential benefits,\" the agency statement says, noting that alternative treatments for ADD have come on the market since pemoline was introduced. The drug acts as a stimulant to the central nervous system.

Taken from About.com's Autism Site: 
 
 As Autism Awareness Month draws to a close, my thoughts are fast turning to NEXT month - and Mother's Day.  
 
 \"This year, I'm inviting autism moms to submit a guest blog to be published on this site during the month of May.  Here are the details:
Autism moms (or the people who love them) are invited to submit a guest blog of up to 1,000 words.  These should be personal reflections on motherhood and autism rather than essays on the state of the autism community, public policy, etc.
Photos and short author bios are welcome but optional.  Be sure you have the rights to any images and can provide a credit and caption.
If you are already a blogger, please send me an original piece that is NOT presently on your blog, along with a link to your blog so I can include it in the post.\"

We could use your help!

We can use your help; let folks know about Autism Blogs Directory! 
 
I've changed it to show the top 25 blogs in each category; hopefully that will speed the loadtime. 
 
Please scroll down. Hodge Podge of Autism-Related Blogs are in the middle column below this post, as are some of the other categories. 
 
If you know of a good autism-related blog, please comment with its url! Let's see how big a directory we can create! If you don't mind, please link to this directory, too! 
 
If I miscategorize your blog, let me know where you want it! :-) 
 
 
 
Update for the blog gems:  Our   first post isn't much,   just a request for help categorizing bloggers. Most of our blogs here are just snippets. But sometimes, we go on for a bit. This is the first one where we really discuss on the directory   our purpose .

Ok, day two and no thoughtful post, but I think that I wouldn't be very thoughtful in general if I didn't pass on this link to a great story.

This blog has been nominated in the ‘Health’ category –  Please vote for us  if you have enjoyed or found anything useful on LB/RB over the past year. Annoyingly, it seems you have to register to vote, but please make the effort as it will help us reach new people. Kathleen’s now (in?)famous  blog  has been nominated in two sections. ‘ The Blogitzer  – which is the blogging equivalent of the Pulitzer and  Best Blog of all time , both categories it fully deserves to win in. So – please support both of us in our efforts. Thanks!

If you know exactly what I mean then this is for you Left Brain/Right Brain  now has a Twitter account  which some of the authors that blog on LB/RB have access to and which will be used to post updates to the site, notify people of new LB/RB blog posts, notify people of interesting sites/stories we’ve found and want to share with you. For those who aren’t familiar with Twitter, its what is known as micro-blogging. A user has 140 characters in which to make a post. I have  my own personal Twitter account  but I wanted to make a dedicated LB/RB account for the purposes described above. You can track Twitter accounts by becoming a ‘follower’ (you can see the people I ‘follow’ at the bottom right column of my Twitter home page) and subscribing to the  dedicated RSS feed  or by checking the  Home page  every so often – or by using a desktop solution such as  Twhirl , or via a Firefox extension like  TwitKit . Obviously, you need to  join Twitter  in order to either follow others tweets (a message posted to Twitter is called a tweet) or post tweets yourself. So, join up, or start following  LB/RB !

"22553" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/10/31/tomorrow-autistics-speaking-day/" "Tomorrow: Autistics Speaking Day" "In a great response to a bad event last year,  Corina Becker sparked  “Autistics Speaking Day”.   From her post: “On November 1, there is an Autism awareness campaign called Communitcation Shutdown, whereas people are encouraged to stay off Twitter and Facebook for the day in order to promote an awareness of the communication difficulties that Autistics face. ”   Read the full post, and the many that followed it, for a discussion of why “Communication Shutdown” was such a bad idea.  I’m glad that a year later “communication shutdown” is gone, but autistics speaking day is not. From the website : To raising Autism awareness and Acceptance, and battling negative stereotypes about Autism. To advocate for the inclusion of Autistic people in the community. To offer a forum to broadcast their voices, and to help the messages of Autistic people and non-Austistic allies reach the ears of as many people as possible. From the FAQ : Q.  What do we do on ASDay? 
A.  The plan is that on November 1st social networking sites like Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, as well as YouTube and  blogging sites will see a huge increase in the posts of autistic people.  We will post links to as many of these as we can to share the works of the autistic people.  Our hope is that this will help promote autism awareness and autism acceptance.  If you are a blogger or own a website, you can write a post on or around November 1st for Autistics Speaking Day and we will share the posts through this blog, Twitter, and Facebook.  Everyone is free to participate in ASDay however they want.  Some will just read through the posts, some will help to distribute the posts, and some will actively write them.

\"This is Autism\" Flashblog 
 
 
 
 
 
Last Monday, Autism Speaks told the world that autism is:  . . . living in despair  . . . fear of the future  . . .exhausted, broken parents . . . lost, helpless, burdensome children . . .  a national emergency If that's not what autism is to you, join us on  Monday November 18th  for the  \"This is Autism\" flashblog . 
 
 
What is it? 
 A flashblog is a day when a group of people share their thoughts about a single topic. You can post something on your own blog and let us know about it or you can submit your contribution here and we'll post it for you. Then we'll share everyone's posts throughout the day on Monday, here and across the web using Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr to get the word out. 
What Should I Submit? 
 
 Tell us what \"This is Autism\" means to you. You can write a paragraph or a blog post, contribute a poem or a video, make a comic or a graphic. Use your imagination. Let's tell the world what autism is in the words and works of autistic people and those who love and support them.  
 
 
 
Who Can Participate? 
 
 Everyone! The flashblog is open to autistic individuals as well as parents, family members and allies of autistic people.  
 
 
 
Great! I'm in! How Do I Submit? 
 
 
Submit your contribution by  addding it to the Google Document  or emailing it to thisisautismblog@gmail.com. 
 
 
 
What you should include in your submission: 
 
 
 A link to your contribution or the full text of your post. If you send a link, let us know if we should: link to it, reprint it with a link, or link it with a short quote. We will embed videos, comics and other graphics unless you tell us not to.

				 It is so nice to see so many new readers having a look at my blog. I want to thank Autism Speaks for linking to my last essay. You can also check out my facebook page (idoinautismland) and give it a “like”, and I am also on twitter. I don’t have much to say today other than welcome to my blog, and I will post soon when I have more time.

Some times we do is she petting you?” “Is she petting you?” is a script. It makes my girl laugh. When she is petting Winston, she asks us to ask him if she is petting him. I trust you to follow that. It’s just, you know, what we do. And when we do it, my girl FEELS LOVE.

							dear oprah					" "** They give you two thousand characters. Not words,  characters . That includes spaces and line breaks, ellipses and apostrophes. It includes quotation marks and dashes, periods and exclamation marks. The whole kit and caboodle. And let me tell you, two thousand characters ain’t much. It takes me two thousand characters to say, “Hi, my name is Jess.” But I did what I could with the space that I had. Dear Oprah, 
 Since space is so limited, I have to make this short. I want to be on your show –  though God knows what I would wear.  I’ve written a letter to President Obama imploring him to light the White House blue in support of World Autism Awareness Day on April 2nd. In it I said: 
 “My daughter has autism, Mr. President. And you’re right; I love her fiercely. I love her with a ferocity and a tenderness that can only co-exist within a mother’s heart. I love her so much that there is nothing on God’s green Earth that I wouldn’t do to help mitigate her challenges. There is nothing that I wouldn’t do to make the world less foreign to her, less hostile. There is nothing that I wouldn’t do to ensure that every day when she steps outside our door, she is met with tolerance and understanding and compassion. That she is seen by the world as a full and complete human being and not as a set of challenges encompassed by a single word. There is nothing that I wouldn’t do to ensure that her talents and unique gifts are recognized, fostered and celebrated throughout her lifetime ..” 
 (I have to ask you to click the following link to continue reading the letter. PLEASE do. It says so much more than I can fit into 2000 characters ..  http://lightthewhitehouseblue.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/this-is-my-autism/#comments . While you’re there, PLEASE read the HUNDREDS of comments from every corner of the autism community. 
 We are a group that can be bitterly divided at times, but here we come together – truly united behind a single purpose – creating awareness. While awareness is not the end-goal, it is the only means by which we will achieve it. 
 Would you help us convince the President to light the White House blue?  Will YOU consider lighting your stage blue on April 2nd? 
 Thank you for all that you do to make our world a better place. I’d be so grateful for anything you can do for us and more importantly, for our children. 
 Warmly, Jess

							stay for a long					" "* This is not an easy road, but its rewards are tremendous. It’s joys are the very sweetest of life’s nectar. You will drink them in and taste and smell and feel every last drop of them. You will be OK. ~ From Welcome to the Club, Diary – May 2009 (click  HERE  to read the post in its entirety)  * Last night, I wrote the following on Diary’s Facebook status: 
 Diary of a Mom 
 after a night full of heartbreaking regression, an AMAZING moment at bedtime — when i told brooke it was time for me to say goodnight, she put her arm around my neck and said softly, ‘not yet, mom. i need to you to stay for a long.’ so stay for a long i did. #love #connection #HOPE I am copying it here because I need it to be a part of my diary. I need to etch it here in stone so that I can refer back to it when the storm clouds gather – as they inevitably do. I need to be able to remind myself that miracles exist. I need to make sure that I never, ever forget how I felt lying next to my girl in the dark, staying put because she told me that she needed me and asked me to stay. These are the moments that sustain us – the simple, perfect morsels that remind us that all is possible. The sweetest of life’s nectar indeed. * Thank you all for sharing in these moments and for really, truly understanding their import. It means the world to me.  Are you on Twitter?

							dear you – part two					" "As you may recall,  yesterday’s post  started like this .. Dear Friends With Special Needs Kids, 
 I have something to tell you. And I’m thinking that you don’t hear it enough. So come closer and pay attention, OK? This is important. 
 YOU ROCK. I went on to tell you a few of the specific ways in which you rock. And even though it felt incomplete, I hit publish. Then, as always, I kissed my girls one last time, left my heart behind, and got in my car and drove to work. And as I did, my brain ran a mile a minute. There were so many topics left untouched. So many things I needed to add. It simply wasn’t enough to leave it as it was. So I’m at it again. Because I think this is important. Because we forget. Because we don’t hear it nearly enough. So here goes. ~ Dear friends with special needs kids, Here are some more reasons why you rock … You rock because you know the difference between ignorance and malice. You rock because you doubt yourself and because you know that that’s okay. You rock because you never doubt your child. And because you won’t let anyone else doubt him either. You rock because you know that it’s okay to be human. You rock because you accept help when it’s offered. And offer it when you can. You rock because you know that no one – no one – could possibly do this alone. You rock because you know how much richer your life is for all of the people who are now in it and all of those who will be in it in the future. You rock because you teach your children that no one one’s self-esteem should ever come at the expense of someone else’s. You rock because you tell your truth – and because you want nothing more than for your child to be able to tell his. And because you know the difference. You rock because you know what matters – and what doesn’t. You rock because you know that diagnoses mean insight, information, and community NOT excuses, limitations or anything that we don’t give them the power to mean. You rock because you apply what you’ve learned as a special needs parent to absolutely everything you do. You rock because you know that ego has no place in a conversation about what is best for a child. You rock because you learn as much from your children every day as you teach them. You rock because you refuse to stay home and hide. And because sometimes you know there’s no choice. You rock because you haven’t eaten a hot meal in years. You rock because you long ago convinced yourself that you really don’t like your food too hot. You rock because you know that bullies are cowards. You rock because you’d fight the demons bare-fisted if you could. You rock because you make no assumptions. You rock because you know that it is in our weakest moments that we find our greatest strength. You rock because in the deepest depths of the mud and muck, you find humor. You rock because at the end of the day, you’re still you. You rock because you cast your own insecurities aside – or work through them step by step by infuriatingly tiny step – to do what you need to do for your child. You rock because you never become too much of a therapist to remember that you are a mother (or a father) first. You rock because you play to your child strengths to help guide him through his challenges. You rock because you know when to listen to the experts – and when to follow your gut. You rock because you know that pain is never a competitive sport. You rock because you know that EVERYONE has a story. And because you treasure the gift of discovering it. You rock because you blaze a path for those to come. You rock because you have learned that politics are personal. You rock because you’ve learned that everything is personal. You rock because you know that courage is not the absence of fear. You rock because you know that nothing happens in a vacuum. You rock because when you know it’s not working, you try something different. You rock because you make what feels like Sophie’s choice. Dozens of times a day. You rock because you know the difference between cruelty and curiosity. You rock because you ask questions. You rock because you can Google circles around thirteen year-old girls. You rock because you know that sometimes the best way to be heard is to listen. And because you know that sometimes – just sometimes – you need to shout. You rock because you bring cookies to IEP meetings – even the ones to which you’d really rather bring something with a trigger. You rock because you know there is no more courageous act than asking for help. You rock because you read that one last book at bedtime. Three times. And because you know that it’s okay if sometimes, you Just. Simply. Can’t. You rock because you know that you matter. And because even when you forget, you listen when someone (ahem) reminds you. You rock because you know that you are born into the company of blood relations, but that you can choose your family. You rock because you still seek balance, no matter how absurdly unattainable it might seem at any given moment. You rock because as much as you may want to drop-kick the next person who tells you that God doesn’t give you any more than you can handle, you don’t. You rock because you know that, ‘What we typically do ..’ and, ‘Well, common practice is …’ are really stupid ways to start a sentence. You rock because you know that Individualized Education Plans are meant to be just that – individualized. You rock because you know that your path is just that – yours. And because you might silently judge a fellow mom for wearing really ugly shoes (c’mon people, we’re not saints) but you’d never judge the road upon which she chooses to set them. You rock because you come here not just to read my drivel but to be a part of this community. To laugh, to cry, to cheer to commiserate – to find ways to make things better not just for your child but for all of our children. You rock because you know, they are all OUR children. So I’ll say it again. ~ Dear Friends With Special Needs Kids, I have something to tell you. And I’m thinking that you don’t hear it enough. So come closer and pay attention, OK? This is important. YOU ROCK.

							proud mama					" "  {image is a photo of Katie ice skating just before her guests arrived yesterday} There are so many posts that I can’t write. So many stories that just aren’t mine to tell. Especially Katie’s, as they become more and more intertwined with her friends’ lives, with their stories. But I want to shout from the rooftops. To tell you how proud I am of who this incredible young woman is – and who she continues to become. To show you just how much impact she has on the world around her – on everyone whom she so graciously welcomes into her open circle of warmth and generous care. To tell you that she  sees  them. And says so. That she is so much braver than I ever was. Because she is not afraid to feel. To share. To love. To connect. The stories will have to stay in our memories where they belong. But my pride in this kid? Well, that I simply can’t keep to myself.

							of leaky eyes and privacy					" "– Ed note: Before I write anything this morning, I have to acknowledge your incredible comments on yesterday’s post. As I wrote on Diary’s Facebook page,  I don’t have the words to thank you all for your support today. (And I always have words.) But I’ve got nothing big enough, broad enough, deep enough to tell you how blessed I feel by this community, by each and every one of you, who come here to laugh with me, learn with me, celebrate with me, cry with me, fight, scrap, claw and pray with me day in and day out. Your words lifted me today. Your presence here lifts me every day. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. And now, we return to our regular programming.  – It is well known that I am a crier. In fact, I come from a long line of criers. My Grandma says we come by it honestly. She calls it Leaky Eye Syndrome and says that it’s clearly genetic. I knew that I’d passed it onto Katie when, at age two, I took her to see Finding Nemo and she cried through the entire movie while wailing, “He can’t find his Daddy!” The fact that she shares the affliction doesn’t stop her, however, from teasing her mama. And why should it? (She comes by that honestly too.) Anyway, case in point: this video that she made on Christmas Eve, 2011. Yeah, really. It’s that bad. On Sunday morning, I asked Katie if I could share a story on Diary. It wasn’t really about her, but it involved her, and, as you all know by now, I don’t share anything about the girls without their permission. She said no, as she typically does lately and, well, that was that. Later in the day, I said, “Katie, I want to talk to you about something. It’s just .. well, I need to make sure that someday, when you read Diary, you’ll know that the only reason why you’re dramatically underrepresented for a pretty significant period of time is because you didn’t want me to write about you. I just don’t ever want you to think that …” “Mama,” she said, cutting me off, “why are you saying this?” “It’s just, well, it’s so important to me to respect your privacy and your right to decide what you’re comfortable sharing and not sharing. But because of that, I really don’t talk about you very much on the blog anymore because you usually tell me that you’d rather I not share stuff. Which is totally and completely – seriously 100% – fine. I just worry that you’ll read it someday and say, “Where was I?” I never want you to think that I didn’t write about you because I didn’t want to. I’m just so proud of you and I want to tell the world every damn awesome thing that you do, but, well, my respect for you will always, always trump my desire to crow about you. I just love you so much. I just needed you to know all that.” “It’s not that I don’t want you to write about me,” she said. “I just get uncomfortable when you ASK me if it’s okay. It’s okay. Just please stop asking.” “Wait,” I said, “so it’s just me asking you the question that makes you uncomfortable, but it’s okay to write about you?” “Mama,” she said, “that’s what I just said. Can we please stop talking about this?” “Of course,” I said, “but I want to make sure that I completely understand. It might mean that THIS conversation is uncomfortable, but then we don’t have to have it again, cool?” “Yeah.” “So you’re alright with me sharing stories about you, as long as I don’t ask you first?” “Yeah.” “Well, okay then,” I said, once again reminded of the futility of trying to find logic in that which has nothing to do with logic, a lesson offered daily by this almost teen of mine. “I’m glad we talked about it, babe,” I said. “I just want you to be comfortable with all of it. That’s more important to me that anything else.” “Mama,” she said, “can we talk about something else now?” “Oh my gosh, Katie,” I asked, somewhat panicked, “why are you crying?” “I have no idea,” she said. “Why are YOU crying?” I hadn’t realized that I was. “I don’t know either,” I said. We both laughed. And there we were, laughing through tears, laughing at our tears, and finally, just laughing. “Mama?” she said. “Yes, kiddo?” “You can totally write about this.” “Ha,” I said. “Will do.” " 8.99703943639962e-05 0.000402815542877243 0.0110076422133495 0.000167415725402643 4.1773221672378e-05 0.000219975011969178 0.000208381935979848 0.000342626590395736 0.000146156470589546 0.000108562011054176 0.00015881122575962 7.14245256146492e-05 0.000189566933758776 0.000123161127997946 0.000138721440925861 0.0147579895268613 0.58258895177846 0.00041364345965695 0.150442316977131 0.000263901995233176 0.000116369229111694 0.000523212637457146 0.000282626926601442 0.000172638956328143 0.00023461199438606 0.000115628983419624 0.00153591398947362 0.000617016769239766 0.000177066536152356 0.000202133019443752 0.00016603539097988 0.000121240233571158 0.000524545248453993 0.00027054323736258 0.000706824996338756 0.000107541004090987 0.000196568115022873 0.0036772979047781 0.000150590714195442 0.000752654263570098 0.132447097563491 0.0285021862721199 0.000363044386387365 8.8876496891263e-05 9.27417250859073e-05 0.000243660897179385 0.000507922494843867 0.000159450549552217 0.000256684345652915 0.0648034670097654

							#unspokendoc					" "{image is a gorgeous photo of Emma Zurcher-Long, a beautiful 13 year-old girl, gleefully running through Central Park. The text reads, “Autism was not something parents wanted to hear. But I hope that will change when more people get to know someone like me.” Click on the photo to learn more about Emma’s project of love, #UnspokenDoc} Many of you know how I feel about  Emma  (and her mom  Ariane .) Emma is a beacon of light, leading us all toward a far greater, far deeper understanding of ourselves, of each other, of autism. Two years ago, Emma found her voice through typing and she’s been working to change the world with her words ever since. Now, she’s taking her mission  to film , not just starring in the telling of her own story, but co-directing it. Emma and her production team need our help getting this incredible movie to the screen. I know how easy it is to just keep reading, to make a thousand excuses why you can’t or won’t contribute, to rationalize why a million other things are more urgently in need of help than a movie. I would typically think the same. But this isn’t just a movie. It’s the heart of a movement — a movement toward understanding, compassion, support, and an unwavering belief that every human being is richly, unconditionally worthy of all three. Please help them get the movie to the screen. To schools, to homes, to hearts. Emma’s story can change the future for our kids, for all of us. Please give what you can and help spread the word. – Learn more  HERE . Contribute  HERE . Other ways to help spread the word: Follow them on  Facebook  and  Twitter  and ask your friends to join you. 
 Share the story among your friends, family, colleagues – any and all fans of social change and kids making a better world for each other. (And tag the following when you do: @unspokendoc, @emmashopebook, @genevapeschka, and @juliangeow.) 
 THANK YOU!

							i scream, you scream ..					" ". It’s unseasonably warm – a balmy sixty degrees in New England at the end of November. Brooke and I are crossing the street, headed for the ice cream shop. I watch the door to the shop open and close as we walk toward it. I fear we’re not the only ones with this idea. The shop is small and the acoustics are awful. It’s a combustible mix that  we know all too well . “Brooke,” I say, “the ice cream shop might be crowded. You going to be OK?” “Just a little sinus trouble,” she answers. My fault. She always invokes Burt in  Elmo’s World Happy Holidays  when I ask if she’s OK. I take a different tack. “OK, baby. What should we do if it gets too loud while we’re waiting on the line?” “Cover my ears,” she says. “That’s a GREAT idea,” I tell her. “That’s perfect.” “And what will you do if you feel overwhelmed?” It’s a big question. She takes it in, processes it, then buys time by asking, “What’d ya say?” I repeat the question. “What will you do if you feel overwhelmed?” She thinks. We walk. I wait. After a moment, she speaks. And when she does, she answers the question with all of the straightforward, no bullsh-t, raw, this-is-who-I-am Brooke-ness that I live for. “I’ll scream.” ** Ed note: #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf … continues to thrive on Twitter. It’s been fabulous to have seen so many of you there joining in the conversation.  If you haven’t dipped a toe in the Twitter water yet, don’t be shy. Or do be shy. Heck, just do whatever feels comfortable for you.  In the meantime, I’ll add my new contributions here so that those of you who have drawn lines in the sand can see them too.  **

							#youmightbeanautismparentif…					" ". . If you’re on Twitter, you may have noticed something of a phenomenon lately. Over the last week or so, a community has begun to form. Some brilliant soul (if you know her / him / them please leave details in the comments!) began to use the hash tag #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf .. and it caught on. Like really caught on. . Parents of children with autism are connecting with one another around the hash tag. They’re sharing their stories – 140 characters at a time, they’re offering us all windows into their family’s celebrations, their heart-breaks, and above all, their overwhelming love for their kids. . It’s a pretty amazing thing. . I both love and hate reading the various tweets. I love them because they remind me that we’re not alone. I hate them because .. well, they remind me that we’re not alone. . The following are some of the tweets that I’ve posted there over the past few days. .

							autism, puberty and respect					" "– Honestly, our kids should just get a pass on the whole puberty thing. – a fellow autism mom – I want to write about the intersection of autism and puberty. I want to tell you that I’m struggling. With how to talk to Brooke about all of it – not just about what is happening to her body, but why. And more importantly, how it’s going to feel for her, from the inside out. (I don’t know how it will feel for her. I don’t know if she will experience the process differently than I did, or if it will be largely the same. My guess is that it will be different. Most things are.) I will make the most educated guesses I can as I guide her. I will take all of the information that I’ve gathered over all of these years of watching, studying, analyzing. I will extrapolate out to the very last degree to which I am able. I will find ways to deliver the information that she needs. I’ve tried talking. I’ve tried books. Neither was the answer. So I will offer up characters she knows, in the format of stories with which she is familiar. Brooke loves to read her old potty training books. The formula in those books makes sense to her. It’s familiar, comfortable, accessible. So I am working on writing a story for her in which Dora the Explorer explains puberty in the same format that she describes the transition from diapers to the potty. I thought it would be easier than it is. But as I write, I find myself stumbling across land mines – phrasing that is more likely to produce anxiety than ease, words that are far more conceptual than concrete. So I’m studying books like  this one  and  this one , searching for clues, guidance, ways to avoid missteps. Brooke deserves nothing less than everything I can do. I know that many of you reading this are parents of kids who face different challenges, and many of those kids are younger than mine. I know that many of you look to our story to see to what to expect as you move further down the road. Some of you have asked me to talk here about puberty, to stand by my banner of  No Secrets, No Shame  and to share the details of the process. To offer a guide of sorts. As much as I want to help, I can’t. Some time ago, Brooke’s older sister, Katie and I came to an agreement about what I would write about her here. If I don’t have the chance to ask her permission first, I am to trust my gut about what would embarrass her and what wouldn’t and, obviously, not write anything that I don’t think she would want me to share. My gut answer comes from one question … “If it were me, and I were twelve, would I want my mom telling this story to everyone I know?” The answer is, most often, no. Brooke’s autism does not negate her right to me asking the exact same question of myself every time I sit down to write about her. My desire to talk about  my  challenges,  my  fears, my own insecurities about the process, cannot ever trump her right to privacy. Helping to guide others cannot come at the cost of her dignity. If she chooses someday to talk about any or all of it, so be it, but she’s not in a position to make an informed decision yet. So it’s up to me to ask the question, “If it were me, and I were ten, would I want my mom telling this story to everyone I know?” The answer, my friends, is no.

							autism street					" "* I typed something I thought might be poetic. And then I deleted it all – one letter at a time. It was a story about a house on Autism Street – I thought a pretty little metaphor might make it easier to say. It didn’t. The truth does not always fit into pretty metaphors. My Brooke’s autism – our family’s autism – is a fact of our lives. It challenges each and every one of us – none more than my baby girl. We walk a high wire, arms out, heads up. We search for our footing; we fight for our balance. We scan the crowd. We seek compassion. We sniff out pockets of understanding. We hound the experts; we beg, borrow and steal the tools for our girl to live the fullest life she possibly can. We pray for acceptance. We try our damndest to celebrate what we have the luxury of calling her differences. It isn’t easy. Not by a long shot.  But our neighbors on Autism Street live vastly different lives. They live in houses where autism is about survival. Where there are no words. Where connection, engagement, a momentary, fleeting interaction is everything. Where constant vigilance takes its toll. Where sleep is a precious memory. Where children growing up and growing stronger is terrifying. Where tempests brew without warning and siblings are versed in self-defense. Where psychotropic drugs are a necessary evil. Where cabinets and pantries are secured behind lock and key. Where seizures are constant. Where skills once mastered vanish with the wind. Where potty training happens – again and again and again. Where children vanish in the blink of an eye – wandering into the world armed with superhuman coordination, uninhibited by any sense of danger. When we host a block party here on Autism Street, we’re reminded that our high wire act is really awfully quaint. * We need compassion, understanding and the tools to teach our girl to fly. Our neighbors need HELP. The need it NOW. They need answers. They need services for these kids – for themselves. They need a place to turn. They need a strategy – short-term, long-term, the distant future. They need a break. Too many of them are living under siege. * To those of you who read Diary without a further connection to autism, I am grateful. I beg you though, please, please always remember as you read … Our autism is just one house on the block, not remotely representative of its neighbors.  Our friends need help. And by God they need it now.

							warning – insufferable bragging in 3,2,1 …					" "
 – Is there any chance you might be willing to indulge this Mama some unabashed bragging? Some completely immodest pride in her eldest girl? Pretty please? If not, I completely understand. It’s annoying. I get it. Just move on and I’ll see you tomorrow. No harm; no foul. But, you see, a friend sent me this photo yesterday. She is vacationing with her family in NYC and she and her girls took a trip to Bloomingdale’s. And while they were there, they saw an ad for Ralph Lauren Children. A really big ad. Like a poster. On the wall. In Bloomingdale’s. I know I already said that, but still. And, well, it’s a picture of my kid. And that makes me pretty damn proud. But truthfully, that’s not really what I’m here to brag about. I mean it is, but not entirely. See, as proud as I am that my kid is beautiful (yeah, I said it, sue me), what I’m most proud of is this … Luau showed her the picture. He was jumping out of his skin. He’s a proud papa, after all. She looked up and said, “Cool.” Then returned to what she was doing. Because for her, It’s not about the pictures.  Or where they end up. It’s not about seeing herself. Truthfully, she doesn’t really care much about that part. For her,  it’s all about the experience. The adventure. The trip. The time alone with Mama. The kinship with the other kids. The stylists. The photographers. The seamstresses. The crew. The puppies. ( It’s Ralph Lauren; there’s always a puppy).  The clothes. The accessories. The wranglers. The friends she gets to see again and again and the new ones she makes every. single. time. It’s about being exactly who she is. In any and every setting. And who she is – according to her Mama – is absolutely beautiful. From the inside out.

"32150" "48" "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/naming-convention/" "Naming convention" "Last week when Hope and I picked her up from school, Rhema had something new to show us. “Rhema. What’s your sister’s name?” Her teacher asked her. “Ho. Hope!” Rhema said happily. Close your eyes. Can you see us? Our big fat grins, our cheers, our hearts soaring? All weekend, on the hour, Hope’s been asking her: “Rhema. What’s your sister’s name?” “Ho. Hope!” Hope loves hearing her say her name. To add a little variety I suggested we ask Rhema the other questions she’s learned to answer: How old are you? (Eight, eight). Where do you live? (She tackles the 3-syllable name by turning it into a 2 syllable name, and it’s the sweetest sound). And… “Rhema. What’s your name?” “Ho. Hope!” “Rhema. What’s  your  name?” “Ho. Hope!” Er… uh oh. “That’s your sister’s name. What’s your name, Rhema?” “Ho. Hope!” I looked at Hope. She looked at me. She giggled. “Rhema, ha ha!  I’m  Hope.  Your  Rhema. What’s your name, not my name, what’s your name?” “Ho. Hope!” And so it went. Funny crazy conversations in my house. “She’ll get it,” B said. “She’ll get it,” Hope said. “She’ll get it,” I said. . “…I’d never forget you—never. 
 Look, I’ve written your names on the palms of my hands.”

							their big brother, my friend					" "{image is a photo of Conner flanked by Katie and Brooke at Disney World last year. He is, of course, wearing his Mickey ears.} This morning, I woke up to find the following note in my inbox. I read it, then read it again. With tears threatening to fly free, I wrote back and asked Conner if he would be comfortable sharing his words here. More precisely, I wrote this: Oh, Conner. This is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read. I cherish my friendship with you and the wisdom you share. I know I’m a lot older than you and much closer to your mom’s age than yours, but you teach me so much. 
 Would you be comfortable with me sharing your words on Diary? Please don’t feel pressured if you’d rather not — I never, ever want you to feel like you can’t write to me privately and know it will stay that way. But if you are comfortable with the idea of me sharing this, I would really, really love to. 
 You are a gift, Conner. And the pictures you paint with your words are truly art. Conner generously agreed, which means that you get a gift this morning too. Before you read further, I have a request. Take a deep breath. Slow down. Listen. Now read. * Ms. Diary It is me Conner. I do like your post today. I was worried once about my life in the tomorrows. My body and my mind was upset because I thought I had to be another someone.  I would rock and no words would come. My mom knew like she does. She sat on The floor when I needed her with me but not too close and she hugs me when I Need her scent and feel. I know I can be me. I may live with my mom our lifetime And that is our choice. I will not let people who think different make me different. Mom says like you that she is blessed to have me. If me wants to move and live With a friend or by myself mom says she will be the first one to assist me. And if I want to stay here with mom like now I feel then mom says we will discover each day one magical day at a time. I like to learn and I have many things I will do someday. I don’t like it when people tell me or others what is right or wrong to live. Do they hear every noise in the room? Do they see people speak words from their mouth but when the words fly from their mouth to my ears their words are only sounds. Do their fingers not always move in rhythm with their hands? And do the stars Shine so bright you cant help but wish on them? Can they hear the sound of water that makes you want to jump and the colors of life that make you want to touch? Does Mickey Ears give them the confidence to write when words wont come from their mouth and give speeches when they will? This is my life and I love it. I have struggle days and I have happiest days. The tomorrows can be scary. I learned my yesterdays are part of me my todays are who I am and my tomorrows are where me and my mom are going. I hope this makes sense because I want you to know Brooke and Katie are lucky. And if they want a big brother I will never be far away. – Conner, my girls could ask for no better big brother, and I could ask for no better friend.

 I am thrilled to introduce a new blogger on the scene. This is her very first post and I am absolutely ecstatic that she chose  Diary  as the venue for her debut. Please give her a warm welcome! . . HI         LILY           I         LOVE        YOU JOJO           IS                      COOL . . Yup, that’s it. Yes, it’s a post. It’s a post that took my guest blogger nearly thirty minutes to type, so don’t knock it. “I would type on there. Is it my turn now? I will play on the computer!” “Oooh, Brooke, do you want to type something on Mama’s blog? You can say ‘hi’ to my friends.” “Oh yeah.” She settles in to type. One tiny finger hovers above the keyboard, poised and ready. She is concentrating. She retracts the finger and turns to me. “What is your friend’s name?” “Hmm, well, I actually have a lot of friends who will read what you write. How about if you just say, ‘Hi, Mama’s friends’?” Too abstract . “Is your friend’s name Ell-ee-yah?” “Um, well, no honey. Why don’t you just call Mama’s friends ‘Mama’s friends’?” Nope. “Is your friend’s name Lily?” “Sure, honey. Why don’t you call my friends Lily.” The little finger re-emerges. It takes up residence above the keyboard. It’s first job is to hit the Caps Lock. Hey, if you’re going to write a post you may as well MEAN it. “Where is the ‘h’?” I point to the h and she presses it down. She looks at it on the screen and appears to be quite satisfied with her work. She finds the i without help. “Her name is Lily”. She types L-I-L-Y. “I said ‘hi’ to Lily.” “I see that. That’s great, honey. What else would you like to say?” She is already typing. I watch I LOVE YOU emerge, ever so slowly on the screen. Oh man, Brooke. I love Lily too. (I keep this to myself). “We would play here now,” she says, pointing to the Nick Jr bookmark on the top of the screen. “No, sweetie. You already had your play time on the computer time today. You can go there again tomorrow.” “I will type JoJo,” she says. She types it all out … Slowly … Meticulously. It’s better than anything I’ve ever written. And then she starts to delete it. All of it.”Bye Bye Bye Bye,” she says as the words begin to disappear, letter by letter. “Oh, Brooke, let’s leave it there. It’s wonderful.” “It is?” “Yes, baby. It is.” She types it all back in. Slowly … Meticulously. So, there you have it, Lily. Brooke’s first guest post. Sorry,  Russ ,  but I think you may have been outdone.

							back to school					" "* I have a post brewing, my friends. A big one. A really sort of terrifying one. One that – as desperately as I want to write it THISVERYSECOND – demands,  and deserves , far more than the eight minutes that I have right now to write it. So it will have to continue to simmer just below the surface for one more day. In the meantime, I thought I’d share the following. Yesterday, a friend asked for some resources to share with teachers in her kiddo’s school. Since it’s that time of year – the time so fraught with anxiety and doubt and sometimes downright abject terror and  How is my baby gonna make it in school  and  Will he have someone looking out for him  and  Will there be someone who gets her, who helps her, who will take the time to understand her  and  Will she maybe, just maybe, make a friend? Yup, it’s that time of year. Here is what I shared with my friend. Please – seriously, PLEASE – add to the list in the comments! Happy reading – I’ll see you tomorrow. * Momastery On Gifts and Talents Temple Grandin’s Advice For Educating Autistic Kids Just Stimming: Quiet Hands Mom-NOS: A Hairdryer Kid in a Toaster-Brained World Diary: Hopes and Dreams Diary: How to Talk to Kids About Learning Differences – Part One  and  Part Two

 Lest anyone think that our Maui trip was not also amazing and fun... the cascading pools at the Grand Wailea are really a lot of fun with waterfallsand water slides and a lazy river and a rope swing and lots of other crazy pre-teen party fun.  wailea

Big Waves at the Bay of Fredericton this Morning

Fredericton looked like a city on the Atlantic ocean this morning with the wind and the rising St. John River waters producing some pretty good waves and flooding up over the walking trails on both sides of the river.

No Autism Just Fredericton In May
" "
 It was a beautiful May day in Fredericton. A perfect day to do a bridge walk, from Westorland Street Bridge, along the Saint John River, across the pedestrian bridge, (former train bridge) through the down town, across the Westmorland Street Bridge and home to Nashwaaksis on the North side of Fredericton. But who let that Blogger into the picture?

Walking Trail Flooded This Weekend

 Max and a new friend. Sabrina thought it would be fun to get into the tank and go swimming with the sharks, but I pointed out that she hadn't brought her bathing suit. Max's favorite tank of fish. Can you spot Nemo 1 and Nemo 2?  Sabrina checking out the starfish   Jellyfish rock The penguin mafia Quick—spot the hippo! Is it just me, or did he smile for the camera?

			 We are off to  Lassen National Park , getting in one last camping trip before summer’s over! Nigel will be hiking up the 10,457-foot peak with me while Aidan (not into hiking so much) joins Grandma for a canoe ride on Manzanita Lake. My mom works as an interpretive ranger at the park, so it will be fun to see her lead one of her ranger programs. We’ll return Thursday with a full report!

Conor and Dad Bridge Walk - Fun at the River

A bridge walk is a good work out for Dad as I struggle to keep up with Conor.  Fortunately for Dad, Conor takes time out for fun at the River, climbing and strolling along a small wall and, of course, throwing rocks in the River - the Saint John River. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

A Perfect Day

 Today was a perfect day in Fredericton. A clear blue sky, a beautiful sunny day with a comfortable fall breeze. Conor enjoyed the cool breeze ... and the McDonald's Hash Browns. A visitor also enjoying the breeze ... and showing us some flying techniques. The view from the picnic bench.

The news from Nat is that he is totally happy and participating in everything, although he did not love the lake/waterskiing as much as one would think because, well, it was not the ocean!  That’s my boy. Today I am in Aspen, and this is our last full day.  Home tomorrow night at midnight.  I just saw a bear while I was walking to get a latte.  Now I’d say it was a perfect vaca except that my Natty was not here. 
 
 
 The third day of our trip, we left the Aspen area and headed up to Crested Butte.  This may have been my favorite town in Colorado; a perfect gem of a place with preserved Victorian false -fronted buildings and funky boutiques (not a chain in sight), and of course, magnificent mountains on all sides. 
 After Crested Butte we headed to Telluride by way of Black Canyon of the Gunnison, an incredibly steep canyon.  …  See my Tabblo>

Conor and Dad's First 2009 Bridge Walk
" "
 Conor and Dad got out for our first complete \"Bridge Walk\" last evening, from our home down the North Riverfront Trail past the Westmorland Street Bridge on to the old Train Bridge, now a pedestrian bridge, across the Saint John River,  back to the Westmorland Street Bridge, across  to the North side, back up the trail and home. Without Conor it takes Dad as much as 2 1/2 hours to complete the walk with a couple of short rests on benches along the way. With Conor there are no stops to rest and Dad has to keep a brisker pace completing the walk in 1 hour and 50 minutes last night.   Dad is a bit sore today. It was a beautiful, sunny evening.  We saw lots of people, and some furry friends, along the way. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

Judgmental Giving
" "
I don't know if you caught the  Oprah's Lifeclass with Brene Brown , or know of Dr. Brene Brown's work, but I am a big fan. She said something that really has me thinking, and I'm paraphrasing, but the essence was, if you can't ask for help, that's because you have a judgment about what help is and who needs it. Therefore, when you give, you are  always giving with judgment . 
 
At first I thought about all the ways she was wrong, and then I realized that was just a defense mechanism, because she's so right. At the very least, we judge giving help as good, and asking for help as bad. 
 
Thoughts?

I wish I could. People say, “If he doesn’t seem unhappy, he’s not.” Yes, but no. Sometimes I am not satisfied with that. So here is what I want to ask him: 1) Do you understand what I say when I speak normally, that is, quickly, using metaphor? 2) If so, do you feel bad when I adapt what I’m saying to a simpler language? 3) Do you know that I respect you, no matter how I talk to you? 4) Are you lonely? 5) Do you feel left out when everyone around you is talking? Or maybe you’re used to it by now? 6) Do you understand why we are planning your life without really knowing you how you feel about it? 7) Do you wish that you and Ben were close? 8) Do you feel Max reaching out in his quiet wispy way? 9) What do you want for your birthday? 10) Have you ever been abused?

"12866" "19" "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2016/05/21/2119/" "" "I know I’ve said this before, but every now and then I run across something that makes me feel the need to say it again, and today was one of those days in multiple ways. I know that Dan Savage has said and done some outrageous and problematic things.  But “It Gets Better” really, really isn’t one of the worser things he has ever done. When I was a kid, no one told me it would get better. Almost everyone told me that it would only get worse.  Parents.  Teachers.  Adults of every stripe continually told me that adulthood was just awful boring drudgery where I’d have to be better at pretending to be someone more socially acceptable than who I was if I was ever going to make it, that the time I was living in was the best time of my life and I should learn to appreciate it. Our guest speaker for Senior Week in high school actually, in fact, told us that “It’s all downhill from here.” I was badly bullied at school and at home and no one did anything.  I hated that other people controlled my life.  I didn’t know I was queer yet, but in so many other ways, a lot of people were making sure I knew that the way I was was Not Okay. I was supposed to believe that that was as good as it was ever going to get for me.  That was the best I should expect.  It would not get better. And those were vicious, ugly lies. No, it isn’t enough just to say it and not  do  anything to make it better now, but when the alternative to not even saying it is that a lot of kids are actively being told that it does  not  get better and no one is contradicting that message in  any  way? If you have a choice between telling a kid who’s unhappy or having a hard time that it will get better, or that it won’t?  Tell them that it will. Like, dear lord.

Can we talk?
" "
 This is what happens. We meet. I don’t talk much. For a long time, I say hardly anything and when I do it’s cryptic or odd to you. After a period of time, probably months, I start to say more things, but the things sometimes are even more strange, and now there is chirping and trilling and repeating. Here and there you may recognize a line from a very old movie or TV show. Then comes a period of time where I seem much more “normal” to you with less chirping, less repeating. Even my jokes make sense during this time. And then it’s over, and back to Gilligan’s Island and the birdhouse. Let me break that down: Phase 1. Quiet. Phase 2. Less quiet, more odd. Phase 3. Less odd with variable quietness. Phase 4: Less quiet, more odd. This is how some people interpret that: 1. You are shy. 2. You are shy, but getting used to talking to me. You are nervous due to the shyness, so you behave oddly. 3. You are over the nervousness. You are finally okay and we can relate like regular people. 4. You don’t like me anymore. You are being as annoying as possible to push me away. Why don’t you just tell me it’s over? Or it can be seen this way: 1. You are shy 2. You are really weird, but that’s okay with me. 3. You understand it’s not okay to be weird all of the time. You are making the expected efforts to fit into society and this is good. This is what a person of good character does. 4. You have “decided” you are autistic, even gone so far as to get a diagnosis. Now you don’t care about fitting in anymore. You are using this as an excuse for bad behavior. Why don’t you just grow up? This is how it looks from the inside: 1. I don’t know why it is, but I’ ve  never been comfortable talking. Some days it takes all my energy just to say a little. I am almost never able to communicate what I actually mean by speaking. I am surprised you are even still trying to have this relationship with me. Most people give up after one conversation. 2. This is part of the way I relate to the world. Sometimes the repetition is a means of communication, sometimes the chirping is my way of expressing happiness. If I am doing these things around you, I am starting to get comfortable with you. If you accept me at this stage, you may have a friend for life, but if you get angry or ask me to stop, I will know that I will never be able to truly relax and be myself around you. It’s okay either way. I am not so invested in this friendship yet that rejection will hurt very much. 3. You are still here? That’s great. I appreciate that you like me for who I am. You know what? I can sometimes have what appears to be a normal conversation. If I am well rested and not stressed, I am more likely to be able to do this. There are lots of factors that play into this. The medicine I take for depression made a difference for a long time. Not so much now, but that’s fine with me, that’s not what it’s for anyway. 4. It has been a while, I understand so much more about myself and my communication style than I did when we first met. I have found that there are other people like me, too. I am autistic. Don’t worry, though. I am exactly the same person I have always been. I can take care of myself better now that I understand I am not a defective person. I have to play the “normal” game a lot at work, but when we are just hanging out, I can be myself and relax, right? Right? Hello?

I wish I could. People say, “If he doesn’t seem unhappy, he’s not.” Yes, but no. Sometimes I am not satisfied with that. So here is what I want to ask him: 1) Do you understand what I say when I speak normally? 2) If so, do you feel bad when I adapt what I’m saying to a simpler language? 3) Do you know that I respect you, no matter how I talk to you? 4) Are you lonely? 5) Do you feel left out when everyone around you is talking? Or maybe you’re used to it by now? 6) Do you understand why we are planning your life without really asking you how you feel about it? 7) Do you wish that you and Ben were close? 8) Do you feel Max reaching out in his quiet wispy way? 9) What do you want for your birthday? 10) Have you ever been abused? And so today I had a bad moment on my bike ride, a real heart bruise, when I thought of these, and I wanted you to let me know, somehow. But I know you can’t, and so I have to live with that.

"42300" "64" "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/autistic-pride-day-2015-letter-to-myself-as-a-child/" "Autistic Pride Day 2015 – Letter to Myself as a Child" "I have been wanting to write a letter to myself as a child for a while now and Autistic Pride Day seemed like the perfect day to do it. As I thought about what I would say to myself if I could reach back in time, I realized that there is not one single “me as a child.” So this is a letter to many of my past selves over time. I have tried to write in ways I would have understood at different ages. If I could only give one message to myself at any age, it would be this, “stop taking the blame for the bad things other people do to you.” I was so hard on myself. Why? Because others were hard on me. How ridiculous is that? Over and over, I punished myself for what other people did to me. So I got punished twice. I want to apologize to myself for making everything even harder than it had to be. And I want to forgive myself, too. I was just trying to survive a difficult life with the “tools” I had. Dear Sparrow at three-years-old: You are such a good girl! I love it when you are happy and singing. I see how hard you try to always do the right thing. Always remember that I love you and that you are such a good girl. Dear Sparrow at seven-years-old: I am so sorry about how school has turned out for you. I remember when you were four years old and so excited on your birthday because you were finally old enough to go to school. Going to school was almost all you could think about. And then it happened and it didn’t live up to your expectations at all. The teachers are teaching things you already know and the other students don’t treat you well. Sometimes the teacher doesn’t treat you very good, either. I will tell you a secret: those other students are treating you badly because they don’t understand you and that scares them. I will tell you another secret: don’t tell the other students that you know that! Whenever you know something that helps you put up with how hard life is, don’t share that with the people who are making your life hard because they will just make fun of it and find ways to take that away from you. Knowing that they are treating you mean because they don’t understand and are afraid is like having a secret shield to protect you from feeling as bad when they are mean. Don’t let them know you have that shield. Sometimes people you trust are telling you that the bullying you are getting is your own fault and that if you could act more like the other kids, they wouldn’t bully you. Don’t believe that it is your fault! It is not your fault that you are being bullied by others; it is their fault that they are bullies! There are things you don’t understand and what do you do? You try to learn more. You don’t turn into a meanie about it. So you know that the other kids could stop being bullies if they wanted to, but they are choosing the lazy way of staying afraid and not learning about you. Isn’t that sad for them? This is your secret shield to help you stay strong when they get mean. Never tell them, but just know inside yourself that they are being mean because they are too lazy to learn a better way to be. It’s okay to feel sorry for them. Feel sorry for them in secret. It’s part of your shield. Yes, you really are different from the other students. That doesn’t make you wrong. It doesn’t mean you should try to change who you are. There is nothing wrong with being different and hopefully some day those other students will learn that. Right now, I want you to learn it. Being different doesn’t make the bullying your fault. Being different is not “bringing it all on yourself.” And those people who say you “insist on being different” or are trying to “show off” are wrong You are different because you were bon that way. Never be ashamed of being different. Be proud of who you are! Just pay attention to the things you have control over. Try to be a good person. Try to do your school work as well as you can. And remember your secret shield and stay strong behind it. Dear Sparrow at twelve-years-old: Your life is changing so much! Everything is going to be different in middle school. Try to talk to an adult you trust about the things that are hard for you. Tell them how much it hurts to write with a pen or pencil. They ‘know that your handwriting is really bad but they don’t know that it causes you pain to write. You haven’t told them because you didn’t realize that the way writing feels to you is not the way it feels to everybody. Tell them that it hurts. And if they don’t hear you or don’t understand, tell them again. You have a condition called dysgraphia and that’s why you have been having a hard time getting your school work done. If your parents and teachers can understand that you have a handwriting disability, they can get you help. Or maybe they will start letting you type your school work like you’ve been asking to do for so long. They just have to understand that it hurts and they can’t understand until you tell them. Middle school is going to be harder so you need to get ready for it. You need an IEP plan. You can’t be expected to know what that is, but if you tell your parents and teachers about the things that are hard for you and try to tell as much detail as you can, they can work for you and get a plan in place so that you can get help with the hard things, like handwriting. Tell them how the other students treat you. It’s just going to get harder for you next year, so you need to make sure the adults understand right now what is happening. No adult is with you in every class, every minute, so you have to tell them about the things they weren’t there to see. They don’t know what is happening when they aren’t around. You have such a bright future waiting for you and an adult life where you will not be stuck all day with people who treat you badly. You will have a life where you can make choices for yourself and the more you are able to get help right now with the things that are hard for you, the brighter your future is going to be. Stay strong. Remember your secret shields. Get trusted adults to help you with the things that are hard. Love, Sparrow There are things I would like to say to myself at fifteen-years-old, but it starts getting too intense and too personal at that point for me to feel ready to share with others. If I were to give enough advice and encouragement to myself before that point, maybe my teen years wouldn’t be so hard anyway. Who knows what my adult years would look like? At 48 years old, I’ve finally managed to carve out a life that makes me happy. It doesn’t look very much like the American Dream. But it suits me well. If I could send these letters, and so many more, back in time to my younger self, maybe I wouldn’t have had to wait this long to figure out where I fit in this world. But there is no time machine hidden inside a mailbox. This is my life and I am happy with where I’ve ended up. Would I have wished for other things? Yes. Yes, the life I wanted is so different from the life I have. But I’ve found a happy place in this life and I’m grateful. I can’t really send letters to my younger self, but I can write them. And she’s still here, inside me. She’s reading these letters. She’s healing every day.   " 5.05112695615992e-05 0.0759807021422659 0.00418638072608193 9.39907054364054e-05 2.34523642501038e-05 0.0180653664169248 0.000116989996703383 0.0380696342829265 8.20553131539323e-05 6.09489937581201e-05 8.91599585670177e-05 4.00992292201691e-05 0.000106426859176768 6.91452447195717e-05 7.78811313000498e-05 0.000311281890066973 0.000136974427792696 0.000232228128384038 0.694484983365571 0.00214170099368698 6.53321299955144e-05 0.0381710190836342 0.000158672694232899 9.69231370115411e-05 0.00611233871048838 6.49165405123483e-05 0.000862294381325721 0.00433348791562646 9.94088733427781e-05 0.000113481723678085 9.32157566923632e-05 6.80668142327791e-05 0.000294490722522813 0.000151888657230979 0.000396826402455234 6.0375778998904e-05 0.000110357469424509 7.09714298684017e-05 8.45447906722043e-05 0.0482675367793744 0.0643908787737367 5.33992140216419e-05 0.000203820745627141 4.98971325389867e-05 5.20671528510784e-05 0.00013679634668773 0.00028515835942279 8.95188883755766e-05 0.000144107984267162 0.000498292171603026

 I’ve been hearing it for a while now, and I know, I know, I know it’s true.  But… 
 Making myself a priority has always seemed like an act of selfishness.  I know, logically, it’s not.  But, still, it’s hard to shake off those cultural preconceptions, isn’t it? 
 Well, I’m going to do it.  Really, I don’t have much of a choice.  I can do what I want to do and be what I want to be for my family unless I have enough energy and peace to get it all done.  If I don’t take care of myself, I never will. 
 So, the first step to prioritizing self-care is deciding I’m worth it, and I am.

 A s you read
my words there are many others who wish that they could also talk. Not just
type.    Those people reading these words
should believe that even if someone with autism cant speak that doesn’t mean
they have nothing to say. I think we should always believe that people can do
great things if we understand the kind of help they need and give it without
wanting the person to be different. On the inside there is a lot happening you
cant see. Don’t be angry when we do things you don’t understand. I think you
should reme mber that everyone wants to  
 be loved for who they are.

"20669" "34" "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/truth-is/" "Truth Is" "Author’s note: Yesterday in the blogosphere there was an  Autism Positivity Day Flash Blog , sparked by one author noticing that someone had found their blog by searching “I wish I didn’t have Asperger’s.” Due to my own situation, I couldn’t participate, but today is  Blogging Against Disablism Day , and I still have something to say. Sometimes in the morning I am petrified and can’t move 
Awake but cannot open my eyes 
And the weight is crushing down on my lungs 
I know I can’t breathe 
And hope someone will save me this time   x Dear “I wish I didn’t have Asperger’s,” I want you to know that I understand. That’s the first thing. This isn’t going to work if we aren’t honest with each other, so, let me be honest. I’ve thought a lot about that mythical cure, and there have been days, many days, when I didn’t have to think at all–when I  knew  that, if I had a chance, I’d take a cure in a heartbeat. I need you to know that I understand. I do. I do. I want the things a cure could give me.  I want to have the leading role in my own story, and parts in others’. I want to be able to do the same things everyone else can do in the same way without any extra effort. I want to not feel like a freak. I want to feel safe. I want to be someone my parents can love. I want to know I have a future, and I want to not have to blaze that trail by myself. I want to have worth. I want other people to not think they have a right to me and my space, or else I want it to stop bothering me. I want my words and experiences to make sense to other people, and I want their words and experiences to make sense to me. I want to have to work just a little less hard. I want to have a college degree, a job, and a house of my own, and I want to be able to live wherever I want. I want to be able to assume I’m a person. I want to not have a month out of the year dedicated to my brokenness. I want to be able to assume that it’s not me, it’s them. I want to wake up and not be terrified or already tired. I want a lot of things. It’s not a bad thing, to want things. Check in: can you see, now, that I really do understand? I hope you can. I get a couple of visits from you, or someone with the same keyword search, every week, and I want you to know that you aren’t alone, and you aren’t wrong. Okay. I’ve been honest with you. Now I want you to be honest with me. Can you look at the list of things I want, and tell me if you see a pattern? I’ll wait. While I wait, I figure, I might as well tell you some other things I’d like to stop being. In addition to no longer being autistic, I’d also like to be cured of -being a lesbian 
-being female 
-being so obscenely tall Really. I’d like to get be able to get married to someone I love in every state. I’d like to be able to walk down a dark street without fearing for my safety. I’d like to be able to sit in a chair designed for someone of my height. And none of those things are happening right now, so I guess I can either fight for them to change, or try to change myself. Okay. Did you find the pattern? It’s okay if you didn’t. It took me awhile to understand it. It’s subtle.  Every single one of those things I want? Have nothing to do with being autistic. Really. Not a single, solitary one. I  should  have a leading role in my own story. When I don’t, it’s because other people aren’t treating me like a person. That is  not my fault.  Pretty sure the one in the wrong there is the one who thinks that a disability means you aren’t a person. Why  do I want to be able to do the same things as everyone else? Why is that important to me? If I lived in a world where it was recognized that there are multiple ways to do something and that this is  okay  and the things I do and the ways I do them are valid and important, would I care? Would I even realize this was something to care about at all? I would know that I have a future, and that it’s a bright and near and real one, if I knew growing up that autistic adults existed. Guess what–they do, they have for thousands of years, and on the whole, they’re doing just as well as anyone else. I want to have worth–okay. See, if I had a friend who felt worthless, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t tell that friend “you’re right, you’re pathetic. Please change everything about yourself.” I’m pretty sure I would tell that friend that the people making her feel worthless were abusive assholes, that she was good at plenty of things, that she was a fantastic person I was lucky to know, and that human worth isn’t some tangible thing we can gain or lose. And if I can say all of that to a friend, and mean it…why can’t I say it to myself? I’m not special. I work by the same rules as everyone else. And that means I  am  worth something, whether I believe it or not. I can keep going through these. I do make sense to a few people, who take the time to listen to me the way I need to be heard, and they make sense to me. That is how relationships work, and there are lots of different ways to communicate. I can have a job, a living situation I am in charge of, and all the education I want, with the correct supports, just like everyone else. It is not my fault that the supports I need differ from the majority, and that is not an excuse or invitation to mistreat or discriminate against me. Etc etc etc. In the end, there are really two things I want when I say  I wish I wasn’t autistic  or  I want a cure.  I want to not feel like a freak, and I want to feel safe. Those are hard, scary things to feel and to admit. And, because I’m being honest, I have to ask something even scarier. What if being cured didn’t fix those things? Because ultimately, if I took a cure, I’d be surrendering. Instead of fighting for my right to be treated and valued as a human being regardless of disability, I’d be letting go, giving in, and letting myself be changed into someone easier, someone acceptable, someone convenient. And I want to be clear–there is nothing  wrong  with wanting things to be  easier  or wanting to feel  safe  or  accepted  or just being done  fighting.  That just means that you’ve been asked to be much, much stronger than everyone else for much, much too long. But if, in order to be  safe  I have to stop being me? Then I’m really not safe at all. As long as being disabled means being unsafe, then no one is safe. Not really.  Disability is a natural part of the human experience  according to the ADA. Most people will experience some form of disability, for some period of time, at some point in their lives. So long as we as a society keep permitting exceptions to rules like  everyone is a person  and  treat people like people,  none of us are safe. Safety earned by staying within acceptable margins isn’t safety at all. I promised to be honest. Part of being honest is looking at what my words actually mean, what lies beneath them, what ideas are controling what I say. And underneath every  I wish I wasn’t autistic  is a  I wish people would stop hurting me  or a  I wish the world had room for me  or a  if I blame myself, I can feel like I’m in control. And it’s okay that I feel this way. Well, it’s not okay that  anyone  ever has to feel this way, but I’m not bad or wrong for feeling it. Neither are you. But feelings aren’t the same as reality, and in the end, if we weren’t autistic anymore, there would still be people hurting others just because they can and just because no one ever told them to stop, and we’d still know that it takes only the slightest deviation before we’re vulnerable again. A cure won’t ever be able to change that. What  will  change that is something a lot harder than a magic pill. What  will  change that is enough people saying  enough is enough  and doing the hard work of making our world one where everyone is welcome, all communication is honored, and everyone is safe and valued. And that is going to take time, and there are going to be days, still, as we work to make that happen, where you, where I, will wish we weren’t autistic, because sometimes it just  hurts . But it will change. It’s changing now. And you shouldn’t, and don’t, have to. You are amazing and sufficient and lovable just the way you are, and I really, really hope you’ll stick around so that one day the rest of the world can know it, too.

I think that “How are you?”  is kind of meaningless, it’s just stuff we say.  I think Nat knows that, on some some level.  Maybe to him it seems like there’s so much stuff you’re just supposed to say, and none of it gets to anything real. So what is real for him?  If it’s just what’s in front of his nose, then how does he deal with complex feelings?  Does he feel them and not understand them? Maybe that’s the way you’re supposed to be.  That’s what I was told, long ago:  “Just feel your feelings.”  Right now that’s what I’m doing and it feels putrid.  I’ve been carrying Nat-guilt around ever since I dropped him off yesterday.  Guilt and grief. I hate the way his brothers have to be told to say goodbye.  I hate the way he has to be told to say Happy Mother’s Day.  For all of them, it’s just a lot of words. Meanwhile I’m sick of words and I’m sick of feelings.  And I want someone else to be in charge for a change.

Regression Sucks

But things were better. I know, it's because we said it out loud. I know, development works like that. I know, that is part of his autism. I know, this too shall pass. I know, we could try another diet, more acronyms, some test, etc, etc. I know, all kids have ups and downs. I know, he is disregulated. I know I'm always vowing to complain less. I know, I know, I know. But don't you think regression still sucks?

The Four Hardest Words
" "
 It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.  ~Lena Horne 
 I sit and watch THE DIVA figure things out. She wants to do everything herself. She gets mad if she can't figure it out. She gets mad if she can't something to do exactly what she wants. She gets fiercely mad. (I wonder where she gets that from?? Shut up) And she is so proud of herself when it all works out to her DIVA satisfaction.  But the one thing she, 9 times out of 10, will refuse to say is, \"Can you help me?\"   I know exactly whom she gets that lovely trait from. I'm a do it myself girl. I hate hate asking for help. Relying on other people? No thanks.  
 Oh but the Boy Wonder has taught me, I must ask for help. I can not do this alone. It has gotten easier not quite 4 years in to ask for help for him.  
 And now almost 4 years in, I am learning to ask for help for me.  From the Mamas . From a few other very special people. 
 If you're just starting out on this road, ask for help. Take help that's offered. If not for you, do it for your kids. In watching THE DIVA struggle and refusing to ask for help, I've learned I need to ask so she can learn to ask for help.

I have a confession. I have been holding out on you. Something happened. And I didn't want to tell you. Because it's a good thing. And I do. not. trust. good. things. I do not speak lightly of good things. But. Um. Some people have been trying to explain to me lately that the world does not work the way I think it does. And that maybe, possibly, people SHOULD say the good things. Er. I don't know. I'm open, but I'm uncertain. So I want to give it a try. I want to tell you a good thing. I beg of you not to jinx me. Not to hate me for the good. Not to tell on us. Not to let us be punished for a good thing. Okay, maybe if I tell you this good thing, and the good thing stays, I will think about considering that maybe some of the people who want me to be more, uh, hopeful, might possibly be on to something. We will have to wait and see. So. A few months ago. We stopped Melatonin. My children, almost 7 and almost 5, just sleep at night now, like they are supposed to, most nights of the week, both unmedicated. Ahem. This is a very vulnerable moment for me. Please, don't even comment. Let's just wait while I hold my breath and see which of us is right about how the world works. And let's see how long it takes me develop insomnia. Good night.

				 In some ways I’m getting used to autism but I can’t get  too  used to it or I won’t get better. I have to strike a balance between the need to accept myself the way I am and the need to  not  accept myself the way I am, so I can keep fighting to improve. Not easy to find that middle spot.

Triggered
" "
 
 
Yesterday was one of those days where almost everyone I came into contact with said or did something that triggered me. Could have been one tiny little misplaced word like \"best.\" Could have been something as simple as someone saying no to my (really great, brilliant, super helpful and perfect) suggestion. Could have been someone telling me I was confusing them, as opposed to them saying they were simply confused. 
 
Turns out I was doing some triggering of my own. Things I said in jest dropped deeper than I'd intended. I guess you just never know what's going to trigger you, and when you're going to do the triggering. 
 
It does beg the question, however, how careful must we be to watch out for that sort of thing? I am all about sensitivity, or so I think, until someone busts me on my own actions. Then again, I think I do some of my best work totally uncut. Pulling a Dr. Phil, if you will, calling it like I see it. 
 
Even when someone says, \"I need advice... \" or \"Tell me what you think...\" or worse yet, \"Tell me the truth...\" it can, and often is, dicey to do so. Maybe that's why we have professionals - maybe the answer is to just shut up and listen and not offer anything back whatsoever - let those that are hired to do so, do so.

 \"Those people reading these words
should believe that even if someone with autism can't speak that doesn’t mean
they have nothing to say.  I think we should always believe that people can do
great things if we understand the kind of help they need and give it without
wanting the person to be different.  On the inside there is a lot happening you
can't see. Don’t be angry when we do things you don’t understand. I think you
should remember that everyone wants to   be loved for who they are.\"

This is for posterity. Two haircut milestones. 
 
First: Witness what Leo's level of comfort and familiarity with our local hair salon and local stylists means: He, his sister Mali, and I all got our hair cut together.  At the same time . When Leo was done his stylist handed him his iPad, and suggested he go sit in a chair and wait for me. Which ... Leo did. Patiently. Like the mature teen dude he is.

And here are the before-and-afters for Mali. I think her new 'do is fetching, but her reasoning for this shortest-ever cut is both practical, and tactical -- she wanted a style that would not catch in her Bo staff during karate practice. A girl's gotta have her priorities.

 *in my humble opinion 
 It’s cold, even in Austin. Every day I stand in my closet and wonder why I only have one throw-over-what-you’re-wearing-comfortable-and-adorable sweater. 
 Today I asked my friends on Facebook to point me in the direction of their most favorite throw-on sweaters. I love a cozy wrap or cardigan for layering, and of course, my  Facebook  friends came through. 
 So I give you (and my pocket book weeps)…the best comfortable and cozy cardigan, pull-over or wrap style throw-on sweaters: 
 
   
 (from top, going left to right) 
 1.  H&M  Boucle Cardigan 
2.  Sundance  Falling For You Pullover 
3.  Vintage Glam  Winter Why Not Cardigan 
4.  Land’s End  Women’s Vintage Blend Zip Cardigan 
5.  Vintage Glam  Crossing Paths Cardigan 
6.  Nordstrom  Bobeau Asymmetrical Flece Wrap Cardigan 
7.  Sundance  Spring Blooms Cardigan 
8.  Express  Striped Cover-Up 
9.  BCBG  Beret Color-Blocked Cardigan Wrap 
 Feel free to add your favorite cozy sweater link in the comments! (I will thank you while my pocket book weeps some more.) 
  and keep coming back because the Facebook suggestions keep rolling in. For instance, THIS amazing deal  from J Jill!  (Cashmere Cardigan) 
 
   
 and this one from  sheinside  called the Apricot Hooded Long Sleeve Cardigan

 What a Black Thong on a Pasty White Butt Looks Like I do not wear thong-style drawers because they I like the way they look. I wear them because they are comfortable, and because--once pants go on top--they avoid making my butt look like it got embossed with underwear. I have yet to explain this to Mali, however. She was with me while I was changing into my sleepwear, spied my thong-adorned behind from, well, behind, and declared, \"Mommy's got poo-poo!\" Nice. Technorati Tags:  Mali

		 I used to think this was the best kiddie tee-shirt ever: 
 Spelling deeds, done dirt cheap. But now I think I found one that’s even better:
 Toga! Toga! In other news, Quinn is willing to wear the long-sleeved shirts I bought him yesterday to replace his stained yellow short-sleeved shirts.
 Edited to add:  I bought the black tee-shirt at Target.

"31666" "46" "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2012/11/23/old-lady-shoes/" "Old Lady Shoes" "Yeah, you’ve seen them: old ladies wearing Old-Lady Shoes. Dowdy footwear that inextricably time-travelled from some economically-depressed post-war period. Or low-heeled, lace-up shoes resembling dull leather sneakers, that shuffled in from the land that fashion forgot. Practical  shoes. Hopefully, comfortable shoes, given the tired way those old ladies are getting around. But damn, I mean  dayam , if not quite ugly shoes, then definitely shoes without style. And, as you may have guessed,  suddenly, here  I am, too.  Last fall I broke my foot. The displacement fractures in the metatarsals (the long bones over the arch) mended, albeit crookedly, with offset mends that make them look like rivers with meanders. (Don’t fall over in shock when I say that my hypermobility includes rather low arches, too.) This past spring my foot started hurting again, as my second job stocking groceries involved walking around concrete floors and stocking heavy cases — not good for the osteoarthritis or the broken bones. So I got orthotics to provide more support for my poor ravaged feet. But now my foot is constantly aching, and I’m limping, and am getting what I’m assuming are referred pains in my knee and hip. And when I saw the orthopedist earlier last week for chronic foot pain, he disapproved of my buckled  Mary Janes  I’d worn to my first job, and told me I need to wear shoes that lace up. I’m not much of a fashionista, but I can’t picture wearing either hiking boots or my rumpled black sneakers with skirts, suits or dresses. So that means I need to get a new pair of shoes. Or maybe a pair of knee-high boots.) But, I can’t wear polyurethane (PU), PVC or silicone, which limits me to fabric or leather footwear, which is of course, more expensive. Great! I need to find: 
 slightly-dressy, 
 low-heeled (no more than 1.25″ / 5 cm), 
 lace-up, 
 leather shoes, 
 with removable insoles (so I can replace them with my orthotics), 
 in a size US womens 10.5  (UK 8, EUR 42), 
 wide toe ( C ), 
 preferably brown. 
 If you’re laughing and/or groaning, you probably have some idea of the magnitude of that request. I mean, that is pretty specific! Not being fond of shopping, I did some quick noodling around online, and discovered that the lower-end department stores don’t carry leather shoes (boo!), and that many of the online sites don’t mention whether or not the insoles can be removed. (I’e also become quite the connoisseur of Web sites with numerous lists of ways to filter search requests.) I also noticed a general lack of lace-up shoes, aside from “granny boots” with 2.5″ heels. So I looked up the current addresses to the store with a huge, self-serve selection of shoes, and stopped by there en route home one day. They had nifty boots full of brass buttons, sharp-looking tweedy  spectator pumps  [court shoes], loafers and flats with all kinds of fun hardware … but an absolute  dearth  of lace-up shoes. (Since I have wide feet anyway, I checked out the men’s section, but was dismayed to find walking shoes with  heavy  lug soles, or stiff wingtips so stylishly long that it seemed my feet would look like aircraft carriers, down to the brogues resembling rows of rivets.) I finally asked a sales clerk for assistance, just in case I’d missed something. She was understanding of my requirements, even letting me slip out some insoles to test my orthotics on a couple of pairs — only to find that the toe boxes were too low-profiled. She too, was surprised to realise that there were so few lace-up shoes. What few they had were made with the insoles sewn down, or were fashioned of (sweat-inducing) imitation leather. And, apparently this year’s crop of sneakers [trainers] comes in neon colors. Naturally, chef’s or medic’s clogs won’t work either. Le sigh. And  this  is why I hate shopping for wardrobe items (in addition to the noisy lighting fixtures that drill into my head.); it seems that no matter what I’m looking for, it’s not to be had. The year I wanted khaki shorts, I couldn’t find khaki shorts — yes, khaki shorts! Ditto denim overalls. Or a long-sleeve white blouse with sleeves to fit my arms, and tails long enough to stay tucked in. Or, good grief, cufflinks to go with a French-cuff blouse I found at the thrift store. And so it goes. I already have a pair of black sneakers that I wear (with black trousers) at my grocery job. Sorry, but unless I’m evacuating in an emergency, I can’t imagine wearing either hiking boots or my rumpled black sneakers with skirts, suits or nice dresses. All I need to find is a pair of slightly-dressy, low-heeled, lace-up leather shoes, with removable insoles, in a size 10.5 wide, preferably brown. No, I’m not being picky, I’m being particular. The “slightly-dressy” and “preferably brown” are what I want, but the rest are what I  need.  (And unlike a coworker who has diabetes, neither my orthotics nor my footwear are covered as a necessary medical expense. Those orthotic insoles I had to get cost me half of what I pay for my monthly mortgage!) Even worse, a lot of those “comfort” shoes don’t lace up or come in 10.5 wide. Or, I can find lace-up “granny” ankle boots or knee-high boots, but the heels are too high, or they are made of some sweat-inducing synthetic. Or, I can find oxfords with the right heel height and made of leather, but not in a 10.5 wide. Or, I can find cute, low-heeled, leather lace-up shoes, but either the insoles are sewn in so I can’t use my orthotics, or else they’re so cheaply made there isn’t any arch support. And so on, and so on. So now I have joined the ranks of older women looking for supportive, sensible shoes that don’t look too dowdy. Don’t laugh at us gimping along in our leather sneakers; those specialty shoes are DAMN hard to find!

A little slice of Heaven
" "
I started a project on Wednesday for an amazing beauty product company... went to the home office in SF..wow. The offices are all soft, sparkling white with crystal and gem lighting and glass everywhere. It was so quiet. and clean. and sort of like the vision Hollywood gives us of Heaven..only without George Burns. oh yeah, and I forgot how beautiful (read:coiffed) everyone is in SF.  There was a fashionista wearing a navy blazer with a perfectly fitted stripy blouse with a pair those longish plain-front shorts in white with mile-long legs propped up on nude open-toed high-heeled sandals that had those laces which tied around her ankles. She looked like a young Christie Brinkley... and get this.. she smiled when she walked by and said \"hello\" even though I was not waiting for her in the lobby.

Sablog: A \"blog\" by Sabrina, age four. First manicure!
" "
 So, do you like your nails? Sabrina: \"Yeah.\" Why? Sabrina: \"Because they're pretty.\" What color are they? Sabrina: \"Purple with light pink. Bofe of them.\" [She cannot say her th's so \"both\" is \"bofe.\"] And who likes purple? Sabrina: \"Max does.\" And is that why you got purple? Sabrina: \"No.\" Why did you want me to polish your nails? Sabrina: \"Cause I wanted them to look beautiful. Abbie polishes her nails. She does. Don't you know that?\" I didn't know. Should we polish Max's nails, maybe? Sabrina: \"No. Because boys are a boy because, uh, they're taller than girls.\" What polish do you want to do next? Sabrina: \"Another pink that's darker. Yipppoooooo!\" After this blog was recorded, I was forced by Sabrina at watergun-point to drive her to Target and purchase glittery polish. Then she made me open the bottle and cover the purple polish with the glittery one right then and there. Uh-oh, I am in for it. BTW, there's still plenty of time to enter to win the  Pottery Barn Kids gift card .

 The Potion Maker squidium  is a milky, pasty opalescent gel created from the bones of a Snark. spanglemonkeyium  is a translucent, crumbly tan powder drawn from the bones of a bandersnatch. Mixing  squidium  with  spanglemonkeyium  causes a violent chemical reaction, producing a cloudy indigo potion which gives the user the power of acid-spitting.

WEDDING BELLES :)
" "
A very girly post today I am afraid. 
Missy and I have Anastasia's wedding to prepare for in Vienna. 
All I can say is ,'So many beautiful dresses and so little time and money to buy and wear them all'. 
 
This is a dress I am considering wearing . 
However, it would need a lot of taking in to wear it so I am not too sure. 
 
 
Now these are 2 dresses I have actually bought . 
The black dress is very 1940's and you all know how much of a fan I am of 1940's clothes. 
I shall wear this to dinner on the Saturday. 
 
 
The red dress I feel looks more 1950's and I also LOVE 1950's clothes. 
I shall be wearing this to Anastasia's Birthday dinner on the Friday evening. 
 
 
 
Now this is me trying on the red dress. 
 
 
And this is me trying on the black dress. 
 
 
 
Now this is a linen skirt that I bought from the Edinburgh Woolen Mill. 
It feels lovely to wear and I shall be wearing it on the Sunday to go for kaffee und kuchen (coffee and Cake) with all the family. 
 
 
 
And this I am considering buying from Debenhams. 
In fact I still have not decided on my Mother of the Bride Dress for the wedding on the 14th of April !!!!!! 
I think a trip to town is in order :) 
 
 
And this is Missy's beautiful dress that she will be wearing for the wedding. 
I am undecided as to what else she will wear but last summer Tesco had a wonderful half price sale on all clothes and   I bought Missy lots of summer dresses. 
 
 
 
 
And I still have the accessories to buy :)

The artist lives in Vancouver and is very talented.  Delphinium is my favorite flower, and its beauty if proof that God exists.  Lucky bees!  You an agnostic?  An atheist?  A Nietzsche Freak?  A Doubting Thomas?  Fear not!  Look upon the delphinium and your heart will know the truth. The blue shown here is my favorite color (I guess?  I also love baby pink, rose red, and jade green).  I painted Baby Benji’s room this color when he was born; actually, every boy of mine had a room this color at one point in his little darling life.  Just imagine a bellydance costume with these colors!  Actually, I have many of them already.  Maybe now I’ll make a delphinium blue bra top with pink and green beading and use the rose red petal skirt I already have (or the jade green one I just made!) and maybe I should now try to make a cabaret style belt with fringe, also in delphinium blue.  And then my hips have to heal, but how?  I can’t stop dancing.   It is like that girl with the red shoes in the fairly tale , except my feet are bare!

Not Alopecia - Trichotillomania!

[UPDATE:  Barbara  set me straight on the terminology.  It's not alopecia -- it's trichotillomania.  Two bonus syllables, even!] Joy's cute new haircut did not stop the hair-pulling. She's yanking it in clumps now.  It's her new favorite stimmy. Here's how it looks from the top: Any blogospheric wisdom would be appreciated.  Stocking cap?  Buzz cut?  Bald is beautiful?

"38890" "57" "http://susansenator.com/blog/2006/12/going-tribal/" "Going Tribal" "Ned’s father and stepmom bought me  this DVD for Chanukah .  They made an excellent choice!  I had just begun to think about Tribal belly dance, because the other night, my teacher was wearing tribal garb and it was very interesting.  She had on a metallic coin bra top, heavy eye makeup, and a long fringed and tassled hip belt over leggings.  So this is a very different look from the cabaret-style Egyptian belly dance costuming I’ve been into, which is more sequined and beaded and at times a bit garish.  The tribal thing is more ethnic and exotic.  It fits yet another side of me, because I happen to be rather ethnic myself!  Tribal is more focused on drum solos and a bit more infused with Eastern elements of yoga and spiritualism.  Okay by me.  I can use a little spiritualism/meditation, etc.  I watched the DVD and saw some extreme belly dance, performed by Rachel Brice.  She could do things with her different body parts that looked like a Disney nightmare of a belly dancer, almost as if her head were separate and floating above curling fingers, slithering waist, flipping belly.  I had to try it.  I took my laptop and DVD up to my bedroom and tried a little of it, but it was a bit uncomfortable because it was so hard to do!  So I knew I was hooked. This morning after everyone had gone I put on black leggings and black bra top and the silver belt made of tiny bells and blue beads that the boys had gotten me for my birthday.  Also the matching  silver and blue beaded slave bracelets  (one I had bought and one Ned had gotten me for Chanukah) I have ordered my own  silver coin top  and maybe I’ll get one of those tribal belts with the fringe!  But if I don’t, I can wear it with the beautiful green silk scarf or the boys’ belt.  So this morning, clothed in my tribal look, I practiced Rachel Brice’s 30 minute routine.  It starts with a whole yoga warmup, which I’ve never done, but I enjoyed and found pleasantly strenuous.  Then I learned how to do a hip lock, which is a hip lift that you cut off sharply, no extra movment (and as little jiggling as possible).  The non-jiggling is achieved, I realized, by lifting the torso/chest as high as you can and tucking the pelvis so that basically everything remains contracted except for the obliques which are lifting the hip.  This lifting also improves the look of everything, especially if you have a more meaty middle due to 1) your age; 2) your Eastern European roots and 3) having eaten like a pig while pregnant three times, and thereafter until you discovered Dr. Atkins.  So all day I’ve been trying to sit and stand like that, to build my core (so that I don’t get grossed out when I watch myself perform).  I felt a bit of that high, that belly dance high, when I caught a glimpse of myself doing the interior hip circle correctly — which is done only with ab muscles, not really hips at all!.  In a flatter, leaner stomach you can see the muscles switch sides as they expand and contract.  It is quite dramatic.  In my belly, you can see a shimmer of that happening.  Oh well, at least the piercing looks nice.  In time, however, I expect it will all look better, and come more easily.  And then I will perform.

Win a $100 Lands' End shopping spree...plus, introducing supermodels Max and Sabrina
" "
 
 
 
 
 
Sometimes, I enjoy buying the kids clothes more than I do for myself. This is  always  true of bathing suit shopping. Like, Max doesn't have any cellulite concerns whatsoever.   
 
 
 
Every spring, I stock up on swimwear from  Lands' End . This year, the company sent gear for the kids to model (for keeps), and also offered up a $100 Lands End giveaway for two readers. The swimwear fabric is great quality and doesn't pill; the styles are cute, colorful and comfortable; and there are a ton of tops and suits with UPF 50, recommended by The Skin Cancer Foundation as an effective UV protectant (basically, a great backup for sunscreen). Plus there's always some sort of sale happening. 
 
 
 
Miraculously, Max chose colors other than purple. However, he demanded a new Lightning McQueen remote control car as his fee. Sabrina asked if her photos could go on the Lands' End site, and while I couldn't arrange that, she loved her photo shoot. The only hiccup was when her agent demanded that she be provided with a limo fully stocked with cheese crackers and craft supplies, including glow-in-the-dark rubber bands. Also: Both kids would like to be known by their first names only, a la Gisele.

 RAIN BY Nguyen Nguyen        Well yesterday the forecast said rain so I suppose it is an improvement on what I expected. I feel like it is a rainy day anyway! Beauty was awake early and so she decided to watch Monsters Inc on the TV/Video and I caught up with the computer. I came across the shocking news of the death of an artist who worked at the Llanover Hall where I did my GCSE, this wonderful artist was  called Tony Goble. We weren't friends(hey he was a brilliant artist and I was a GCSE student) but it was always nice to chat to him when I went to my art classes and I cannot believe he has gone. I will miss him. Byzantine Birds\" by Tony Goble More about  Tony

Just to say that I am fine and well but not sleeping well. So I am constantly tired, hence  the no blog entry yesterday! Beauty went back to school today after what seemed like a really long weekend. I took her to the local garden centre yesterday because they had a fish shop(live fish-'fish are friends not food' kind of shop) and she loved it. We saw a clown fish and Beauty was quite happy to point out that the fish was called Nemo. Look at the picture that Fiona made for me, she is brilliant at Photoshop. She made it for my computer teacher who loves Dr Who and Torchwood Based  on the latest Dr Who episode.Captain Jack is back next week.........phwar!

YOU CAN'T BEAT FISH AND CHIPS
" "
Well.....I am cream crackered! Yesterday was the final day of preparation before Belle arrived with her young man from the south(the south of the USA that is).What didn't help was the fact that Beauty had been awake since 3.30am so I spent the day cleaning and feeling as if I was in an alternate universe-a kind of twilight zone. A day that had started with Barney, Numa Numa and hello kitty on the computer. Barney is becoming almost like a omnipresent Big Brother in this house. When I wake-there's Barney, when I sleep-there's Barney. I wouldn't be surprised one day to find him behind the checkout in Asda. We picked Belle and her Beau up at her fathers house and bought fish and chips and then came home and ate them in the garden, afterwards we watched Mermaids on video . Eating was a bit of a problem as Beauty has developed a liking for the batter on fish and will wander around expecting people to give her theirs , next time I shall buy her her own fi sh. She also likes the pastry on pies. I love Clark's pie and chips,  my per sonal heaven!

NEWS FLASH OF THE HUGE KIND!
" "
 Belle's Beau proposed and Belle said yes(after the squealing stopped!) at St Fagans. Belle is ecstatic and of course is walking on sunshine. Belle and Beau have permanent smiles on their faces.....they are happy, happy, happy. I asked Belle if I had enough time for Weight Watchers and she said December. Today Belle and her Beau have gone to Swansea to see where Belle went to University and to see all the sights of Swansea. Fiona returns today from Cult Camp in Far,Far Away so that will mean plenty of washing! Ariel still has over a week to go at Cub Camp so she will not return until B elle and her Beau have returned to the USA. My lovely bedroom. And here are pictures of the finished room! I think it looks brilliant, SnoWhite's young man gave me homemaking tips and said I needed to put chocol ates on the pillow for Belle and Beau.Thanks mate! Just for you Anastasia is the picture of Sno White's dress that she promised you, I will email the rest of the pictures and of course the other engagement pictures. Finally a picture that I took yesterday. It was taken just after one of the many rain showers that we had yesterday.

WE MAY BE GETTING BETTER
" "
Well I think that my sore throat may just be getting better. It didn't feel like it at 3am and 7am when my throat was so sore that I had to get up and drink a warm drink to make it feel better. But now Ariel seems to have started a sore throat. Oh dear, as long as everyone is ok for the wedding tomorrow. Beauty has an inset day so she is happily watching her BBC2 idents! Fiona is painting her bedroom..................PINK! Ariel is  sleeping-recovering from her final day at school-EVER. And Dimitri and Anastasia are happily shopping in town-AGAIN. I have spent the day resting, apart from feeding the dishwasher and the washing machine! Fiona will take my camera to the wedding so there will be lots of photos to see on Photobucket tomorrow night Belle.Love to Beau and Woody. Did you get the Woody picture? I will write again soon.

BEAUTY'S ROYAL WEDDING TEA PARTY :)
" "
A POSTCARD FROM HOME Today we had a tea party to celebrate the Royal Wedding. Beauty thoroughly enjoyed the cheese sandwiches :) And Fiona enjoyed making the cheese sandwiches ! Of course we had lots of Royal bunting. And here we have Fiona and Ariel who loved watching all the hats and dresses and Prince Harry ! They were both enthralled and they were quite regularly heard to exclaim 'oooooh' and 'ahhhhh' and 'oh so sweet' and 'Harry is the best Royal' :) We all of course LOVED the dress :) And the kisses xx Whilst Beauty was quite happy to watch the wedding (however briefly!) she was just as happy to play on the computer :) But for Beauty the refreshments were definitely an important part of the festivities. And this is the lovely Victoria sponge that Beauty helped to make and Fiona decorated :) It was a lovely wedding and we had a lovely tea party and it was a very special day :)

COMPLETE WITH PRESENTS. PONIES FOR BEAUTY AND SOAP FOR ME THIS IS MY FAVOURITE SOAP, ANASTASIA AND I WENT TO PARIS A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE BOUGHT THIS BEAUTIFUL SOAP IN A LITTLE SHOP ON THE CHAMPS ELYSEES AND FOR THE BIGGEST NEWS OF ALL..... YESTERDAY WE WENT TO ASDA AND BEAUTY SAW THIS DOLL, BABY BORN AND INSISTED WE BOUGHT IT. Beauty has been scared of dolls since she was tiny but she saw this doll and started singing the Baby Born song and insisted I buy her the doll. Beauty is odd when it comes to toys in a shop as usually she only wants to look and will not let me buy her anything BUT today was different. She played with her doll all evening with her pram that she had for Christmas. Huge progress. She even insisted on taking the doll to bed. However, at 2am she  awoke awoke and  checked her doll and found the dolls hat gone, screaming ensued until I found the hat and put it back on. Beauty was then awake for approximately 2 hours, singing and chatting. Perhaps I could Superglue the hat to Baby Born's head! I have taken it easy today on Beauty's number 2 day back at school and have contented myself with washing clothes and doing dishes, PLUS a nap.....well it had to be done!

I am from A Land where Roosters call at any hour and day breaks over and over again. I am from A Land of Peaches, sometimes sweet, sometimes a little rotten (though never to the core). I am from A land where the natives speak of durst and  someping , of  hitted  and  lemalade . I am from A land of tinker toy towers and houses made of sheets. I am from A land I built myself; a foreign place. Here I am.

It is 5:15am and I am awake again! I would rather be asleep but NO,my body has other ideas and so here I am  awake again at what is considered STUPID O'CLOCK when you do not have to be awake. Niamh was also awake during the night but she was happy enough to chat and sing to herself until she went back to sleep. She is a little sweetheart. It is her last but one day at school. Can you believe the LEA has them in school again on Monday and the teachers are being made to come in on Tuesday for an Inset day............now that is just plain mean on the teachers. Why not just have 2 inset days at the start of term? Last night I did something I haven't done in years. I went out Christmas shopping. Usually I buy all the presents a little at a time from September onwards but this year I have been so unwell that I have been going out as little as possible. So last night I went out with Runningman and bought all the presents that I still had to buy and now I just have the childminders presents to buy and a wedding present for a wedding that is happening over the Christmas holidays. AND I am considering doing a very large shop in the next few days using the ONLINE service and then going in just to buy a few things next week. I sound so organised but really I am too cream crackered to do anything else. People who LOVE TO SHOP must be very healthy and have a very strong constitution.

SUMMER IN THE CITY
" "
Yesterday Beauty spent equal time between destroying the lounge, playing the piano, playing in the garden, playing with the bead curtain by the back door, reading the telephone directory, performing acrobatics on the computer chair, watching videos and playing on the computer! We may not have gone far from the house yesterday but we certainly had a busy day. The parks in Cardiff are a nightmare during the holidays so that is definitely not an activity to embark on lightly, I tend to go in the evenings when the pace is more sedate. Roath park seems to be filled with older people taking their constitutional walks in the morning, hordes of children in the afternoon and a meeting place for Asian families in the evening, the evening is definitely the more pleasant choice for Beauty who is not too keen on lots of noise. The week that we  helped SnoWhite to move we passed Victoria Park a lot which was totally overflowing with children playing in the paddling pool and teenage girls trying to get a tan. Way too many people for me let alone Beauty. Last night I watched the film  The Pumpkin Eater,  it is a 1964 B&W Brit Flick, I haven't watched an old film for quite a while and I was surprised that I hadn't watched it before, it was a really good film. My parents loved the cinema and films and at home we watched all the films on TV, I especially liked the  Hammer Horror films.  Anastasia is also a film fan but she is not as keen as I am on certain  action films as she has to look away at the violence. SnoWhite also likes films but is not too keen on anything involving spiders and bugs of any kind, she is especially not too keen on  The Mummy  films due to the bugs running around. She will watch the film however as she loves the prison warden played by  Omid Djalli, I agree with SnoWhite that he is one of the funniest men on screen.             I also think that  Oded Fehr  who plays Ardeth Bay in The Mummy films is worth watching the films for. Oded Fehr

							what siblings would like parents and service providers to know					" "* Once in a rare while a post just writes itself. Or, even better, is beautifully written by someone else and then sent to me on a silver platter. I get to copy and paste and then sit on my duff (or more accurately move onto any one of the seven hundred and forty-three things on my to-do list), leaving you to read their thoroughly researched and incredibly insightful words.  Ed note: Trust me, this is a bonus. While I might periodically manage insightful, I think we can all agree I don’t ever do ‘thoroughly researched.’ In  Monday’s post , I linked to  The Sibling Support Project  in order to provide information about  how to find or start a local Sib Shop . I was delighted when I got a comment on that post from The Sibling Support Project’s very own Don Meyer. I replied to Don’s comment and thanked him for all that he does to support our fabulous siblings. He wrote back, and when he did he attached the following – a summary of responses from the now adult siblings of folks with special needs to the question,  “What would siblings like parents and service providers to know?” I couldn’t think of a better way to cap off the Spotlight on Siblings Week than to post this veritable gold mine of insight (and practical advice!) Don’s contact information and links to the  Sibling Support Project  are at the bottom of this post. Please check out the website and reach out to Don with any questions you may have about how to support siblings. Thank you, Don! ****** What Siblings Would Like Parents and Service Providers to Know In the United States, there are over 4.5 million people who have special health, developmental, and mental health concerns.  Most of these people have typically-developing brothers and sisters.  Brothers and sisters are too important to ignore, if for only these reasons: 
 These brothers and sisters      will be in the lives of family members with special needs longer than  anyone .  Brothers and sisters will be there after parents are      gone and special education services are a distant memory.  If they are provided with support      and information, they can help their sibs live dignified lives from      childhood to their senior years. 
 
 Throughout their lives,      brothers and sisters share many of the concerns that parents of children      with special needs experience, including isolation, a need for      information, guilt, concerns about the future, and caregiving      demands.  Brothers and sisters      also face issues that are uniquely theirs including resentment, peer      issues, embarrassment, and pressure to achieve. 
 Despite the important and life-long roles they will play in the lives of their siblings who have special needs, even the most family-friendly agencies often overlook brothers and sisters.  Brothers and sisters, often left in the literal and figurative waiting rooms of service delivery systems, deserve better.  True “family-centered” care and services will arrive when siblings are actively included in agencies’ functional definition of “family.” The Sibling Support Project facilitated a discussion on SibNet, its listserv for adult siblings of people with disabilities, regarding the considerations that siblings want from parents, other family members, and service providers.  Below is a discussion of themes discussed by SibNet members and recommendations from the Sibling Support Project: 
 The Right to One’s Own      Life.  Throughout their lives,      brothers and sisters may play many different roles in the lives of their      siblings who have special needs.       Regardless of the contributions they may make, the basic right of      siblings to their  own  lives must always be remembered.  Parents and service providers      should not make assumptions about responsibilities typically-developing      siblings may assume without a frank and open discussion.  “Nothing about us without us”— a      phrase popular with self-advocates who have disabilities — applies to      siblings as well.       Self-determination, after all, is for everyone — including brothers      and sisters. 
 Acknowledging      Siblings’ Concerns.  Like parents, brothers and      sisters will experience a wide array of often ambivalent emotions      regarding the impact of their siblings’ special needs.  These feelings should be both      expected and acknowledged by parents and other family members and service      providers.  Because most      siblings will have the longest-lasting relationship with the family member      who has a disability, these concerns will change over time.  Parents and providers would be      wise to learn more about siblings’ life-long and ever-changing concerns. 
 Expectations for      Typically-Developing Siblings.  Families      need to set high expectations for all their children.  However, some typically-developing      brothers and sisters react to their siblings’ disability by setting      unrealistically high expectations for themselves — and some feel they must      somehow compensate for their siblings’ special needs.  Parents can help their      typically-developing children by conveying clear expectations and      unconditional support. 
 Expect Typical      Behavior From Typically-Developing Siblings.  Although difficult for parents to watch, teasing, name-calling,      arguing and other forms of conflict are common among most brothers and      sisters -– even when one has special needs.  While parents may be appalled at siblings’ harshness      toward one another, much of this conflict can be a beneficial part of      normal social development.  A      child with Down syndrome who grows up with siblings with whom he sometimes      fights will likely be better prepared to face life in the community as an      adult than a child with Down syndrome who grows up as an only child.  Regardless of how adaptive or      developmentally appropriate it might be, typical sibling conflict is more      likely to result in feelings of guilt when one sibling has special health      or developmental needs.  When      conflict arises, the message sent to many brothers and sisters is, “Leave      your sibling alone.  You are      bigger, you are stronger, you should know better. It is your job to      compromise.”       Typically-developing siblings deserve a life where they, like other      children, sometimes misbehave, get angry, and fight with their siblings. 
 Expectations for the      Family Member with Special Needs.  When      families have high expectations for their children who have special needs,      everyone will benefit.  As      adults, typically-developing brothers and sisters will likely play      important roles in the lives of their siblings who have disabilities.  Parents can help siblings now by      helping their children who have special needs acquire skills that will      allow them to be as independent as possible as adults.  To the extent possible, parents      should have the same expectations for the child with special needs      regarding chores and personal responsibility as they do for their      typically-developing children.       Not only will similar expectations foster independence, it will      also minimize the resentment expressed by siblings when there are two sets      of rules — one for them, and another for their sibs who have special      needs. 
 The Right to a Safe      Environment.   Some siblings live      with brothers and sisters who have challenging behaviors.  Other siblings assume      responsibilities for themselves and their siblings that go beyond their      age level and place all parties in vulnerable situations.  Siblings deserve to have their own      personal safety given as much importance as the family member who has      special needs. 
 Opportunities to Meet      Peers.  For most parents, the      thought of “going it alone,” raising a child with special needs without      the benefit of knowing another parent in a similar situation would be      unthinkable.  Yet, this      routinely happens to brothers and sisters.  Sibshops, listservs such as SibNet and SibKids, and      similar efforts offer siblings the common-sense support and validation      that parents get from Parent-to-Parent programs and similar programs.  Brothers and sisters — like      parents — like to know that they are not alone with their unique joys and      concerns. 
 Opportunities to      Obtain Information.  Throughout their lives, brothers and sisters have an ever-changing      need for information about their sibling’s disability, and its treatment      and implications.  Parents  and  service providers have an      obligation to proactively provide siblings with helpful information.  Any agency that represents a      specific disability or illness and prepares materials for parents and      other adults should prepare materials for siblings and young readers as      well. 
 Sibs’ Concerns about      the Future.  Early in life, many brothers      and sisters worry about what obligations they will have toward their      sibling in the days to come.       Ways parents can reassure their typically-developing children are      to make plans for the future of their children with special needs, involve      and listen to their typically-developing children as they make these      plans, consider backup plans, and know that siblings’ attitude toward the      extent of their involvement as adults may change over time.   When brothers and sisters      are “brought into the loop” and given the message early that they have      their parents’ blessing to pursue their dreams, their future involvement      with their sibling will be a choice instead of an obligation.  For their own good and for the      good of their siblings who have disabilities, brothers and sisters should      be afforded the right to their own lives.  This includes having a say in whether and how they will      be involved in the lives of their siblings who have disabilities as      adults, and the level, type, and duration of involvement. 
 Including Both Sons      and Daughters .  Just as daughters      are usually the family members who care for aging parents, adult sisters      are usually the family members who look after the family member with      special needs when parents no longer can.  Serious exploration of sharing responsibilities among      siblings — including brothers — should be considered. 
 Communication.  While good communication between parents and children      is always important, it is especially important in families where there is      a child who has special needs.       An evening course in active listening can help improve      communication among all family members, and books, such as  How to Talk      So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk  and  Siblings Without   Rivalry  (both by Adele Faber and      Elaine Mazlich) provide helpful tips on communicating with children. 
 One-on-One time with      Parents.   Children need to know from their      parents’ deeds and words that their parents care about them as      individuals.  When parents      carve time out of a busy schedule to grab a bite at a local burger joint      or window shop at the mall with their typically-developing children, it      conveys a message that parents “are there” for them as well and provides      an excellent opportunity to talk about a wide range of topics. 
 Celebrate Every      Child’s Achievements and Milestones.  Over the years, we’ve met siblings whose parents did not attend      their high school graduation — even when their children were      valedictorians — because the parents were unable to leave their child with      special needs.  We’ve also met      siblings whose wedding plans were dictated by the needs of their sibling who      had a disability.  One child’s      special needs should not overshadow another’s achievements and      milestones.  Families who seek      respite resources, strive for flexibility, and seek creative solutions can      help assure that the accomplishments of all family members are celebrated. 
 Parents’ Perspective is      More Important than the Actual Disability .  Parents would be wise to remember that the parents’      interpretation of their child’s disability will be a greater influence on      the adaptation of their typically developing sibling than the actual      disability itself.  When      parents seek support, information, and respite for themselves, they model      resilience and healthy attitudes and behaviors for their      typically-developing children. 
 Include Siblings in      the Definition of “Family.”   Many educational, health      care, and social service agencies profess a desire to offer      family-centered services but continue to overlook the family members who      will have the longest-lasting relationship with the person who has the      special needs — the sisters and brothers.  When brothers and sisters receive the considerations      and services they deserve, agencies can claim to offer “family-centered”—      instead of “parent-centered”— services. 
 Actively Reach Out to      Brothers and Sisters.    Parents and agency personnel      should consider inviting (but not requiring) brothers and sisters to      attend informational, IEP, IFSP, and transition planning meetings, and      clinic visits.  Siblings      frequently have legitimate questions that can be answered by service providers.  Brothers and sisters also have      informed opinions and perspectives and can make positive contributions to      the child’s team. 
 Learn More About Life      as a Sibling.   Anyone interested in      families ought to be interested in siblings and their concerns.  Parents and providers can learn      more about “life as a sib” by facilitating a Sibshop, hosting a sibling      panel, or reading books by and about brothers and sisters.  Guidelines for conducting a      sibling panel are available from the Sibling Support Project and in the      Sibshop curriculum.  Visit the      Sibling Support Project’s website for a bibliography of sibling-related      books. 
 Create Local Programs      Specifically for Brothers and Sisters.   If your community has a Parent-to-Parent      Program or similar parent support effort, a fair question to ask is: why      isn’t there a similar effort for the brothers and sisters?  Like their parents, brothers and      sisters benefit from talking with others who “get it.”  Sibshops and other programs for      preschool, school-age, teen, and adult siblings are growing in      number.  The Sibling Support      Project, which maintains a database of over 200 Sibshops and other sibling      programs, provides training and technical assistance on how to create      local programs for siblings. 
 Include Brothers and      Sisters on Advisory Boards and in Policies Regarding Families.    Reserving board seats for siblings will give      the board a unique, important perspective and reflect the agency’s concern      for the well-being of brothers and sisters.  Developing policies based on the important roles played      by brothers and sisters will help assure that their concerns and      contributions are a part of the agency’s commitment to families. 
 Fund      Services for Brothers and Sisters .  No classmate in an inclusive classroom will have a      greater impact on the social development of a child with a disability than      brothers and sisters will.       They will be their siblings’ life-long “typically developing role      models.”  As noted earlier,      brothers and sisters will likely be in the lives of their siblings longer      than anyone — longer than their parents and certainly longer than any      service provider.  For most      brothers and sisters, their future and the future of their siblings with      special needs are inexorably entwined.  Despite this, there is little funding to support      projects that will help brothers and sisters get the information, skills      and support they will need throughout their lives.  Governmental agencies would be      wise to invest in the family members who will take a personal      interest in the well-being of people with disabilities and advocate for them      when their parents no longer can.       As one sister wrote:       “We will become caregivers for our siblings when our parents no      longer can.  Anyone interested      in the welfare of people with disabilities ought to be interested in us.” 
 The Sibling Support Project.  All rights reserved. About the Sibling Support Project The Sibling Support Project, believing that disabilities, illness, and mental health issues affect the lives of all family members, seeks to increase the peer support and information opportunities for brothers and sisters of people with special needs — and to increase parents’ and providers’ understanding of sibling issues. Our mission is accomplished by training local service providers on how to create Sibshops (lively community-based for school-age brothers and sisters); hosting workshops, listservs, and websites for young and adult siblings; and increasing parents’ and providers’ awareness of siblings’ unique, life-long, and ever-changing concerns through workshops, websites, and written materials. Based in Seattle since 1990, the Sibling Support Project is a national effort dedicated to the interests of over six million brothers and sisters of people with special health, mental health and developmental needs. For more information about Sibshops, sibling issues, and our workshops, listservs and publications, contact:

Help change other parents' perceptions of special needs: Take this important survey
" "
 
 
 
 
Ever feel that fellow parents have no idea of what your life
is like as the mom of a kid with special needs, for better or worse? Here's
your chance to help. 
 
 
 
For a major story in Parents' magazine spring 2014 issue,
they're conducting a survey of two groups of moms: those whose children have
special needs and those who do not.  
 
 
 
The editors are looking closely at both groups' attitudes about
the issue of special needs, particularly how they affect our children socially
and in school. They also want to better understand how both groups of moms
understand and relate to one another. The ultimate goal is empathy and
understanding, which of course will benefit all kids (and us moms). 
 
 
 
The survey should take about 30 minutes and includes
open-ended questions, which means you get to express your opinions and
describe your experiences in detail. 
 
 
 
Just a few requirements from the Parents peeps: 
 
• Moms
only, please, ages 18 to 65 
 
• Your
child with special needs must be between 3 to 12 years of age. (If you have other
children outside that range, that's fine.) 
 
• You
cannot take the survey if you work in the fields of education, healthcare or
pharmaceuticals (because several survey questions touch on those topics). 
 
 
 
The survey is open through Sunday, October 27;  click to take the one for parents of kids with special needs . (The survey for the other group of moms is done.)

 Whenever I went out with my autistic son, I frequently felt like I wasn’t wanted and didn’t belong. This was particularly true of playgroups and playgrounds.  Other adults and children would steer clear of us, despite my best efforts to make us appear welcoming and non-threatening. But that’s hard when your child hums and rocks and doesn’t play, act or talk like the other kids. I did though feel welcome and understood, when I started being in situations with special needs children and their parents. Even when our children didn’t have the same condition and challenges, we had all been through similar trials. We’re all extra patient, we know we don’t have to constantly apologise and explain to each other our children’s unusual language and behaviours. Now that my eldest is attending school, I spend more time alone with my youngest (who doesn’t have any special needs). Today I took him on two outings, to two local playgrounds. He did what normal children did, and so did all the other children at these playgrounds. I spoke to the other parents, and we talked about normal things, “what’s your daughter’s name, how old is she, oh she has lovely hair…”. At first I felt like an imposter, pretending I wasn’t a mother of a special needs child. But gradually I slipped into the role and got the hang of it, and even started to quite enjoy it. I felt like shouting, “hey look at us, we’re normal!” No one was avoiding me or my son, if anything they were actively engaging with us, in a way I’d never really experienced with my eldest because his behaviour scares people off. Whereas I once felt like I belonged nowhere, I now oddly feel like I belong everywhere. I am a mother of a special needs child. I am a mother of a child without special needs. I’ve had the usual concerns for a normally developing child, and the usual concerns for a seriously developmentally delayed child. I am usual! I haven’t yet felt like these two mothering worlds are integrated; when I’m out with both children I have to of necessity, resort to a mother of a special needs child because the eldest requires so much extra attention and care to avoid outing-ending meltdowns. I suspect as my mothering life progresses, that I won’t notice the differences so much, but for now I am keenly aware of it and of how people treat me differently depending on which child is with me.

As the parent of a child with a disability or special needs, what type of stories or resources are you most interested in? Are there areas that you feel haven't received adequate attention or dialogue? Is there a taboo topic you'd like discussed? 
 
 
 
 
Please help me ensure that BLOOM is covering issues related to parenting kids with disabilities that matter most to you as parents – and which can assist the professionals working with our kids.

 Parents: What Does Your Heart Want? I have recently encountered a large dose of context regarding what constitutes a \"difficult\" life with special needs kids. This context--which is confidential--makes me renewedly grateful for Leelo's abundant support, and broken-hearted for those families overwhelmed by stress while underwhelmed by resources. I do wonder how our new SpEd PTA can best support such families in our community, especially those who need help but don't know how to ask for it, those for whom asking is painful, those who aren't as concerned about the help their kids need as they perhaps should be. Might be time for me to join the Outreach committee. Parents: if someone was to offer your family a few hours of non-judgmental assistance, what would be your heart's deepest desire? And would you actually accept help, or would pride (or another emotion) get in the way? Comment anonymously if you like. Technorati Tags:  parenting ,  special needs parenting

			 Yesterday I attended the first  family-centered  support group meeting for ASD families in southern Oregon. I’ve previously attended other support groups for parents, and they were always welcoming, but I felt like something was missing. I would leave without feeling better than when I had arrived. It wasn’t the type of support group I was looking for. 
 This one yesterday was different. It was so affirming to have the kids there. The parents, the ASD kids, and the siblings all there, all interacting – it just felt right. I met other parents also at the teen stage as well as others just starting out. The level of understanding was inherent, as was the bond. I saw tiredness on some of their faces, and stress. But I also saw hope. 
 And the hope was there because the older kids were there. I saw some young parents watching Nigel, and that gave me a sense of pride.  Because I know how far he’s come.  I still have many concerns about the future, of course. But if Nigel, just as he is, can give some young parents hope for their child’s development, that’s something. That’s really something. 
 I did the same thing when I went to  the autism and puberty seminar  that I attended in October. One of the presenters at the seminar was a higher-functioning autistic adult. All the parents were rapt as we listened to her, watched her, absorbed her. She was  hope  to us, those of us with teens. She patiently answered questions, related stories of her childhood and teenage years, what she had been like. We all wanted to know when she had started talking so that we could compare that to our own children’s past development, and look ahead to how far  she  progressed, thinking that the potential was there for our kids. Of course, there are no guarantees, and we know that. But still. We hope. 
 If you ever have the opportunity to attend a seminar where an autistic adult will be presenting, I encourage you to do so. You will come away with a sense of understanding that you couldn’t possibly get from reading a book. You can’t look at that person and think,  That’s what my kid could be like . But looking at them and just  experiencing  their presence will give you hope. And we could all use a little more of that.

Atlantic Guest Columnist Breaks Autism Taboo, Discusses Economic Impact of Autism on Families
" "
 
 
 
 
 
Atlantic guest columnist  Laura McKenna  breaks a major autism taboo by discussing the impact of autism in families, more specifically  The Economic Impact of Autism on Families . This could be a real shock to those who feel that parents should have no input into discussions about autism generally and to those who want to prattle endlessly about the joys of autism as an alternative way of thinking. McKenna speaks very candidly about some harsh realities facing parents of autistic children: 
 
 
 
 
 
 \"However, once the parent overcomes that grieving process, they have to endure a lifetime of smaller cuts. The therapy, which is so necessary for the child's success, is very expensive. Parents will fight insurance companies and school districts to cover the costs. Often, they are unsuccessful, and they must deplete family bank accounts. They face hostile school districts and community members who accuse the family of stealing their children's money. Families become drained both emotionally and financially.  
 
 
 
 Working on their children's behalf becomes a full-time job. One parent, often the mother, either stops working or works less hours,  in order to manage the educational and therapy of the child. She must shuttle the child long distances to find the right services. She must navigate the health care bureaucracy.

I recommend this article for anyone who is looking for a complete understanding of the realities of autism disorders and how they affect all of us, the diagnosed individual, the community, society and .... families with autistic children.

ISBN 978-1-59030-753-3. pap. $16.95. PSYCH “When a child is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), parents often lose themselves in the overwhelming task of caring for their child to the detriment of themselves, their marriage, and their other children. The parent of three boys (one of whom who has ASD), Senator knows about these pitfalls firsthand and here encourages other parents to strike a healthy balance in their lives. She addresses topics such as feelings of despair and hopelessness when dealing with ASD, nurturing and sustaining one’s marriage, accepting the child with ASD while remaining open to new treatments, adolescence and ASD, and looking forward to the child’s adulthood.  VERDICT Senator’s message of a balanced life is valid and empowering at any point in a family’s journey with ASD. A great read. “—Lisa M. Jordan, Johnson Cty. Lib., KS yay!

Is Anyone Open to and Autism Adoption?
" "
I thought I would put this out to my readers: 
 
 I hope this e-mail finds you well.  I am writing because I am actively looking for a home for 3 year old “Sam”.  Sam was adopted from Russia in 2006, at the age of 13 months.  Sadly, his placement is not working out and I must find him a new family. 
 
Sam has been diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder and he shows signs of having an autism spectrum disorder, although this is not yet confirmed.  Sam can be a very challenging little boy who is sometimes loving, but often prone to tantrums.  He would do best in a home with no other children or older children, and a parent or parents who feel called to adopt a special needs child. 
If you think you might be the right parents for this little boy, contact me and I will get you in touch with his adoption agency.

We asked Barbara Fishbein-Germon, social worker in Holland Bloorview's child development program, to answer this question about siblings. 
 
 Q. I'm wondering how to best support my daughters (who have very different abilities) in having a meaningful and equal sibling relationship? 
 
 A. Barbara Fishbein-Germon:  This is a wonderful question.  
 
There are many ways that this parent can support his or her children to have meaningful relationships. I think the first thing to do is to try to think of activities they can all do together. This can take creativity on the part of parents and children and may vary depending on the needs of the child with different abilities. Many activities can be adapted and many programs are designed to include the entire family. 
 
If your child uses a wheelchair, how about a visit to the accessible  Windreach Farm ? Your kids can pet the farm animals, take a trail walk, go for a wagon ride, and at this time of the year -- Meet Santa! Swimming is a fun activity to do as a family. Holland Bloorview offers  two nights  and one weekend swim for families in our heated pool. Both of your children can attend an integrated camp -- like our  Spiral Garden  program, which is run by artists. Many of our Centre for the Arts programs are open to children with and without disabilities. The Geneva Centre has a  movie night  that is free for everyone and accommodates children with autism. Contact the Geneva Centre to find out about movies in the New Year. 
 
When one child has a disability, I think it's important that parents foster a culture of accepting difference. Starting early, you can find lots of books that celebrate all kinds of differences related to cultures, families and abilities. 
 
I encourage parents to be open with siblings about their child's condition, strengths and challenges. It can be helpful to bring siblings to a few medical and therapy appointments because brothers and sisters can feel left out when not included. Also, without information, siblings may develop fears about the unknown.  
 
Don't forget when coming to Holland Bloorview that our  Ronald McDonald Playroom  is open to children with and without disabilities aged 2 1/2 and up. This can be useful if you need to speak with a doctor or therapist on your own, want to look something up in our  Family Resource Centre , or just want a coffee break! 
 
Try to balance the time and attention you give each of your children. Kids need individual attention with their parents, so plan special outings with each child. 
 
By developing a circle of support around your child with disability, you will have people who can support you in meeting both of your children's needs. For example, a member of your support network may offer to take care of your child with disability so you can have a special afternoon with your other child. The support network is also there to help your child with disability develop friendships and interests because each child needs friends and activities separate from their sibling. You can learn more about support networks by calling Holland Bloorview's warmline: 1-877-463-0365. Don't forget to ask about sibling panels offered through Holland Bloorview's family education workshops. 
 
When someone offers to help -- whether through babysitting or cooking -- accept the offer! 
 
Your daughter without disability may benefit from talking to other children who have siblings with disabilities.  The Young Carers Program  offers weekly, drop in and special events for children involved in caring for a brother or sister. Many of the programs are fun and include acting, cooking, photography and art.  
 
 The Sibling Support Project  also offers many valuable resources, including the opportunity to connect online or at events with other siblings. 
 
This earlier BLOOM article looked at some of the common issues facing siblings:  'What about me? Aren't I special?' 
 
Thanks for your question!

If you feel torn between accepting your child with autism and treating them, there is no need for you to. That’s right; you do not have to choose between accepting your child who has autism and treating their autism. You can do both. I repeat: You can fully accept your child with autism AND you can treat your child’s autism without in any way diminishing your acceptance of or respect for your child.

You should unconditionally love and wholly accept your child who has autism simply because he or she is your child. As parents, we love and embrace the children we have been blessed with because that’s what parents do. As parents of children who have autism, we must acknowledge that autism is a part of who our children are and that autism will affect them, us, and other loved ones… because that is our reality. Our children are who they are, and their autism is an important element of who they are. We must accept them for who they are and support them as best as we can.

It is your right, privilege, responsibility and obligation to make decisions that are in your child’s best interest. If you are researching and implementing therapies, treatments and other interventions that you believe will be beneficial to your child and will help them to lead a productive, meaningful and fulfilling life with the greatest degree of dignity and independence possible, then you are doing the right thing.

I implore you to avoid feeling compelled to choose between accepting your child and treating your child. You don’t have to; you don’t need to; and you shouldn’t. Rather than choose sides, choose to accept your child for who he or she is and to help him or her reach their full potential.

I get heartsick each time I hear parents of special needs children talk about how isolated they feel. If you have a friend or acquaintance with a special needs child, please believe that they could use your support no matter how competent and independent they may seem, how much help you think they already have, and despite how uncomfortable you may feel in asking. Many parents of special needs kids experience social attrition after their child is diagnosed, and become even more isolated if their child cannot tolerate the family's former social schedule. Sometimes an email, or a phone call and a non-judgmental ear is all that is needed; sometimes parents really do need more than that. A few months ago, I wondered why I hadn't heard from a good friend for three days. When she finally surfaced, it turns out that she had had a 48-hour migraine and that her husband had been running herd alone for most of the weekend. I sobbed when she told me -- I would have been there, would have taken the kids, would have brought over dinner -- had I known. But I understand why she didn't reach out. Sometimes, we know that our support community of special needs families is already so stretched that we don't feel we can ask for more than we already have. Some of our kids are really, really challenging and cannot be foisted off on a $5/hour teenager, no matter how much we need to go grocery shopping or spend thirty minutes sitting quietly in a poop-smell-free corner. We would hire more help if we could, but  outside care for special needs kids can be expensive, and competent caregivers hard to find , even for those who can afford them. And some of us don't even want to be away from our children -- we just want more company when we're with them. If you don't know what to do, how to approach, ask. We parents of special needs kids can be very thick-skinned, and I at least don't mind any questions rooted in good intentions. Ask your friends if they need any help. Ask how to interact with our children, how to make them blossom, how you can learn to love our children with this fierceness that would make a mama bear recoil. Let your friends know that you are there for them, should they ever need your help. Don't wait until they reach out. They may be too embarrassed, too overwhelmed, or too depressed to ask themselves. Sometimes just knowing the support is there, should they need it, can make a huge difference in attitude. P.S. I find it helpful to remember that quirky kids often have quirky parents.

			 Meatballs 
 
 1 lb lean ground beef 1/2 cup chopped rolled oats 2 tbsp potato starch 1 tsp finely chopped parsley 2 tbsp minced onion 1 large clove minced garlic 1 large egg salt and pepper or Adobo to taste 
 Mix ingredients thoroughly in a large bowl, form into tbsp-sized balls, lay out on greased sheetpan or Pyrex dish, bake at 400 degrees for fifteen minutes before putting the potatoes in. Teeny-Tiny Potatoes 1 bag Teeny-Tiny Potatoes, rinsed and patted dry 1 pat butter (about 2 tsp) 1 clove minced garlic the leaves from about a 2-inch sprig of fresh rosemary, stripped off and minced finely salt and fresh-ground rainbow peppercorns to taste 
 Mince the garlic and rosemary together, then cut them both into the butter and rub the bottom of a glass baking dish with the mixture. Rub the rest over the outsides of the potatoes and put them in the oven with the meatballs. Bake both for thirty minutes (the meatballs for a total of forty-five minutes) at 400 degrees. 
    When they're done, the outsides of the meatballs will be sizzly and crisp, and when you take the teeny-tiny potatoes out they'll squeak and their skins will wrinkle up. We had both with steamed broccoli. 
    Or at least Hotter, Big Child and I did. I don't know why I don't just serve the Littles yogurt, toast, and apple slices to begin with.

Tonight's dinner guests loved tonight's Vegetarian Chinese Hot-and-Sour Soup so much that I felt I should share the recipe. Either that, or they asked me for the recipe and I'm always up for repurposing significant typing efforts. Here is the pork-riddled, complex multi-mushroom-rehydrating, nasty canned bamboo shoots-containing Epicurious recipe I bastardized, and which Epicurious/Gourmet had already \"adapted\" from Bruce Cost: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chinese-Hot-and-Sour-Soup-231354 And here is what we actually ate: Simplified Though Scrumptious Vegetarian Chinese Hot-and-Sour Soup Makes four large or six/eight small servings. INGREDIENTS * 4 medium fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps thinly sliced * 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch * 2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar * 2 tablespoons rice vinegar (not seasoned) * 1 tablespoon soy sauce * 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar * 1 teaspoon kosher salt (Michael, if you are reading this, I now own a three-pound box) * 2 tablespoons peanut oil * 4 cups vegetable broth (I used Better than Bouillon) * 1 block firm tofu, rinsed and drained, then cut into 2-inch by 1/4-inch-thick strips * 2 large eggs * 2 teaspoons roasted sesame oil * 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper (Aiiigh! You can see the pepper but you saved $10 because you didn't buy white peppercorns!) * 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallion greens * 2 tablespoons fresh whole cilantro leaves SPECIFICS Stir together 1/4 cup broth with cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside. Stir together vinegars, soy sauce, sugar, and salt in another small bowl. Heat a wok over high heat until a bead of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact. Pour peanut oil down side of wok, then swirl oil, tilting wok to coat sides. Add  mushrooms and stir-fry 1 minute. Add broth and bring to a boil, then add tofu. Return to a boil and add vinegar mixture. Stir cornstarch mixture, then add to broth and return to a boil, stirring. (Liquid will thicken.) Reduce heat to moderate and simmer 1 minute. Beat eggs with a fork and add a few drops of sesame oil. Add eggs to soup in a thin stream, stirring slowly in one direction with a spoon. Stir in pepper, cilantro, and scallions, then drizzle in remaining sesame oil and divide among 6 to 8 small bowls. NOM NOM good on a cold January evening. Enjoy!

(Or, From one jar of olives, two very different kinds of sandwiches)" "Are you getting tired of the same-old same-old for lunch? Had too much holiday leftovers? Here’s a lovely change of pace, especially for all you bread and cheese lovers out there: three very easy and quick recipes for two sandwiches and a soup! A plate with half a grilled pimento-cheese sandwich, cream-cheese & olive spread on a Dutch rusk (toast), and a bowl of tomato soup garnished with croutons and shredded Parmesan cheese. In the background are containers of cream-cheese & olive spread , pimento-cheese spread, and a container of Dutch rusks.   “Salad olives” is the common labeling (in the US) of jars of sliced green Spanish olives stuffed with pimentos.These olives are great for adding to potato salad, and of course, making cream cheese & olive sandwiches. CREAM CHEESE & OLIVE SANDWICH FILLING Scoop some cream cheese or Neufchatel into the mixer bowl, and add half that quantity of well-drained salad olives. Blend well, and spread on bread or crackers. It’s kind of a given that as a result from the slicing during processing, one ends up with a whole bunch of pimentos that have escaped their green olive rings. And you know what that means? You don’t have to buy a jar of pimentos to make pimento-cheese spread! PIMENTO-CHEESE SPREAD Dump about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese (that’s two or three handfuls) into the mixer bowl, and add about a fourth that quantity of well-drained pimentos, about as much mayonnaise as pimentos, and a dash of cayenne pepper. Blend well, and spread on bread or crackers. Great as a filling for grilled-cheese sandwiches. A cutting board with diced bread sprinkled with herbs. In the background is the jar of herbs, can of vegetable oil spray, and a loaf of home-made bread with a couple more slices cut. CROUTONS I made a loaf of bread the other day, but when I stuck it back in the breadbox, forgot to set it sliced-side down. So my first slice was rather dry. “Croutons!” said I, and diced the bread, then gave the pieces a quick hit of vegetable oil no-stick spray, and sprinkling of mixed Italian herbs. I dropped the croutons into a baking pan into the oven to bake while I made some tomato soup. TOMATO SOUP Dump one can petite-diced tomatoes and one can tomato sauce into a pot. Add a dash each of Sriracha and Worchestershire sauces, and half a teaspoon of dried basil (a whole teaspoon of minced if you’re so fortunate as to have fresh basil on hand), plus a dash of black (or white) pepper. Bring to a simmer. Remove from heat, and before eating, stir in a bit of milk. Serve garnished with croutons and shredded Parmesan, as desired.

 Chicken Crack Salad 
 
 One of the Iron Gate moms made this salad for us last week. It was so fricking good that I harbored many evil thoughts about hiding the leftovers from my mom and Seymour--and I don't even  like  chicken! I did resort to eating straight from the open leftovers container when I knew they were watching, but since the salad is so obscenely delicious they were not dissuaded, and laid claim to their portions. Sigh. Guess I'll just have to make more. For now I'll just share it with the world!
 Curried Chicken Salad 
  
 3 whole (6 split) chicken breasts, bone in, skin on
 Olive oil
 Kosher salt
 Freshly ground black pepper
 1 1/2 cups good mayo
 1/3 cup dry white wine
 1/4 cup Major Grey's chutney
 3 Tbs. Curry powder
 1 cup medium diced celery ( 2 large stalks)
 1/4 cup diced scallions, white and green parts (2 scallions)
 1/4 cup raisins
 1 cup whole roasted, salted cashews
  
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
 Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub the skin with olive oil. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the meat from the bones, discard skin, and dice the chicken in large bite-size pieces.
  
 For the dressing, combine the mayo, wine, chutney, curry powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a food processor. Process until smooth.
  
 Combine chicken with enough dressing to moisten well. Add the celery, scallions, and raisins, and mix well. Refrigerate for a few hours to allow flavors to blend. Add the cashews and serve at room temperature.

If you achieve the same alchemy I did, this meal will make you weep with joy. Prep and cooking were made even easier by the right equipment -- a razor-sharp ceramic knife (birthday gift), a well-seasoned cast iron skillet (inherited), and an  Italian pasta pot  (the kind with the strainer inside the pot, gift from my brother when he lived in Vicenza). An efficient setup means less to clean up afterward -- but anyone you invite to eat this will be in your thrall, so you can always command them to do the dishes. 
 
 Chanterelle Cream Sauce Pasta, plus Collards With Bacon Drippings 
 Sauce adapted from  Earthy.com's Creamy Chanterelle Sauce recipe 
 
Ingredients 
 1 bunch collard greens, washed and cut horizontally across rib into 1/2 inch wide ribbons 
 3 strips thick-sliced bacon  
 2 tbsp butter 
 1/2 to 1 pound fresh Chanterelle mushrooms, sliced (leave small ones whole) 
 1 medium onion, chopped 
 1/3 cup heavy cream 
 1/3 cup brandy 
 1 cup chicken stock 
 Salt  
 Pepper 
 Chopped fresh flat leaf parsley 
 1 lb farfalle or other dried pasta 
 Process 
 In a heavy skillet, cook bacon low and slow until crispy but not burnt. Turn off heat. 
 Set bacon aside on grease-absorbing substrate of choice. 
 Leave skillet with bacon grease and drippings on stove. You'll come back to it. 
 Start heating pasta water.  
 Melt the butter in a separate, non-bacony skillet over medium high heat. 
 Add the mushrooms and the onion to the skillet. Sauté over medium-high heat until the mushrooms begin to brown and most of the liquid has reduced (~10 minutes). 
 Add dried pasta to boiling pasta water.  
 Add the cream and brandy to the mushrooms, then whisk in the chicken stock. 
 Boil this mixture until thickened almost to a sauce consistency, about 8 minutes.  
 Strain cooked pasta and place in large serving bowl. If you cooked it in an Italian pasta pot, put the strainer back in the water and keep it on simmer. If not, bring another pasta-pot sized batch of water to boil. 
 Toss pasta with cream sauce. Season to taste with salt and freshly-ground pepper. 
 Crumble bacon and sprinkle over top of pasta, followed by parsley. 
 Turn heat for bacon-grease-and-drippings-holding skillet back on, to medium 
 Put collards in boiling water to blanch (30 seconds at most) 
 Strain collards, place in bacon-drippings skillet and toss, scraping pan to lightly coat with bacon bits and drippings (you might need to remove some of the grease beforehand). 
 Serve pasta with collards on the side, wearing a self-satisfied grin. 
 P.S. No, Leo did not eat this. But his sisters inhaled it.

 2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum 
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest 
 1 cup brown rice flour 
 1/2 cup potato flour 
 1/4 cup tapioca flour 
 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) coconut oil (I started using coconut oil because Little Child was allergic to the dairy protein molecule as a grub and still use it in a lot of baked goods because of the excellent flavor and texture it gives them) 
 2/3 cup sugar 
 2 tablespoons agave nectar 
 2 large eggs 
 1 1/2 cup very mashed ripe bananas (about 2 medium bananas) 
 up to 1/2 cup nuts, if you want (I skipped it, because times is tight) Blend all dry ingredients except sugar. Cream coconut oil, sugar, and agave nectar together with lemon zest, then add the dry mix, then the eggs, mixing as you go. 
 Figure One:  I finally cracked (SEE WHAT I DID THERE?) and bought eggs, since my hens are really milking this molt for all it's worth. Guess which egg came from the store? And that's an Eggland's Best cage-free one on the right, not even store-brand or anything. Slack-arse chickens! Put liners in a cupcake tin, and spray each one with nonstick spray for easy removal. Glop full of mixture; it will make an even dozen (don't be scared to make the liners pretty full--this doesn't puff up QUITE as much as wheat muffins). I baked these at 375 for 23 minutes, and it was a hair too much, so I'd say 20 minutes give or take, and since Hotter can eat anydamnthing he wants (not that I'm bitter) and was bartering sex acts for muffins, I'd say they were pretty good :)

			    This is a nice, mouth-warming but not-too-hot vinegar-y BBQ base that I use mostly on chicken, although I've also used it for ground-venison \"Sloppy Does\" and it was fantastic in those, too. It's not too spicy for MY kids, but if you have picky eaters you might want to omit the banana pepper and maybe halve the black pepper. Or just throw a PBJ at 'em, make this as follows, and possibly eat it with a spoon, because it's THAT GOOD: 
 MFA Mama's Shebangarang! BBQ Sauce 
 1 c. ketchup (I buy store-brand when it's on sale if we're poor, Heinz Organic at the local big-box store if we're less-poor, depending) 1/2 large sweet onion, diced up small 2 tbsp red wine vinegar 2 cloves garlic, finely minced 1 small banana pepper (like, thumb-sized, or you can use a jalapeno if you want to make it really hot), deseeded and also finely minced  1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 1 tbsp Shebangarang! 2 tsp honey  1/4 tsp black pepper 3 drops \"liquid smoke\" flavoring  
 Put the EVOO and onions in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to clarify. Add the garlic and banana pepper and keep stirring until the garlic begins to brown (don't overdo it or it'll be bitter). As soon as you see the first hint of brown on the garlic, add the rest of the ingredients and simmer until it coats the back of a spoon nicely. This was makes enough to coat an entire picked chicken's worth of meat (if it's a backyard-raised chicken, so probably only the breastmeat of a store-bought roaster), which is dinner and leftovers at my house.

Really good gazpacho (yes, there's an actual recipe on this blog)
" "
 Hell has officially frozen over, because I have a recipe to share (some of you may know that I am not that big on cooking, UNDERSTATEMENT ALERT). It's for a really, really good gazpacho. While I didn't actually create it myself, I think you should all be duly impressed that I have a recipe to share. So what if it's for a cold soup.  I've had gazpacho on the brain ever since a new Twitter pal,  Danielle , asked what people's fave healthy foods are. I mentioned gazpacho, edamame, peaches and Hostess Snowballs, the pink kind, because as we all know they are chock full of vitamins and minerals and fiber and Omega-3s. Then today, I had lunch with my friend Erin (she blogs for  Parenting , check out her posts!) and the waiter said the soup special was minestrone. \"Do you have gazpacho?\" I asked. They didn't, but we all agreed gazpacho rocks. I'm going to be making some over the weekend. The recipe is from a restaurant in Palm Beach whose name I can't recall. Dave and I had dinner there a few years ago when we were on vacation, and I was so wowed by the gazpacho I begged the waitress to get the chef to share the recipe. He did. Enjoy!   So, what food are you obsessed with lately, healthy or not?!  REALLY, REALLY GOOD GAZPACHO 1 large cucumber, peeled, seeded and finely diced (1/4\" cubes) 1/2 green pepper, finely diced 1 small jar pimientos, finely diced 1/2 large onion, (sweet or spanish), finely diced 3 tbsp. parsley, finely chopped 2 tbsp. fresh basil, finely chopped 1 large clove garlic, minced  1 cup Wish-Bone Italian Vinaigrette Dressing 6 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped or a 14-oz can of tomatoes, chopped 1 8-oz can tomato juice   Salt and pepper to taste Sour cream, croutons and cucumber spear for the garnishes Combine diced cucumbers, green pepper, pimientos and onion in a large bowl with parsely, basil and garlic. Mix in Italian dressing. Add tomatoes to soup along with the tomato juice; if using canned tomatoes, first strain the liquid from tomatoes. Salt and pepper to taste. Puree in blender. Chill until ready to serve. Makes a lot. Photo by  JungleFrog

"26300" "39" "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/slow-cooker-recipe-savory-ginger-sweet-potato-pumpkin-wbacon/" "Slow Cooker Recipe: Savory Ginger Sweet Potato & Pumpkin w/Bacon" "  Image courtesy of  SavoirFaireCookbook.com As the weather turns colder —and the economic outlook declines along with those temps —my thoughts turn to warm, hearty, nourishing food that I can make with ease and frugality. In a moment of inspiration the other day, I looked around my kitchen to see what ingredients I had on hand and came up with this recipe. It’s super simple to make, doesn’t take terribly long and can be adapted in any number of ways. Best of all, Nik loves it! So much that he actually grabbed a spoon and tried to feed it to himself the other night at dinner. And it’s so easy to make I can make a big batch and freeze it in single serving containers for him! Ingredients: 1 small pie pumpkin (or any fleshy winter squash like Butternut) 4 sweet potatoes 1 1/2 cans (total 3 C) chicken  OR  vegetable broth (I used Swanson’s low fat/low sodium) 1/2 C sour cream or plain yogurt 2 Tbs savory Ginger to taste – can be fresh, candied, or ground (I used candied ginger to give it just a tiny hint of sweetness, too) Salt/Pepper to taste 4-6 slices of bacon —cooked and crumbled (approx. 1/2 total bits) Prepare the pumpkin by splitting in half, scoop out seeds and membrane. Peel and quarter sweet potatoes. Put both pumpkin & potatoes in slow cooker —pumpkin halves face down. Add chicken broth, savory & ginger. Cook in slow cooker on HIGH for 2-3 hours until pumpkin and potatoes are soft enough to pierce or slightly mash with a fork. Remove pumpkin and scoop out flesh. Replace flesh in slow cooker. Puree mixture using either a hand blender, food processor, or immersion blender. Add sour cream; mix until thoroughly blended. Add bacon. Salt/Pepper to taste Cook for another 30 minutes on HIGH. This will allow flavors to infuse and some of the extra liquid to reduce. You may cook it longer if you want it to thicken some more or you can transfer it to a casserole dish and bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 350F. If you prefer your sweet potatoes thicker or slightly chunkier, use a bit less liquid (or thicken with potato flakes!) and mash instead of puree. ************************************************** The more I play around with it, the more I really like the versatility of this dish. It goes great as-is with chicken or pork as a side dish. As-is, it’s very low-fat, low-sugar. However,you can play around with different seasoning combinations and it can become anything. Substitute dried cranberries for the bacon, or swap curry for the savory and you have a great compliment to lamb! You can change it up and sweeten things by adding brown sugar, cinnamon, and cranberries (or nuts, or marshmallows…). You can spice it up with a southwest flair by adding chipotle in place of the savory and some green onion instead of bacon. You can thin it out with more broth and serve it as a creamy soup in sourdough bread bowls, too. ENJOY!

 Yummy! 
 
 Who says you can't eat well without gluten, dairy, eggs, soy, peanuts, legumes, corn, chocolate, meat, and citrus? Not my family. I just sent this recipe to  Rachel , and since I am the laziest typist in the world I'm just going to post it here too. Now Ep can make Groundnut Stew whenever she wants to!
 
 GROUNDNUT STEW 
 One of my favorite recipes is from Sundays at Moosewood, and is their recipe for West African Groundnut Stew. I have made it for my daughter's preschool several times, and most kids just love it. It's one of the recipes I lob at people who are skeptical about vegan diets (not that I'm on one, but to claim that you can't eat well within vegan guidelines is just silly).
 
 Here it is from memory, which is close but not exact (I can't go upstairs when my son is in therapy sessions, that's where the cookbook is, and if I don't respond to you now I never will). It looks complicated, but once you've made it and have the routine down it's quite easy.
 
 2 tbsp cooking oil of choice 
 1 onion, diced
 2 cloves garlic, chopped
 1/4 tsp cayenne powder (optional)
 1 sweet potato (yams are okay too) peeled and cubed into 1/2-3/4\" cubes
 1/4 of a cabbage, chopped
 3 cups tomato juice
 1 cup apple or apricot juice
 5 tbsp chopped cilantro
 1 tbsp chopped fresh ginger
 1 tsp salt
 1/2 cup unsweetened unsalted smooth peanut or almond butter
 
 -Cook onions in oil over med-hi heat until translucent (about 10 minutes). (this is when I chop cabbage/sweet potatoes)
 -Add garlic and cayenne, sautee another minute
 -Add cabbage and sweet potato, stir to mix/coat, put lid on, turn heat to medium, and let steam for ~15 minutes, stirring occasionally (this is when I get the next five ingredients ready)
 -Add juices, salt, ginger, and cilantro. Put lid back on, turn heat to med-hi, and let cook for ~10 minutes.
 -Stir in peanut butter until mostly incorporated. Turn heat to lowest setting and let cook for ~30 minutes or until the sweet potatoes and cabbage are tender.
 
 You can serve it with rice, or (more authentically and more fun for kids) with pounded rice balls. 
 
 RICE BALLS 
 -Add 1.5 times the recommended amount of water to your rice and cook it until the water's gone (or, until the rice cooker bell rings). 
 -Take the lid off, so the rice can cool down to a touchable temperature (mix it a few times to help) 
 -Pound it with a potato masher until it's formable (it does not have to be remotely smooth)
 -OIL YOUR HANDS WELL
 -Shape the rice into little balls, whatever size you like
 
 Yum!

We have winners....plus, special treat: an awesome recipe
" "
 The winners of the  Cheryl&Co.  Plaid Tidings VIP Gift Tower of sweets: Carolyn G. and Lynn. Someone from the company will be in touch about shipping out your treat. Enjoy, and save some for me! Ha, ha.  Note, that is not either of the winners above. Keep reading! In the responses to the  giveaway for the premium box of pears  from  USA Pears , Barbara from Boston asked about a pear butter recipe. Just so happens that USA Pears has a fantastic one, I practically drooled onto my keyboard. And I think Max will go ga-ga for it. Even more so if I dress up like this babe, snapped at some Halloween parade. Enjoy! It calls for Bartlett pears, but the Anjou and Bosc kind work great, too.  Ingredients: 4 pounds ripe pears, preferably Northwest Bartletts, peeled, cored, and cut to 1-inch chunks 5 cups apple cider 2-1/2 cups light brown sugar 1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon 1-1/2 teaspoons grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon powdered clove 2 tablespoons vanilla extract (optional) Directions: • Bring cider to boil over high heat. Cook until reduced to 2-1/2 cups, or half. • Add pear chunks and cook until fruit is soft and translucent, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a food processor. Puree until mixture is smooth. • Wash original pan, or use another. Add fruit puree, brown sugar, spices, and stir to dissolve. Bring mix to a simmer, stirring frequently to avoid scorching. Cook until very thick, 30 minutes or more. • Remove from heat, cool to room temperature. Add optional vanilla if using it. (Taste at this point; you may not want to add it.) • Put pear butter into clean sterilized canning jars, seal with canning lids and rings. Process according to jar manufacturer's directions or in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Photo by  Erina753

Alas, somebody kept dumping their old coffee on it, and the young tree died. It would also have been nice if this sandwich had occurred to me at the time; it would have been mighty sustaining for long nights when I was making corrections, like “boquey” to bouquet and “expresso” to espresso. (Unfortunately I wasn’t there the right evening to correct “mid-evil” to medieval or “castlations” to crenelations.) 
But back to food! The contrasts in flavors and textures in the filling is fabulous! It’s an easy sandwich to make — the only trick is having all the ingredients on hand. (Recipe after photo.) Two sandwich halves, one with toasted Italian bread spread with mayonnaise and topped with bacon, artichoke hearts and tomato slices, and the other topped with blue cheese and avocado. 
 section of a French or Italian loaf, about as long as your hand 
 blue cheese crumbs 
 mayonnaise 
 2-3 slices of bacon, cut in half and cooked 
 one ripe avocado, sliced around, pitted, scooped from the peel, and sliced 
 a couple of canned artichoke hearts (plain, not marinated), sliced 
 Roma or other ripe tomato, seeded and sliced 
 
 Slice bread lengthwise; spread mayonnaise on one half, and press blue cheese crumbs firmly into the other half. 
 Lay slices in a toaster oven or under the broiler, and toast until the edges of the bread become crusty and the cheese is softened. 
 Lay the bacon, tomato, avocado, and artichoke hearts on the blue cheese slice, and top with the mayonnaise slice. 
 Mash down as needed to make the sandwich cohesive, and sized for eating. 
 The prepared sandwich, with a couple bites eaten from it, showing off the colorful, tasty layers. Enjoy!

		 Sam, as I’m dicing pork chops for stir fry for dinner: “Is that pig meat?  [slurping noises…]  Yummy! Pig meat! I love pig meat! I love pig meat.” 
 Which is ironic because we practically had to force him to eat One. Bite. of pig meat for dinner. Perhaps he likes the idea of loving pig meat more than he likes the pig meat itself. But what a weird thing to want to like.

Posted By Popular Demand: Cake
" "
It is my sister's birthday next week, so while she was visiting this weekend, in between the reveling and the  beer-making , and the  beer-drinking  and the  concert-going , I made her a cake. 
 
A few of her favorite foods in life are mayonnaise, chocolate and apparently  Bordeaux chocolates from See's Candies ..that last one I actually didn't know about when I chose which cake to make her, but this cake sort of managed to hit all those sweet spots.  
 
I remembered that I had read about a World War II era cake that used mayo instead of eggs and shortening because as two of you may recall, and a few more of you may have read.. there was rationing during the war...back when people actually had to sacrifice some of their personal luxury for the benefit of a greater good...but I digress. 
 
 Wikipedia  tells us \"Tires  were the first item to be rationed in January 1942 after supplies of  natural rubber were interrupted. Soon afterward, passenger automobiles, typewriters, sugar, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, fuel oil, coffee, stoves, meat, lard, shortening and oils, cheese, butter, margarine, processed foods (canned, bottled, and frozen), dried fruits, canned milk, firewood and coal, jams, jellies, and fruit butter were rationed by November 1943.\" 
 
And since necessity breeds ingenuity, the bakers, really, the women of that generation, found new ways to make their cakes..voila... the delicate deliciousness of this cake was born. 
 
This recipe comes from  America's Best Lost Recipes: 121 Heirloom Recipes Too Good to Forget  in which I have found several great recipes, for obscure and once well-loved foods like Runsas, which are also called  Bierock  which my family loved. 
 
    World War II Chocolate Mayonnaise Cake  (all italics are my own notes) 
 Ingredients 
 Cake  
2 cups all-purpose flour 
1/4 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder 
1 teaspoon baking powder 
1 teaspoon baking soda 
1 cup mayonnaise 
1 cup granulated sugar 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
1 cup water 
 
 
 
 Frosting  
 (I doubled the amount of butter, brown sugar and milk, and used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar to make my frosting, because we always like more frosting. I think if I had used the entire amount of powdered sugar it would have been too stiff.) 
4 tablespoons unsalted butter 
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 
2 tablespoons milk 
1 cup confectioner's sugar 
 
 Directions Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350   degrees   F. Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan.  (Because you make this in a 9x9 pan you can actually use your counter top (toaster) oven to make this cake, thus avoiding heating up the entire kitchen!) 
 
  Whisk the flour, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda in a medium bowl.  
 
   Stir the mayonnaise, granulated sugar, and vanilla together in a large  bowl until smooth. Add the water and stir until combined. Whisk in the  flour mixture until incorporated.  
 
  Scrape the batter into the  prepared pan  (you can actually let kids lick the spatula here without worry since the eggs in the mayonnaise have already been cooked! A great cake to make with little kids! ) and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out  clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely in the pan, at least 45  minutes.  (Many people leave this cake in the pan and frost it there. I flipped mine upside-down onto a serving platter before frosting it so it would look more birthday-ish and less Grandma VanZanten Poor-Man's Cake-ish..but let me tell you Grandma VanZanten's cake was AWESOME!) 
 
  ***** 
 For the frosting, melt the butter in a small saucepan  over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar and bring to a boil. Boil  until the mixture begins to thicken, about 2 minutes, then, off the  heat, carefully stir in the milk.  
 
  Return to a boil, then remove from the heat to cool until just warm, about 30 minutes. 
 
   Stir in the confectioner's sugar and spread the icing evenly over the  cake. The cake can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.  (if it lasts that long!) 
 
 Enjoy!

"31312" "46" "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/17/meme-mut8nt-r4/" "Meme Mut8nt-R4" "(Andrea pulls on her lab coat and disinfects the benchtop.) Steve D at  One Dad’s Opinion  meme-tagged me.  I don’t know what the official name for this is, so I’ll refer to it as the Random-8 meme. Random-8 has the following genes: 1. Let others know who tagged you. 
2. Players start with 8 random facts about themselves. 
3. Those who are tagged should post these rules and their 8 random facts. 
4. Players should tag 8 other people and notify them they have been tagged. While entertaining some insomnia during the wee hours of the morning, I realised that this list was going to be difficult, having already done the  Five Weird Things  meme.  But then I had an idea — a wild idea — a wild, wee-hours idea that unlike most such, still sounded cool the next day. Now,  Do’C at Autism Street  halted meme transmission with a mutation (he must have really vigorous interferons), which I can certainly understand, as these meme games can be a pox on smaller blogging communities.  Interestingly,  NotMercury  also presented with the same meme mutation.  So although I shall tag some people, I will also employ a little transduction to add a  new  gene onto our little social microbe (no, not GFP for Green Fluorescent Protein — although bioluminescence is cool, I’ve something more useful in mind). Depending upon the host’s resistance-factor homozygosity or heterozygosity, they may choose to pass along the original Random-8 meme, OR they may transmit my transformed mutant -R4 form. ( Bwa-ha-ha! )  Unlike the wild type, the Mut8nt-R4 codes for the transcription of a heap of amino acids, because  R  is for Recipe! New genome for Mut8nt-R4: 1. Let others know who tagged you. 
2. Players start with 4 recipes they especially like (ethnic or regional recipes and quick meals are especially nice). 
3. Those who are tagged should post these rules and their 4 recipes. 
4. Players should tag 4 other people and notify them they have been tagged. GREAT CHICKEN CAPER This first recipe is something I invented for nights when I need something that was (1) really quick to cook, (2) used mostly stuff from the pantry and (3) didn’t require that I’d remembered to defrost anything ahead of time. The only hitch is that you have to remember to buy a couple things and keep them in the pantry for the next time you have one of Those Days. 4 tablespoons olive oil (50 mL) 
1 pound chicken breast filets — still-frozen is fine (1/2 kg) 
2 lemons, washed and sliced thinly & seeded (no need to peel) 
1 large jar or 2 small jars of marinated artichoke hearts, sliced (keep brine) 
capers 
oregano or marjoram Spread olive oil to cover the bottom of a pan and lay the chicken strips in a single layer.  Scatter the lemons and artichoke hearts on top, sprinkle generously with capers and oregano, and pour on the brine.  Put the lid on the pan, and cook over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.  Serve with rice or egg noodles.  (At our house, the rice cooker lives on the counter.) CARIBBEAN CURRY This one is for all of my vegetarian friends. It’s not as quick, but is tasty any time of year, and produces fabulous “lunch-overs”. 2 tablespoons oil  (30 mL) 
1 onion, finely chopped 
3 garlic cloves, minced 
equal amount of minced fresh gingerroot 
1 cup diced seeded tomatoes (250 mL) 
1 can lowfat coconut milk (about 200 mL) 
1/2 teaspoon salt (2 grams) 
2 teaspoons curry powder * (10 grams) 
1 teaspoon ground cumin (5 grams) 
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom (2 grams) 
3” cinnamon stick (8 cm) 
1 large sweetpotato, peeled and diced (drained if canned) 
1 can black-eyed peas, drained 
1 small eggplant, cubed 
1 sweet ripe pepper, diced 
2 handfuls fresh baby spinach leaves 
pineapple chunks, optional 
cooked brown rice Sauté onion for 5 minutes until tender, then add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the curry powder, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon stick, cook stirring constantly for 30 seconds.  Stir in tomato, coconut milk and salt and stir to combine.  Add sweetpotato, peas, eggplant and sweet pepper, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Add spinach leaves the last two minutes of cooking. Remove cinnamon stick before serving with brown rice. * GARAM MASALA  (CURRY SPICE MIX) 2 teaspoons ground cardamom (10 grams) 
1 teaspoon ground cayenne chile (5 grams) 
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon (15 grams) 
2 teaspoons ground cloves (10 grams) 
1 teaspoon ground cumin (5 grams) 
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg (5 grams) 
1 tablespoon ground turmeric (15 grams) DIMENSION ‘X’ COOKIES Gotta have some chocolate in here! Instead of vanilla cookies with chocolate bits, these are my special chocolate cookies with vanilla bits — the cookies from another dimension! If you don’t have vanilla chips, then substitute pea-size chunks of white chocolate. 3/4 cup brown sugar (150 grams) 
1/2 cup sugar (115 grams) 
1 cup butter (2 sticks) softened (225 grams) 
1 teaspoon almond extract  (5 mLs) 
1 egg 
2 cups flour (200 grams) 
1/4 cup baking cocoa (30 grams) 
1 teaspoon baking soda / sodium bicarbonate (5 grams) 
1/2 teaspoon salt (2 grams) 
1 cup vanilla  chips (180 grams) 
1/2 cup salty Spanish peanuts (60 grams) Preheat oven to 375°F / 190°C.  Cream together the butter and sugars.  Mix together the dry ingredients, and add this, along with the remaining ingredients to the creamed mixture.  Drop by tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet, bake for about 10 minutes. Let cool for a minute before removing to wire cooling rack. CRICKET CRUNCH  Where else would you find such an appetizing recipe for insects? We served these at a department Open House, and yes, ordinary people ate them. Insects are a good source of low-fat protein. 2 tablespoons oil  (30 mL) 
About 3 dozen large crickets (available at pet shops) 
Two large handfuls of small snack-size pretzels 
One large handful of salted Spanish peanuts 
One large handful of seedless raisins (sultanas) 
1/2 teaspoon salt (2 grams) 
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne chile (2 grams) 
1/4 teaspoon turmeric (1 gram) Set the package of crickets in freezer for half an hour to kill them.  Mix the seasonings together. Heat oil in wok or large pan and sauté the crickets, sprinkling evenly with seasonings.  Add the other ingredients and toss for a couple of minutes to throughly mix before removing to a serving bowl.  (Have some toothpicks on hand in case someone gets a tarsus stuck between their teeth.)

			    Sometimes life is just fucking awful, and your only recourse is to cook, bake, can, and pick your feelings into submission. Here is a recipe for amazing gluten-free jam-drop cookies. For maximum smug satisfaction, use jam you made the same day: 
 Gluten-Free Jam Drop Cookies makes about 1.5 dozen preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit  
 1/3 cup each tapioca flour, white rice flour, and almond meal 1 tbsp potato starch 1.25 sticks unsalted butter 1/2 tsp Pink Himalayan Salt  1/3 cup sugar paste from a one-inch section of vanilla bean about 1.5 tbsp jam 
 Whisk dry ingredients except sugar and salt together and set aside. Beat butter, sugar, vanilla bean paste and salt together until fluffy. Add dry ingredients in three parts and beat together, roll into balls of about 2 tsp each, set balls on a sheet of parchment paper laid over a pizza pan and press thumbprint in to make dimple, fill dimple with jam, Repeat until you run out of dough (or eat it all), bake at 350 for 12-15 minutes depending on your oven.  
    We (Little Child and I) made these today with fresh strawberry jam from the garden, and they tasted like really rich, buttery shortbread with jam. SO good. Tonight there are rose petals macerating in the fridge for rose-petal jam tomorrow, and we agreed that we'll have to make more jam-drops when that is ready.

			    I realize I mostly post super-healthy recipes on here. This is not one of those. Big Child just turned twelve and asked me for a \"coconut overload cake, like last year!\" Unfortunately, last year we were so broke that I was totally improvising, and I don't even remember what the hell I did except that it involved lots and lots of coconut. So I Googled around for ideas, decided to go for a pudding cake since Big Child likes really rich baked goods, and saw one otherwise-gross recipe that included flaked coconut in both the cake AND the frosting.  BRILLIANT! While I couldn't actually taste the cake (STUPID WHEAT WITH ITS STUPID FUCKING PROTEIN!), I liked the idea of adding to the (god this is a douchey word, but bear with me) mouthfeel with something to give it a little texture. 
 Big Child's Twelfth Birthday Triple-Coconut Cake 
 The Cake: 
 1 box yellow cake mix 1 3.5-oz packet of coconut-flavored cook & serve pudding 1 and 1/3 cups water 3 eggs 1/4 cup coconut oil 2 cups unsweetened flaked coconut - you can use sweetened if you MUST, but remember you've already added sugar via the pudding and I think sweetened would be cloying Beat eggs and oil together, add pudding powder, then add cake mix and water in alternating halves and once mixed, beat on highest setting or, if you prefer, WITH FEELING, for three minutes. Stir in coconut flakes and bake in two 8- or 9-inch pans for 35 minutes at 350 (if you use 9-inch pans, check at 33 minutes or it may get a little darker than you want it to due to the pudding mix adding sugar). Cool in pans for 15 mins and then on racks or plates until cool enough to frost. 
 The Frosting: 4 oz neufchatel cheese 2 oz coconut oil 1 tsp vanilla extract 1-2 tbsp heavy whipping cream 2-3 cups confectioner's sugar 2 cups unweetened flaked coconut Toast the coconut flakes in a dry pan over low heat until golden. Set aside to cool. Beat the neufchatel cheese and coconut oil together, then add 1 tbsp heavy whipping cream and vanilla extract. Add confectioner's sugar one cup at a time, correcting with the other tbsp of heavy whipping cream as needed until you have the right consistency--you want shiny but not loose, forming nice peaks and ripples. Beat in half the toasted coconut, saving the other half to coat the frosted cake. 
    Frost the tops of both layers, stack them, then frost the sides and coat with toasted coconut. If you can do this and have it come out looking neat and pretty you're a better woman than I am, but according to the MFAmily Gluttens it will be so delicious you won't care (I tasted the frosting and it was gooooood). Write \"Happy Birthday\" in gloopy cursive with one of those super-nasty HFCS gel frostings, top with re-lighting candles if you're a wise-ass like we all are here, and sing the birthday song. WHOO, TWELVE!

Autism Discrimination Alleged in France
" "
 In the predominantly English speaking countries we don't always hear much about autism from other countries.  The attached article refers to a complaint of discrimination brought in Paris France by a parent autism advocacy group which denounces  government policies in France which  systematically result in institutionalization in pyschiatric hospitals of autistic children and force  parents seeking an education for their autistic children to send them to Belgium.  The group  Léa pour Samy - La voix de l'enfant autiste  alleges that government policy excludes autistic children from a school based education. Une enquête sur la discrimination   contre les autistes est ouverte NOUVELOBS.COM | 27.07.2007 | 10:20 L'association \"Léa pour Samy\" fustige une politique française de mise à l'écart des enfants autistes, contraire à celle de la Belgique où sont scolarisés plus d'un millier d'entre eux. Le parquet de Paris a ouvert début juillet une information judiciaire pour \"discrimination\" après une plainte déposée en septembre 2006 par l'association de parents d'enfants autistes \"Léa pour Samy\", a-t-on appris jeudi 26 juillet de source judiciaire. L'association estime que les pouvoirs publics ont \"mis en place sciemment une discrimination\" des enfants autistes, en les plaçant dans des hôpitaux psychiatriques ou en obligeant les parents à les envoyer dans des institutions spécialisées et privées en Belgique. Elle condamne des moyens insuffisants et inadaptés. Par cette plainte, \"Léa pour Samy - La voix de l'enfant autiste\" souhaite \"mettre en lumière la prise en charge catastrophique des enfants atteints d'autisme dans notre pays\" avec notamment un accès \"impossible\" à l'école, expliquait-elle en mars. http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/

Liberal education critic Chris Collins Calls for an Immediate Halt to the Alward Government Autism Intervention Service Changes
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 Collins calls for halt to
changes to autism intervention services   
 

 
  
 
   
   
 
 
  
 
 
 

 
  
 
   
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 June 11, 2014   
 
 
 
 FREDERICTON – Liberal education
critic Chris Collins is calling for an immediate halt to the Alward
government’s changes to the autism intervention services in New Brunswick.  
 
 
 
 Changes made by the Department
of Education and Early Childhood Development to the standards for agencies
delivering intervention services for preschool children with autism spectrum
disorder were announced without consultation on May 26, less than one week
before an initial implementation date of June 1.  This date has since been revised by
Government to July 1, again with no adequate consultation with those affected.   
 
 
 
 One of the main concerns voiced
by parents and advocates is the introduction of a new mandatory 95 per-cent
attendance rate for autistic children receiving intervention services from
autism support agencies.  Should a child
miss more than 3 days over a 3-month period, the agency loses funding.  
 
 
 
 Collins, the MLA for Moncton
East, said this is unacceptable and added that he has already received calls
from families expressing their concerns about this new policy.   
 
 
 
 “Autism support agencies
already experience high staff turnover rates. 
This new policy’s impact on agency funding will certainly make staff
retention more difficult,” said Collins. 
“While this impacts the autism support agencies, it also certainly
impacts the children.  
 
 
 
 “Routine, consistency, and
familiarity are all extremely important for a child with autism,” added
Collins.  “These changes are causing an
undue amount of uncertainty and stress for both these children and their parents.”
 
 
 
 
 Collins said that the policy is
too vague, and does not offer specifics to indicate if there will be any
exceptions permitted for missed attendance. 
For example, Collins wonders if a child is sick, or if they spend a day
with their grandparents, would that count as a missed day?  
 
 
 
 “At the end of the day, parents
must be involved in the decisions that will impact their child,” said
Collins.  “This is yet another example of
this Alward government making hasty decisions without thinking about the impact
they will have on New Brunswickers.”

d’intervention pour les enfants d’âge préscolaire atteints de troubles
autistiques ont été annoncés sans consultations le 26 mai, à moins d’une
semaine de la mise en œuvre proposée du 1 juin. 
Cette date a depuis été révisée par le gouvernement au 1 juillet, encore
une fois sans consultation adéquate avec ceux et celles qui seront
touchés.   
 
 
 
 Une
des principales préoccupations exprimées par les parents et les défenseurs est
l’introduction d’un nouveau taux de participation obligatoire de 95 pour cent
pour les enfants autistiques recevant des services d’intervention d’organismes
de soutien à l’autisme.  Si un enfant
manque plus de trois jours sur une période de trois mois, l’organisme perd du
financement.   
 
 
 
 M.
Collins, le député de Moncton-Est, dit que cela est inacceptable, et a ajouté
qu’il a déjà reçu des appels de familles exprimant leurs inquiétudes face à
cette nouvelle politique.    
 
 
 
 «
Les organismes de soutien à l’autisme connaissent déjà de fréquents changements
au personnel.  L’impact de cette nouvelle
politique sur le financement de ces organismes rendra encore plus difficile la
rétention du personnel, » a dit M. Collins. 
« Bien que cette nouvelle politique aura un impact sur les organismes de
soutien à l’autisme, elle aura certainement un impact sur les enfants.  
 
 
 
 “Un
enfant autistique nécessite une routine, de la cohérence, et de la familiarité,
» a ajouté M. Collins.  « Ces changements
causeront un stress et une incertitude excessive pour ces enfants et leurs
parents. »  
 
 
 
 M.
Collins a dit que la politique est trop vague, et n’offre pas de détails pour
indiquer s’il y aura des exceptions pour les journées manquées.  Par exemple, M. Collins veut savoir si une
journée manquée s’appliquera à un enfant malade, ou à un enfant qui a passé la
journée avec ses grands-parents.  
 
 
 
 « À
la fin de la journée, les parents doivent être impliqués dans les décisions qui
auront un impact sur leurs enfants, » a dit M. Collins.  « Voilà un autre exemple d’une décision
rapide prise par ce gouvernement Alward, sans aucune considération pour
l’impact qu’elle aura sur les Néo-Brunswickois. »

Amy Yasko, PhD Yes, Canada will miss out on Jenny McCarthy and  Andrew Wakefield , who was recently given “ The first annual Andrew J. Wakefield Award for Courage in Medicine ” by AutismOne, if that gives you an idea of AutismOne’s leanings.  Does Sick Kids want to be hosting future “Andrew J. Wakefield Award for Courage in Medicine” award ceremonies?  Do they want to have  HBOT balloons smoking in their exhibit hall ?  Do they want to host future conferences with speakers from SafeMinds ( Mark Blaxill ),  TACA  (Lisa Akerman), the “National Vaccine Information Center” (Vicky Diebold and Barbara Loe Fisher), together with Mark and David Geier (bad armchair epidemiologists and, worse yet, purveyors of Lupron as a therapy for autism), Mayer Eisienstien, Joseph Mercola…? I join Orac at Respectful Insolence in asking, what was Sick Kids thinking?

Links to Articles Concerning Autism and the CT tragedy
" "
Kathleen and I believe that offering multiple perspectives is vital to the health of our community. Open exchange and dialogue are key to creating meaningful change in the larger society. 
 
Speculation, as always, is rampant in the CT tragedy. The need to react, even if knee-jerk, is  understandable. 
 
Below are the pieces we have found covering the intersection between autism and the tragic school shooting on Friday (in no particular order).

 Shannon Rosa, contributor to \"My Baby Rides the Short Bus\" and BlogHer contributing editor, parenting children with special needs 
 And tomorrow night, we'll be reading at Modern Times bookstore in San Francisco, which is only one of this weekend's three Bay Area MBRTSB events:

 BLOGHER10 (New York) 
 There was a breakout session in the Personal: Blogging Autism: Shattering Myths, Opening Eyes and Finding Your Tribe 
 
 Autism is both more out in the open than it has ever been before and more shrouded in myths and mystery. Come learn and share your stories about how blogging contributes to the autism community as a source of support and outlet for parents, as a way for those not dealing directly with autism to gain more insight and sensitivity and as a tool for advocacy and activism. Shannon Des Roches Rosa, a parent of a child with autism, moderates the discussion with Shark-Fu, who is co-guardian of her autistic brother, Stimey fromStimeyland.com, who parents a child with autism, and Carol Greenberg, who is an adult with autism, from Brooklyn Special Needs Consulting.

 Every year Maggie and I are humbled by the outpouring of volunteers willing to spend some time as hosts in  The Serenity Suite . This year is no exception. So with no further ado, I give you the 2012 Serenity Suite hosts! (Oh wait, here’s more ado–imagine a line of beauties entering stage right while waving above their heads and grinning.) (Anissa’s wheelchair, which is the new black , is being pushed by  Smacksy , who is wearing Bob on her shoulder (that’s the new trend in bigboywearing). He is waving for both of them. Anissa is not waving. It appears she is flipping off the crowd for singing  You’re The Inspiration .)

 In our closing remarks from behind the podium, Maggie and I would like to remind you that this year’s suite is  in honor of Susan Neibur  and all others we have lost this year.Come and share your stories. Find out more  here .) 
 If you’re planning to stop by and see us, please grab a Serenity Suite badge for your blog from the  BlogHer website ! 
 Thank you! 
 P.S. For those of you in recovery (of any kind), we will have local recovery meeting times and locations available on site!

 BlogHer11 was a big deal for special-needs bloggers. Julia Roberts (Support for Special Needs)   lobbied hard for a big special-needs presence  at BlogHer, and got great support from the BlogHer team. The panelists' biographies are  here. 
 
 Room of Your Own | Special Needs Mini-Conference 
 Friday Lunch 11:45am – 1:15pm Room of Your Own | Special Needs Mini-Conference The special needs blogging community is big enough–and important enough–to warrant this nearly three-hour mini-conference, co-hosted by moderator Julia Roberts and Support for Special Needs, and featuring Aurelia Cotta, Robert Rummel-Hudson, and Shannon Rosa.... 
 Aurelia, Julia, Robert, and Shannon will share their own insights with the larger group, but you’ll also have the opportunity to go deeper in small round-table discussions moderated by parents of kids with special needs. Connect and share is the goal of this

I've  mentioned previously  how flexible Bud is in his pretend play. His favorite activity is acting out tv and movie scripts with his characters. If he has the actual toy versions of the characters in question - the Blues Clues crew, the Teletubbies, the Sesame Street ensemble - then he uses them. If he doesn't, he improvises. Here are some of my very favorite improvisations. The first characters Bud needed to create on his own were Chris and Martin Kratt, the hosts of the PBS show  Zoboomafoo . Here's what Chris and Martin look like in real life: And here's what they look like at our house, as played by the Fisher Price family dad and mom. (NB: The mom always plays the role of Martin. I'm not sure, but I think it's because Chris wears the green shirt.) Bud is also a fan of  Moose and Zee , the cartoon hosts over at Noggin: Except that in Budland, the roles are played by a moose puppet and Norville, the bird from  Clifford's Puppy Days : Sometimes Bud likes to play with Smooch and Winslow, the marmosets from  It's a Big, Big World , who look like this on TV:  And like this in Budland:   And, of course, we can't forget the ever-popular  Curious George  and The Man With the Yellow Hat: as played in Budland by BJ (of  Barney  fame) and an anonymous stuffed monkey. (You may also take note of the clever roller skates on George's feet, created by Matchbox cars and twist-ties.): Bud's current passion is the new Noggin program,  The Upside Down Show , starring \"brothers\" Shane and David, whom (for obvious reasons, when you realize that you're looking at Shane on the right) Bud calls \"Shave-it and Dave-it\": This is what they look like around here, where Zoboomafoo stars as Shave-it and Woodstock stars as Dave-it: And, finally, the  piece de resistance  and my personal favorite, Charlie and Lola, as they appear on the BBC CBeebies website, And as they as they appear in our bathroom (That's Charlie on the left):

				 I love classical music as my facebook followers know because I show them music films often. I think it is like God’s voice the times I hear magnificent melodies like Bach, or Beethoven, or Mendelssohn, or Prokofiev, or Debussy, or the many other composers at their best. I wonder why music like this isn’t composed anymore. The era of  these magnificent musical gifts  is over and we continue to listen to music hundreds of years old. It was a golden time for music that is not here now. What would happen to Bach if he lived now? What kind of music would he compose? Would he even have the chance to create his imagination’s masterpieces? I bet there is a musical genius here on earth now who could compose the magnificent music I love if there was a place to, but instead has to write jingles for ads, sound tracks for movies, or top forties songs. I guess our genius now is in developing technology but I do wish there was more music to soar in the way it used to.

 I am pleased to unveil a delightful series of  Curious George  illustrations by our own  resident artist . I have transcribed their captions exactly as he dictated them. They are all scripts, as heard by Bud. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... Curious George! George is a monkey, so he can do things you can'ts do. I really like the boat he build, and we're going to make some, too. Curious George is a monkey, so he can do things you can'ts do. George pull out the spaghetti so he can scratch the soft the mystery.   George is a monkey, so he can do things you can'ts do. He got all the skins back on the wrong fruits.   George is a monkey, so he can do things you can'ts do. He's getting all the mosquitoes back in the grass. Curious George is a monkey, so he can do things you can'ts do. He build a world tree for the pigeon that actually stand up. Curious George is a monkey, so he can do things you can'ts do. He found his way home by following sounds. THE END

In my  last post , I made the claim that Paul McCartney was \"at his goofiest\" in the new video for the song \"Ever Present Past.\" I stand corrected. A good friend and fellow McCartney fan sent me an e-mail reminding me about a dance sequence from McCartney's 1973 television special  James Paul McCartney . The song was \"Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance\" and the sequence was... well, it's hard to describe. I wish you could see it for yourself, but I've only got a grainy copy on VHS and it seems that no one has added it to YouTube yet. Let's just say that compared to \"Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance,\" the video for \"Ever Present Past\" shows Paul being downright dignified. Here's a still that captures just a bit of the flavor of Paul in his 1973 glory:

For Conor Control Can Make A Difference: HERSHEY'S KISSES Christmas Bells, Autism and Sensory Challenges
" "
 

 
 
 
 
Conor would always react negatively when he heard the Hershey's Kisses Christmas bells  commercial. The sound of the bells, even the sight of the bells, almost invariably agitated him. Recently I recorded a couple of Frosty the Snowman shows for Conor using our television DVR system. The Hershey's Kisses Christmas bells commercial was included as one of the commercials during the broadcast of the Frosty episodes.  Today I grabbed a coffee from the kitchen to go back upstairs to do some work on my laptop and realized Conor was playing, and replaying several times, the Hershey's Kisses Christmas bells commercial using the television remote control. He actually seemed to be enjoying the sound of the bell music. Sure he was desensitizing but more than that, he seem to actually enjoy the bell music.  He appeared to have learned to enjoy the commercial's bell sounds because he exercised control, literally, over the playing of the commercial, its sounds and images.

Effects are the lifelong-iest
" "
As  I've mentioned before , Bud often uses echolalia when he speaks. But he doesn't just quote short statements. He recites entire video scripts from start to finish, adopting accents and dialects as appropriate and even including sound effects and background music. He has a future in television or theater if he wants one. He does the same thing with music. He learns songs thoroughly. He learns the drum beat, the bass line, the guitar solo, the pauses, and the background vocals, but mostly he learns the lyrics. At three years old, Bud could not sustain a back-and-forth conversation beyond Me:  Do you want juice?,  Bud:  Okay,  but he could sing  Paul McCartney 's  Band on the Run  from the first note through the last without missing a beat. Some of his favorite music these days comes from the children's channel Noggin, whose host - the very talented Moose A. Moose - appears between programs to perform a wide array of musical numbers. The  Noggin songs  are terrifically complex, and they never underestimate a child's capacity to sustain interest in music with complicated melodies, syncopation, or lyrics. Bud adores them all. Yesterday at school, the spirit moved Bud and he burst forth into song. His teacher,  Mrs. Parker , had heard him perform this particular number before, but he'd never sung it with the full class as audience. She seized the moment, set aside the current lesson plan, yielded the floor, and let Bud take center stage as he performed for them all, singing at full voice, with complete note-for-note and word-for-word accuracy: Days are the sunniest Jokes are the funniest Rabbits are the bunny-est Hives are the honey-est Elephants the ton-iest Troubles - they're the none-iest Everywhere I go!  Straws are the bend-iest Time is the spend-iest Cards are the send-iest Books are the lend-iest Fun's the pretend-iest  Friends are the friend-iest  Everywhere I go!  Berries are the fruit-iest  Shoes are the boot-iest Puppies are the cute-iest  Treasure is the loot-iest Teams are the root-iest Horns are the toot-iest Everywhere I go!  Birds are the tweet-iest Candy is the sweet-iest Socks are the feet-iest Tricks are the treat-iest Drums are the beat-iest  Lunch is the eat-iest  Everywhere I go!  Flowers are the smelliest  Jams are jelly-est Rain's the umbrell-iest  Tales are the tell-iest Wishing is the well-iest Buttons are the belly-est Everywhere I go! Skies are the blue-iest Cows are the moo-iest Gum is the chewiest Ghosts are the boo-iest Goo is the gooey-est  You can be your you-iest  Everywhere I go! The other children in the class were delighted. Some of them knew the song and joined in on the lyrics they remembered. But Bud was the only person in the whole class who could sing every word. And he knew it. He tried to downplay his achievement last night, acting as though it was no big thing... but he couldn't keep the smile from crossing his lips as Nana recounted the story of his performance to Daddy. Bud was proud. And so, in his honor, I offer you this final verse, penned by me: Bud is the the song-iest His teacher's cheers are strong-iest The kids are sing-along-iest And worries are so-long-iest Cause school is can't-go-wrong-iest When Bud feels the belong-iest Everywhere he goes!

       Snooks Eaglin at the 2006 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (with George Porter, Jr. on bass) There’s some sad news from New Orleans.  Snooks Eaglin, the blind bluesman who was one of this country’s greatest musical treasures, passed away today.  He had a unique guitar style that influenced countless players, and a stage presence that won him fans around the world.  He was known as “the human jukebox” due to his ability to play anything at any time, but always in his own style.  One of his best known recordings was “Funky Malaguena,” which was just what the title indicates: the flamenco standard played with a decidedly New Orleans beat. I was lucky enough to see him for the first time when I was still an impressionable teenager and learning that there was a lot of great music that wasn’t on mainstream radio.  I saw him many times through the years, the last time being at the 2006 JazzFest.  He never failed to leave me in awe. An obit from WWOZ (the world’s greatest radio station) can be found  here . Below, enjoy Snooks.

Stumped
" "
Bud's latest language challenge has me stumped. One of his new favorite activities is watching Teletubbies videos on our small portable DVD player. He especially likes watching it from angles so that the Tubbies look very tall or look overexposed. He also loves playing with the slim, credit-card sized remote control to watch the movie in fast forward or reverse, or to change the setting so that the narrator uses a British accent instead of an American one. Here's the mystery. He calls the remote control a \"miper.\" He does not call the regular tv remote a miper, so it is exclusively this particular device that holds that title (\"Mama, I can't find my miper!\") There is an answer. It is logical. It is  not even wrong . I just can't figure it out. Stay tuned.

Mozart's Requiem In Fredericton
" "
 In the \" nothing to do with autism \" department I was able last night to attend, with my oldest son, a performance of Mozart's Requiem by the The Fredericton Choral Society and the Fredericton Chamber Orchestra at the Wilmot United Church in Fredericton.   It was my first time attending a live performance of any classical music; unless you count my attendance at a Rolling Stones concert in Moncton a couple of years ago :-) I do not pretend to be musically learned or sophisticated.  As a child I did enjoy the classical music sometimes featured on Bugs Bunny cartoons .  My interest took a leap forward with the release of the multiple award winning  Amadeus.  The internet, better computer sound quality and good quality CDs and DVD's  have all made classical music more accessible and enjoyable.   Last evening though I attended my first live classical performance and I was excited to see and hear one of Mozart's most famous compositions, Requiem, as completed by  Süssmayr and performed by the Fredericton Choral Society and the Fredericton Chamber Orchestra. We arrived early and were able to sit only 3 rows from the front of the orchestra and the conductor.  It was an amazing experience for me and my son.  The Fredericton Chamber Orchestra will present Robert Schumann's \"Spring Symphony and some other pieces at the Wilmot United Church on May 2.  I hope to be there again with my son. Never too old to experience something new and amazing. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

Musical tastes
" "
Bud is a big fan of music, and music is a big part of his life. He could work a CD player by the time he was 2, and since that time he has had distinct musical preferences and a vast CD collection of his own. He also has an uncanny ear for melody and could sing in tune well before he talk. Up until now, his tastes have run from the age-appropriate - the Wiggles, Laurie Berkner, Hap Palmer, Raffi, Sesame Street - to the things he has adopted from the collections of Mama, Daddy, Nana, and Papa, which include Paul McCartney, Sam Bush, John Denver, and the Irish Tenors. But yesterday he was singing to himself while he was playing, and I started listening to him. It was clearly not a song I'd heard him sing before, but it was somehow familiar: \"An she be weeeeeeeeeee be loooooove... an she be weeeeeeeee be loooooove.\" \"Bud,\" I said, startled. \"Are you singing Maroon 5?\" \"An she be weeeeeee be looooooove...\" So I started singing. \"Bud, is that the song that goes, \"I don't mind spending every day out on your corner in the pouring rain... and she will be loved?\" \"Yeah,\" he said matter-of-factly. I was flabbergasted. I don't own that CD, and neither does anyone else in the family. \"Where did you hear that song?\" \"In the car.\" I called to my mother in the other room, \"Did you have the radio on in the car today?\" She did (which is unusual, because Bud is usually very insistent on listening to his own music in the car, and she usually lets him.) But not only did he hear it and like it, he remembered it well enough several hours later to sing it. Next thing you know he'll want his own iPod.

Reality check
" "
I swear to you, I had no idea that I cackle. Bud and I were playing and he was doing a big fake laugh - \"HAHAHAHA\" - that he does. He encourged me to join in, \"You do it!\" So I jumped in with a fake laugh of my own: \"HAHAHAHAHA!\" \"No, like this - heh-heh-heh-heh-heh,\" he cackled. \"Hahahaha,\" I tried, in a different fake laugh. \"No,\" he redirected. \"Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.\" \"Heeheeheeheeheehee!\" \"No. You try it - heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!\" The absurdity of the conversation combined with his impish little face cackling at me finally got to me and my fake laugh morphed into a real one. And that's when I heard it. \"Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!\" It stopped me cold. I cackle. I am a cackler. Reality bites.

	 22 (MAKE THAT 25) GOOD REASONS TO LOVE NEW ORLEANS MUSIC
	 
    " "
	 
      I was staring to formulate a new post on autism controversies, etc., but it’s been just too pretty a day, and I’m still having those  Jazzfest  thoughts.  Then a friend of ours emailed asking for musical suggestions for a party with a New Orleans theme.  It got me thinking about what songs I would burn onto a mix if I was throwing the party.  Here, in alphabetical order, is a pretty good, but certainly non-exhaustive, sampling of New Orleans classics.  All These Things  ⎯ Art Neville Art is the eldest of the famous brothers (and the father of television journalist Arthel Neville).  His career spans close to fifty years, and would have been considered complete if he had never cut another record after “All These Things.”  It’s a great slow-dance love song. Big Chief  ⎯  Professor Longhair Henry Roeland Byrd a/k/a Professor Longhair was called “the Bach of Rock,” partly because of the intricacy of his piano playing, and partly because of the influence he had on what developed into rock-n-roll.  He pioneered a rhumba-flavored blues style of piano playing that came to shape the New Orleans style.  “Big Chief” is one of many songs that echoes the chants of the Mardi Gras Indians, groups of African Americans who take to the streets on Fat Tuesday morning in elaborate costumes.  Greta versions of this song were also released by Dr. John and the subdudes. Burgundy Street Blues  ⎯ George Lewis I’m not including very much traditional jazz on this list, mainly because it would lengthen it by at least a hundred tunes to include just the essentials.  But this little-known gem is just too good to omit.   George Lewis was, in my humble opinion, the greatest clarinet player New Orleans ever produced.  “Burgundy Street Blues” was one of the few tunes he actually wrote.  It has a bittersweet feel to it; you just can’t help but close your eyes and smile wistfully while listening to it. Cissy Strut  ⎯ The Meters The original Meters consisted of Art Neville on keyboards, Leo Nocentelli on guitar, the incomparable George Porter, Jr. on bass, and the irrepressible Zigaboo Modeliste on drums.  They served as the house band at legendary Sea-Saint Studios, where they backed up the likes of Dr. John, Robert Palmer, and Paul McCartney.  They also cut some amazing albums of their own.  Most of the early records were instrumentals, including this classic that redefined the meaning of “funk.”  After years of legal disputes and petty squabbling that kept them apart, the original four Meters regrouped for last year’s Jazzfest.  They had so much fun, they did some more dates, and they are back on the jazzfest schedule for the end of this month. Fiyo on th’ Byo (Fire on the Bayou)  ⎯ The Neville Brothers This tune was originally recorded by the Meters, during a period when Cyrill Neville was part of the group.  When Art and Cyrill left the Meters, they formed the now-legendary act with their brothers Charles and Aaron.  This is one of the Meters’ tunes that made it into the new group’s catalog, and the Nevillized version is nothing short of amazing. Gonzo  ⎯ James Booker Before the weird blue Muppet, and even before anyone decided to give the name to Hunter S. Thompson, James Carroll Booker, III was Gonzo.  He took Professor Longhair’s syncopated rhythms and took music to places no musician had gone before or has gone since.  Among the odder chapters of his life story was that this genius who was known to disobey a few laws in his life, took the young son of the local district attorney under his wing, and showed him a thing or two on piano.  A few cynics thought Booker was using the kid as his get-out-jail-free card, but it turns out the kid had a few chops and Booker seemed to genuinely like him.  The kid was a 12-year old Harry Connick, Jr., who seems to have found some measure of success.  It is ironic that Booker, who was known as “the piano prince of New Orleans,” recorded his best known song, “Gonzo,” on organ.   Hey Pocky Way  ⎯ The Meters This classic vocal track from the Meters is adapted from a Mardi Gras Indian chant.  The Neville Brothers also perform this song, but the Meters’ version is definitive Fat Tuesday funk. Iko Iko  ⎯ Dr. John This is another one that started out as an Indian chant.  It is the mark of pride in new Orleanians that we actually understand the lyrics to this one.  A better known version was released by the Dixie Cups, but the doctor’s recording can’t be beat. I’m Walkin’  ⎯ Fats Domino When Hurricane Katrina bore down on New Orleans, one of the stubborn folks who refused to leave was Antoine “Fats” Domino.  His rescue from his Ninth Ward house made headlines, and resulted in a collective sigh of relief around the world.  He’s not only playing at this year’s Jazzfest, he’s on  the poster .  A lot of his songs could have made this list, but I chose my favorite. It’s Raining  ⎯  Irma Thomas Irma Thomas is rightfully called the “soul queen of New Orleans.”  She makes any song sound good.  This is a classic tune of having the blues in the rain. Lipstick Traces  ⎯ Benny Spellman This was the only nationally known hit by Spellman, affine New Orleans singer.  The song’s imagry shows why Allen Toussaint is so revered among songwriters: Lipstick Traces On a cigarette Every memory of you Lingers yet Mardi Gras in New Orleans  ⎯ Professor Longhair This is a rollicking good time of a song with incredible piano work and the world’s funkiest whistling.   Mother in Law  ⎯ Ernie K-Doe Ernest Kador was a unique character who was born to entertain.  It’s hard to say he had a great voice, but every song he sang was infused with personality.  His best known song was another Allen Toussaint gem, with references to the stereotypical mother-in-law having been “sent from down below.”  For anyone who has had a mother-in-law who “thinks her advice is a contribution, but if she would leave would be a solution,” this song is an anthem.  In his last marriage, ol’ Ernie finally found a mother-in-law he loved, but he never talked about the ones who came before.  I can relate. St. James Infirmary  ⎯ Louis Armstrong It seems odd to only have one song by Satchmo on the list, but it’s another case of keeping it manageable.  “St. James Infirmary,” also known as “The Gambler’s Blues” was a New Orleans variant in “The Unfortunate Rake” cycle of folk songs (okay, that’s a bit more information than you really wanted).  Armstrong recorded it at the peak of his career, and he’s at his best on both trumpet and vocals. Such a Night  ⎯ Dr. John Mac Rebennack’s most commercially successful album was ‘Right Place, Wrong Time,” on which he was backed up by the Meters.  Of all the great songs on the album, “Such a Night” is standing the test of time quite well.  It’s hard not to crack a little smile at the rationalization of the refrain:  “If I don’t do it, y’know somebody else will.” ‘Taint it the Truth  ⎯ Ernie K-Doe Another great performance from K-Doe, in one of those “she’s left me” songs. Time Is On My Side  ⎯ Irma Thomas Most people are familiar with this song as being one of the early hits of the Rolling Stones.  Ms. Thomas recorded the original, and her vocal puts Mick to shame. Tipitina  ⎯ Professor Longhair Never has random nonsense sounded so good.  Dancing to this is as much fun as is humanly possible.  The famous New Orleans nightclub, Tipitina’s, is named after this song, and a statue of the professor stands in the neutral ground (“median” for you yankees) of adjacent Napoleon Avenue.  Tell It Like It Is  ⎯ Aaron Neville Is there anyone out there that really hasn’t heard this one? Who Shot the Lala  ⎯ Oliver Morgan Before Sym and I got married, one of our more memorable dates was to see the legendary Tommy Ridgley (who we eventually hired to play our wedding) perform at a suburban club.  Sitting in for a set was none other than the great Oliver Morgan.  As it turned out, we were one of only two couples in the place, but Tommy and Oliver didn’t seem to care.  They put on a great show.  I will never forget seeing Oliver Morgan look down from the stage to the dance floor where I was twirling my Sym around, and he asked “You love that woman, boy?”  I surely do Mr. Morgan.  “Who Shot the Lala” is Oliver Morgan’s best-known song, and is, without doubt, the world’s most fun song about a killing. Workin’ in a Coal Mine  ⎯ Lee Dorsey This was reworked in the ‘80s by Devo, but it just wasn’t the same.  It’s yet another Allen Toussaint song, and has the absolute greatest bass line of all time. You Can Have My Husband (But Please Don’t Mess With My Man)  ⎯ Irma Thomas When you get right down to it, the name pretty much says it all. There it is, a short list of songs that can turn any party into a N’Awlins second line.  But there’s a lot more where those came from.  Anyone with internet access can get a free lesson in New Orleans every day by listening in on  the world’s greatest radio station .  So c’mon, everybody get funky! *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * Addendum: After posting this, I realized I left off three of the great ones. Barefootin’  ⎯ Robert Parker This has to be one of the greatest dance songs of all time. Ooh Poo Pah Doo  ⎯ Jessie Hill Another bit of irresistible nonsense.   You Talk Too Much  ⎯ Joe Jones And really, haven’t we all wanted to say that to someone sometime.  Some people say something similar in the comments to this blog on a regular basis. So now we have a full 25 songs on our New Orleans list.  NOW GET FUNKY!

Conor Likes the Computer AND the Headphones
" "
 Conor loves the computer.  He goes on the laptop and watches various videos, especially O Canada and he loves to listen to the sound on the headphones.  I don't know if he learned how to use them at school but Conor picks up the earphones, plugs them in and uses them no problem.  And he enjoys listening on them which did surprise me a  bit since the sound can be louder and more complex heard through the headphones. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

Any singers in the house?
" "
This Friday, I'm bringing in cupcakes to Max's school to celebrate his birthday. I've also volunteered to lead a holiday sing-a-long, and will no doubt be impressing kids and teachers alike with my vocal range as I belt out  \"Jingle Bells\" and \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer.\" Seriously, I like to sing, I was in choir in grade school and college. So it's fun when I get to do it with kids. My fantasy career: being a singer, of the Norah Jones crooner variety.  Dave took me to see her in concert for my birthday last year, she sounds absolutely amazing live. I've also fantasized about being  Laurie Berkner , who does really boppy, creative songs for kids.  I've never once fantasized about being Willie Nelson, FYI. What's your fantasy career?

The grass is always bluer

Mere months ago,  I told you  that Bud and I have the same taste in music. Since then, Bud has been branching out. We still have a lot of musical tastes in common - there is still a lot of overlap - but the more we listen to the radio, the more we check out videos on Yahoo, the more we sample clips from iTunes, the more I'm discovering that Bud has a musical sensibility that's all his own. Increasingly, he approaches me with iPod in hand and asks me to download a song for him - a song that I didn't know he liked; a song that doesn't particularly grab me. They tend to be testosterone-laden  country songs  with lyrics like  \"All my friends say I started shootin' doubles when you walked in...\"  And, then, on the flip side, there are other songs -  lovely  songs by artists he enjoys - that he rejects outright. He despises Keith Urban's \" Everybody \" so much that he made me cross out the song title on the CD case and on the disc itself before he'd listen to any of the other songs. (I asked him why he didn't like it. His reply: \"It makes me strain.\") I'm afraid this all might serve as irrefutable evidence that my sweet little boy is turning into a GUY, but that's a post for another time. It's actually exciting to me that Bud is forging his own musical identity, and I want to help him follow his passions and explore the best of what the musical world has to offer. But lately, in addition to his good-old-boy country rocking, he's been tuning in to a genre that I know absolutely nothing about: Bluegrass. I first noticed that Bud was spending a lot of time listening to the Dierks Bentley  album tracks  that are heavily influenced by bluegrass. Then one day we were surfing iTunes together and he discovered the album  Pickin' on   Dierks Bentley: A Bluegrass Tribute . We listened to the 30-second clips and I told Bud he could choose a couple to download, but he was insistent: he needed to have them all. He loves them. Yesterday, when he talked me into downloading Brooks and Dunn's \"Play Something Country\" for him, he caught a glimpse of the  Pickin' on Brooks and Dunn  tribute that's available on iTunes. I surfed away quickly enough to distract him, but I know it's only a matter of time before he discovers the whole (seemingly infinite)  Pickin' On  series. Now, I don't want to be critical of the folks behind the  Pickin' On  empire, but they credit themselves only as \"Various Artists.\" As I've said, I'm no bluegrass expert, but my hunch is that  Pickin' On  is not the very best that bluegrass has to offer. I just don't know what is. I put out the call to Bud's dad, who tends to know a lot about a lot of different kinds of music, and I'm casting a wide net out here to the blogosphere. Perhaps one of my regular readers is also a bluegrass aficionado. Or perhaps if I use the word \"bluegrass\" enough in this post - in phrases like \"you just HAVE to hear this great bluegrass artist\" or \"this is the greatest bluegrass musician of all time,\" my Google hit will be high enough that some bluegrass junkies will surf on in and give me some tips. So, bluegrass fans, tell me, please: My son and I are looking for the best in bluegrass. Where do we begin?

"21219" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/08/04/another-example-of-the-workings-of-the-vaccine-court/" "Another example of the workings of the vaccine court" "This doesn’t involve the autism cases.  Instead it is about the Hepatitis B omnibus proceeding which is also ongoing.  It does involve some familiar names: Clifford Shoemaker (attorney), Dr. Mark Geier and his son David Geier.   It does give us some insight into the billing practices of these gentlemen. As background I’ll note that Clifford Shoemaker  subpoenaed  blogger Kathleen Seidel of Neurodiversity.com.  He ended up being  sanctioned  for that action. Dr. Mark Geier has been a frequent consultant to Mr. Shoemaker’s cases in the vaccine court.   Ms. Seidel  has covered some of the cases before where Dr. Geier has participated. David Geier has so far not been compensated as a consultant to the Court. In a recent case,  Quinton O. Riggins, Jr. v. Secretary of HHS , we can see some of the decision processes involved in awarding fees to attorneys and consultants in the Court. The application was for a total of $221,211.34: On April 1, 2008, petitioner’s counsel, Clifford Shoemaker, filed an Application for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (hereinafter referenced to as Petitioner’s Application), requesting a total of $221,211.34 in attorneys’ fees and costs. Counsel requests $16,592.16 in fees and costs related to the above-captioned matter, and $204,619.18 in fees and costs related to the “general hepatitis B proceedings.” Of this, about $96k was paid: Accordingly, petitioner is entitled to the following award for fees and costs for efforts in the Riggins case and for efforts on the hepatitis B cases in general: $95,801.72 for attorney’s fees and costs to be paid by check payable to petitioner and petitioner’s counsel; and $528.25 in petitioner’s costs to be paid by check payable to petitioner. The Clerk shall enter judgment accordingly. The analysis of the application is lengthy. I will quote some sections below. In regards to Mark and David Geier: “Petitioner’s counsel requests $110,386.73 in costs related to S&A’s general hepatitis B work, of which counsel has earmarked $97,443.43 as costs (for fees and expenses) owed to Dr. Mark Geier and his son, David Geier.” In the end, Dr. Mark Geier was paid $10,000 and David Geier was not compensated. In denying payment to David Geier, who holds a bachelors degree, the Special Master noted: “In summary, the undersigned finds the costs for David Geier’s efforts to be obviously unreasonable as Mr. Geier is not qualified to address the medical issues involved in the Program and his work was duplicative of the efforts by Dr. Geier. Thus, the undersigned denies the request for costs for David Geier in its entirety.” In regards to Dr. Mark Geier: However, Dr. Geier’s qualifications as an expert, testimony in the Program, and credentials, have been subject of considerable criticism over the years by the court. The undersigned questioned his expertise as far back as 1991. Daly v.Sec’y of HHS, No. 90-590V, 1991 WL 154573, at *7 (Cl. Ct. Spec. Mstr. July 26, 1991) (“[T]his court is inclined to not allow Dr. Geier to testify before it on issues of Table injuries. Dr. Geier clearly lacks the expertise to evaluate the symptomatology of the Table injuries and render an opinion thereon.”). More recently, in a published Order, my colleague, Special Master Vowell, addressed this criticism, as well as her concerns regarding petitioners utilizing medical articles authored by Dr. Geier, as follows: 
 I found that the articles authored by Dr. Geier unpersuasive and not scientifically sound, based on my prior reading of the articles and critiques of them. I am also aware that Dr. Geier is trained as a geneticist and obstetrician, not an immunologist, epidemiologist, or rheumatologist, and that my fellow special masters and several other judges have opined unfavorably on his qualifications and testimony as an expert. It appears that since the Court has found that Dr. Geier is not qualified as an “expert”, he was retained as a “consultant”.  However, he appears to have acted in ways overstepping the bounds of “counsultant”. In the instant matter, the undersigned finds it was reasonable (and appropriate) for counsel to consult with Dr. Geier in a limited manner regarding the hepatitis B claims. Those efforts would entail Dr. Geier performing an initial review of the counsel’s hepatitis B claims and some initial research regarding vaccine injuries resulting from hepatitis B vaccine. Dr. Geier would then educate counsel as to the nature of the issues and the types of experts required. However, once Dr. Geier performed an initial review of these claims for counsel, and once counsel began reaching out to doctors who would ultimately serve as experts in S&A’s hepatitis B claims, it was no longer reasonable for Dr. Geier to be billing hours and incurring costs in S&A’s general hepatitis B efforts. Dr. Geier at this point was moving well beyond the role of a consultant.14 Thus by the beginning of 2002, when Mr. Shoemaker began to meet with experts15 to assist in the prosecution of the hepatitis B claims, Dr. Geier’s work on behalf of S&A’s general hepatitis B efforts was no longer needed and should have concluded. Because of this, Dr. Geier was compensated at a reasonable amount for his consulting activities. The undersigned notes an award of $10,000.00 represents an almost 90% reduction of the invoice submitted by the Geiers in this matter. The award of $10,000.00 is reasonable for Dr. Geier’s consultant efforts, and thus should not be viewed as a “reduction,” but viewed as reasonable compensation for Dr. Geier’s role as a consultant. The time not compensated is time largely spent by Dr. Geier duplicating the efforts of the experts, duplicating his own work, or performing work as an expert (work he is not qualified to perform). Stated another way, once experts were identified and became involved, Dr. Geier’s role as a consultant ended. Mr. Shoemaker requested $221,211.34 in fees and costs: On April 1, 2008, petitioner’s counsel, Clifford Shoemaker, filed an Application for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (hereinafter referenced to as Petitioner’s Application), requesting a total of $221,211.34 in attorneys’ fees and costs. Counsel requests $16,592.16 in fees and costs related to the above-captioned matter, and $204,619.18 in fees and costs related to the “general hepatitis B proceedings.” The court found that $64,254.45 was reasonable. Here is an example of a charge that was denied: The 5/30/2006 entry bills 0.5 hours to “[r]eview excel chart and update information; transfer information needed for SC to laptop,” P. App at 18. The “transfer information needed for SC to laptop” entry was explained by counsel asconstituting mere seconds and thus not administrative overhead. P Resp at 2, fn 1. However, counsel failed to address the remainder of the entry and identify what excel chart he was updating and how that activity was relevant to Mr. Riggins’ case. However, far more egregiously, counsel has billed for this exact same activity on precisely the same date twice before in two separate hepatitis B cases. Trips to France and Italy were also excluded: Another extreme example of counsel’s error in billing judgment is the request by counsel for fees and costs billed by Dr. Mark Geier and David Geier for trips to France and Italy in the summer of 2005 and winter of 2006 respectively, and for Mr. Shoemaker to travel to France with the Geiers in the summer of 2005. These requests represent a complete abdication of billing judgment. 
 Dr. Geier and Mr. Geier together billed a total of over $20,000.00, P App at 62-63, to travel along with Mr. Shoemaker to France and meet with various doctors and lawyers to discuss adverse events following the hepatitis B vaccination. Dr. Geier, in his affidavit, and counsel in Petitioner’s Sur-Reply, allege it was necessary to travel to France to discuss the doctors’ and lawyers’ experiences and research relating to adverse reactions stemming from the hepatitis B vaccination, and that this information could only be obtained in “face-to-face” discussions. In addition, Dr. Geier and Mr. Geier together billed $23,690.00 to travel to Italy to attend the 5th International Conference of Autoimmunity. Petitioner argues in Petitioner’s Response that the Geiers were invited to present their research at the conference by Dr. Shoenfeld, a leading expert in autoimmunity, and that at the conference they were able to secure Dr. Shoenfeld’s services as an expert in counsel’s cases. Petitioner further alleges the Geiers were able to discuss autoimmune disorders with experts at the conference and further “expedite the prosecution of various hepatitis b cases.” P Resp at 12. and Additionally, the Geiers provided absolutely no supporting documentation, such as receipts, to evidence the $9,399.68, see P App at 60, they allege they incurred in costs for airline tickets, other transportation costs, parking, hotel, “daily expenses,” food, and conference fees during these trips. P App at 61-62. By itself, this failure justifies not awarding these costs. Many expenses for Mr. Shoemaker were questioned by the Special Master.  Some based on the lack of adequate justification for the costs: Petitioner’s counsel has failed to provide adequate information for the undersigned to determined exactly what the costs represent and whether or not the costs were reasonably incurred. No receipts are provided for any of these expenses. For example, for what did counsel pay costs to Federal Express? Who traveled to Boston and stayed at the Ritz Carlton? What expert was met with in Boston? Who traveled to Florida? And what attorney was met with in Florida? Other expenses were considered to be “overhead” Respondent objects to five hours of time billed by counsel for “‘meeting with consultants about scanning issues’” on April 19, 2000; one hour of time billed by counsel for “‘review[ing] computer breakdowns and update computer field’” on October 8, 2002; and three hours of time billed by counsel for a “consultation with Legal Nurses Association to discuss reviewing cases and preparing chronologies” on September 19 and 21, 2001. R Opp at 17; see also R Reply at 7. Respondent objects to these billings on the basis that the billings are administrative in nature, “more properly categorized as overhead” and would benefit “all petitioners represented by [counsel’s] firm.” Id. The undersigned agrees. The entire decision is 37 pages long, detailing the requests for reimbursments, fees and costs.

			 We all know the meaning of \"ambulance-chasing lawyer\".  Well, there's a sub-species: lawyers who foment false vaccine-injury claims.  Clifford Shoemaker is a prime example of the sub-species, as Kathleen Seidel has  so ably documented . 

 You will recall the  furore on behalf of Kathleen Seidel , when Shoemaker issued an alarming subpoena for Seidel's records.  

 The New Hampshire U.S. District Court  sanctioned Shoemaker for the subpoena Clifford J. Shoemaker’s action is an abuse of legal process, a waste of judicial resources and an unnecessary waste of the time and expense to the purported deponent. 

 The Clerk of Court is directed to forward a certified copy of this order, the motion to quash, the show cause order, and the response of Shoemaker and Seidel to the appropriate professional conduct committee of the Virginia State Bar in order that it may be made aware of Clifford J. Shoemaker’s conduct and so that those authorities may take whatever action they deem appropriate.  Good news, indeed.

"22613" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2008/04/04/autism-omnibus-special-masters-speak/" "Autism Omnibus: Special Masters Speak" "A new document  has been uploaded to the Autism Omnibus hearing section by the Special Masters. It regards the Poling case. I want to pick out a couple of sections (thanks to M and MS for this tip): We do note, however, that under the statutory provision in question,information from a Vaccine-Act proceeding may be disclosed if the person who supplied such information provides “express written consent” for such disclosure. 42 U.S.C. 5 300aa-12(d)(4)(A). Thus, for example, in the six autism “test cases” discussed above, we are able to disclose the names of the cases in this pdate, because the families in question have provided such “express written consent.” Therefore, in the case that is the subject of the media reports, if the parties who supplied documents and information in the case provide their written consent, we may then be able to appropriately disclose documents in the case. Until such consent is provided, however, we cannot disclose any information.  We reiterate that this court has issued no decision on the issue of vaccine causation of autism And: In recent weeks, there have been a number of reports in the media concerning a certain Vaccine Act case, currently pending before the court.  Some of those reports have erroneously stated that the Office of the Special Masters has recently issued a “decision,” “opinion,” or “ruling” concerning the issue of whether a Vaccine Act claimant’s autism symptoms were caused by one or more vaccinations.

The PSC hired experts to help their case.  Mark and David Geier did not serve as experts on the OAP but felt that they deserved compensation.  $600,000 in compensation.  Nearly 10% of the total costs for the OAP. Thanks to Left Brain/Right Brain commenter Anne , we now know  the Geiers lost this suit . The Geiers presented eight counts, and failed to make them stick Count I — Breach of Contract; 
Count II — Joint Venturer Liability for Breach of Contract; 
Count III — Ratification; 
Count IV — Implied Contract; 
Count V — Unjust Enrichment; 
Count VI — Joint and Several Liability for Professional Negligence (Malpractice); 
Count VII — Civil Conspiracy for Fraud; and 
Count VIII — Breach of Implied Warranty. Here are some excerpts from the decision: In sum, the Geiers have failed to present a factual basis for the Court’s exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over the Law Firms Even if the Court has personal jurisdiction over the Law Firms due to their continuous and systematic contacts with the District of Columbia, it is necessary to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim. The Geiers’ malpractice claim is based on the disingenuous assertion that the agreement to assist the Geiers in petitioning the Vaccine Court for fee payment created an attorney-client relationship between the Geiers and the Law Firms. This allegation is not “plausible on its face.”  The Geiers’ civil conspiracy allegations are threadbare accusations that fail to state a claim, see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, let alone meet the heightened pleading standard required by Rule 9(b).  One does wonder where the future lies for the Geiers.  Mark Geier (the father and doctor of the team)  is 65  and could retire.  David Geier (the son who holds a B.A.) is a bit young for retirement.  Mark Geier’s  medical licenses have been suspended .  The Special Masters in the vaccine court have made it clear that neither Geier is qualified to act as an  expert  or a  consultant .  And, now, the Geiers have burned bridges with many of the attorneys in the vaccine court.  I’ve heard that the Geier address in Florida is registered as a mail order pharmacy. —

 Judge Sanctions Lawyer for Issuing Subpoena to Blogger Kathleen Seidel 
 June 23rd, 2008 
by David Ardia 
 A federal magistrate judge in New Hampshire has  sanctioned  Clifford Shoemaker, a Virginia attorney, for abusing the legal process by issuing a  subpoena  to Kathleen Seidel. Seidel publishes the blog  Neurodiversity , where she writes about autism issues. In February 2008, she wrote about a lawsuit against various vaccine manufacturers,  Sykes v. Bayer , in which the plaintiffs Lisa and Seth Sykes sought to link exposure to mercury to their son’s autism. (For more on her statements about the lawsuit, see my previous post:  Blogger Kathleen Seidel Fights Subpoena Seeking Information About Vaccine Litigation .) 
 On March 24, 2008, Shoemaker, an attorney for the Sykes, served Seidel with a  subpoena  in connection with the Sykes v. Bayer lawsuit. The subpoena demanded that Seidel appear for a deposition on April 30, 2008, and that she produce a shockingly broad collection of information, including her bank statements, tax returns, communications with religious organizations, and personal correspondence with other bloggers. 
 On April 21, magistrate judge Muirhead granted Seidel’s well argued  motion to quash  the subpoena. The judge also ordered Shoemaker to show cause why he should not be sanctioned under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11  for issuing the subpoena.  In response, Shoemaker filed a rambling  opposition  to potential sanctions in which he asserted that Seidel was engaged in a conspiracy with Bayer and others to harass him, his client, and various witnesses.  (With the help of Paul Levy from  Public Citizen , Seidel filed a restrained  response  that made Shoemaker’s outlandish claims seem all the more, well, outlandish.) 
 Not surprisingly, the judge didn’t buy any of Shoemaker’s conspiracy theories and in a strongly worded opinion, made it clear that the subpoena was an abuse of the legal process: 
 Mr. Shoemaker made no attempt to avoid imposing an undue burden or expense on Ms. Seidel. To the contrary, I find that he sought to burden her by requiring production of every scrap of paper related to autism, her web site, her tax returns, and her communications with the government. He improperly imposes a requirement to create documents, e.g., a list of “names of persons helping, paying or facilitating . . . these endeavors.” The documentation sought is exhaustive. . . . 
 Shoemaker has not offered a shred of evidence to support his speculations. He has, he says, had his suspicions aroused because she has so much information. Clearly he is unfamiliar with the extent of the information which a highly-competent librarian like Ms. Seidel can, and did, accumulate. If Shoemaker wanted to know if Ms. Seidel was in part supported by or provided information by Bayer, he could have inquired of Bayer or limited the Seidel subpoena to that information. Instead he issued the subpoena calling for production of documents and a deposition on the day before he stipulated to dismiss the underlying suit with prejudice. His failure to withdraw the subpoena when he clearly knew that suit was over is telling about his motives. His efforts to vilify and demean Ms. Seidel are unwarranted and unseemly. 
 In the end, the judge didn’t order Shoemaker to pay a monetary sanction, but he did order the Virginia lawyer to attend ethics training and directed his court clerk to notify the Virginia State Bar so that it could consider disciplinary action on its own.  
 Shoemaker and his client have a right to disagree with Seidel and, if they think they’ve been the victims of a conspiracy, to sue her.  But they don’t have a right to misuse the legal system to coerce a critic to “shut up.”  As I’ve  noted  before, we all lose when we allow that to happen.

"For right or wrong, better or worse, the Hannah Poling case is being closely watched by the autism community.   Recently, much of the discussion has centered on the fact that we don’t have a lot of the details. Back in April,  the court released a document detailing some of the discussions involving the release of information.  You can read about it in the document and in Kev’s blog post about it.  But, it seems to boil down to 1) the Polings would like the government’s expert reports made public.  If that happened, the Poling’s would release their daughter’s medial records, but only for the HHS to discuss.  The medical records would not in themselves be made public. 2) The HHS would like ” to disclose medical information regarding this case* in order for the Secretary to address inaccurate statements that were being made publicly concerning respondent’s position in this case.” 3) The Special Master (judge) notes that since the government’s expert reports have already been released to the public (in one case, posted in full on the internet), the question of making them public is moot. The Special Master deferred ruling on the question (“styled as a motion for complete transparancy” by the Polings) until June 9.  That date has come and gone.  Nothing has been made public from either side as far as I can tell.  However, on June 12, the following entry was made in the Hannah Poling Docket: MEDICAL RECORDS [Exhibit(s) #73?78] filed by TERRY POLING. (Attachments: # 1 Index, # 2 Exhibit EXH73, # 3 Exhibit EXH74, # 4 Exhibit EXH75, # 5 Exhibit EXH76?1, # 6 Exhibit EXH76?2, # 7 Exhibit EXH77, # 8 Exhibit EXH78)(Shoemaker, Clifford) (Entered: 06/12/2008) Hannah Poling’s medical records have been turned over, apparantly for the HHS to review.   Based on the docket, it appears that HHS up until now has only had the expert reports as reference [edit: note comments below and  another post –the previous statement was incorrect] I hope that if not “complete transparancy”, at least “some transparency” will be forthcoming in this case.

"20838" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/10/02/is-the-end-of-the-omnibus-autism-proceeding-near/" "Is the end of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding near?" "The  Omnibus Autism Proceeding  (OAP or omnibus) is the way the  Court of Federal Claims  (vaccine court) has been handling the now 5,000+ claims submitted for autism as a vaccine injury.  The Omnibus started officially in July of 2002 with  Autism General Order #1 .   Along the way it was decided that the best way to handle the large number of claims was using “test cases”.  Three test cases were heard for each of two “causation theories”.    The idea was that “general causation” arguments could be made once, and very thoroughly, and the other cases could be decided on the outcome. The first causation theory was that the MMR vaccine in combination with thimerosal could result in autism.  The test cases for this theory were those of  Michelle Cedillo ,  William Yates Hazelhurst  and  Colten Snyder .    Attorneys for the families presented evidence for a mechanism where thimerosal was proposed to reduce the immune response and the MMR vaccine led to a persistent measles infection which, again as proposed, led to symptoms of autism.  In all three cases the special masters (judges) ruled against the petitioner families.   They found that the evidence did not support the mechanism proposed.  The second causation theory held that thimerosal in vaccines could result in autism.  Three test cases were presented, again with individual and general causation evidence.   The test cases,  Jordan King and William Meade , and  Colin Dwyer  were heard.  Their attorneys argued that mercury from the thimerosal in the vaccines accumulated in the brains and resulted in neuroinflammation which, in turn, resulted in autism.   As with the MMR case, the special masters ruled against the petitioner families.   To put it simply: all the data and all the experts that could be put together to support the idea that vaccines cause autism weren’t persuasive.  They came up with two stories (MMR and thimerosal) and neither story made a case that was even close (the special master’s word). Some of the petioners appealed.  Some appealed to multiple levels.  The appeals were denied. The Court recently issued an  update letter .  I quote part of it below: As described above in part I of this Update, all of the court rulings in the six test cases described above have found no causal link between autism and MMR vaccines and/or thimerosal containing vaccines. Further, the PSC has informed the special masters that no additional OAP test cases are contemplated. 
 Therefore, the Office of Special Masters has begun discussions with members of the petitioners’ bar and respondent’s counsel about how best to conclude the approximately 4,700 autism cases remaining open on the court’s docket. To aid in that process, some petitioners’ counsel have contacted all of their OAP clients to advise them of the results in the test cases and to recommend a course of action with regard to their claims. Additionally, all petitioners who are not represented by counsel have been ordered to inform the court either that they wish to dismiss their claim or that they intend to proceed with their case. For petitioners who wish to continue with their claim, orders to identify a theory of causation, produce an expert report, and file additional evidence will follow. Petitioners’ counsel who have not yet done so are encouraged to contact their clients and determine how their clients wish to proceed. 
 The issue of attorneys’ fees and costs for petitioners’ counsel is part of the discussion about how to conclude proceedings on the OAP petitions. Mediation efforts are underway to develop methods to resolve the fees and costs issues, and a report on the progress in these talks is expected at the October judicial conference. The special masters are assuming that no one will go forward with the MMR and thimerosal theories.  Since those theories don’t hold up in court, it seems a good assumption.   Petitioners can still go forward as individual cases, as in any non-omnibus case.  They will need to submit records and a theory of causation and support that theory in hearing. The PSC (petitioner’s steering committee, a group of lawyers which has managed the Omnibus from petitioner’s side) has decided that no additional OAP (Omnibus) test cases are planned. This is very important.  They have no other theories to present.  They don’t plan to present “too many too soon”.  They don’t plan to present a Wakefield-like theory of persistent measles infections leading to “leaky guts”.  They don’t plan to present a “mitochondrial autism” theory. This last bit is very important.  The Hannah Poling case made a lot of news when it was leaked that the government had conceded her case as a table-injury MMR encephalopathy.  She was supposed to be one of the three thimerosal test cases.   At the time of the concession and since, it was asserted that her case was “not rare” and that the attorneys were prepared to go ahead with the mitochondrial disorder story.  It would appear that there are not many (if any) other “Hannah Poling” cases out there.  There is at least one family pursuing a variation of the mitochondrial disorder theory.  Alexander Krakow was scheduled to be a test case for the thimerosal theory and his family pulled out of the Omnibus to pursue the mitochondrial theory.  While there may be a case or two that we hear about from here on out, it appears that the Omnibus, the “class action” type phase, is over.

"21114" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/15/audio-of-the-cedillo-appeal-part-1/" "Audio of the Cedillo appeal part 1" "The vaccine court case of Michelle Cedillo is apparently the last one of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding which is still undergoing appeals.  I wrote about the appeal  recently on LeftBrainRightBrain , but those were responding to second-hand accounts of the hearing. With thanks to  commenter Anne , the audio is here: Cedillo appeal arguments Below are notes I took on the first part of the hearing–the part where the lawyer from the Michelle Cedillo (also representing the rest of the petitioners) was speaking.  I’ll get to the second half shortly. I tried to put my own commentary in italics. Suffice it to say, the notion that the petitioners presented compelling arguments and the judges were entirely favorable to them isn’t born out from the audio. Ms. Chin-Caplan (attorney for the petitioners, including Michelle Cedillo) argued that the rules of the civil procedure do not apply in the vaccine court and that the government used them as “a club and a shield”. She complains that the government required them to go to a foreign jurisdiction (the UK) to obtain documents.   I found that odd in light of the fact that the petitioners  did  try to obtain documents from the UK as early as 2004.  In response to the complaint that the Special Masters required the petitioners to work with this foreign jursidction, the judge asks if the petitioners filed a motion (under rule 26) to compel the government to produce the documents.  Ms. Chin-Caplan argued that the Federal rules of procedure do not apply in the vaccine court.  The judge responded “that’s not quite true”.  Under rule 7 of the vaccine rules, Ms. Chin-Caplan could have asked that the Federal rules be followed.  The judge asked if the petioners made a motion to follow those rules. The judge asks, since they wanted the underlying data why didn’t Ms. Chin-Caplan ask the Special Masters to “please compel the government to bring in the underlying data”.  Rules were in place to do that, but the petitioners didn’t do this.  Ms. Chin-Caplan discusses that they worked with counsel in the UK for advice on how to proceed in the UK.  However, they gave up before filing for the documents. Ms. Chin-Caplan argues that lack of due process was “pervasive” in the proceeding. One judge asks what other pervasive violations of due process  existed.    She referred back to the same situation about Dr. Bustin.   In other words, she dodged the question of “pervasiveness”.    Judge–weren’t you given the opportunity to follow-up and to question and challenge the testimony?  Ms. Chin-Caplan talks about how new information was presented at the hearing.   She doesn’t discuss the opportunity to challenge the testimony in post-hearing briefs. Judge–points out that the petitioners didn’t follow through on all avenues to get the material from the UK.   The petitioners abandoned the opportunity to request the material from the UK based on advice from the counsel they consulted with in the UK.  In other words, they didn’t actually try to get the courts in the UK to unseal the documents. Judge Lyn notes that there was a concession that Mr. Conway (Ms Chin-Caplan’s colleague in this case) conceded that the lack of access to these documents  did not  prejudice the case.   Ms. Chin-Caplan is stuck trying to argue that her own colleague’s concession was incorrect. Ms. Chin-Caplan argued that the test-cases were supposed have the “general causation” arguments only made during the Cedillo hearing, not the Snyder hearing.  Thus, when Dr. Rima testified in the Snyder hearing, council for the Cedillos were not present.  Ms. Chin-Caplan argues that Dr. Rima presented a calculation based on information about Michelle Cedillo and that this was in error.  She further argues that since she was not present for this hearing, she didn’t know about that until the decision was handed down and it included reference to this testimony. I find it very odd that her argument is that she wasn’t following the other test cases in the Omnibus. Ms. Chin-Caplan argues that she submitted the alleged Rima miscalculation–and added more post-hearing information that should have been admitted.  This was filed for reconsideration of the decision.  This includes a textbook by Prof. Zimmerman of the Kennedy Kreiger Institute and a paper. The Judges point out that much of the information was available before the decisions were handed down.  Ms. Chin-Caplan argues that the Special Master didn’t have time to read the textbook (it came out a month before the decisions). One of the judges points out that the petitioners would still have a difficult time with the present state of the science proving their case. Ms. Chin-Caplan notes that the Althen standard: that they have to present a plausible theory of events and have a timeline. Ms. Chin-Caplan makes a statement I have a difficult time parsing: “Plausibility to some people for whatever reason seems to mean “possible”.  But plausibility in the  scientific and medical world means that  it makes sense  from a thinking it through from a scientific and medical standpoint that this can occur.” Ms. Chin-Caplan discusses the theory they have for MMR causing injury in Miss Cedillo.  A judge points out that Ms. Chin-Caplan appears to asking them to reweigh the evidence, which isn’t their job. I would argue that Ms. Chin-Caplan and the others in the OAP did not present a plausible theory for how MMR would cause autism.  Multiple witnesses for the government showed how each leg of their theory was implausible.

"21961" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/08/11/autism-omnibus-cedillo-appeal-denied/" "Autism Omnibus: Cedillo appeal denied" "In the Autism Omnibus Proceeding there were three “test case” hearings to decide if autism can be considered a “vaccine injury” due to MMR.  In all three cases, the special masters (judges) decided that there wasn’t enough evidence.  In fact, it “wasn’t even close”.   All three have been appealed.  The  first appeal was denied  a few weeks ago. 
 
The second appeal decision is in , for the test case that was the hearing for Michelle Cedillo.  This case had the most “general causation” information and so was the most complicated. As with the Hazelhurst appeal document, this document is a very good summary of the hearing.   Here is the summary of the appeal arguments: The Cedillos assert seven arguments in their motion for review to show that the Special Master’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law: (1) A panel of three Special Masters should not have heard the general causation evidence; (2) The Special Masters should not have allowed the last-minute expert reports and testimony of Dr. Stephen Bustin; (3) The Special Master improperly discounted the medical diagnoses and opinions of Michelle Cedillo’s treating physicians; (4) The Special Master improperly ignored concessions made by Respondent’s expert witnesses; (5) The Special Master ignored important aspects of Michelle Cedillo’s evidence; (6) The Special Master abused his discretion by refusing to consider important post-hearing evidence; and (7) the Special Master’s decision was contrary to law. Petitioners’ arguments four and five include multiple sub-parts, specifically raising the testimony of six expert witnesses and seven substantive areas of Petitioners’ evidence that the Special Master allegedly mis-evaluated. Probably the key to the entire MMR-causes-autism idea, and the first subject that the appeals judge covered was the question of whether measles virus can be considered to persist in intestinal tissue.  The petitioners case in this respect depends heavily on  studies by Dr. Wakefields group  and samples taken from Michelle Cedillo which both rely on the Unigenetics laboratory of Dr. O’Leary.  Without the test results of the Unigenetics Laboratory, Petitioners have lost a cornerstone to their causation theory. The fact that Petitioners did not prove the existence of any persistent vaccine-strain measles in Michelle Cedillo’s body leaves Petitioners well short of meeting their prima facie case that the MMR vaccine played any role in causing Michelle’s autism. Under these circumstances, Petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, and thus the burden never shifted to Respondent to rebut Petitioners’ proof. See Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278. The Special Master’s decision regarding the Uhlmann Study and the Unigenetics testing is reasonable in all respects, and could not in any sense be regarded as arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Since the MMR test cases were heard,  another very important study has been published , further showing that there is a lack of persistent measles virus in children with autism and bowel problems. Without going into the details on the other points in the decision, we can jump to the conclusion and see that it is succinct and clear: The issue before our Court is not to determine the causes of autism. The Court can only hope that medical professionals succeed in identifying the causes and developing a cure for this tragic disease. Rather, the Court’s task is to weigh the Special Master’s February 12, 2009 decision under the applicable review standards of the Vaccine Act, and determine whether it should affirm or modify the decision to any extent. After performing this review, the Court is satisfied that the Special Master’s decision is rational and reasonable in all respects, and is in accordance with law. For the reasons addressed above, the Special Master’s decision is AFFIRMED. Or, to put it more succinctly: Petitioners still have the burden of proving their claims by a preponderance of the evidence, and the Special Master reasonably concluded that they failed to do so. There is still one more MMR appeal in the works. Given the results of the first two, my guess is that the attorneys are preparing for the next step in the journey towards a civil case. Without more evidence to support their case, I would have serious doubts about the MMR hypothesis winning in a civil trial.  Since the omnibus hearing, there is more good evidence against the MMR hypothesis and the plaintiffs will face more stringent evidence rules.

"21134" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/16/audio-of-the-cedillo-appeal-part-2/" "Audio of the Cedillo appeal part 2" "We’ve recently discussed the first part of the audio from the Cedillo appeal (the part where Miss Cedillo’s attorney was speaking) in  Audio of the Cedillo appeal part 1 .  Here I share notes on the second half of the audio: where the government’s attorney is speaking. I should have done this before, but a little nomenclature: 
The U.S. Government is represented by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  She doesn’t actually take part, but is represented by attorneys from the Department of Justice (DoJ).  The government is referred to as the “Respondent” in these proceedings. The Cedillo family is represented by their attorney, Ms. Chin-Caplan.  Michelle Cedillo is the “petitioner”.  Her case is one of the “test cases” heard in the portion of the hearings to determine if MMR causes autism.  Her case served two purposes.  First, to argue that in her specific situation vaccines resulted in some or all of her conditions.  This is referred to as “specific causation”.  Second, her case presented evidence on the general question of whether the MMR (alone or with Thimerosal) could cause autism.  This is referred to as “general causation”. Ms. Chin-Caplan is working as both the attorney for Ms. Cedillo and as a member of the “Petitioner’s Steering Committee” or PSC, which is the association of attorneys working with the 5,000 plus families who filed petitions claiming autism as a vaccine injury.  Those 5000 plus cases are grouped in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding, or for short: OAP, or “Omnibus”. Again, my observations are added in italics. The DoJ attorney didn’t even finish her introduction before one of the judges jumped in to ask about the fact that in a regular civil court, the underlying documents would have to be produced or Prof. Bustin’s testimony would be excluded.  The fact remains that in the vaccine court, that rule (rule 26) does not apply.  As noted in the first half of the audio, the PSC attorneys could have asked for those rules to apply but they did not do so. The judge goes on to say that it was the government’s responsibility under the federal rules to obtain the documents to support the testimony. I will add here that I am somewhat unclear if these are the Federal rules for the vaccine court, or the Federal rules (e.g. Rule 26) for the civil court.  It sounds to me like they are the rules for the civil court. The DoJ attorney noted that they tried to get everything from the UK litigation.  All the expert reports and information.  However, the solicitors they were working with in the UK suggested that their petition was too broad and would be denied.  So, on advice of those solicitors, the DoJ narrowed the request down to only the three expert reports. It sounds to me as though the DoJ attorneys were possibly unaware that the evidence–in this case the actual lab notebooks from the Unigenetics laboratory–were not going to be produced in full with the expert report.  Even if so, I don’t see this really as an excuse.   However, some of the pages which Prof. Bustin used in his testimony were reproduced.  These include pages that showed that Unigenetics made corrections after the dates on the notebooks.   Another observation: the laboratory notebooks are not all of the information from which Stephen Bustin made his report and it is not all the information which he used to form his testimony in the Cedillo case.  Not all of his testimony would be excluded without the full laboratory books, in my opinion.  Prof. Bustin spent considerable time investigating Unigenetics The DoJ attorney noted that they went to the UK to obtain the information only after they learned that the Unigenetics laboratory results constituted a key part of the petitioner’s case–four months before the case was heard.  They had to “hussle” to get the information unsealed.  The judge asked if the DoJ had a responsibility to inform the petitioners of their intent to obtain this information.  The DoJ stated that she did not believe that was the case. The full witness list for the government was not finalized and made public until shortly before the proceeding.   One list of potential witnesses  was made available to the petitioners in March 2007–four months before the hearing–but that list is not public.   The final list for both sides  was made public on June 12, 2007.  To me, this may indicate that the DoJ attorneys were *not* required to give more lead time on their witnesses or strategy. The petitioner’s attorneys were given a year after the hearing to request the lab notebooks from the UK.  DoJ attorneys offered to join in the request and the Special Masters wrote a letter of support for the request.  The petitioners never filed an application in an attempt to obtain the documentation. The DoJ attorney stressed again that the Special Master stated that he didn’t need the testimony from Prof. Bustin or some of the other information to make his decision. I keep thinking that in many ways the Special Master should have been present in this appeal.  Both Ms. Chin-Caplan and the DoJ attorney spent a considerable amount of time discussing what the Special Master thought and did.  I realize that is not how appeals work, but as the appeals judges keep saying, this is not supposed to be an adversarial procedure.  The goal is to bring in all the information and weigh it One of the judges made a short speech about how scientific opinion progresses and that new data, new techniques could emerge which might support the petitioners.  The DoJ attorney noted that the Courts can not wait indefinitely for the science.   The petitioners deserve to have cases settled.  First, this is precisely why the evidence standards in the vaccine court are low.  The idea is to give the petitioners the chance to win cases before the evidence is in.  This is what happened in the DTP cases in the early phases of the vaccine court.  Many cases were decided–for the petitioners, mind you–which later evidence showed were not supported.  Second, this is not the purview of the appellate court.  They shouldn’t be deciding on the merits of the evidence but on procedural questions.  Third, as time progresses, the MMR causation theory has only become more implausible.  The Hornig study, for example, came out after the Cedillo trial and was a clear rebuke of the early papers by Wakefield’s team At one point, the DoJ attorney suggested that the underlying data would have buttressed Prof. Bustin’s testimony and she wishes she did have it.  One judge, quite rightly in my opinion, corrected her with “how do we know that?” The Judge asserts that Prof. Bustin relied upon the documents to determine that Unigenetics was “a bad laboratory” I would disagree at this point.  The lab notebooks were *part* of the data Prof. Bustin used to form his opinion.  But, they were not *all* Ms. Chin-Caplan claims that she would have joined the DoJ in their attempt to obtain the documents had she known they were attempting that.  One judge pointed out that she was given a year after the hearing to obtain the documents and failed to even make the attempt.  I don’t see how Ms. Chin-Caplan aiding the DoJ in their attempt would have changed what she is claiming it would have changed.  She demonstrated that she was unable to obtain the documents on her own, so her expertise would not have been helpful.  What this would have done is signaled to her 4 months in advance that the DoJ planned to challenge the quality of the Unigenetics laboratory.  Frankly, that should have come as no surprise.  There was much criticism of the Unigentics laboratory and the resutls in the public arena.   The petitioners were aware of the UK litigation as they had also attempted to get data from that proceeding–and some of the petitioner’s experts had worked on the UK litigation. Ms. Chin-Caplan argues that the one year she was given to obtain the documents was not enough because it was “an impossible task”.  One of the judges points out that she has no way of knowing it was impossible since she didn’t try. Ms Chin-Caplan stated that she didn’t want to waste the taxpayer’s money on an attempt to get the documentation since she wasn’t sure it could be obtained.  She argues that it would be difficult because it involved possibly two foreign jurisdictions. This is a very weak argument.  First, the question of whether she was sure or not really doesn’t apply.  The only thing that would apply is if she was sure are request would be denied.  Second, the idea that she was saving the taxpayer’s money doesn’t really work.  The costs of the appeals far outweigh the savings involved.  Third, the DoJ had already shown that it could obtain documents from the UK litigation in a matter of four months.  The DoJ offered to assist the petitioners, but they apparently did not avail themselves of that opportunity. Another observation: the petitioners relied upon the Unigenetics laboratory.  This is a laboratory which refused to be allow standard inspections to be come an accredited laboratory.  It strikes this observer that it was the responsibility of the petitioners to obtain the laboratory notebooks.  Without them, the DoJ was unable to effectively cross examine their witness who was claiming that Unigenetics was a good laboratory.  That expert, Dr. Kennedy, took part in the UK Litigation, so he too was relying at least in part on data which was not entered into evidence.  The Judge asked Ms. Chin-Caplan if she could have made her case if Dr. Bustin’s testimony were excluded.  Ms. Chin-Caplan claimed that she could  this is counter to what the special master who heard the case and wrote the decision *clearly* wrote in that decision I think it is safe to say that *neither* the DoJ *nor* the petitioner’s attorney came away without some very tough scrutiny by the judges.   More on this appeal can be found in a piece on the VaccinesWork blog,  Appeals Won’t Succeed – Olmsted Isn’t Honest Even though I give away the ending of his excellent post, I quote it here: The Court of Appeal panel in  Hazlehurst   faced roughly the same arguments as the Cedillo panel. The Court of Appeal reviews the trial court decision ‘de novo’, or brand new. If they don’t like the trial court decision, they replace it with theirs. However, the appeals court and the trial court can’t merely replace their judgment for the Special Master.   All quotes below are from the  Court of Appeals decision in Hazlehurst . 
     By statute, the Court of Federal Claims may set aside the special master’s decision “only if the special master’s fact findings are arbitrary and capricious, its legal conclusions are not in accordance with law, or its discretionary rulings are an abuse of discretion.” 
 Appeals courts are very limited in what they can do when they disagree with the facts decided by a trial court (in a criminal matter) or the medical facts (before the Special Master).  But normally the Court of Appeal can substitute its views on admissible evidence for that of the trial court (criminal court) or the Special Masters.  That isn’t the case here, because following the statute that governs the Vaccine Court, Rule 8 states: 
     In receiving evidence, the special master will not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence but must consider all relevant and reliable evidence governed by principles of fundamental fairness to both parties.” Vaccine R. 8(b)(1) (2009). 
 Even if the Court of Appeals thinks that the Special Master was wrong when letting in Dr. Bustin’s testimony after giving the plaintiffs a year to apply to the British for access to the reports, that isn’t enough for them to substitute their opinion for that of the Special Master. 
So there is near zero chance that the appeal would succeed. Dan Olmsted should have said so and explained why.

"21966" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/08/12/autism-omnibus-snyder-appeal-denied/" "Autism Omnibus: Snyder appeal denied" "The appeals for the MMR phase of the Omnibus are now concluded: all three were denied. The Autism Omnibus Proceeding is the way the “Vaccine Court” has taken on the task of deciding the merit of the theory that autism is a vaccine injury.  The petitioners had two basic theories: (a) the MMR vaccine can cause autism and (b) the vaccine preservative thimerosal can cause autism. Three hearings were heard for each theory.  In each hearing a single individual took the role of a “test case”.  So, each hearing not only represented the case of a single child, but also presented “general causation” evidence as to whether MMR or thimerosal could cause autism. The six test cases (three MMR and three thimerosal) have been heard.  The MMR cases were ruled upon, and all three were denied.  All three were appealed.  And, now, all three appeals have been denied. Here is the conclusion of  the appeal for the last of the MMR test cases , that of Colten Snyder: As the special master’s decision makes clear, Colten, and by extension, his family, have dealt with significant adversity for many years, and, like the special master, the court is very sympathetic to their circumstances. However, the court cannot be ruled by emotion and base its determination solely upon the adversity endured by petitioners’ family. Moreover, it is not the task of this court to determine whether vaccines cause autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Rather, the court must decide whether the special master, considering the record as a whole, rendered a decision that was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. She did not. Her decision was entirely rational and fully supported by the record. Thus, the court DENIES petitioners’ motion for review. Pursuant to Vaccine Rule 30(a), the clerk is directed to enter judgment in accordance with this decision. Very solid decision.  The appeal was denied. Looking back through the document one finds that the Judge noted that the case for MMR causing an injury was clearly not supported, and that the Special Master did not make an error in her decision: The court finds no error in the special master’s findings. The special master’s conclusion that petitioners did not present a biologically plausible medical theory is clearly supported by the record. She found that the various aspects of petitioners’ theory were not scientifically sound and that the lynchpin of their theory was wholly unreliable. See id. at *87-93 (petitioners’ theory), 
116-35 (Unigenetics’ reliability). Next, the special master’s conclusion that petitioners had not established a logical sequence of cause and effect is also supported by the record. In a statement reminiscent of the Cedillo hearing (first MMR test case) the Judge noted that the medical records show that the “onset of symptoms” did not occur when the petitioners thought: She [the special master] found that based on the medical records, the onset of Colten’s symptoms did not occur at the time suggested by petitioners. It is worth reading or skimming the decision.  It is a good summary of the case and the evidence presented.  I don’t want to quote much more of the document here, with this exception. Petitioners’ charge–that the special master feared a public backlash against vaccines if she ruled in their favor–is preposterous. There is not a shred of evidence to support petitioners’ claim;70 it rests solely on petitioners’ speculation. Merely because the special master found that petitioners did not carry their burden of proof does not diminish her integrity or render her decision unsupported. Claims of error by a losing party against a decision maker are hardly unusual, but should be grounded in reality. One thing that bothered me greatly was the implication in the appeals that the Special Masters were acting improperly out of some hidden motive such as trying to protect the vaccine program or fear of public backlash.  Sometimes it is difficult for a lay person like myself to understand whether such arguments are expected and “just part of the game” or whether they are attempts to impugn the integrity of the Special Master.  I have read enough comments on other blogs to see that many readers are willing to accept that members of the judiciary could act to deny children due process. I’m glad the Judge in this appeal took  the time to respond to these false allegations.

"21555" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2007/05/30/autism-omnibus-crashing/" "Autism Omnibus crashing?" "Another few points of interest in the Autism Omnibus proceedings. Firstly and perhaps most significantly is the  defining of the Omnibus proceedings  as being at ‘crisis point’ by the Special Masters overseeing the case: Petitioners were supposed to provide (by their own suggestion) test cases that would show, in the first instance, how MMR and thiomersal working in combination would cause autism. Special Masters agreed to this arrangement and dictated that three cases would be needed. So far,  only one  out of the 4,700 cases in the Omnibus can be found. At (the) first status conference in December 20 2006, when the PSC (Petitioners – the parents) first proposed moving to a test case format, Special Master Hastings advised the PSC attorneys that for a ‘test case’ approach to be effective, the PSC would need to offer additional cases, rather than a single test case, for trial. Since that time, the PSC has stated that it will select two such cases, and has represented that it is working diligently on selecting the two cases. At the status conference held on Jan 25 2007, the PSC was orally instructed to designate such cases within 30 days (i.e. by Feb 24 2007). The PSC did not do so. At the status conference held on Feb 28 2007 the PSC representative stated that the teo cases would be designated within seven to ten days. That did not happen. After further discussion, we extended the deadline for designation until March 30 2007. that date, too, passed without any designation. At the status conference held on April 2 2007, the PSC attorney stated that the two cases would be designated on April 6 2007 but no designation was made by that date either We then extended the deadline to March 30, then again May 10, but, still no additional test cases have been designated. So, out of the 4,700 cases filed under the Omnibus, apparently only one can show a theory about how MMR and thiomersal, acting in unison can cause autism. Which is weird considering that its a ‘fact’ amongst adherents of the vaccine hypothesis. And how about that one case – Cedillo – what does that show? …without going into detail, we note that the facts of that one ‘test’ case are fairly unusual and do not appear to be representative of the majority of the cases in the OAP (Omnibus Autism Proceedings). Good grief. Could it be that, from the 4,700 cases in the Omnibus that there are _no cases_ representative of a general theory of how MMR and thiomersal working together cause autism? Back to the Special Masters – the emphasis in this passage is theirs, not mine.: We want to stress that we believe we are at a _crisis point_  in the efforts to move the autism cases towards decision. The Office of Special Masters has adopted the approach toward these cases originally suggested by _petitioners’_ counsel and we have patiently waited almost _five years_ to give that approach a chance to succeed…..Either something must change or we will be required to go to a new approach. And then the bombshell: In the event that petitioners do not promptly come forward with additional test cases to allow us to pursue the ‘test case’ approach described above for handling the autism cases, it appears that the ‘omnibus approach’ to the autism cases may have to be declared a failure. That is some pretty direct language. You’ve had five years, it says, we’ve done everything your way. Now shape up or ship out. Things got worse for petitioners. For years they had been claiming that they couldn’t move forward without certain data (VSD data) being made available to them. It would seem that the Special Masters have seen this for the delaying tactic it clearly is as they have  denied this motion . They have denied it because they (rightly) claim that it is unnecessary and involved a lot of irrelevant data. They also note that petitioners should be able to make a case out of what they have and that petitioners failed to provide a good reason why this data was needed. Special Masters noted: Finally we note that the PSC itself states that ‘the petitioners could very well establish general and individual causation in these Omnibus claims _without epidemiological evidence_ ‘  That’s what bragging gets you I guess. Update: Daubert Ruling The Special Masters  also ruled  on the applicability of Daubert in the Omnibus cases. Before we discuss that, lets have a brief refresher as to what it is. Daubert is a legal precedent in the US that essentially makes the presiding judge the arbiter of good science. They _must_ under Daubert apply a very high standard of science. It speaks volumes that Martha Herbert, Boyd Haley, Mark Geier have all fallen foul of Daubert in the recent past. Under Daubert, Haley and Geier’s science was adjudged to be of such low quality that they never even testified – they were barred from doing so. OK, so. Respondents asked the Special Masters to ensure that Daubert standards were applied to the causation issues in the Omnibus hearings. They even asked that four ‘expert’ witnesses be excluded under Daubert which was a legitimate thing to do. If the Special Master had agreed with that request than that would have been game over for the whole Omnibus hearing. No expert witnesses = no causation = no case. What the Special Master has actually done is not quite that, but Plaintiffs should be very concerned. The Special Masters have agreed that Daubert standards should play an extensive role: I agree with respondent that the principle that scientific evidence must be evaluated for reliability, set forth in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals….does have application to Vaccine Act cases. That is big news. Plaintiffs need to realise that their science is going need to be of the utmost quality. However, the Special masters have decided that this proceeding is procedurally different enough that a small wrinkle should be introduced. This is a non-jury trial. In a jury trial, Daubert can be used (as I mentioned above) to exclude poor quality expert witnesses. This could also happen in a non-jury trial but the Special master has elected to not go that way. What they have decided to do is: I conclude that the best procedure is to hear the testimony of the expert witnesses in question….I can then evaluate the reliability of the expert testimony in question [in the context of Daubert] and determine what weight it should be accorded, if any. So, Daubert will apply, but instead of being used to exclude the possibility of juries hearing poor quality expert witnesses, as this is a non-jury trial, Daubert will be applied directly to the proffered testimony of the expert witnesses. Whichever way you cut it, this is not good for Petitioners. They were staunchly opposed to the Daubert standard being applied at all as they knew it would mean that scientific standards of proof would apply. Standards that Boyd Haley and Mark Geier have already failed to meet in previous thiomersal/autism cases.

"21862" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2008/04/30/poling-vs-hhs-something-is-definitely-beginning-to-smell/" "Poling vs HHS – Something is definitely beginning to smell" "Back in March I wrote a post highlighting my suspicion that  we weren’t getting the whole story  regarding the Poling’s. They had – at that time – failed to give permission to Dr Andrew Zimmerman to discuss the case, despite the fact that he was deply involved in the treatment abd diagnosis of Hannah Poling. He has still – to the best of my knowledge – not been given permission by the Poling’s to speak. I also  blogged Jon Poling’s own words  on the subject of document release: The HHS expert documents that led to this concession and accompanying court documents remain sealed, though our family has already permitted release of Hannah’s records to those representing the almost 5, 000 other autistic children awaiting their day in vaccine court. and pointed out the strange incompatability with what the _court_ said: in the case that is the subject of the media reports, if the parties who supplied documents and information in the case provide their written consent, we may then be able to appropriately disclose documents in the case. where it is made crystal clear that the Poling’s had not in fact provided written consent to release their documents. Further documentation from the courts  has now been released which touches on this issue in more detail. I want to thank M who can choose to name themselves further if they feel like it for helping explain these and for highlighting them in the first place. The basic gist of this document is that *the Poling’s do not want all the information to be released* despite their oft-repeated claim to the contrary. What information do they not want released – and why? Respondent points out in the filed Sur-Reply to Petitioners’ Motion for Complete Transparency of Proceedings (R’s Sur-Reply) that while petitioners “did undertake initial steps 
necessary to permit discussion of their case before the Special Masters presiding in the Omnibus 
Autism Proceeding and before representatives of the Petitioners’ Steering Committee[,] *[i]n fact, 
it is respondent who first approached and asked for petitioners’ consent to permit the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to disclose medical information regarding this case* in order for the 
Secretary to address inaccurate statements that were being made publicly concerning respondent’s position in this case.” Now _this_ is a bombshell. It was _not_ the Poling’s who first wanted to release documents, it was HHS. They asked for the Poling’s consent to permit HHS to disclose medical information in order to ‘address innaccurate statements that were being made publicly’. Well, well. And there’s more. HHS had also heard aboout the press conference the Poling’s intended to hold: Having received no response from petitioners, respondent contacted petitioners’ counsel to inquire about the proposed consent form and to “inquire whether press reports were true that petitioners were planning press conference for the following day.” Petitioners’ counsel replied to respondent, and represented during a status conference in this case, that the reports of a planned press conference were not true…….and two days later they held a press conference and appeared in 
nationally televised and print interviews discussing the case. So they lied about the press conference too. Petitioners Counsel is, of course, one  Clifford Shoemaker . What is going on here? Granted there are pre-conditions HHS also wanted placed upon the release of information but why won’t the Poling’s let key medical details that would ‘address innaccurate statements that were being made publicly’ be released right now? Why do they claim that they are asking for complete disclosure when it is clear they are not? Why did their counsel blatantly lie about the press conference? This is very much an example to me of the ‘muddying of the waters’ that  John Shoffner talked about recently .

This was noted to be incorrect in a  comment , and I appreciate the accurate information. I apologize for taking so long to make the acknowledgment of the mistake more obvious (I had noted it in the comments). The Docket shows that the  expert reports  were filed in December of 2007, 12/11/2007 and 12/13/2007.  This is more than a month after the “Respondent’s Report” on 11/9/2007 (which I assume to be the concession). In searching for those entries, I found a strange entry in the docket.

(Shoemaker, Clifford) (Entered: 12/14/2007) I can see two meanings for this, and both are confusing to me (so are likely incorrect): 1) This is a status report requesting that the expert reports not be filed unless needed for the fee determination.  But, they were already added to the docket.  Would that mean that they would be pulled from the docket? 2) This is a status report on a previously entered request to defer filing the expert reports.  In other words, a request was made previously and this is basically a statement noting that the previous request is no longer valid. There are probably other explanations.  The above are just speculations.  Well, the comment that this entry seems strange to this reader isn’t a speculation, but you get the point, I hope.

 A-CHAMP TO PROVIDE DAILY LEGAL REPORTING ON CEDILLO HEARING IN VACCINE COURT New York, New York June 4, 2007 Contact: Robert J. Krakow, Esq. 516-354-3300 rkrakow@earthlink.net A-CHAMP, an organization that advocates for children with vaccine injuries and autism, is pleased to announce that it will be providing daily reporting and commentary on the proceedings in Cedillo v. The Department of Health and Human Services, the first case to be heard of the more than 4800 pending in the vaccine court’s Omnibus Autism Proceeding. The Cedillo case, which will be heard beginning June 11, 2007 by three Special Masters of the United States Court of Federal Claim will consider one theory relating to the claim that vaccines are a contributing causal factor in autism. Mary Holland, Esq., who teaches law at New York University Law School, will be posting daily commentary on the proceedings on the A-CHAMP blog at http://achampblog.org. Ms. Holland has a child who has been diagnosed with autism but does not have a legal claim pending regarding her child’s disorder. The goal of A-CHAMP’s reporting by Ms. Holland will be to provide incisive and accurate summaries of the proceedings. The proceedings, which are unprecedented in the history of tort litigation, have been a subject of confusion and controversy among parents. We hope that by elucidating the complexities of the proceedings parents will be placed in an improved position to understand the nature of the issues that will be decided in the vaccine court. A-CHAMP will also be posting background articles and relevant documents on its website that will be linked to achampblog.org. As the Cedillo case proceeds A-CHAMP invites those who follow the proceedings to comment on it and on our reporting and commentary. While it has been described as a “test” case the decision in the Cedillo case will not be binding on any other case nor is it necessarily representative of any other case. Many of the facts that likely will emerge in the Cedillo case will also very likely be unique to that case. Nevertheless, as the first legal proceeding in which the substantive claim that vaccines cause autism will be considered, the Cedillo case has historic implications. For that reason and many others ACHAMP will be there to offer information and commentary to interested parents and others.

"22298" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2008/07/12/small-omnibus-updates/" "Small Omnibus updates" "OK,  I am watching this closely enough that I read the small updates. This one  discusses a number of small topics. First , evidence and all arguments are now complete for the  First Theory of Causation .  This is the theory argued last year in the Cedillo, Hazelhurst and Snyder cases.  The theory there was that thimerosal plus the MMR vaccine combine to cause autism. There was some delay as the petitioner’s lawyers (PSC) attempted to get some documents from the UK.  It appears that there was a low likelyhood of that ever happening, so the PSC dropped the request (ceased efforts in that regard). What does this mean?  It means the Special Masters (SM’s) have all the information that they are going to get.  They have already spent a lot of time analyzing what they have, and they expect to make a “detailed written ruling as soon as possible”. Second  is an update on the  Second Theory of Causation .  That is the theory that thimerosal alone can cause autism.  This was mostly a summary of the fact that two of the specific cases (King and Mead) have been heard this May and that the third specific case (Dwyer) will be heard later this month. Third , is the, well,  Third Theory of Causation.  This is the theory that MMR alone causes autism.  As near as I can see, this is in a bit of a limbo right now.  The PSC was supposed to submit expert reports and prepare for specific cases in September.  However, there have been motions stating that there is no new general causation evidence.  The evidence would be the same as for the  First Theory  hearings held last year.   The Special Masters appear to be still working on how to respond to those motions. 
Another update  was submitted recently.  This is a strange one.   There was discussion during the May hearings (on the thimerosal theory) that two more respondent (i.e. government side) expert witnesses would give general testimony (in person and/or by expert report) in the July hearing (Dwyer).  Those were to be Dr.’s  Clarkson  and Magos.  The PSC wanted to put Dr. Aposhian on to rebut their testimony.  All well and good.  Except that the Respondent’s decided to pull the expert reports by Dr.’s Clarkson and Magos.  The PSC then said that they still wanted to put Dr. Aposhian on to rebut other testimony.  Still following?   Well, the SM’s said that since Dr. Aposhian was only on there to rebut the Dr.’s Clarkson and Magos, he couldn’t go on if they didn’t. Now, I expect this to draw a lot of speculation.  People will be claiming that for some reason the DoJ was afraid of what Aposhian had to say, to the point of scuttling their own witnesses.  I expect this from the internet, because, well, that’s the sort of thing that happens here.  But, there is this bit in the Omnibus update: Mr. Powers then stated that the petitioners might wish to file a motion requesting that certain unspecified inferences be drawn from the respondent’s decision to withdraw the reports of Drs. Magos and Clarkson. As we noted during the conference, we will certainly consider any such motion So, the PSC want to “draw inferences” from this action.  As I said, I expect that from the internet.  I was a little surprised to see it from the lawyers in this case.  (I may surprise easily) There is something of substance in this: general testimony for the  Second Theory  is over.  No more expert witnesses talking about the general idea that thimerosal causes autism.  There will be a few days of testimony about one more of the Petitioners (Dwyer), but it is supposed to center only on the details of his case.

"21082" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/02/20/fees-for-the-omnibus-autism-proceeding-hit-7m/" "Fees for the Omnibus Autism Proceeding hit $7M" "In the United States, the court hearings on whether vaccines cause autism were held under the  Omnibus Autism Proceedings (OAP) .  These proceedings represented over 5,000 families who filed for consideration that they had a child who (a) suffered a vaccine injury and (b) this injury resulted in autism. The OAP heard six “test cases”.  Each test case represented both the question of whether the  specific  test-case child considered suffered a vaccine injury and also the  general  question of whether the idea that vaccines cause autism was proven. The first three test cases considered the question of whether the MMR vaccine could cause a vaccine injury resulting in autism.  The second three test case considered the question of whether thimerosal containing vaccines could cause vaccine injury resulting in autism. The decisions from the MMR cases have been handed down, and they were unanimously and definitively against the MMR causes autism theory.   These have been appealed and that appeal was denied.  I believe an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court has been either filed or planned. The decisions in the thimerosal cases have not been handed down yet.   The OAP was a very long process, starting in 2002 and still ongoing, involving multiple law firms and many lawyers and experts.  It has been an expensive process.  We are slowly learning just how expensive. Last year  an interim award of over $2M in legal fees was granted for lawyers working on the Cedillo test case.  That was the first case heard in the MMR segment of the AOP. The Court has now granted an interim award of   $2,300,000 for the King test case , the first heard in the Thimerosal segment of the AOP. During an unrecorded telephonic status conference on July 1, 2009, the law firm of Williams, Love, O’Leary, and Powers (WLOP) agreed to reduce its interim attorneys’ fees and costs request from $3,101,764.84 to $2,300,000.00, including $2,070,000 in fees and $230,000 in costs. Respondent’s counsel then indicated that respondent will not object to that amount. WLOP’s reductions included: the withdrawal of time and expenses relating to direct legislative lobbying, that is, any activity relating to efforts to affect the outcome of the political process; the withdrawal of time and expenses relating to “case specific” work in cases other than this claim, and unrelated to  “general causation” work on the OAP; the withdrawal of time and expenses WLOP conceded were related exclusively to civil cases outside of the Vaccine Program; and the withdrawal of time and cost claims relating to public relations and media work during the pendency of the OAP. In addition, WLOP generally reduced the fees it requested for time spent on the OAP. Finally, WLOP agreed to significantly reduce the expenses for which it sought reimbursement, particularly those costs incurred while on travel. Let me highlight a couple of statements: the withdrawal of time and expenses WLOP conceded were related exclusively to  civil  cases  outside  of the Vaccine Program. and WLOP’s reductions included: the withdrawal of time and expenses relating to direct  legislative lobbying , that is, any activity relating to efforts to affect the outcome of the political process Bold is mine. Apparently, the law firm applied for and was denied funding for work done for civil cases that were outside of the vaccine program and for lobbying efforts.  What were they thinking trying to get tack that onto their fee request?  Let’s face it, the Omnibus has already subsidized any upcoming civil cases by giving the lawyers time to research their arguments and pay experts.  And, really, asking the program to pay for lobbying? This is only an “interim” fee request.  Fees are still mounting, and not all the past fees have been assessed: Of note, this Decision resolves all fees and costs requested by the WLOP firm in the King interim fees application, at Tabs A & B of that application. This Decision does not resolve the amounts requested at Tabs C through U of that application. I don’t know how much is involved with “Tabs C through U”, but it sounds like the remaining fees could be considerably more than the $2.3M granted. It is interesting to note that the father/son team of David and Dr. Mark Geier have expert fee requests submitted (and as yet unpaid) for this case, even though they were not called as witnesses and, to my knowledge, did not submit expert reports: This does not resolve the vast majority of fees and expenses relating to Drs. Geier and Young. The majority of expenses relating to Dr. Geier, David Geier, and Dr. Young are included in the PSC Committee Costs, at Tab C of the initial Fee Application The Geier’s are well known “experts” in the vaccine court.  Young, I suspect, is the same person as  co-authored a paper with the Geiers  purporting to show a link between neurodevelopmental disorders and thimerosal in vaccines.  That paper was reported to have been recieved funding “…from the Autism Petitioners’ Steering Committee of the no-fault National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).” I am all for petitioners in the Vaccine Court having access to good experts.  I don’t consider the Geier team to meet that standard.  Should the Petitioners’ Steering Committee have decided to fund this reasearch, I see that as their expense, not one that should be passed on to the vaccine program.  Dr. Mark Geier has been referred to in  court documents as : There are multiple cases where Dr. Geier’s opinion and testimony have been given little or no weight because they exceeded the scope of his expertise.  and Dr. Geier is “a professional witness in areas for which he has no training, expertise, and experience” I frankly suspect that funding The team of Young, Geier and Geier in this instance is another attempt to get the Vaccine Program to pay for work the lawyers expect to use in the civil cases that will follow the likely rejection of the Vaccine Court hearings.  Remember, they weren’t called as expert witnesses in the Omnibus. One other expert witness of note, Dr. Vas Aposhian, is also mentioned in the fee ruling: This decision resolves the $34,048.25 that WLOP requested for expenses related to Dr. Aposhian ($31,750.00 in fees; and $2,298.25 in expenses incurred in May 2008). This decision does not resolve the $207,382.53 in fees and expenses included in the PSC Committee Costs for costs relating to Dr. Aposhian, nor does it resolve the $7,910 requested by Williams Kherkher for costs associated with Dr. Aposhian. See Tab C at 3887 and Tab E at 4396-98. We don’t have the decisions from the King hearing yet, but here are some comments from the Cedillo decision: Thus, concerning this issue [genetic hypersensitivity to mercury], I conclude that the testimony of Drs. Brent and Cook was persuasive, and that the testimony of Dr. Aposhian was not. I find that Dr. Brent’s testimony on this point [the lack of an established mercury efflux disorder] was persuasive, and that the testimony of Dr. Aposhian was not. I wonder if Dr. Brent, whose expertise was persuasive, will be paid anything like the roughly quarter million dollars that Dr. Aposhian has billed. So we have $2M in fees granted for the Cedillo hearings, and now $2.3M for the King hearings.  This is part of a total of over $7,000,000 requested in interim fees: In their application, the petitioners sought a total of $7,202,653 for interim fees and costs. This total reflected the fact that this case was, as explained above, one of the “test cases” in the OAP. Because this was a “test case,” in which the petitioners sought to present all of the “general causation” evidence concerning the theory that thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause autism, several different law firms participated in the development and presentation of the evidence, while five expert witnesses prepared expert reports and testified at length for petitioners during the evidentiary hearing. The high total sought reflects the participation of all those law firms and expert witnesses. I don’t think anyone is surprised that this is a very expensive proceeding.    Millions of dollars were spent trying to prove the now discredited (and never well supported) hypothesis of Dr. Wakefield.  The thimerosal hypothesis also never had much substance, and has cost millions more. One thing good out of all this is that the proceeding also paid to compile  expert reports  from some real experts debunking the MMR and Thimerosal myths.

Geier, a Rockville doctor accused of improperly treating children with autism, has been ordered by the state Board of Physicians to stop practicing medicine while his license is suspended. 
 The doctor’s license was suspended in April after the board concluded his hormone and chelation therapy endangered the children in his care. But the board in a new “cease and desist” order this week accused the doctor of refilling prescriptions for at least three patients in violation of the suspension. 
 The doctor has appealed the suspension of his license. His lawyer declined to comment on the newest claims.

"22232" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/02/14/vaccines-in-court-what-next/" "Vaccines in court, what next?" "Lisa Jo Rudy has a post on the “what next question” On beyond the Vaccine Court: next steps in the vaccine-autism legal process  In it, she quotes from Law.com where they also looked into the question.  One of the petitioner’s lawyers is indicating that they may appeal. I seem to recall there being mention of a possible appeal in the Omnibus Docket, but I can’t find it right now.  Basically, the next step would likely be to take the U.S. Court of Appeals.  One of the petitioner’s attorneys is indicating that this may happen, with the argument “I think the special masters were imposing a standard and imposing a burden on this evidence in these cases that was higher than what is called for under the statute.” Seems a stretch to me.  When a Special Master makes a point that it was “not even close”, it doesn’t seem as though it was a matter of changing the standard. There are many more comments in the decisions making it exceedingly clear that the Special Masters didn’t think these cases had even close to the merit required, but I don’t expect that to stop people from appealing. After that, or for some people even before the appeal, there is the chance that the cases could be taken to civil court.  Similar cases have worked in civil court in the recent past–with cases dismissed before trial even begins based on the lack of evidence.   Now, civil court judges will be able to refer to the Special Master’s decisions, which are quite detailed and quite clear. But, in civil court, will they be able to assemble the “Dream Team” of expert witnesses that the DoJ put together for the Omnibus? They may not have to. One of the entries in the dockets for the Cedillo, Snyder and Hazlehurst cases was this: NOTICE, filed by SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES RESPONDENTS CONSENT TO DISCLOSURE OF 
EXPERT REPORTS. (Babcock, Alexis) (Entered: 01/30/2009) Yep, we may get to read the expert reports.  It could help slow down any civil cases. Much more, it could give new families to autism something to read besides the websites of the orgs promoting vaccine causation. I can’t wait to read those reports.

Closet Cleaning
" "
 
As it turns out, writing a book is a lot like cleaning out a closet - both of which I've been doing a lot of lately. 
 
The thing is, to really clean the closet, you pretty much have to take everything out and see what you've got. This creates a much bigger mess than whatever you started out with, and the temptation is to just cram it all back in and close the door. This does not work. 
 
No. You must go through everything in there and see what you've got. Then you must ruthlessly toss whatever isn't working with the other things in there - even if it's beautiful. Even if it cost you a lot. Even if you absolutely love it. If it doesn't go, it doesn't go. 
 
If it doesn't fit, hasn't been used in at least six months or is simply out of style, never to come back,  it's got to be cut.

We saw our beloved developmental/behavioral pediatrician again recently. We've gone as often as monthly and as little as quarterly, for thirteen years. He's really good about celebrating our progress (which is gigantic) and pointing out our next goal or two. We are supposed to start getting Rojo as independent as possible, starting with going into a grocery store together, sending him off on his own to get milk, coming back to the cart and then going back for something else, etc. There is a little store in our neighborhood just a few short blocks away. The goal is that someday I will be able to give him $10, send him with a short list, and have him come back with everything on it (with as much help as he needs once in the store). This is a long way from happening, but we are baby stepping it now. At this point he is not willing to separate from me in the grocery store, but I can get him to find something in the aisle while I'm in the same aisle looking for something else. Like I said, baby steps. 
 
The other thing we are supposed to do is get Rojo to express his opinion. The doctor explained to us something so obvious, yet I'd never thought of it in these terms: opinions use both the left and right sides of the brain. They take fact (left) and cross over for feelings (right), and make the two hemispheres work together. Right now when you ask Rojo what he thinks about something, he's likely to say, \"Good.\" It's very hard for him to expand - to offer an opinion on anything. It's not hard to get my daughter to offer an opinion on literally, EVERYTHING, so it's comforting to know it's a wiring thing and not a bad parenting thing that is giving him such trouble. 
 
This new task has helped to reshape my views on my own opinions and those of others. When I totally disagree with others' opinion I am a little better at saying to myself, \"That is just their feelings mixed with some fact,\" instead of dismissing them as just plain wrong. The tricky part is when I agree with their opinions to realize that then, too, it is simply their feelings mixed with fact. It is not pure fact. It is not pure feelings. It is not pure, at all. It's an opinion. Nothing more, nothing less, but very worth considering, always.

			 At least, that's what  Jordan  tells me.  And I believe her when she tells me things.  Totally confused?  See original context  here .  And you can add this to the list of things that made me smile today.  Although I really couldn't tell you why.

 Having surgery, then sleeping through a good portion of my recovery, gave me something of a power boost. I felt better than I have in a long time. My mind was clearer, at least for a little while. After I came back to work full-time, I realized two things: 
 
 First, the time I put in when I could only work part-time wasn’t as clear, coherent, or organized as it seemed at the time. 
 Second, my priorities had shifted because I’d had plenty of time to consider what was going well, what wasn’t, and what I could do about it. 
 
 I cleaned up my messes. I cleared up my backlogs. Now, I’m feeling like I’m really and truly back. I’m ready to walk my walk and make it work. My priorities truly have shifted. 
 I’m going to keep these shifts close to the vest, but I’ll give you a hint…I’ve talked about doing this before, but then I lost track of it. I’m starting fresh, breaking free, and doing a little cheating. 
 It’ll make sense in time. For now, I’m just going to enjoy being back and keeping my little secret. :)

Do you have any idea how frequently I try to give Oliver some thing that he doesn't want? Apparently quite a lot. I know this now because of his new favorite phrases: \"I don't want that.\" and also: \"I don't want any.\" And sometimes just: \"No thanks.\" This is all a vast improvement over his previous responses, which were to either jump up and run away from the offending item or to shove it away with a loud \"No!' Oh, and the other day, I also was able to teach him a couple of new phrases that seem to be taking hold. Now, instead of saying: \"I want juice!\", Oliver will ask: \"Can I have juice?\" or \"Can I have that?\" It is just a little thing, but it is so nice that he has a new way of asking for what he wants -- and the fact that it is a question and not a statement just totally makes my day.

Looking forward

I have tried all day, this final day of 2005, to reflect on the year that has passed; despite my best efforts, though, as I try to reflect my mind starts to wander and before I know it I find myself forgetting to look back and beginning to look forward. It's not that 2005 was a bad year. On the contrary, it was a very  good  year; everyone was healthy, we enjoyed many, many happy times, and Bud made huge strides forward. Perhaps I've simply gotten swept up in Bud's forward strides - the momentum is so great, the ride so thrilling, that there seems to be no need to look back; I'm just keeping my eyes on the next thing to come. Because when I say I'm \"looking forward,\" I don't just mean that I'm considering the year to come. I mean that I'm filled with anticipation and excitement. It's the feeling of knowing that your favorite author is about to release a new book; that you have front-row tickets to a concert you can't wait to see; that two weeks from tomorrow is your tenth birthday. I am really  looking forward  to what comes next for Bud, and for  all of us .

      Really, I swear I'll be posting something new real soon.  I've been a little busy getting settled into a new house and a new career, and there just hasn't been enough time to keep up with everything.  But I'm getting back up to speed and I hope to have something up in the next few days.  In the meantime, start a conversation among yourselves . . .

I was working on a post about this but I think it has all been said here: http://www.lovethatmax.com/2011/07/mystery-of-missing-ipadsand-unrest-in.html read the comments too Yes, we were one of the \"winners\". Unlike some of the parents though I never counted on it. There was a part of me that hoped something that good could really happen but the realist (cynic) in me was pretty sure it wouldn't materialize. There were too many things that didn't add up, too many \"perfect\" promises. I figured that an entry was relatively safe since he didn't ask for any financial info. As they say, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Maybe in a few weeks we will all be surprised . . . what are the chances?

The semester is officially done.

Yes! Yes! I have turned in the grades, and Hell Semester is officially over! Now I can get back to the good stuff: Christmas and blogging. Where has the time gone?  This will probably be another thin posting week, but you never know with me. Hopefully I'll be really, really back to everything after the guys go back to school. But then, I have three classes to revamp (especially in light of Hell Semester 2009).

I’ve just got too much going on with a heavily pregnant wife, a major redesign project at work, a major uncompleted redesign of this site and Megan not sleeping so well at the moment. I’ve got two articles about 70% complete but thats about it. Actually thinking about the project itself I seem (as  Dave Shea pointed out ) to have strayed away from the overall aim of web standards. Although I have mentioned them, they seem to be the most undiscussed part of the project! To that end, I’m going to call the current project, Project: New Part I. Where Part I turns out to have been a look at processes and organisation, Part II will concentrate exclusively on code. I can even envisage a Part III in a far distant future where I look at serverside scripting for designers. That should keep me nicely busy and harrassed for the next year or so.

 Last week, I had problems with my car—again. 
 While I’d scheduled myself to take it in Monday, and to be home in time for bowling, I had things to do first.  Mark queried me about this, and then said, “It just seems like you’re doing other things.” 
 I’m always doing other things. 
 There are always other things to do. 
 My day never revolves around a single problem.  There’s no clearing my calendar.  Every chance to wait is a chance to work, if I’m prepared.  Every day has its pressing needs, though they may seem trivial.  Like dishes, when I don’t get them done for five days in a row, they need to be done whether I want to or not, whether I have time or not.  And it’s not like I can do them while Ben is home to play in my water. 
 So, yes, there are other things.  I get as much done as I can in the time allowed.  There’s always more to do.  I imagine there always will be. 
 I can see myself being called home, and me saying, “But wait, no, see I’m not finished…” 
 There is always more to do. 
 And sometimes being reminded of that overwhelms me. 
 So, what did I do?  I took a nap. 
 The car could wait.  The dishes could wait.

 That was the temperature -- 26 Fahrenheit or so, without calculating in the wind chill -- so Jim and Charlie did the obvious thing (in our household, that is) and got some inquiring looks along the way.

Well there is more interesting news on the evil special educators redux department. Did anyone ever tell you, you were so crazy you belonged in a padded cell? Maybe they did but they were probably being metaphorical and not entirely serious. The following is interesting in light of this.  read details here

This is Leelo's twice-yearly report. Written by the wondeful Supervisor M, posted with her permission. Her detailed notes should give you an idea of where Leelo is, what he is doing, what we are working on, and what his main challenges are. Hopefully there will be some helpful information for families facing similar scenarios. Note: I observed Leelo in the classroom yesterday, and was impressed by how nicely he was thriving and learning in his well-run environment. Particularly amazing was his tolerance of multiple children screaming in his vicinity, as long as he was engaged and on-task. He was still stimming and taking off shoes whenever possible, plus acting out whenever he didn't like what was going on. Though because of his extremely well-structured and 1:1 supervised environment, he did not act out very often. As mentioned below, we need to replicate as much of the class structure and visual supports as we can, in our home. Introduction An important goal for Leelo for the past 2 years has been to increase his ability to access instruction in a classroom environment, and to reduce his need for highly individualized, home-based instruction.  Since  April 2008,  Leelo has been attending Playa Azul School for a full day every day, and his home program has been reduced to 2 afternoons per week (total 4-6 hours).  He adapted quickly to the longer school day, and the increased learning opportunities occurring at school.  At school, Leelo responds to effective teaching strategies and increased learning opportunities in his daily schedule.  Leelo is now mastering newly introduced skills at school, while continuing to generalize skills previously mastered in the home program.  With Leelo better able to access academic instruction in the classroom environment, his home program has been modified to increase emphasis on leisure skills, independent living skills and chores.  His home staff and family are working to integrate visual supports in the home.  Leelo’s aggressive behaviors are managed with behavioral interventions based on his Functional Analysis Assessment, and with allergy/decongestant medication.  Despite this, aggressive behavior continues to threaten Leelo’s safety and the safety of those around him.  Compulsive, repetitive behaviors also interfere with learning. BEHAVIORAL CONSULTATION FOR HOME ABA PROGRAM Current Skills The main focus of the in-home component of Leelo’s program has been generalization of skills mastered in the school setting, maintenance of previously mastered skills and increasing Leelo’s repertoire of self-help and independent living skills. Independent Work:  Leelo is able to work on 5 tasks independently for up to 30 minutes.  Leelo requires (on average) 0-4 indirect non-verbal cues per activity to remain on task.  In the past month, Leelo has begun to choose the activities and put together his work station with one verbal cue per activity. Leelo has also been observed to initiate cleaning up the materials with 100% independence.  Next steps:  have multiple areas around the home in which Leelo can access his independent work. Community Outings:  Leelo and the staff working with him in the home go on walks around the immediate neighborhood each session.  Leelo is able to put his shoes on with one visual cue.  Staff working with Leelo use a visual cue (a picture card that reads “walk together”) to keep Leelo on task and safe.  Leelo requires physical re-direction on average 2-4 times per outing. In an effort to increase Leelo’s independence out in the community and to decrease the need for physical re-direction, learning “stop” has been added to Leelo’s program.  Instructional protocols for teaching Leelo “stop” include walking in front of Leelo, presenting both visual prompts (a picture card) and verbal cues to “stop” and reinforcing correct responses with social praise. When Leelo does require re-redirection during outings, staff use both physical prompts and the visual prompt to “stop”. Visual Supports:  The importance of the use of visual supports for all individuals who come into contact with Leelo cannot be overstated.  Use of visual supports increase Leelo’s independence and allow him to spend more time engaged in meaningful activities.  Also, staff reports strongly suggest that use of visual supports decrease anxiety and the rate of target behavior. Functional Life Skills:  Leelo has begun to work on setting a place for mealtime with decreasing visual prompts.  Staff working with Leelo have identified that he would benefit from learning to make a snack.  Increased skill acquisition in the areas of community living and independent work increase Leelo’s ability to function as independently as possible. Increasing Tolerance to Foods: A system for increasing Leelo’s tolerance to a variety of foods has been identified (see attached).  Currently, Leelo is working on increasing his tolerance to hard boiled egg whites and oranges. Behavior: Behaviors that have been given priority for intervention and behavior support in the home are hitting others, hitting self and repetitive behaviors.  While antecedents can be difficult to identify and functions multiple, it is becoming increasingly clear that not being engaged in meaningful activities increases the likelihood that Leelo could engage in target behavior.  In other words, when Leelo is actively engaged, he is less likely to engage in target behavior.  High risk times for hitting self and others in the home are: While on the computer (hitting self) While attention is diverted to another person When left alone or with no clear activity or task In the presence of his siblings Repetitive behaviors are unpredictable and appear to spike in clusters.  For example, Leelo was persistent in placing numbers on a Velcro strip.  Staff blocked the behavior and then Leelo would not put numbers on the strip unless staff weren’t available to block multiple responses.  The numbers were removed for a period of time and represented several days later without incident. Due to the complexity of antecedents and functions, it is important that staff working with Leelo understand those interventions that decrease the likelihood that target behaviors will occur (e.g., use of visual supports and increased engagement). BEHAVIORAL CONSULTATION AT PLAYA AZUL SCHOOL Emphasis has been on increasing staff use of effective instructional strategies to reduce Leelo’s aggressive behavior and increase appropriate behavior and learning.   Previously, Leelo was unable to access instruction in noisy, busy classroom environments.  As Leelo’s staff further develops their expertise in teaching Leelo and managing his behavior, the SDC classroom has become the main setting for academic instruction. Using contingent reinforcement and multiple repetitions: new skills Leelo’s teacher currently uses contingent tangible reinforcement paired with praise when teaching new skills.  That is, Leelo is praised, and earns short periods with a preferred toy or straw for correct responses.  In addition, Leelo is presented with 3 to 5 repeated, consecutive learning opportunities when learning new skills.  These 2 strategies are effective and essential for teaching Leelo new skills. Leelo works on new skills during 7-8 minute work-with-teacher times.  Examples of skills taught during work-with-teacher include sight-word recognition, one-to-one correspondence, and receptive and expressive labels for emotions. In addition, Leelo’s teacher consistently tracks Leelo’s practice and progress on skills.  Mastered independent skills are moved to work-station, so that additional new skills can be introduced.  Next steps: Para-educators should be trained to introduce new skills to Leelo during work-with-teacher time; increase work-with-teacher time from 7/8 minutes to 12 minutes per session, at least 2 sessions/day; add social and conversational skills to work-with-teacher time. Using effective strategies for maintaining mastered skills Para-educators also use contingent reinforcement and praise when practicing mastered skills.  Generally this occurs at snack time, when staff work on asking and answering social questions, and  getting attention of others by tapping/calling name.  Next steps: increase variety of skills practiced at snack; practice mastered skills throughout the day; track maintenance of mastered skills. Increasing food tolerance At school and at home, Leelo is working on tolerating an increased variety of foods.  In both settings, Leelo can put oranges and scramble eggs to his mouth and lips, and is now working on putting them in his mouth.  A protocol for introducing new foods has been developed (attached below).  Leelo’s parent, classroom staff, and OT work together to coordinate instrution. Visual Schedule At school, Leelo follows an individualized visual schedule.  He has a morning schedule and an afternoon schedule, each with about 10 activities listed.  The schedule, made with Boardmaker software, vertically displays text (3/4 of card) and a small icon (1/4 of card) beside the text.  A name card cues Leelo to check his schedule.  Upon arrival at school, Leelo typically receives the name card from the bus driver; this was begun to prevent dropping on the floor of the bus when disembarking.  With the card in hand, Leelo knows to walk to class.  He checks his schedule by scanning the entire morning’s schedule.  Leelo consistently checks his schedule when handed a name card, and also independently requests his name card when finished with an activity.  He  consistently transitions to both preferred and less-preferred activities using the schedule. He occasionally requests a different activity in response to a less-preferred e.g. in response to circle time he may say “I want recess”, but is able to tolerate the less-preferred activity with a “first circle time, then recess” prompt. Next steps: fade out icons on most familiar activities, to increase sight-word recognition. Work-station (independent work) Leelo independently works on 6 consecutive tasks with 2 to 5 prompts on average.  Each work-station session takes between 5 and 15 minutes, and occurs 2 to 3 times per day. Tasks include chore-type (e.g. sorting silverware), academic (matching sight words to pictures, writing name), and leisure (listening to music on headphones, reading story to self).  Staff assist Leelo physically if necessary, with little or no verbal interaction.  Staff also keep busy with other jobs, to reduce Leelo’s dependence on them during this independent work time.   Next steps: rotate work-station location/have Leelo travel to get materials himself; increase emphasis on leisure skills and open-ended tasks (e.g. toy play); increase time spent on work station to 15-20 minutes; consider using choice board so Leelo can help  decide which tasks to work on; train all staff to use non-verbal prompts BEHAVIOR: Aggressive behavior: hitting self, hitting others At school, Leelo’s aggressive behaviors averaged 4 times per hour this quarter, with a range from 0 to 8.  This is an increase from 2 times per hour from last quarter.  In general, he hits himself more often than he hits others.   At school, hitting self and others most often appears to function to escape demands/noise (other children screaming), and to gain access to preferred tangibles and activities (usually a straw, or outside time).  Less frequently, Leelo appears to use aggression to get attention.  Occasionally aggression appears to have a sensory function. Further understanding aggressive behavior for Leelo: Aggressive behavior increases when he is sick or has physical discomfort (e.g. cut or scrape). The frequency of aggression may vary across time within a day, as in the graph on 5/1a and 5/1b; during the first hour of observation Leelo hit himself and others 8 times, and during the second hour there was no aggression. Aggression does not correlate with time of day at school, as Leelo may have a calm morning and have increased aggression in the afternoon, or vice versa. Aggression does correlate with activities: Leelo continues to have highest likelihood of  aggression during circle time, recesses lasting more than 10 minutes, and  motor/sensory room periods. Aggression increases when staff use loud, and/or lengthy directions when working with Leelo, and when staff respond to aggression by giving Leelo a straw or another reinforcer. Replacement behaviors: requesting a break; When a break card is visible, Leelo can consistently, verbally request a break from work-with-teacher.  He is beginning to request a break in circle time.  Next steps: staff should consistently honor Leelo’s request for break during circle time; during work-with-teacher, staff should have Leelo do “1 more”, and then give him a break; breaks should be brief (1-2 minutes), and should entail Leelo leaving the work/circle area, sitting at a desk, and completing a small puzzle; Leelo should return to work after his break is over. Repetitive behaviors: These may interfere with learning, and sometimes lead to aggressive behavior.  Included are: repeatedly sliding finger on surfaces such as the computer screen, desk, visual schedule, and floor, repeatedly matching the numbers on the independent work station activities, and bending the visual schedule cards.  These behaviors appear to lessen when Leelo is blocked from performing them, or when the antecedent for the behavior is removed from the environment (e.g. removing the matching component to the independent work). Straws: Leelo continues to request, chew and manipulate straws as a preferred material.  Prolonged time with straws tends to lead to aggressive behavior, and interferes with learning and speaking.  On average, Leelo has a straw about 40% of the time when at school.  Straw use varies between activities. During work-with-teacher, straws are used as reinforcers for correct responses, for brief 3-5 second intervals.  During recess, straws appear “custodial”; something for Leelo to play with during often extended (20 minutes), unstructured time. RECOMMENDATIONS: Home: Increase rate of engagement throughout the day:  Data suggest that Leelo is more productive and engages in lower rates of problem behavior when he is engaged. Increase use of visual supports across all environments.  It is critical that all individuals who come into contact with Leelo increase their use of visual supports.  Those who are not fluent in the use of visual supports would benefit from ongoing training and feedback in the use of visual supports. School: Track mastered skills for maintenance Increase work-with-teacher time; have paras as well as teacher implement this Emphasize training across all staff, to increase consistency in use of effective strategies Reduce straw use and increase engagement during recess Ongoing feedback from school staff regarding skills that are ready to be generalized in the home.

 Leelo's Progress: The Good Stuff Although things have been rough for the past month, before then Leelo was having his best learning and behavior (and happiness) period to date. When Supervisor M called me to consult on details for the progress report below, she giggled and said she'd never had so much fun writing one of these reports. Enjoy the good long snapshot of happy Leelo before we were revisited by sad, pissed off Leelo from days of yore (who had two milestones today: pooping on the bus and hitting a classmate in the face; whom we're hoping to banish with Tylenol meltaways, comfortable undergarments, a working trampoline, and pool-friendly weather; and whom I both hope and hate to hope will be diagnosed with an ear or sinus infection tomorrow so we'll have some idea about why he's so miserable in his own skin) . PROGRESS REPORT Student: 		Leelo Rosenberg Date of Report:	4/9/08 Supervisor M, MA EdS In the past year, Leelo has experienced many changes in his instructional program, including a change of placement to a classroom at the Saint Matthews County School at Cielo Azul, an increase in the use of visual supports at home and at school, and a greater emphasis on directly teaching appropriate alternative behaviors to replace aggressive behavior.   He is also spending a full day at school. Leelo has made exceptional progress this year.  As his aggressive behavior decreased and his behavior replacement skills developed, he has been able to tolerate more challenging instruction and demands.  He currently enjoys a complex and comprehensive instructional program. VISUAL SCHEDULE AND INDEPENDENT WORK Leelo transitioned easily to Room 4 at Cielo Azul.  Everyone who knows him will agree: Leelo loves school.  The physical layout allows for the outdoor gross motor activity which Leelo so enjoys.  The classroom is convenient for working on his functional and academic goals.  In September 2008, Leelo quickly learned to follow his individual visual schedule.  He currently scans the entire day (at least 15 activities) upon arrival.  He consistently checks the schedule when given a name card, and when he doesn’t have a name card- he approaches staff and says “check schedule”.  He is currently learning to read a text schedule by fading the pictures and enlarging the text.  Leelo also uses a picture schedule at home during ABA therapy. This year Leelo made progress in independent work.  He now consistently does 5 consecutive activities, with 3 to 6 prompts, for up to 25 minutes at home and about 10 minutes at school.  The activity trays or shelves are numbered, and he matches a number on his desk with the number on the activity tray or shelf.  He can do a variety of activities independently, including puzzles, folder tasks, lacing, and some open-ended tasks like listening to headphones, and playing with trains or a toy piano. At home, he is able to do independent work in a variety of locations, by moving the trays to each location.  His parents use the independent work trays when they are busy, and need Leelo to play by himself. NEW SKILL ACQUISITION AT HOME AND SCHOOL Leelo has also begun to tolerate small group experiences, and one-to-one instruction of new skills in a classroom environment.  Previously, Leelo generally mastered new skills mostly in a one-to-one environment using discrete trial methodology at home.  This year, Leelo is tolerating one-to-one instruction with a teacher in a noisy, busy class, and he is also participating in group circle time with up to 6 other children.  For new skills, he continues to require one-to-one instruction, and to do best with 3 to 5 repetitions of a single skill at once. Contingent, tangible reinforcement is essential. New skill instruction includes the Edmark sight-word reading program.  Leelo has progressed steadily through the pre-reading section, and has now begun the sight-word discrimination or actual reading section of the program.  In class, he is also working on identifying emotions, developing one-to-one correspondence, sorting and categorizing, and learning the functions of objects and senses.  This year he also learned to set a table place using a placemat jig, and he currently sets the table for his entire class at snack time, with 3 to 6 prompts.   Recently simple cooking activities and dish-washing were introduced. At home and at school, Leelo has been working on his computer skills. With an adapted mouse, he can click and drag to complete simple actions on the screen.  He currently uses the TeachTown program at home, to reinforce computer skills and some basic vocabulary skills. He also plays simple leisure games which emphasize mouse skills. Computer has become a preferred activity for Leelo. As his school program capacity has grown, Leo’s home program has been modified to emphasize more functional, life, and social skills.  Leelo has learned to put away his clothes in the correct drawers, and is currently learning to fold them.  He continues working on learning to play games and do craft activities, sing songs with actions, and to further develop his language and social social skills.  His home independent work includes many open-ended activities, which he can play with for up to 25 minutes. TOILET TRAINING This year, Leo’s parents worked hard with Leelo on bowel training, and he is now mostly independent at toileting and washing up afterwards.    He currently wears underpants during the daytime, and pullsup to bed. He typically has infrequent accidents at school (less that once per week).  At home, Leelo has bowel accidents about once a week. He generally had been staying dry for about three months, but recently has had one to two urine accidents during the day. Leelo does not yet consistently initiate toilet use, but is scheduled trained and will always use the bathroom when given a bathroom card or when taken.  At school he can withhold urine for about 2 hours. He occasionally independently initiates toilet use at home. BEHAVIOR Critical to this progress has been Leelo’s improvement in behavior.  Since his FAA ( Functional Analysis Assessment , 3/26/07), Leo’s aggressive behavior (hitting himself and hitting others) at school has been reduced from an average of 8 episodes per hour (range 3 to 16) to 2 episodes per hour (range 0 to 5).   Previous episodes at school often involved 5 or more hits to himself and/or others, plus an escalation in intensity.  Current episodes are generally 1 to 3 hits, and his behavior does not escalate. Appropriate Replacement Behaviors: Leelo has learned some key replacement and coping behaviors that address his needs to either escape from demands, get attention, or to get tangible materials (usually a straw).  He has learned to request a break using a voice-recorder break button, and this month he has been  verbally requesting a break without the button.  He has mastered tapping adults to get their attention, and continues to work on calling them by name.  With a “wait card” prompt, he can wait appropriately for at least 30 seconds in context.  He independently transitions between activities with a name card, even when his behavior is escalated. He is learning to use headphones to enjoy music and also block out aversive crying, screaming, and other noises.  He has learned to tolerate ending preferred activities, especially access to a straw, which he now consistently ends by counting to five and giving the straw back to the adult.  And he has learned to play and work by himself, without adult attention, for up to 25 minutes. Medication: Leelo’s behavior improvement is likely due in part to ongoing use of the medication Claritin since Spring 2007. His aggressive behavior had previously increased during the winter and spring, and he appeared to have headache pain (head hitting, rubbing, preference for forehead pressure); so there was some suspicion that he was suffering from allergies and sinus problems. This winter/spring of 2007-08, while on Claritin, Leelo has not experienced a long period of behavior escalation. [ SNORT. Did I brag too much? Sigh .] Problem Behavior Prevention and Response: In addition, implementation of other behavior plan interventions have been critical to his learning and maintaining appropriate replacement behaviors. Staff currently prevent behavior problems by using a range of strategies, including managing straw access, maintaining routine, using visual supports and reducing verbal instruction.  Staff also teach Leelo replacement and coping behaviors, including waiting, requesting breaks, tapping or calling people for attention, and  schedule use.  Staff respond to problem behavior by prompting Leelo to use these more appropriate skills to meet his needs.  The staff at Cielo Azul rotate within the class, so Leelo has had to learn to tolerate some variation in instruction.  This is beneficial to Leelo, as long as all staff are skilled in his behavior plan implementation and instructional goals. Visual schedule and prompts: Learning to follow a visual schedule has been central to Leelo’s reduction in aggressive behavior. Previously, Leelo was regularly aggressive during transitions, including transitions within a multiple-part activity.  With the visual schedule, Leelo understands what is happening now, and what will happen next and later, and he appears much more relaxed and able to engage with this understanding of his day. In addition, visual prompts have been helpful in teaching Leelo to wait, and to walk together instead of running ahead. Independent work: Engaging in independent activity has also been important in reducing problem behaviors. Leelo enjoys attention, and previously engaged in aggression and self-injury to get attention.  In addition to asking for attention in more appropriate ways, it was also important for Leelo to learn to tolerate and enjoy his time alone, and to engage in activities without adult attention. His progress in this area has been wonderful to observe. Leelo is becoming self-directed, and independent. Most importantly, he appears to be enjoying himself in purposeful ways, and is now better able to participate in his family and school communities. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS Leelo has made great progress in the past year. He has mastered skills which are pivotal to his ability to learn in a classroom and to function independently.  The use of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) in understanding Leo’s problem behavior and learning challenges, in developing and modifying interventions, and in tracking his progress has been critical.  Specifically, Leelo behaves more appropriately and makes progress when skills are taught in small steps, when reinforcement is consistently provided contingent on correct responding, and when data is collected immediately. It is recommended that he continue to receive ongoing behavioral consultation at school and at home.  His home program should emphasize functional living/self-care, social/ language, and leisure skills.  Generalization to siblings, parents, and family friends should be the focus.  Instruction to increase food tolerance is recommended.  Classroom consultation should continue to emphasize implementation of Leo’s behavior plan; the use of effective instructional strategies to teach new skills and to increase Leo’s time actively engaged in learning across the school day.  Opportunities for peer social interaction and group learning should also be increased.

 Here are the latest whats and hows of Leo,  from his most recent team meeting. Leo himself left for week-long sleepaway this afternoon. I am trying not to freak too much, or worry about the sniffly nose his camp nurse said was fine as long as he avoids a fever. I am also convinced he'll lose his first front tooth while he's away -- it was flapping in his mouth like a broken gate. I hate to miss that. The camp crew said they'd try to save it, if possible. Leo’s Team Meeting Notes 7/30/09: Squid, Therapist V, Supervisor E, Supervisor M Headsprout Does about 15 min per session, needs prompting to keep on task and not click mouse randomly, working on consonant-vowel (CV) and CVC words and simple sentences. ACTION: continue with adult facilitation (not independent work) Pants Pants up: working on buckling at school, next step-transfer skill to belt on waist; Leo now using briefs (not boxers) ACTION: get mirror in bedroom to increase Leo’s ability to self-monitor and manage his own pants;  be sure to slow Leo down when he is dressing so underpants are pulled up neatly first, then pants. Keep pants short (e.g. cuffs) Eating Speed Nice, steady improvement at home and school, except when very hungry- frantic, grabs food. Update from Therapist V Nice progress re: folding laundry, following directions w/traveling; getting attention using name, giving a play idea; walking- fading out holding hand. Action/CAUTION: - Leo may bolt into street without clear warning/provocation, be sure to reinforce his walking beside you and be ready to grab him if he runs into traffic. Action: next step for getting attention and giving a play idea- Leo needs to further expand these requests (currently fluent with tickles, hugs, physical play and affection); consider as next steps- requesting books and activities, using visual choice board prompt or the actual materials. (Therapist V, Therapist E, Therapist M, Squid and Seymour) Behavioral Definitions /Approaches Aggressive behaviors include: hitting, pushing, pinching, scratching, kicking, elbow grinding, head-butting others, throwing materials Self-injurious behaviors include: slapping self on face and stomach, hitting head against surfaces, hitting hands against surfaces, Precursor behavior: stomping Responding to target behavior: (Therapist E and Therapist M modeled) Aggressive: MOST IMPORTANT: EVADE (step back/away, do not approach or touch) “Stop” + visual “Sit Down”  + gesture  “Check schedule”  +name card Leo transition to next activity  +schedule icon  Reinforce Leo at end of this sequence if compliant. Self-Injurious- prompt more appropriate replacement; redirect; ignore; remove straw if he is chewing/holding. If blocking, do NOT make eye contact.  In general, minimal eye contact when problem behavior is occurring. Social interaction and play, and problem behaviors with siblings Squid expressed concerned about safety, and is currently emphasizing preventing problematic contact, and keeping Leo engaged to reduce aggression; Therapist M- Leo needs to develop a repertoire of positive ways to interact with Mali, Then, he needs to practice positive interactions with Mali at least 5 times as frequently as he is aggressive with her. So- if he hits her 3 times in a day, there should be at least 15 opportunities to practice some more appropriate way of interacting with Mali. Leo also needs to be able to control himself (vs us managing his aggression by keeping him engaged, limiting his world to those environments that do not occasion aggression). Supervisor M continues to recommend that Therapist V work with Leo to greet/hi-5 etc. Mali at least 5 times during their session, and that they do at least 1 table activity/game together, with Leo and Mali across from each other (e.g. try Eric Carle picture-imitation game), or an obstacle course (they have done this together in the past).  If necessary,  2 adults can facilitate to ensure safety. This activity should be a regular part of Leo’s visual schedule with Therapist V, so it becomes routine for Leo. ACTION: Squid and Seymour to communicate with Therapist V, Therapist E and me around this, so that we can develop a comfortable plan for working to reduce Leo’s aggressive behavior at home. Toilet Training Next steps- Action: Squid elected to continue working on standing while peeing at the toilet at home and in other locations. Therapist M will facilitate at school. ACTION: re-visit toileting initiations and night-time continence in 2 months. Independent Work/Leisure at Home Continue to manage materials- variety, novelty, high-interest, systematic rotation; and to do in various locations ACTION: keep adult prompting to a minimum; if prompting is necessary (e.g. if Leo gets off task, needs help) , it should be a physical prompt or a gesture, and NO EYE CONTACT.  (Therapist V, Therapist E, Squid, Seymour) ACTION: store weekly supply in big bin- let Leo chose from these to set up own materials. Then rotate out each week.  (Therapist M set up this week) Visual Supports at Home Family reports consistently using mini-schedule for 3-5 activities, or “first-then” situations, especially helpful when out of house, changes in routine, etc.  Using mini-binder for storage (alphabetical). ACTION: more name cards needed, and icons for going on trip (Therapist V, Therapist E) ACTION: fade out picture on “snack” card to increase sight word vocabulary (Therapist E); Put meals, snacks, and straws on schedule to reduce behavior problems (Squid, Seymour, Therapist V) School Update Therapist M met with new Teacher C and former teacher M to facilitate transition. It is likely one para from current class will move to Teacher C's class with Leo.

 The bulk of what follows is excerpts from Supervisor M's progress report dated 1/20/09. Much of this data was collected when Leelo was still in his terrifying November/December 2008 Abilify phase -- a phase from which we are still recovering despite the fact that Risperdol has had such a generally lovely affect on Leelo's behavior and contentment, a phase that has left me in suspended animation and leached out any interest in writing or indeed most things. Though I did recently send the following email to a local parents' group, prefacing a summary of advice I'd been given re: autism, aggression, and antipsychotics: It has taken me four months to write this summary because I wanted to add our own experience, and I wanted it to be positive or at least hopeful. That was unfortunately not the case with Abilify; even at a low dose it increased my son's aggression to the point where we stopped taking him anywhere or having friends over [ though we made exceptions for my entire family during the holidays, obviously, and also for out of town friends ], made him unable to sit still or focus on/complete simple tasks, made him so hungry that we had two choices: feed him all day or be assaulted (he gained a lot of weight), and disrupted his sleep patterns so that he was waking between 3:30 and 5:30 AM daily. Obviously, Abilify was not the right drug for him, despite the reports ... as to how other children benefitted. I am happy to report that we have seen only positive results since we switched to 5 mg of Risperdol 2x/day (it has been eight weeks so far). My son has become focused, happy, sweet, affectionate, chatty, connected, and the star of his SDC. He has simultaneously started trying new foods while losing five pounds of his Abilify weight. For the first time *in his life*, he goes to sleep without a fight and on time, yet gets a full night's sleep. I am considering putting a small shrine to Risperdol in our entryway. And I am yet again fascinated by how very differently our children with autism respond to identical treatments. Wouldn't you know, almost within 24 hours of writing that email, Leelo spiraled into another aggressive episode, directed mostly towards Mali, and me. We've resumed Claritin after a hiatus of several months, and are crossing our fingers. Anyhow. BEHAVIORAL CONSULTATION AT PLAYA AZUL SCHOOL Emphasis for consultation this quarter has been on reducing aggressive behaviors, and reducing stereotypic use of straws during recess by increasing engagement. BEHAVIOR Incidence of aggressive behavior: hitting self, hitting others At school, Leelo’s aggressive behaviors [decreased] from last quarter. However, staff and family reports and observations suggest that the intensity of Leelo’s hitting has increased, as he is growing larger and stronger.  At school, hitting self and others continues to function most often to escape demands which cause frustration and confusion, and to gain access to preferred tangibles and activities (usually a straw, or outside time). Leelo may also hit other people to gain attention from staff and peers. He hits specific peers more often than others. These peers sometimes are screaming when he hits them (screaming can be a trigger for hitting); other times there is not clear antecedent other than the peer is present and nearby. Typically, hitting peers results in sudden and dramatic activity, as adults rush to the scene, suggesting an attention function, or perhaps that Leelo is bored and seeking change or activity. MEDICATION In consultation with a developmental psychiatrist Dr. R, Leelo started on a  trial of Abilify 5mg 1x daily on 11/20/08. The dose was increased to 2x daily on 12/14/08. Leelo’s school staff were not informed of the medication trial. Hitting self and others appeared to continue at similar rates as before, and with similar, if not greater intensity.  For example, in December, Leelo began pushing people and furniture (room area dividers) intensely enough to knock them over. [...] Leelo appeared less focused during independent work. [...] he was more obsessed with straws, throwing them away and requesting fresh ones. Parents reported similar behavior at home with Abilify. PREVENTION OF PROBLEM BEHAVIORS Staff consistently use name cards to prompt Leelo to refer to his visual schedule when he transitions between activities. Staff also use simple, clear  language when giving Leelo directions.  Staff are familiar with Leelo’s high risk times, including circle time, when other children are screaming, and waiting for computer.   Next steps : increase use of praise and reinforcement for appropriate replacement and coping behaviors (e.g. waiting, hands down, etc); increase use of visual supports when giving routine less-preferred directions (walk together, put on shoes, wait), increase learning  opportunities for practicing requesting breaks and help, waiting. REPLACEMENT BEHAVIORS  Leelo is learning more appropriate behaviors to meet his needs: Getting attention by tapping and/or calling someone by name.   Staff provide daily opportunities for Leo to tap and/or call them by name. Leo consistently uses this replacement skill throughout the day when making requests. He does not yet use this when he wants to play or interact.  He does approach adults and hug them. He also approaches both adults and peers and hits or pushes them.  It is unclear if this type of hitting/pushing is an attempt to interact socially, or to create excitement/change in the environment.  Next steps:  Teach Leelo to invite someone to play by giving a play suggestion e.g. “Let’s play ball”, or “Let’s play swings”. Requesting a break:   Currently Leelo practices requesting a break 1-3x daily, usually in context of circle time, and/or work with teacher.   Next steps:  practice more frequently, or Leelo will lose this skill;  staff should consistently honor Leelo’s request for break during circle time. REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS These continue to wax and wane. In general, they are best treated by blocking him from completing them,  if possible, and redirecting Leelo to the task at hand. Currently, Leelo is requesting [others] to repeat words or phrases before he performs a skills e.g., ... “one at a time” during snack.   STRAWS During the summer, ... Leelo’s stereotypic use of straws [was identified] as a problem behavior which interfered with learning, was associated with aggression, and posed health risk (he takes used or dirty straws). Leelo hits himself and others when his request for a straw is denied, and prolonged use of straws is a risk factor for aggression. An assessment in September of straw use throughout the school day showed 3 general patterns for straw use: No straw access:  Leelo does not use straws during work station, puzzles, and snack, and generally does not ask for straws during these times Straw as reinforcer: During work with teacher and OT, straws may be used briefly (up to 10 seconds at a time, for a total of less than 1 minute) as a reinforcer for completing a task; Leelo also receives a straw for a few seconds when he completes all of his independent work station tasks. Unlimited straw access: During recess, motor room, walks, and circle time, Leelo has prolonged access to straws, for more than 5 minutes at time. Often, during these activities, Leelo may hold the straw for the entire duration of the activity ... Focus on reducing straw use [during leisure/unstructured time] by implementing a visual choice board of activities from which Leelo [will] select and participate in .... Straws were used as a reinforcer following participation in the activity. The intervention was effective immediately with straw use reduced from 100% ... to an average of 54% .... Straw use continued to be high on days when [routine was irregular], and when [demands were reduced] due to aggressive behavior. When the choice board is used, 2 positive outcomes follow: Leelo is more engaged with the activities and equipment available during [leisure/unstructured time], and straw use is reduced.  Next steps: Provide more variety of materials, and choices [during unstructured/leisure time]; consider bringing large trikes out during [this] time, as well as motor time; sensory table; large playground balls and basket hoop; bean bag activities; balloons; cones for tricycle obstacle course; Continue to increase Leelo’s engaged time with recess materials, and reduce straw time further. Explore this and other intervention strategies (e.g. noncontingent access) for reducing straw use at home Consider putting straws on Leelo’s schedule, so that he knows when he can get a new one. FOOD TOLERANCE Family and staff are working to increase his tolerance of new and less-preferred healthful foods. In November, Squid worked intensively and successfully with him on eating apples. Currently, Leelo can eat a large slice of apple (about 4-5 bites), before receiving a handful of preferred snack (veggie booty) [ Currently Leelo will eat an entire apple's worth of slices with no reinforcer ].  His family is now working with him on eating orange slices [ Discontinued; he loathes oranges. Via Sage and during speech/feeding therapy, we are having some success with freeze-dried mango, soy nuts, etc. ].  Next steps: continue with apples, gradually increasing the size of the slice prior to receiving the reinforcing snack; begin to introduce next target food at home, in intensive session.  Select food that was previously eaten by Leelo. ENGAGEMENT In addition to being critical for learning new skills, engagement in learning and activities is related to reduced aggression for Leelo. The more engaged Leelo is in purposeful, varied, and motivating activities, the less likely he is to hit himself and others.  HOME ABA PROGRAM This quarter, Leo’s home ABA program continued to emphasize self-care and behavior, leisure, and communication skills.  VISUAL SCHEDULE This quarter, Leelo’s family worked hard to produce materials for Leelo’s home schedule.   Next Steps:  begin to implement the schedule, beginning at a convenient time (e.g. one where parent can attend relatively uninterrupted to Leelo and the schedule use) VISUAL CUES FOR INSTRUCTION Leelo’s family now keeps four visual cues in the car, which help Leelo when given directions, including “shoes on,”  “seat belt on,” and “wait.”  Next Steps:  keep these and/or other visual cues on person when spending time with Leelo in any location (store, around house, etc).  Options include a key chain, small book, mini velcro board, etc. SELF CARE Check schedule: Continue to use visual schedule throughout ABA session Next steps: begin using visual schedule with family during designated 1-hour periods each day (e.g. morning prep for school, evening routine, etc). VISUAL SUPPORTS  Use text and icons to support routine, less-preferred directions (e.g. wait, shoes on, stop,etc). INDEPENDENT WORK Leo has mastered working on 5 tasks independently for between 15 and 30 minutes in his room.  Next steps:  do independent work at kitchen counter, or in living room. [ implemented ] Community Outings: Continue working on following the directions “stop”, “walk together” using visual supports. Increase independence by using visual cues on schedule e.g.  “put on shoes” to prepare for walk. Setting table: Continue working on setting multiple places at the table in the kitchen or dining room. Laundry: Leelo has mastered putting clothes in correct drawers. Continue working on sorting and folding clothes. Make a snack: continue working with Leelo to make a simple snack, such as sandwich or apple. Food Tolerance: Leelo is beginning to request apples spontaneously when he is hungry.  Continue working on newly introduced food (orange). Toileting: continue work to increase Leo’s independent initiations, reduce accidents. BEHAVIOR: Getting attention: Leelo has mastered calling people and/or tapping them to get their attention.  Next steps:  Leelo should learn to give a play idea or direction following getting the person’s attention. Help: continue work on requesting help; introduce text prompt (e.g. yellow card with word “help” on it);  Wait: continue work on waiting, using text prompt; Taking/requesting break: continue; teach Leelo how to take a break by leaving a less-preferred activity/area, doing something relaxing, and then returning to the area/activity. LEISURE Computer: Continue new games; continue keyboarding Reading: read stories with Leelo; do reading-related puzzle (e.g. matching word to picture, putting letters together to spell sight words); Games: continue learning new table games; begin playing with sister at table; Gross motor activities and exercise: swim, trampoline, walk/hike, bike, other. Craft or project: Continue working with Leelo on a multiple step (e.g. cut and paste) art or science project; Use visual cues and a finished product along with verbal directions COMMUNICATION AND ATTENTION [ if you know Leelo IRL feel free to jump in and reinforce ] Leelo is fluent at requesting, giving directions related to tangible things he wants; he occasionally comments to others about the current activity; his articulation and eye contact are inconsistent Continue to require eye contact and clear articulation, and only reinforce those communications. NLP: continue 5 words; emphasize giving play ideas (see above in behavior- attention); Talking in past tense about day at school: continue working with Leelo, using school day folder with photos.  Increase the variety of questions Leelo is answering (e.g. what did you do, who did you play/work with, what did you eat). Begin teaching Leelo to ask a reciprocal question following his answer. Asking and answering social questions: continue. Have Leelo practice with family, others. Taking conversation turns: work with Leelo to increase the length of his conversations from 1 turn each to 2 turns each. Include social and reciprocal questions and comments.

				 When I was a small boy I went to occupational therapy. They had me go on swings, hammer pegs, climb on ladders, and jump on trampolines. I remember one occupational therapist telling my mom that I had low muscle tone. In this case wouldn’t exercise, including weights, improve my muscle tone? We worked on my vestibular processing so I went from one swing to another instead of stretching, becoming more fit, or becoming more muscular. The result is that I was not fit enough, which is a problem in a mind/body communication deficit. Being fit enables me to tell my responsive body what to do. I work out with a trainer now because I need to have my body learn to be responsive. Now I see where my problems lie.  My soft muscle tone needs to get stronger. My cardio endurance needs to improve and I need more core strength, so I work on everything. Stretching is my most necessary thing and I detest it because it is painful. I will do it because I need to and it is worth the hurt. A lot of my current problems could have been prevented if people had worked on this when I was small. I think it is essential to work on fitness and flexibility for autistic people in a regular program.

Leelo has taken to compulsively touching the floor//his feet/the seat when he gets up from a seated position (stool, toilet, chair). Supervisor M would like us to help Leelo eliminate these behaviors, as they disrupt his ability to transition from one activity to the next, and are a form of stimming that is not sustainable, especially if they develop into more elaborate and more entrentched routines (they are also self-reinforcing). She would like us to stay next to him while he is seated, and gently but firmly block him from bending over/touching the floor when it is time for him to transition. She hopes that, with our help, this obsessive behavior can be faded out much like his previous obsession with taking off any clothes that had even a drop of water on them. And then we can spend more time helping him learn productive behaviors, behaviors that will lead to more independence and hopefully more happiness -- which is what we all want for this cute sweet challenging boy.

 Leelo Rosenberg’s Program Update 2/05/08 By Supervisor M Data inclusive from 9/15/07-12/31/07.  This quarter Leelo achieved many important learning milestones. Most significantly, Leelo learned to check a visual schedule to transition between activities. He also learned to play independently for over 10 minutes, switching to news toy when he was finished with the previous ones.  Leelo became familiar with using headphones to listen to music.  Leelo now enjoys hearing up to 10 minutes of his favorite music on CD using headsets (I-pod, here we come…).  Leelo also learned to tap people when he wants to get their attention.  All of these new skills are either aggression replacement behaviors or coping skills, and are critical to reducing Leelo’s aggressive behavior.  With this reduction in aggressive behavior, Leelo was able to master other new skills at home, and continue to make progress on other skills.  Leelo mastered about 20 discrete skills in ABA therapy, including social questions, sorting, and introductory phonics.  He has also made wonderful progress on more complex involved skills.  He began the Edmark Reading Program, a sight reading program, to complement phonics instruction, and he has successfully completed the first, pre-reading section at home and at school.  He also learned to set the table, and to sort his laundry and put it into drawers.  Once he can fold it- he will be ready to teach his sisters.   Despite an increase in accidents during the holidays, Leelo also continues to make progress on toileting, and is now in underwear all day long and using the toilet at home, school, and other environments for urine and bowel movements. Importantly, so far Leelo has not had a marked increase in aggressive behavior this winter, as he has had for the past 3 winters.  Leelo’s team suspects the Claritin, as well as his newly learned replacement behaviors, are responsible. Bittersweet news: Therapist L, who has been Leelo’s home therapist since he was just shy of 3 years old, will be moving on from Leelo’s team at the end of February.  Therapist L has been the bedrock of Leelo’s home ABA program, responsible for everything from teaching Leelo, to data collection and graphing, to material preparation, to running ABA sessions from a swimming pool in Kauai, and even massaging his feet with lotion.  I think I can speak for us all when I say she has brought such expertise and good spirit to Leelo’s team.  We are so grateful for all that she has shared with us over these years, and I’m sure she will shine at whatever she choses to do next. The team has agreed that this is a good opportunity for Leelo’s school to take on more ABA-based instruction of new skills, and for Leelo to attend school for a full day.  The past 2 months have been spent developing and implementing a transition plan to prepare everyone. Program Data Summary: Based on research in skill mastery, for all programs, mastery criteria is  90% correct on 2 consecutive sessions, unless otherwise indicated.  Previously, a criteria of 80% for 3/5 sessions was used.  It is felt that the current criteria is more stringent, and will result in better learning. GREETINGS: No change. Leelo continues to be fluent at independently saying goodbye, in response to other’s saying bye in a variety of ways, e.g. “I have to go now”, “see you later”, “bye”.  For “Hi/hello”, Leelo consistently says “hi” in response to greetings/waves with a 2 – 4 second time delay.  If the greeter waits, Leelo will  greet back.   Instructional strategies: It is essential that everyone in Leelo’s life wait for  2 to 4 seconds after greeting him, before prompting him.  Please DO NOT prompt Leelo by saying “what do you say” or “say Hi to X”, as he is relying on these cues. The greeter can prompt Leelo by getting close to him, securing eye contact, and waving along with the greeting, and if necessary- limiting distractions and straw access. MULTIPLE STEP IMITATIONS: SONGS AND HAND-CLAP GAMES:  This quarter Leelo began learning to imitate sequences of actions from preschool songs, and hand clap games which are popular with his age mates; while he has historically had difficulty with finger plays since preschool, he is highly motivated by the music.  He has mastered (5)Ram Sam Sam, Twinkle Twinkle, Itsy Bitsy Spider, Head Shoulders, and Down Town Baby (hand clap game); he is currently working on the Hokey Pokey.   Next Steps: continue with age-appropriate songs and simple actions. Generalization: practice at school and with family and friends at home. 2-STEP IMITATIONS WITH OBJECTS/PLAY SEQUENCES: Current prompt level: verbal instruction paired with 2-step imitation during preferred play activities (e.g. trains, teletubbies); Generalization: practice with wider range of materials, at school, with siblings. LAUNDRY: This task evolved from sorting and putting clothes into correct drawers, which are mastered. (2)Leelo is now learning to fold shorts, and put them into a drawer. Next step: fold pants, shirt, match and roll socks; multiple step- fold and put away. SETTING TABLE: Mastered setting cup, plate, napkin, fork, spoon, and knife using placemat jig at small work table (1).  Currently doing as independent work station task, and in school with modified table setting for up to 6 place settings (cup, plate, napkin). Next steps and generalization: practice at home at dining table. Practice prior to dinner, for functionality. Set 4 places. Fade out placemat jig. COUNTING/ONE TO ONE CORRESPONDENCE: Instructional strategy currently modified  as follows: point and label 5 stickers/ pictures on strip, coordinating pointing with label.  Next steps: Once mastered, replace stickers with numerals; eventually return to count objects.    FUNCTION OF OBJECTS: answering  the questions “what do you do with a X?” and “what’s a X for ?”.  Mastered (6): toothbrush, cup, book, scissors, crayons, chair. Currently working on piano.  Next steps: continue learning the functions of objects; later work on the senses in the same way (e.g. what is a nose for- smelling).  Generalization: practice at school, with family;  RECIPROCATE INFORMATION/COMMENTING:   ON HOLD, due to lack of live models;  will consider introducing at school instead;  Generalization:  practice observing and commenting on what people are doing around the house, at school,   ASKING SOCIAL QUESTIONS:   Mastered (5)  answering “how old are you?” ( 7), and “when is your birthday”.  Mastered answering AND asking back “what’s your name”, “how old are you?”, and “how are you” (although Leelo confuses these 2, so they are never asked sequentially).  Next steps: continue learning to ask more questions following giving a response to a question.  Instructional strategies: if necessary, use visual cue with 2 squares, to indicate when Leelo should answer question, and then ask question.  Use video model to support skill once he is using it with about 50 % proficiency.   Generalization: practice mastered skill with family, on play dates, at school with staff, peers.  FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS/TRAVEL AND TRANSFER INFORMATION: No change, due to lack of practice opportunities during therapy.  Discontinue during therapy, and emphasize instruction at school and with family.  When given a direction to do so, Leelo is working on traveling to a person who is out of sight, to tell them something/make a request.   Generalization: Practice traveling and transfer of info directions with family, peers, at school. WAIT: (1)In therapy, Leelo can now wait at least 45 seconds for something he wants, when shown a red “WAIT” card. Practice occurs in real life contexts.  Leelo also responds with appropriate waiting behavior when shown card in non-therapy contexts.  Next steps: continue to increase wait time in dtt setting, up to about 45 seconds.  Begin to practice in response to a request- when Leelo really wants something. Generalization: wait cards should be available to all people who spend time with Leelo, and should be used to cue him to wait appropriately.  Leelo should be reinforced with tangibles/ whatever he has requested for waiting appropriately in all settings. PHONICS/BEGINNING READING: Currently working on Jj.   Leelo has mastered the sounds for Aa Bb Cc Gg Hh Ii Ll Mm Pp Qq Ss Tt  Ww Yy    Next steps: continue introducing single letter sounds. Begin  consonant-vowel-consonant (cvc) blending, introducing very DIFFERENT words (e.g. sat and mom).   Similar rhyming words which are traditionally introduced together (e.g. cat, hat, rat) previously confusing for him EDMARK READING: Begun at home and at school; initial pre-reading section completed and skills mastered; currently working on discrimination test; Generalization: practice sight words by labeling around home and school environments, and creating sight word matching and labeling activities (e.g. folder tasks). FINE MOTOR SCISSOR SKILLS:  Cutting thick square shapes (turning paper while cutting); Leelo attending to lines, and self-corrects when he veers far from the line; Instructional strategies: while wrist weight was discontinued, staff felt Leelo’s skills NOT as good; continue with wrist weight; FINE MOTOR WRITING: Leelo currently working on Letter L; Instructional strategies; OT recommends tracing shaded lines, rather than dotted lines; emphasize diagonal lines; COMPUTER LEARNING:   Teach town (numeral identification) and PBS games; current goal to click, and to drag interspersed as separate skills; Generalization: Leelo also working on computer use at school, and with family TOILETING:   Currently dry when reminded to use toilet every 1.25 to 1.5 hours;  generally compliant to go to bathroom at home and at school; bowel accidents reduced to about 1 per week prior to holidays, with increase in accidents during the holidays  Next steps: Increase Leelo’s spontaneous initiations to use the toilet by reducing verbal prompt, using visual cues when necessary. Instructional Strategies: Use photo prompts for Leelo to state need to use toilet, and to initiate going to the bathroom, continue to reinforce with straw or other preferred, but no need for chocolate/most preferred;  stay out of Leelo’s visual field while he is using the toilet. BEHAVIOR: REPLACEMENT and COPING SKILLS:  Most importantly, in contrast with the past 3 years, Leelo is not having a marked increase in behavior problems this December or January; during the holidays, his family reported an increase in aggression in general, and especially towards his younger sister during the holidays, which has currently been reduced again;  At school, Leelo is observed to hit himself or others between 0 and 8 times per hour, with an average of about 3 times per hour.  Most observed aggression functions to escape from demands, with some aggression occurring to access straws. When he is sick with a cold, aggression increases across all functions.  Leelo has a tendency toward compulsive repetition of behaviors, such as flushing the toilet, leaning his head back to look up and side to side while seated, and repeatedly dropping and picking up straws. This is currently being managed by blocking the behavior and generally redirecting him to prevent or delay him from repeating the behavior.  The following are Leelo’s progress on replacement skills that help Leelo to better meet his own needs, or on coping skills that help him to tolerate the demands of everyday life. INDEPENDENT WORK TIME (Leelo time) Leelo has increased his attention span while working alone, and is now able to attend to 4 activities for about 10 minutes.  He is able to do open-ended activities (e.g. playing with an instrument, rolling in the body sock) and to transition independently to the next activity when he feels finished with the open-ended one.    When Leelo is completely finished, he approaches his therapist to tell her that he is all done, or that he cleaned up.   Next steps: continue to increase variety of tasks and length of time and number of tasks  Generalization: Leelo is currently doing independent work at school using closed-ended tasks;  Leelo should do independent work with family at home at least twice daily. REQUESTING AND TAKING BREAKS: After introducing a pre-recorded break button, Leelo now independently presses the button to request a break, often echoing the request “Can I have a break?”.  He is directed to sit on the carpet, and chose between two enjoyable activities. When he is done, he is beginning to independently put the toy away, and tell Therapist L that he cleaned up.  He continues to have behavior problems when he feels finished but has not been directed to clean up.  Next steps: increase frequency of practice; when pressing button independent in all situations, then fade button to increase verbal request or break card exchange.   Generalization: Begin practice taking breaks at home and at school, using break button TAPPING AND CALLING PEOPLE BY NAME: Tapping people is mastered at home and at school. Continue working on calling people by name.  Generalization: continue practice with various people in all environments. PICTURE AND TEXT SCHEDULE/PROMPT CARDS;  Mastered in ABA therapy and at school.  Leelo also requests “check schedule please” if he finishes an activity at school, and is not handed a name card.  He is beginning to use his picture schedule occasionally when with a babysitter.  Next step: Fade use of name cards, so that Leelo is completely independent of adults in knowing to check his schedule whenever he has finished something and is not sure what to do next. Begin using schedule with family.  Generalization: Leelo should use visual cues in all environments.  WEARING HEADPHONES: This quarter, Leelo has progress from 5 seconds to up to 10 minutes of listening to preferred music CDs at home.  Instructional strategies: continue to increase time and vary music and/or stories on CD; begin practice at school; NEXT STEPS: teach Leelo to operate CD player; offer as break choice, or independent work station choice; MANAGING STRAWS:  During ABA therapy, Leelo receives a straw as a reinforcer for good work for a brief (5 sec to 30 sec) interval as a  keeping straw use brief (10 seconds to 1 minute);  Generalization: At school, staff are working on using straws as reinforcers for good work, and on limiting straw access to brief intervals of less than 3 minutes.  having Leelo earn straws as a reinforcer for good work; CALMING/RELAXATION ACTIVITIES: Leelo’s need for calming activities has been reduced, as his aggressive behaviors are at lower frequency and intensity, and he is healthy. In general, the following calming activities are used as needed: massage with lotion, obstacle course, ambient background music, pressure on his forehead and cheeks (sinus area). NLP, SPONTANEOUS LANGUAGE, REQUESTS:  (S=spontaneous, P=prompted/modeled) Exciting new language includes use of newly learned words to describe emotions and feelings, eg: Leelo has recently been dancing around saying “I’m happy” with a huge grin on his face.  Leelo continues to use vocabulary which he has learned from the natural environment (e.g. “I’m thirsty”).  His negating of things he actually does want is recently not as pronounced. He continues to tag please on to most of his utterances.  Next steps: increase spontaneous language opportunities in the classroom  S- I’m happy (thirsty, sleepy)			 S- Want to go downstairs and see mommy please S-Help me please S- I cleaned up S- I want to play body sock S- No french fries (example of negating when he really DOES want something) S- Its on your head, please. S- Take off the bracelet, please. S- Sunny (the cat) is coming S- Here comes Annie (during play with trains) MEDICATION and HEALTH: No change: Leelo has generally been in good health this autumn and winter. He has taken Claritin daily, as recommended by his pediatrician for sinus congestion, and his team suspects this may be contributing significantly to his maintaining appropriate behavior throughout the winter season.    He continues to take a daily dose of cod liver oil.  His food preferences remain restricted, generally including bananas, pancakes, croissants, pretzels, and peanut butter sandwiches.

The blog SharpBrains has published  an interview with Michael Posner  that should be of interest to all parents, but especially those parents whose children struggle with attentional issues.  Here's a small sample: SB:  The other main area of your research is attention. Can you explain the brain-basis for what we usually call \"attention\"? 

 MP:  I have been interested in how the attention system develops in infancy and early childhood. 

 One of our major findings, thanks to neuroimaging, is that there is not one single \"attention\", but three separate functions of attention with three separate underlying brain networks: alerting, orienting, and executive attention. 

 Alerting: helps us maintain an Alert State. 

 Orienting: focuses our senses on the information we want. For example, you are now listening to my voice. 

 Executive Attention: regulates a variety of networks, such as emotional responses and sensory information. This is critical for most other skills, and clearly correlated with academic performance. It is distributed in frontal lobes and the cingulate gyrus. 

 The development of executive attention can be easily observed both by questionnaire and cognitive tasks after about age 3–4, when parents can identify the ability of their children to regulate their emotions and control their behavior in accord with social demands. 

 SB:  \"Executive attention\" sounds similar to executive functions. 

 MP:  Executive functions are goal-oriented. Executive attention is just the ability to manage attention towards those goals, towards planning. 

 Both are clearly correlated. Executive attention is important for decision-making (how to accomplish an external goal) and with working memory (the temporary storage of information). For example, given that you said earlier that you liked my monograph,  I have been thinking of the subheadings and sections there as I provide you my answers, using my working memory capacity. Posner also mentions a computer-based attention training program,  available here .  I'll be investigating the program and will report on it later.

 Leelo Report 
 
 Leelo is doing faboolously, mastering many new skills, and also generalizing with the skills he's already got (this means he can use those skills elsewhere than in his specific therapy sessions, e.g., playing properly with trains on a display in a store).
 
 Supervisor M is particularly excited about his using four-word phrases during NLP (natural language) training. Check out the full  informal report .

 Leelo’s Team Meeting 9/19/07 Home News Toilet training: accidents 3x per week, including times when Leelo starts pooing and then finishes into toilet.  Last few weeks toileting time is shorter, no need for long sessions of reading stories, watching movies.  Try casually blocking flusher to prevent serious flushing obsession problems. Language and social interaction Leelo playing with Iz in pool: waiting for her so they can count to 3 and jump in together; blew kisses goodbye to Mali; more spontaneous imitation with sisters Purposeful engagement with toys, activities Leelo is enjoying more games and activities; when he initiates by tapping and calling name, prompt him to request “play with me” and engage him- he doesn’t always really want or need a straw right now. Schedule use going well at school and in ABA, is very helpful in reducing problem behaviors during transitions, increasing independence; begin at home by November. School News Working with Leelo on tapping, independent work stations, picture schedule; staff is learning how to manage straws, prompting breaks during circle, prompting from behind, math 1 to 1 correspondence. New short term sub (Teacher D). ABA therapy news: Wearing headphones:  Has worn them for up to 3 min and 30 sec.  Most often still 5 to 10 seconds; try books/stories on tape and CD. Function of objects: Knows toothbrush; working on bed Sorting clothes into drawer: keep sweater and shirt separate (too similar) Making sandwich: work on at kitchen counter; use child-sized containers for PB and J Playdate possibilities: consider structured play with Iz Tapping and calling name: Leelo getting fluent at tapping, doing spontaneously at home, school, with adults and peers; needs to call name also (e.g. getting out of seatbelt in car in order to tap mom). Focusing in on behavior/Behavior Plan Revision (coordinate with next IEP) Behavior plan checklist reviewed; still appropriate/relevant Clarifying triggers/antecedents to aggression and escalating sequences of behavior; emphasis this month. TV- keep Leelo seated and at least 8 feet from TV. Intervening sooner to prevent contact and escalation: once we better identify escalating sequences and triggers, we can be more effective in intervening. Supervisor LP taking over QA from Supervisor Andil: we will work with LP on evasion and other tactics for when Leelo is escalated.

  by guest blogger, Michael Ramirez 
 www.special-fit.com 
 Recently I received a call from a parent asking if I could fitness train an autistic child. I had been a high school baseball coach for over 10 years. Much of my expertise in fitness had come from various experiences in working with athletes in strength and conditioning programs, working in fitness centers, through textbook study, and apprenticing other fitness experts. I also had 10 years of experience working as a behaviorist with autistic children. I had a sound understanding of both areas, but this was an opportunity to combine the two. I quickly discovered that despite the fact that people with autism face many physical challenges, there wasn’t much information out there or programs that addressed this area. In order to work with this child, I would have to start from scratch and develop a program tailored specifically for him. 
 When I began my research, I started to think about what was available to the autism community. School programs, like Adaptive PE, really didn’t address the issues I was going to try to work on. One problem I saw with APE, during my years as a behaviorist, is that it focused too much on teaching how to play certain games or sports, which I found to be too abstract, with not enough focus on getting the kids to move and use their bodies. Instead of focusing on functional movements, these programs produced more frustration because of the slow paced activities. I then questioned why people with autism don’t go to their local gym or just hire a trainer. This was obvious. First, even if a parent hired a personal trainer to work out their child, there was no guarantee that the trainer would have any understanding of autism and the challenges that accompany people living with this condition. Secondly, therapists like myself, don’t always have the fitness background to be able to work on the fitness side in a safe and knowledgeable way. Needless to say there weren’t many resources out there, so I was going to have to develop a program through the combination of my two experiences in both the fitness world and as a behaviorist. 
 I began to think about all of the different children I had worked with in the past and the physical challenges they faced each day. Many of the kids I had seen shared many similar physical characteristics like low muscle tone, poor coordination, lack of strength, lack of flexibility, balance issues, and overall limitations in their movements. Then there was the neurological aspect that impacted their physical functioning. Challenges with motor planning and sensory integration (proprioception and vestibular) were the most evident.Communication and behavioral challenges are also common among children with autism. Taking this into consideration, it became clear why there weren’t many programs out there for people with autism. There were so many issues that made it difficult to produce such a program. Safety was the first thing came to my mind. Initially I was uncertain how I was even going to get a child with autism to perform the basic functions of fitness. Although I had a great deal of experience in working with kids with autism on the behavioral side as well as many experiences working with neuro-typical people on the fitness end, I had never combined the two. Many autistic people are very out-of-shape and have significant gaps in their strength and mobility. With this in mind, I began 
 imagining the process of getting one of my clients to do a burpee, or a deadlift or to run for an extended period of time, or to be willing to exert themselves in a way that would get them the types of results that would be necessary for a physical transformation. This is hard for anyone beginning a fitness program, but is particularly challenging for an autistic child who may not be used to engaging in any kind of exercise. I knew that if I was going to get anyone in shape, they would have to be exposed to “real fitness.” I had worked alongside occupational therapists for many years. I had seen how they struggled to get children to do some of the things they demanded. What I was going to require was not like putting a child on a swing. I was going to demand real workouts with the goal of fitness and progression. 
 
 A couple years back, I had been exposed to the concept of CrossFit through a family member. I had trained in CrossFit for a couple years when I began to train my first client with autism. When I started to think about all the experiences and knowledge I had from the therapeutic and fitness side, CrossFit was a good match as a means to structure a program specifically tailored for children with autism. CrossFit scales exercises to the individual. This seemed to connect to the “I” in Stanley Greenspan’s DIR Floortime Model which stands for “individual differences.” Since no two people are alike, no two people with autism are alike either. Children that I would be working with needed a specific program to fit their needs. CrossFit allowed people to progress based on their current fitness level. CrossFit was developed by Coach Greg Glassman. CrossFit ,com states that Glassman defined “ fitness in a meaningful, measurable way (increased work capacity across broad time and modal domains). CrossFit itself is defined as that which optimizes fitness (constantly varied functional movements performed at relatively high intensity).” 
 
 Many children with autism struggle with flexibility and range of motion. Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) was a good answer to this. Of course I needed to modify its application. PNF was a good way for me to facilitate stretching without having the student do the work. The combination of this type of stretching routine and the CrossFit structure, gave me the necessary components needed to design a good program to fit the needs of people with autism. All I needed to do was test it. 
 
 I began to work with the family who was in search for a personal trainer. It was my first opportunity to test my concepts and ideas. There were many bumps in the road, but the road to success is not always straight, as they say. It took a while to figure out how to elicit certain movements, capture attention, and promote motivation. I relied heavily on my experiences working with Dr. Arnold Miller, who created The Miller Method; a cognitive systems approach to working with kids on the spectrum. The basic philosophy that I took from his teachings, in the application to this program, was the use of children’s aberrant systems and transforming them into functional, relevant activities. For example, 
 one of my athletes likes to take string like objects and twirl them around. It is a self-stimulatory behavior. I used his motivation to stim on these objects, to introduce a heavy rope and create a system of functional movements that can be repeated. It turns “rituals into repertoire”, also a title of one of Dr. Miller’s books. His philosophy in working with people with autism shifted my view about how to use certain behaviors that are common to people with autism. I was fortunate enough to have worked closely with Dr. Miller for several years before his passing. His techniques worked well in combination with CrossFit methodologies. They simply complimented each other. 
 
 The philosophy of this workout program is based on three principles: Neurological/Physical/Individual Based (NPI). Neurological Skills, as it refers to fitness, describes functions like agility, accuracy of movements, coordination, and balance, as well as body awareness. Physical Skills include characteristics like strength, flexibility, endurance, stamina, power, etc. The last part takes into consideration the differences between each individual. Everyone has their own set of skills and abilities. With children and teens with autism, I needed to consider many different things, primarily communication (receptive 
 and expressive), cognitive ability, socio-emotional skills, sensory processing, behavioral challenges, and learning styles. Scaling and modifying exercises, using the CrossFit methods allowed us to tailor a program specifically for each individual, while helping them progress through each movement at their own pace. 
 
 The physical components of exercise in relation to people with autism needed to address the student’s areas of weakness as well as their strengths. My research emphasized the five basic fundamental movements of fitness: pushing, pulling, bending, rotation, and locomotion. These foundational movements allow us to work on basic movements, and build up to more complex and compound movements, through the use of scaling and prompting. Many autistic kids have difficulties with these movements. For example, one of my clients has a big frame and was fearful of certain movements. In our assessment, he was fearful of bending his elbows to lower his upper body because he thought he would 
 not be able to support his own weight and might flop down and smash his face into the ground. As a result, he was unable to do a push-up, so for weeks and months we worked incrementally toward this goal, first by getting him vertical and pushing off a wall, and then by progressively lowering him horizontally towards the ground. Today he can push off the ground, and with a little assistance, he can get his hips up. I know it will be no time before he is doing a full push-up on his own. He has also made big strides in his ability to bend and squat. Initially he would bend his knees only very minimally. This impacted on his ability to perform daily functions like picking up an object from the floor 
 or even sitting down at a desk. A few weeks ago he got his rear end below his knees for the first time, when doing an air squat, with some support to maintain balance (holding his hands out in front of his chest). This was a great accomplishment for him. 
 
 When I began to work with some of my first clients I noticed many common 
 characteristics. Many of the children had bodies that had low muscle tone, very weak posterior chain and core muscles, tightness in the lower half, and very soft upper bodies (Physical). Some of the kids I met had difficulties with balance, coordination, motor planning, agility, the ability to perform compound movements, and be accurate in movements (Neuro). There were also deficits in communication, attention, and behavioral issues, which made it difficult to motivate them to perform for an extended period of time. Let’s face it; exercise can sometimes be painful and hard, especially in the beginning. To get the best results in each workout I focused on strength, compound movements, strengthening a specific muscle groups, and work on the constant varying functional movements at a high intensity. 
 It takes time to get the kids accustomed to the workload, the pacing, and to gain confidence in the movements. There are times when I need to be more of a motivational coach, than a fitness coach. It is definitely a process. All of my students are making gains in one way or another. Working on physical fitness has its obvious advantages when you consider the health benefits but when it comes to people with autism, the benefits are even greater. I have received feedback that fitness training has impacted things like: sleep patterns, energy levels, mood, attention, communication and behavior. One of my students expressed that exercising helps him to feel his body better. He also feels 
 it has been helpful with his pointing (typing). Exercise gives kids with autism added satisfaction and increased self-esteem when they connect their brain and their body and even strategies to deal with excess energy. Recently, the mother of a client told me that her son requested to do some pull-ups in the middle of a behavioral therapy session. He then proceeded to continue to perform his own routine of sit-ups and push-ups in combination until he relaxed. 
 Fitness is an area that has far too long been under utilized in the lives of people with autism. My mission is to change that, through my company, Special-Fit. I want to thank all of my students for inspiring me and helping me develop this program. It was because of the relationship I’ve created with them and their families, that forever changed the way I view people with autism. They have taught me more about breaking through limitations than any other individuals I have met in my lifetime.

9 best things to do for a kid with cerebral palsy (that don't feel like work)
" "
 
 
 
 What are your best tips for kids with cerebral palsy? That's what I asked an amazing pediatric therapist in honor of  National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day, happening this Sunday March 25. Stacy M. Menz,  based in the San Francisco Bay area, has worked  with hundreds of kids with CP. She blogs at  Starfish Therapies  ( a great blog, check it out!) and she's a columnist for  PediaStaff . I know we all already have more than enough therapy to do with our kids (understatement alert!); what's genius about Stacy's suggestions is that they are basic lifestyle ideas you can easily incorporate into your days. And you're going to  love  the part where she suggests giving yourself and your kid breaks! 
 
 
 
 
When I sat down to write this, I thought it would be a breeze. Boy, was I wrong. Each item seemed to morph into
many items and then I’d realize I still forgot something that I really wanted
to share. Writing this list, while
thinking of all the children I have seen with CP over the years, made me really
appreciate the differences in each child with CP I have met. I know every child
with CP is different, but I have tried to make my top points applicable to all! 
 
 
 
 
 
 1. Avoid w-sitting.  This is the number one things I tell almost
all of my families. The topic of
w-sitting tends to bring up a lot of controversy usually because parents have
sat this way themselves and have not noticed any detrimental effects. Kids who have CP often sit
this way because it provides them with a really stable base of support allowing
them sit independently. However, that comes at a cost. W-sitting will
also limit and hinder their ability to develop trunk strength, trunk rotation,
hand preference and independent movement in and out of sitting. Tis position also encourages
hamstring tightness, hip and femur alignment issues, and poor posture. Instead of w-sitting work with your
therapists to find some alternatives ways to sit independently as well as work
on other activities.   
 
 
 
 2. Give kids time to be kids.  Kids with CP are often so
scheduled with therapy appointments that they don’t have time to be a kid, goof
off, and do the things other kids do. Give them unstructured play time with their peers or
siblings or even with you. Let them
guide the interaction and see where it will lead.  The best part is that usually these
unstructured moments are just as therapeutic as all the structured
therapy. It provides them a great
opportunity for them to work on integrating the skills they learn in therapy
and generalizing it out into their day-to-day environment. 
 
 
 
 3. Maintain range of motion early.  Maintaining range of motion
at various joints in the body can be a challenge when a child has a diagnosis
of CP, especially as they grow and get older. With each growth spurt their muscles can get a little tighter and they
lose just a little bit more range. This
is true for both kids who have low tone and kids who have high tone. Depending on the severity, decreased range of
motion can affect your child’s ability to move, or even the ability to maintain
your child’s hygiene.  Start early and
get into the habit of stretching your child or encouraging a multitude of
positions. It’s a lot easier to maintain their range of motion than it is to
get it back. Some areas to pay attention to are your child’s spine, hamstrings,
ankles, hands, and hips. 
 
 
 
 4. Don't be afraid to take therapy vacations!  Its very easy to get caught up in the more-is-better mindset, but at the same time giving your child a break every once in a
while is good for them. It allows their
bodies and brains a chance to take all of the skills and pieces of skills that
they have been practicing over and over and bring it together in a way that
‘clicks’.  In addition it gives their
bodies time to rest a bit.  Think about training
for a race, taper days are included in the work out program so that your body
can recover; well kids need some recovery time as well!  I often find that after a child comes back
from a vacation or a break they will move up to the next level of whatever
skill they have been working on. 
 
 
 
 5. Know that tone and strength are different.  Many kids with CP
have altered muscle tone. This can be
high tone, low tone or mixed tone (a combination of high and low). Low tone is a little easier to see the
underlying weakness and therefore strengthening low tone muscles tends to make
sense. High tone is a little more
challenging because the muscles tend to be \"turned on\" and stiffer already, so
strengthening seems counterintuitive. The reality is that under that high tone, the muscle is weak and by
strengthening the muscles, it can help the child to regulate and have some
control over their tone.  Overall,
strengthening muscles for kids with CP is important because the strength is
what provides them the means to increase their function. 
 
 
 
 6. Core strengthening is important, too!  All strengthening is important—however, the core is the foundation that allows kids to move and to function. The more stable they are in their core the more function they will be able to achieve. A strong core is able to react to changes in balance, sit up tall for increased attention, improve breathing, vocalization and eating, enhances fine motor control, and is involved in almost any activity or function that you want your child to master. 
 
 
 
 7. Promote independence.  Encouraging your child’s
mobility and providing them the resources to have independent mobility can be a
fine line to walk. Many kids with CP are
reliant on their parents, caregivers and aides for mobility and/or
interaction. Providing your child a
means of independent exploration and mobility allows them to explore their
environment, interact with their peers, promote self reliance, and enhances
cognitive skills. Providing them a means
for independent mobility can happen in many ways. It can be power mobility or an
assistive device, or it can be teaching them self directed behavior so that they
don’t need to rely on you for step by step cues on what to do next. Just because you provide them with assistive
devices or wheelchairs doesn’t mean that you have to stop working on
progressing their mobility without the assistive device. In fact, a lot of
times gaining independent movement in an assistive device can help foster the
desire to move and thereby increase their self-motivation. In addition, let your child try tasks
independently even if its messy (like feeding) they feel a sense of
accomplishment when they get to do things on their own. 
 
 
 
 8. Mix harder stuff with easier stuff.  Think about when you are learning a
new skill, how often do you have to practice it until you master it? Quite a bit, I’m sure. During that time required for practice, it’s
energy-consuming both physically and mentally to learn the task. For kids with CP, every new skill requires
exponentially more practice and more energy than when we learn something new.
So what may seem simple to us—such as walking across a room, or eating a meal—can be a workout for a child with CP. But with practice and time, these challenging tasks will get
easier. Don’t give up when something is
really difficult; try mixing it in on a regular basis with easier
activities to prevent frustration for both you and your child. For example, if I'm working on walking with a kiddo and it's hard for them, but they are good at standing or crawling I'll have them practice walking for a bit and then stand at their destination to read a book or play with a toy or use the iPad and then if they want they can crawl back to the 'starting line' where we started practicing walking and try again. This will
provide them with practice of a challenging task and give them a rest (mentally
and/or physically) while successfully completing another task. 
 
 
 
 9. Encourage your kid to be active every day.  Kids are meant
to be active and being active promotes a healthy lifestyle. However, many kids with CP have the tendency
to have poor fitness as a result of their challenges with movement. Encourage this by finding ways to
get them active daily.  It doesn’t have
to be structured: Spend time at the
park, go in the water with them, make up games at home, or see what activities
your community offers. Regardless of
your child’s ability to move, there are ways they can be active to promote
their health and, most importantly, have FUN!

Yesterday began with a disappointment: The weather report predicted rain, which meant I needed to cancel the planned SEPTAR/families of kids with special needs picnic. I had really been looking forward to bringing all our kids to a local park and taking it over, would not have entirely minded if the mommies and toddlers that usually dominate decided to leave rather than conceptualize my son and his friends, and had wanted to have a good, worry-minimized outing with all my kids, their friends, and my friends. Instead, Signora Blog and her family came over for pizza and a rollicking good time, and we all watched the sky not rain. D'oh! Leo's therapist, V, was here for part of the evening, but left at 7:30. All the kids were still tumbling like puppies in a cardboard box, and Leo jumped right in when SB's son Alfredo encouraged him to come jump on the trampoline. Leo. Playing. With other kids. For a long, long time. Watching them bounce and run made me grateful for just how beautifully Leo is doing right now. We have documentation, strategies, and next steps for trying to keep that beautifully going. Seymour and I met with Leo's two program supervisors on Tuesday (Supervisor M runs his program but concentrates on the school angle; she subcontracts Supervisor E to do QA and run the home program; the school district pays for both). I don't know if it was the caffeine-fueled environment (I love you,  Coffee Bar ) or just how well Leo is doing at the moment, but we charged through a very full agenda with focus and results. Here are Supervisor M's notes, slightly modified. ------------- READING Home/home program:  Headsprout  reading: computer phonics-based, to supplement reading instruction at school.  Action: Squid and Seymour will do 30 day trial, consider purchasing 1st half of the program Reading at school. Leo is only doing about 10 minutes of EdMark sight reading program each day, because Leo's teacher is the only one of the classroom staff trained in its use. Action: Squid and Seymour will request teachers to dedicate more time to teaching Leo to read, less time in unstructured recreational activities with no clear goals (indoor play, walks). PANTS (and how to keep them up) All agreed Leo’s body shape not able to combat the forces of gravity; solutions to be tried this summer: Dedicating time to teach Leo to better pull up underpants, then pants, using mirror for feedback Trying alternative types of pants (e.g. zipper and snap, briefs instead of boxer-briefs) Trying a belt Keeping pants cuffed so they don’t get pulled down from being too long EATING Further slowing Leo down when he eats; Supervisor E noticed great improvement, after not seeing Leo for five months; at school, trying to further slow him by having him chew for 5 seconds prior to drinking water; caution being taking to prevent Leo from becoming insistent/dependent on adult counting. S: I would note that we have encouraged Leo to take a drink of water between bites, and to \"take a small bite.\" He has made this part of his routine, and now asks us to repeat the quoted phrase before beginning to eat. He does continue to take the smaller and alternating bites for the remainder of the meal. Not sure if this is a negative; at the moment he's not capable of making his own meals and we don't leave him unsupervised around food, so an adult will always be there to give him that first prompt.  TOILETING Night-time training; preliminary data suggests Leo withholding BMs in daytime and going in pullup on his bed; also suspicion that Leo is often dry when he wakes, and then wets pullup once awake if not taken immediately to bathroom; also drinking a lot in pool/tub- primes him for accidents.  Action: Supervisor M will send out questionnaire this month for Squid & Seymour to complete, to gather more info, identify objectives, make a plan.  Action: Squid & Seymour will resume the use of food reinforcers for spontaenous & successful BMs during the day. AGGRESSIVE & SELF-INJURIOUS BEHAVIOR Behavioral definitions of aggressive behavior and self-injurious behavior: review, revise to make sure we are all describing what we see the same way: Aggressive behaviors- have potential to injure others: hitting, pushing, pinching, scratching, kicking, elbow grinding, head-butting others, throwing materials Self-injurious behaviors- have potential to injure Leo: slapping self on face and stomach, hitting head against surfaces; hitting hands against surfaces; Precursor behavior: stomping Action: Supervisor E to review with Therapist V, Supervisor M to work with Squid to incorporate on google spreadsheet (see below), Supervisor M to incorporate clarifications at school. HOME PROGRAM Changing emphasis on home programming; shift towards quality of life arrangements, and away from precision programming more typical of intensive early intervention; in general, all programming should: increase access to reinforcement, reduce exposure to situations associated with problem behaviors. Strategies generally include: using visual supports, maintaining consistency and routines while introducing variety and novelty in controlled, manageable ways, making most of periods of reduced behavior problems. Squid & Seymour gave examples of how Leo is participating more in family and other activities that increase his access to “life reinforcements,” such as trip to the Maker Faire, hiking with family, kicking soccer ball back and forth with Iz and Seymour for about 10 minutes, playing with siblings on trampoline, took off with Squid to go hiking, stay in motel and swim. Now is a great time to make the most of Leo's current low rates of behavior in terms of teaching replacement behaviors, social interaction skills. Leo better tolerating Mali when she is crying, screaming; important first step for replacing hitting others with an actual skill/behavior; consider having dedicated weekly time for Leo to do specific activities with each sister. Seymour: idea of having Mali participate by sharing materials with Leo, especially things he likes (e.g. getting him his straw, swimsuit to go swim, etc). Critical to all of the above: repetition. Leo learns best with frequent, brief, repeated opportunities to practice. So: Action: plan regularly for soccer, or hiking, or other family fun.  INDEPENDENT WORK RESISTANCE Squid & Seymour indicated Leo resistant to doing independent work, possibly due to boredom. Action: Supervisor M and Squid will create 6 bins of activities for Leo to do during independent time, possibly including “ my busy kits ” activities.  Bins can be rotated weekly to prevent boredom.  About every 2 months, consider adding new materials and toys to keep it interesting, varied, and fun for Leo. VISUAL SCHEDULE Important strategy for increasing independence, further increasing Leo’s tolerance for new things and changes in routines; Important to expand schedule, and increase Leo’s independent use of schedule, rather than fade it out. Keep in mind- we all use schedules, datebooks, blackberry/iphones to maintain our schedules too. Action 1: continue morning routine, switch “new straw” location, so Leo maintains flexibility around this Action 2: begin using schedule for evening routine or “witching hour” Action 3: next steps to increase independence- Leo should independently travel to schedule, and/or keep modified version of schedule on his person Action 4: Leo should set up parts of schedule in which there is some choice GOOGLE SPREADSHEET Revising the online google spreadsheet: make more quantitave for more effective analysis, also quicker to complete. Action: Supervisor M gave Squid sample of more ideal formatting, Squid will implement.

Seymour and I had a meeting with Leelo's Supervisor E tonight, to discuss our family's ongoing behavioral efforts to help Leelo manage his aggression. (Supervisor E has taken over the greatly-reduced home component of Leelo's learning, whereas Supervisor M focuses on working with Leelo's curriculum and classroom work, and ensuring classroom-to-home consistency.) I enjoy our meetings with Supervisor E. It is like going to church in that our goals, our reasons, and our knowledge about Leelo and his behavior are clarified and reinforced, and we take in more of the True Path, the one that will continue to show our son The Way. Here is what we discussed tonight: Overall the tone of our interactions with Leelo needs to be very clear. Positive for positive behavior, neutral/unengaged for undesired behavior. He needs to learn to get our attention by behaving well, not badly. If he is behaving in desired manner, one we want to reinforce and have him repeat, we give him constant positive verbal reinforcement. The moment he acts out, our tone becomes flat and business-like, with interactions kept as brief as possible. We want to prevent episodes rather than impose discipline. Prevention is much less messy. PREVENTING EPISODES Use visual supports. Activity schedules help Leelo organize and anticipate. They also facilitate more independence, as he can scan and work through much of his schedules without external input or prompting. Individual icons are good for easing transitions (e.g., icons used in car: \"Put on Seatbelt,\" etc.) Lots and lots of non-contingent positive praise/reinforcement (e.g., While in car, every minute or so say something like, \"Leelo, you are doing a good job keeping shoes on!\") Warn Leelo about what is happening next. Let Leelo know when we will be turning attention away from him. RESPONSE TO AGGRESSIVE EPISODES Evade. Step back, get out of the way. Say \"STOP!\" (This is a specific direction that tells him what to do, as opposed to non-specific \"NO!\") Give a single, one-step direction, e.g., \"sit down.\" We do not want Leelo to learn that attacking gives him big screeching reactions from his parents. He needs to receive NO reinforcement for such behavior. Supervisor E will be back in two weeks, and in the interim will be thinking about a small reinforcement system that we can use for Mali, to get her to stop reacting so extremely when Leelo targets her. Her fear is legitimate and her shrieking understandable, but if we can get her to run away and not scream, Leelo will lose his reinforcement and she will be safer. In Supervisor E's experience, punishment rarely works with kids like Leelo. They don't know why you are doing it, and it makes them feel like they are being attacked for no reason. BEDTIME ROUTINE Maintain same lovely, happy, snuggly bedtime routine. Once our boy is tucked in bed, nice mommy and daddy are all done and all-business mommy and daddy emerge. Any getting out of bed, even for legitimate toilet needs, is met with only the bare minimum required interaction, and no eye contact. Same phrase, \"back in bed,\" is used consistently and with no affect. Your kid doesn't have to have autism to use a lot of these techniques, by the way. Take away the icons and schedule and the aggressive attacks, and you have a plan for dealing with any kid whose brattiness has a behavioral component.

Stim-Sense
" "
This post is a cross-pollination between Barbara at  TherExtras  and JoyMama at Elvis Sightings –- co-authored by two bloggers who have never met in person, but hope one day they will.   When we move ourselves our bodies are wired to  feel  that movement.  We humans have beautifully intricate wiring (nerves) connecting feeling (sensory) with movement (motor).   Some movement  feels  good.  And with that basic understanding, seeing children who repetitively moved in (sometimes unusual) ways, charter psychologists called this behavior self-stimulation.  Early in Barbara’s career, therapists commonly shortened this to self-stim.  Currently, parents like JoyMama and others who encounter or engage in self-stim have learned to call these behaviors ‘stimming’. Stimming is part of the  DSM definition of autism , though the definition does not use the word, perhaps because it is not technically-defined,  nor even in the dictionary .  \"Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements).\"  However, one can receive an autism diagnosis without meeting this particular criterion -- and stimming is associated with other conditions as well.  Not everyone who stims has autism. Repetitive movement is important for learning -- a mantra of Barbara’s if you read her blog regularly.  But stimming does not fit the \"important for learning\" category in the same way, and can actually impede learning.  Most educational/therapeutic references to stimming are made with negative overtones. Stimming is sometimes described in words like these:   unproductive, obsessive, obstructive, annoying, consuming .  These perceptions of stimming are common among people who are observing it, such as parents, educators, bystanders. In the autism community, some think that since stimming is part of the autism definition, reducing the stimming amounts to a reduction in the autism.  Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), an educational technique intended to reduce autistic behavior, is associated with that approach.    But another list of descriptors implies a different perspective on stimming:  pleasurable, centering, meditative, regulating, communing .  You are more likely to hear these from people who engage in stimming themselves. Within this second perspective stimming is viewed as similar to what neurotypical individuals do to calm or entertain themselves: thumb-twiddling, pencil-tapping, leg-jiggling, even knitting. Stimming as regulating activity is seen as beneficial for helping people \"keep it together,\" allowing them to block out negative or frightening input and keep from feeling overwhelmed.     One particularly thought-provoking insider-view comes from Amanda Baggs, an autistic self-advocate.  In the first few minutes of the video \"In My Language\" below, she shares some of her \"stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms,\" as the DSM would say.  The latter part of the video gives Amanda's own translation of the meaning of her movements, using a voice synthesizer (Amanda's means of speech). Families of children with autism struggle to find a balance between stimming and education.  How does stimming interface or interfere with learning? Does the behavior stand in the way of beneficial play? Learning is the work of childhood.  And stimming can indeed impede learning when it consumes the play-time and energy, or turns educational objects into stim-objects.   JoyMama and Barbara offer the following ideas... in two categories. (This is a brief listing.  To find out more, ask the professionals who work with your child.)   Reducing or preventing stimming regular (daily is best) ‘heavy work’ or strenuous activity/exercise  consultation with a psychiatrist to rule-out or treat co-morbid mental illness  consultation with a neurologist to rule-out or treat co-morbid seizures  structured lifestyle discovering and avoiding an individual's triggers for stimming (for example, Joy stims on ribbons and strings.  Her family sometimes \"disappears\" such objects when the focus needs to be elsewhere).   Using stimming to benefit the person or enhance their life stimming as reward-breaks between learning activities allowing some stim that can be done simultaneously with learning activity - maybe chewing a tube can help your child focus on a book or drawing   use stimming during learning-play -- place a stimmy-toy into a tunnel to crawl & retrieve, take turns with tossing/catching a stimmy-object enter into the stimming-world together -- letting gravel run between your fingers and toes feels good! Therapists have a saying that if you take away one stimming preference, another will develop in its place.  Complete elimination of a stimming habit might be unrealistic, and not even desirable, depending on what function the stimming serves.  Stimming-related goals, like all goals, are best seen in the context of the whole child.  Re-evaluate on a regular basis whether you are satisfied with the progress of your child or the effectiveness of the therapeutic and educational methods being used.  Update September 2010:  There's an excellent  insider-perspective post at  Reports from a Resident Alien  about stimming and its purposes and the sensory channels it affects. Would you share approaches you have used to prevent or incorporate stimming in the life of your child?

 I am a fan of massage therapy.  Massage has helped to alleviate my chronic neck and back pain - the result of years of lifting my son Nicholas, who is now 25 and is disabled with cerebral palsy.  But I have also used massage a tool to soothe my mother's muscles and even to comfort my mother in law as she lay dying in hospital.  If you care for a loved one with Alzheimer's or dementia, you may wish to learn more about the benefits of massage.   
 
 
As a caregiver, you are constantly looking for treatments
that will benefit those you take care of. But you may have overlooked the one
treatment that has been around for a long time—massage. Massage is more than a
relaxing rubdown. It also has a number of therapeutic effects that may very
likely help improve the lives of your loved ones.  
 
 
 
Geriatric massage therapy is specifically designed with the
needs of seniors in mind. This type of massage incorporates gentle and light
techniques that can include passive stretching of the muscles. A light oil or
lotion is typically applied to the skin so that the skin isn’t irritated while
the muscles are being worked.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As a caregiver, it would be a good idea to accompany your
loved one to help them relax and have a comfortable experience. As you would
with any activity, make sure to communicate with your loved one’s doctor their
intent to have a massage. If your loved one is concerned about their modesty,
assure them that they can decide on the amount of clothing they wear.    If they wish, only the area being worked on
will be exposed.  
 
 
 
The effects of massage on those with Alzheimer’s have met
with mixed reviews. Many claim it has a calming effect on the sufferer. Those
with Alzheimer’s are frustrated and anxious because they struggle to
communicate with others. Massage acts as a non-verbal means of communication.
In one study a group receiving hand massages while being talked to in a calm
voice reported lower pulse rates and reduced inappropriate behavior. The
effectiveness may be due to a combination of its relaxing effect in addition to
providing a form of social interaction.  
 
 
 
Those suffering from infirmities may experience relief from
conditions including arthritis, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The
following list includes a number of other benefits that massage offers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Muscle relaxation 
 
Regular massage helps keep muscles limber and reduces the
number of phantom aches and pains that come with growing older. Gentle massage
helps stretch the muscles and over time can increase flexibility. 
 
 
 
 Improved circulation 
 
Massage facilitates blood circulation by forcing blood
through congested areas. The gentle squeezing and pulling also moves toxins out
of muscles and increases the flow of lymph fluids, which contribute to a
healthy immune system. 
 
 
 
 Less anxiety 
 
Those suffering from anxiety and depression benefit from
massage. Massage reduces tension and also provides the therapeutic effects of
human touch to those deprived of regular human contact. Massage is also
reported to increase feelings of overall well-being. 
 
 
 
 Improved balance and
posture 
 
Massage stimulates the body’s awareness and circulation
especially in the feet and hands where blood flow may be constricted. It helps
muscles improve their range of motion and flexibility, both of which contribute
to better co-ordination.  
 
 
 
Massage is more than a skin-deep treatment. It provides more
health benefits than just a relaxing rub down. The benefits are numerous enough
that a caregiver may want to consider them as another avenue to helping their
loved ones lead more fulfilling lives.

 Resources: Notes from Leelo's Team Meeting Here are my notes from Leelo's team meeting earlier today. We covered a lot of ground. Probably the materials most helpful for other parents/caregivers are the sections on compulsive vs. anxiety-based behaviors, and how to manage/prevent crisis situations by modifying school  behavior plan s for home use. We also discussed implementing  a more thorough  visual support system  for Leelo at home, since he is so skilled with and so centered by using an extensive visual schedule at school. Leelo Rosenberg Team Meeting Notes 5/1/08 IDENTIFYING EMOTIONS Supervisor E: When researchers did MRIs of people on the spectrum while they asked them to identify emotions, the subjects’ brains didn’t fire up the way typical people do, so it’s really important to use real world emotional models as well as pictures.  Otherwise it’s just rote memorization and not generalization. Squid will make more emotional model photos, esp. of her and Seymour HAND WASHING Improved hand washing. Currently he gets the soap, but then washes it off before he has a chance to lather. Supervisor M suggests hand-over-hand Supervisor E suggests turning off the water after wetting hands, or using hand sanitizers and wipes. TEACH TOWN/COMPUTER USAGE The current goal of this program is to teach Leelo mouse skills. The games are fun and reinforcing for items that he already knows, like vocabulary and numbers, to introduce new vocabulary, cover gaps, reinforce concepts like “same & different”. It’s okay for Seymour & Squid to use it however we see fit; data collection has not been active since Therapist L left, so other people using the program will not affect any calculations. Currently most activities result in an on-screen reinforcer, but Therapist R and Therapist L frequently have/had to use tangible reinforcers to get Leelo to tolerate the interval before the reinforcer. Supervisor E suggests modifying the intervals before he gets to the on-screen reinforcer. Squid & Seymour & Therapist A have not been able to get past the preview mode, so will set aside time to work on figuring it out. Leelo is currently able to independently navigate Starfall.com and many PBS kids.com programs because he is good at clicking and dragging. Although he will perseverate on many small intervals (one screen over and over) and sometimes needs prompting to get out of these cycles. Supervisor M suggests getting Leelo more varied software to play with, e.g., Reader Rabbit. BEHAVIOR The last couple of weeks have been challenging. Lots of aggression and hitting, occasionally escalating to full-scale freak outs with scratching, hair pulling. He is also targeting his sisters a lot, though he resorts to hitting or pushing them and usually does so for the reaction he gets from them or adults around him (Squid tries to comfort his victims without giving him any eye contact or input whatsoever) He is generally less able to tolerate the usual demands we place on him. Therapist A question: is there a correlation between dropping demands and giving him a less stressful environment; does this contribute to his rigidity? Supervisor M and Supervisor E says only if it happens when you’re in a situation where you’ve asked him to do something and you drop your demand because of his behavior. That is very reinforcing, negatively. Different than dropping your demands across the board when he’s grumpy. Roots of aggression: Many, many changes in environment: Therapist L is gone and he’s realized that she’s not coming back, pool access is unpredictable, trampoline is off-limits (Seymour has taken it apart to replace worn parts), his school days are longer, allergies flaring, he has been having absence seizures and possible migraines. Squid talked with his pediatrician Dr. M this morning. She would like us to try dissolvable Tylenol tablets for his headaches, and move from Claritin to  Zyrtec  for his allergies (Supervisor E mentions that Zyrtec can cause sleepiness, and that we should dose him at night). Note: there is anecdotal evidence that Zyrtec can make some kids hyperactive. Squid’s litmus for a good school day: When he gets off the bus, is he wearing the same clothes he wore to school this morning? At least he has stopped having the several-times-per-day toilet accidents he was having a few weeks ago, though he did have one at school today. BEHAVIOR PLAN Existing plan was written for school. Supervisor M brought a copy with highlighted areas appropriate for home guidelines. She wants to work with Therapist E to rewrite it for home. Highlights: Know high risk times. Reinforce good behavior using praise, tokens, & tangibles (e.g.: currently he’s having problems with transitions between tasks at school). Supervisor E: “Gentle Reminder” is a pager-like object that can be sent for a predetermined interval (every minute or so) to remind grownups to give constant verbal reinforcement. Careful about the attention and not use it when he’s using problem behavior. Use of straws: they try to manage straws in the classroom, harder to do during recess. It’s okay if he’s engaging in other things when using a straw. If he has a problem behavior while using a straw: count to five, and then take the straw. He can earn it back by completing a simple task. (Rule at school: he only gets new straws 3x/day [during a 9 – 3 day]; he gets a straw when getting off bus, in the middle of the day after his independent work time, and at end of day.) Use of visual aids: Need to start using them at home. They override a lot of problem behaviors because he can’t argue with the icons. He is compulsive about obedience to icons and checking his schedule because they shift control from people to the schedule. He’ll even rearrange the schedule to his liking when he can get away with, which Supervisor M thinks is a good demonstration of thinking and engaging. A good start would be “walk together” (icon + phrase) which helps address the bolting. Visual Support icons we need for home. We need at least eight copies of each for home. Examples: Wait walk together stay in car seat play with toys CONSTANT ESCAPING FROM SEATBELT-ONLY BOOSTER SEAT Leelo is starting to refuse to stay in his car seat if he drops a straw, if he wants to take off his shoes, etc.. Yesterday he dove over the seat back and into the trunk because he knew there were cookies in one of the grocery bags located back there. While Squid was driving down the street. Beg five-point harness car seat back from Jennyalice if possible. Start using icon for “stay in car seat” and give lots of praise (use Gentle Reminder) about what a good job he’s doing sitting in his car seat. Might be that he will dislike returning to the five-point intensely enough to comply with booster/seatbelt again. Squid says she will probably have to take out the non-Mali seat in the middle row of the car to use the five-point, as it is very difficult to strap Leelo into it in the back row of the minivan with that seat in the way, but if he sits next to Mali he may hit her. CRISIS MANAGEMENT What do we do to prevent Leelo from getting into a crisis? When we see him escalate, first thing: straw out of mouth. Immediately give him his name card, then immediately give him an icon card for what he needs to do next. When people are in an aggression crisis, we should not be approaching them and asking them what’s wrong. We should make sure that person and everyone else is safe, and let them de-escalate on their own. Sometimes they can learn to de-escalate on their own if they have a safe, designated space to do so. GENERALIZATION of MASTERED SKILLS Supervisor M has spreadsheet of mastered skills for us to practice. Supervisor E suggests using visual prompt for “How old are you?” question. RIGIDITY OR COMPULSION Important to differentiate between anxiety (“wet” shirt) and compulsion (repetitive behaviors). How to deal with rigidity and compulsive behaviors. Compulsive behaviors (stretching out car seat strap five or six times, touching everything in certain sequences, etc.). Supervisor M says this may be neurological path that gets stronger every time the action is performed; this is something that isn’t usually an issue unless Leelo is uncomfortable in his skin like he is right now. Supervisor E says that this is something where you just block the behavior. With anxiety issues (“wet” shirt) we need to get him through it however we can (reinforcers and distractions). We need to increase his exposure.  We can block and delay. We can use the Wait card. We can also re-create the situation while he is doing something highly reinforcing like watching a video. Therapist R says it’s sometimes helpful to talk about it; this helps him relax. “Your shirt is wet. What should we do?” L: “Change your shirt,” introduce distractions; maybe eventually you’ll still have to change the shirt, but maybe not. Also again with the positive reinforcement: “You are doing a really good job keeping that wet shirt on.” FOOD Leelo has gained a lot of weight in the past few months, over ten pounds since the fall. Historically he has bulked up over the winter and slimmed down over the summer, but in his family’s opinion he is far too chubby right now (over 75 lbs). Squid thinks Leelo eats compulsively because it’s something he’s mastered and it’s self-reinforcing. At the moment he doesn’t get a lot of food reinforcers; they have been completely eliminated from his home sessions, and he only gets food as a reinforcer for successful BM toileting or to distract him during times of anxiety/rigidity. Squid thinks that if we were able to distract him more with things he was able to do independently, he might not need to eat so much. She also expressed concern over the amount of snacks made available at school; Supervisor M confirmed that Leelo was being given two bowls of goldfish crackers during snack time. Squid sent in some Veggie Booty today instead. HELPING LEELO WITH TASKS HE CAN DO INDEPENDENTLY At home it would be great to have bins in various places for mastered tasks. Supervisor M distributed lists of mastered and ongoing tasks, as well as checklists for IEP goals. Leelo has started to be reluctant to take his usual neighborhood walks with his therapists. Squid mentioned that Leelo can walk over two miles on trails, where there is a defined path to follow. She will accompany the therapists on their walks for now and show them how to get to the nearby nature preserve where there is a trail, so that Leelo can hike there.

Real Autism Advice  from Alan Harchik - Generalization
" "
 Alan  Harchik , Ph.D.,  Chief Operating Officer of the May Institute, offers sound advice on how to accomplish one of the most frustrating goals in educating your autistic child -  encourage generalization of skills once they are acquired by an autistic child.    Harchik  presents five practices found to be effective by researchers and  practitioners :  Modify rewards : Once the child has mastered the skill, we can try to modify the rewards to make them similar to those that may be found in other settings.     For example, after a child learns to participate in a simple conversation, we might begin using rewards after every five or six responses instead of after every response. Similarly, certain toys or food items used as rewards to initially establish the skill might not be available at home or in the community, but other rewards could be identified. We can bring these items into the teaching sessions.     Finally, structured opportunities to practice the skills with typical peers can be helpful in promoting generalization.     Use lots of examples : Most skills we teach should require the child to learn to respond to many variations of those skills.     For example, if we are teaching imitation, we will teach the child to imitate 20 or 30 different movements. If we are teaching a child to identify something, such as clothing, animals or colors, we will work with the child until he or she can correctly identify many examples.     For some children, generalization occurs after as few as four or five examples. For other children, it may take dozens of examples.     Present common features:  The materials used while teaching should incorporate all of the relevant features and characteristics of the materials to be found in other situations.     For example, if we are teaching a child to put on a shirt, we should ensure that we use shirts that have long and short sleeves, are pull-over and button-down, have different types of material, etc. If teaching how to prepare a microwave meal, we should use microwave ovens of different sizes and with different dials and buttons, as well as meals that involve a variety of times, sizes and foods.     Teach loosely : Although teaching sessions often begin with very structured and set procedures to help the child acquire the skill, over time the sessions should be conducted more \"loosely.\" This means that specific instructions may vary in wording, the exact style of prompting may not be as rigid and the pace of the session may fluctuate.     Further, the child should work with a number of different instructors throughout the day and week. This prepares the student to be less \"locked in\" to specific wording and interactions from the instructor.     Use intermediaries : Some skills for some children can be transferred by a \"carrier\" or \"intermediary.\" For example, if a child has learned to follow a picture schedule, that same (or similar) picture schedule can be used in the generalization setting.  We teach children with good memorization skills to memorize and verbally state a sequence of steps at school, such as for washing hands (turn on water, wet hands, press soap dispenser, rub hands together, etc.), and then have them repeat the steps out loud at home while engaging in the skill or task. http://www.masslive.com/news/republican/

Communication and integration
" "
One of the great ironies in my life is that I teach a college course in Interpersonal Communication. To the students enrolled in the class and the college that employs me, I am (on some level) considered an expert on the subject. And yet, my son - the student who gets the greatest number of hours under my tutelage - finds that this is the very subject that evades him most. There is some sort of cosmic somersault at work here, I think. I have found, though, that my life with Bud has greatly informed my teaching, and that the material I teach has provided a valuable lens through which to view Bud's strengths and challenges. I recently added a new perspective to the mix when I attended a seminar by Barry Prizant on the  SCERTS  model, which is \"a comprehensive, multidisciplinary framework designed to enhance the communication and socio-emotional abilities of young children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.\" Since the summer, we have been integrating  RDI  into our activities with Bud at home, and I really believe in the program. The downside of RDI, however, is that it is complicated. I've given the team who works with Bud some basics of the philosophy - slow down, use fewer words, wait 45 seconds for a response, use declarative language - and they've been great about implementing them, but the bulk of the work we do with RDI will continue to be at home with the guidance of an outside consultant. SCERTS, on the other hand, is designed to be a curriculum-based assessment for use by professionals who work with children in the classroom setting. It is in line philosophically with RDI, but is packaged in a more user-friendly way with clear assessment tools that yield specific goals and objectives appropriate for each individual child. It is a program that I think Bud's team will find helpful, and even inspiring. The SCERTS program addresses three domains for assessment and intervention: Social Communication, Emotional Regulation, and Transactional Support. Social Communication and Emotional Regulation are, of course, two main areas of challenge for children on the spectrum. In the area of Social Communication, SCERTS sets as the overriding goal \"to help a child become an increasingly competent, confident, and active participant in social activities and events,\" by enhancing the child's capacity for joint attention and reciprocity, expression of emotion, and understanding of others' emotions. It seeks to help children become more conventional communicators and to enhance their abilities for pretend play and symbolic behavior. It seeks to help them become full partners in the intricate dance of communication. Through a focus on Emotional Regulation, SCERTS helps children achieve and maintain an optimal level of emotional arousal to maximize their \"availability\" for learning and engagement. The focus in ER is trifold: self-regulation (using strategies to regulate independently), mutual regulation (achieving regulation through social transaction), and recovery from dysregulation (being able to employ these strategies in times of extreme dysregulation, when the child is no longer available for the learning process.) Transactional Support is an area not addressed in RDI, but is extremely important in the educational setting. TS focuses on the collaborative efforts of everyone (teachers, parents, caregivers, siblings, peers) who work with a child so that the same goals and strategies are infused across a child's daily activities. Fundamentally, SCERTS is about integration: integrating work across disciplines, so that SLPs, OTs, PTs, classroom teachers, special educators, school psychologists and parents are all working from the same guide book; integrating approaches and philosophies that reach core deficits, instead of focusing on treating symptoms; integrating strategies for communication development with strategies for emotional and sensory regulation. And so I start the process of integrating SCERTS into our own little grassroots approach to ASD. It's not too difficult, really. SCERTS, RDI, my class in Interpersonal Communication: they all have the same goals, when you break them down. To use an analogy from RDI's Steve Gutstein, we are all trying to help our students become \"broadband communicators\", to trade in their 2800 baud modems for high speed cable, to download and interpret volumes of information in an instant and respond appropriately. SCERTS encourages students to simultaneously share attention, share affect, share intention, and share symbolic systems. RDI promotes dynamic intelligence through the development of emotional referencing, social coordination, declarative language, flexible thinking, relational information processing, hindsight, and foresight. And my class in Interpersonal Communication teaches students to view themselves and others as sender-receivers, to be intentional with and attuned to verbal, nonverbal, and paraverbal messages, and to remain aware of their filters of perception and attribution. Different words; strikingly similar goals. So I take it back, what I said about teaching Interpersonal Communication and having a child with ASD. I was wrong. It's not a cosmic somersault; it's a cosmic cartwheel. It's not one of the great ironies in my life; it's one of the very good fortunes.

 Surprise!  OT is ending!  Not for everyone, of course, or even for everyone in my household.  I recently had Willy’s IEP and we discussed how he no longer needed OT services.  Yay? 
 Well, yeah!  For the last year, Willy’s OT services have only been on a consult basis.  The idea was to create strategies that Willy could implement independently within his various classrooms to manage his sensory needs, while staying in class as much as possible to meet those needs.  This approach has been so successful that the consults are no longer needed.  They were kept in place primarily to transition him to his high school experience. 
 Now that Willy’s been in high school for a couple of months, Willy has made his adjustments.  He’s not wholly comfortable in his new environment, as indicated by his rather compulsive need to sharpen pencils to exert a sense of control over that environment, but he is making effective use of his strategies and he is also fully integrated into his classes.  He’s able to advocate for his own needs and generally does so effectively. 
 There’s still progress to be made, but it’s no longer about OT and sensory regulation.  The occupational therapist will be available if things change, but for now she’s not needed.  That is big, big progress for my young man!  So, yay it is!

One of our life skills coaches is interested in links you may have to social-skills programs that we might be able to adapt for youth aged 15 to 21 with a variety of physical and developmental disabilities. 
 
Has your teen participated in a social-skills program that worked well? 
 
Please post any recommendations or links in the comments. Thanks! Louise

By Louise Kinross 
 
Youth with disabilities tend to have fewer friends and smaller social networks than their peers. And studies find that typical youth are more open to having a friend who has a physical disability than one with an intellectual disability. 
 
Most of the research about friendship for people with intellectual disabilities is based on the perspectives of caregivers and support workers. 
 
That’s why a three-year University of Toronto study called  Voices of Youth  is so innovative. 
 
The project asks youth with intellectual disabilities aged 13 to 24 what friendship and community means to them. 
 
“Friendship is very important for a happy life,” says David Conforti, a 25-year-old with an intellectual disability who’s a project consultant on the study. “I find it difficult to find new friends my age. We all need to feel connected to other people, that way we feel more safe and comfortable in our communities and lives.” 
 
The Voices of Youth research involves three in-person interviews, including one in the community and one where participants are asked to invite a friend who will join them in an activity. A videographer is part of the research team.  
 
“We’re videotaping to get less of an interview and more of an experience format,” says Shauna Eisen, an occupational therapist coordinating the study. “We want to make sure we catch a lot of different subtleties that we might miss in written answers. We also want to make the research accessible for people who might have difficulty communicating verbally.” 
 
The research aims to get a youth perspective on “what friendship looks like and what some of the challenges may be,” Shauna says. “We also want to explore the definition of community, which is seen as vital for a balanced quality of life. Community engagement might be seen by some as physically engaging with neighbours or being part of different groups, or it might be an online presence.” 
 
Researchers are working with three project consultants who have intellectual disabilities and three community organizations that work with people with intellectual disabilities (see photo of the team above). 
 
One of these is  Hand Over Hand , a non-profit in York Region that pairs volunteers without disabilities with youth with disabilities for monthly social events and activities. “I’ve seen the difference this peer-driven social experience makes from the individual’s perspective and from feedback from families,” says Shauna, who is a volunteer. “I’ve seen how much personality, how many skills and abilities are brought to light with this type of opportunity.” 
 
Voices of Youth is wrapping up its second year and will eventually produce a video that incorporates what participants had to say about friendship and their experiences. 
 
The research, a partnership with McMaster University, is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada. 
 
Participants are still being recruited. To get involved, e-mail Shauna at  voices.ofyouth@utoronto.ca .

(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. 
Marginal note:Affirmative action programs 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. (84) It is, therefore, everyone’s duty to accommodate – equal rights means the right to be included. While Section 15 and other instruments exist and rights are stated, they are still not enacted. There are a lot of conditions for the participation in many programs, many of them made for the autistic population, and of course in our community-at-large. A recent court case cited this issue ( Moore vs. British Columbia ) whereby it was noted that remediation  before  the right to inclusion is  not  inclusion; this is in effect, discrimination. In fact, the term is  adverse effect discrimination whereby the concept of remediation is a barrier to participation and inclusion. We can point to many autism services that segregate, punish, or attempt to normalize the autistic citizen as such.    In Moore, this statement was made although not highlighted enough.  The disability community must be involved in shaping the meaning of accommodation, and they are missing from the discourse in cases like  Moore v. British Columbia, 2012.  In short, remediation is not accommodation; the former can be viewed as a disciplinary term and the latter must be created in accompaniment with disabled people to enable disabled people.  The case of  Moore  can be scrutinized in more depth regarding the ontological constructions in policy and law that continue to exclude people with disabilities in the school system and in other programs. Problematic is our notion of independence as a criteria for participation and enabled (or supported) participation in the community. As a result, many autism programs, and of course universities and schools,  maintain  this barrier to participation. It happens when human assistants (appointed and/or approved by the autistic person) are not allowed to accompany autistic citizens; when children are segregated into autism classrooms; and when many folks who have significant challenges are not provided access under the assumption that they are not able  because  they are in need of support. Such assistance is akin to the deaf requiring an interpreter, however, our notions and associations around independence remain the foundation under which exclusion still occurs; such notions require our demolition. These  conditions  to participation are neither accommodation nor equality. This is also supported by Rioux and Frazee: “Equality under s. 15 entails much more than simply ‘accommodating’ persons with disabilities into existing societal norms and structures leaving unscrutinized those norms and structures themselves. Substantive equality challenges the very existence of mainstream structural and institutional barriers, including the socially constructed notions of disability which inform them. For persons with disabilities, equality means the right to participate in an inclusive society. It does not mean the right to participate in mainstream society through the adoption of non-disabled norms.”  (Rioux and Frazee, 1999). If you attended the talks and film screenings in Toronto with the film’s subjects Larry and Tracy ( Wretches & Jabberers ) – autistic people who type to communicate and require assistance – it becomes clear(er) that most autistic individuals who are given access to assistance and communication devices with support can participate. It also becomes clear the levels of injustice that take place everyday for citizens who struggle with speech and physical differences. However, most of our therapies are built to make the individual as independent or non-autistic as possible. We require a standard (and law) by which service and assistance supports the rights of the autistic agent to be included. We know that many people will never “measure up” (as we like to think that they can be normalized through isolating intensive interventions) to become fully independent, but can enjoy life and participate given opportunity and access. By segregating autistic people and putting these conditions on their participation, we as a Canadian society are devaluing the autistic citizen.  We will be discussing ways and means to address this barrier, and call into question organizations (many of them autism organizations themselves who claim to provide services that are funded by the public purse) who provide a  qualified  inclusion – to those people whose bodies appear and behave as “normal” as possible. There will be thousands of autistic Canadians who will, as such, never achieve the quality of life that the Charter states, is their entitlement.

 By Louise Kinross  Life skills staff at Holland Bloorview presented their early findings from a review of 56 studies on friendship for youth with disabilities at a hospital Crosstalk last week. The event brought together staff, youth and a parent speaker. Sarah Keenan, life skills coach, noted that research has shown that friendship is associated with life satisfaction and good mental health in the general population, while loneliness has negative impacts on our immune system and heart health. Yet children with disabilities tend to have fewer friends and smaller social networks than their peers. Sarah referenced an American study of 11,000 teens that found that “over 50 per cent of students with autism had no contact with friends outside school and were never invited to spend time with friends.” Studies find that typical youth are more open to having a friend who has a physical disability than one with an intellectual disability, she said. However, interactions with youth with disabilities in general are often superficial on the part of typical youth. There is no one definition of friendship and clinicians and researchers want to know more about how youth with disabilities define a good friend, Sarah said.Research shows that friendships of youth with disabilities have some unique characteristics. For example, while most teens move away from their family in pursuing a growing social life, youth with disabilities continue to need parent support to keep friendships going. Friendships of people with disabilities, particularly those with autism, tend to be less intimate than their peers. And youth with disabilities have less social contexts in which to develop friends because issues with transportation, accessibility and safety make it harder for them to get together outside school.  Most studies about friendships for youth with disabilities focus on the school environment and few look at connections in the community, Sarah said.Holland Bloorview recently ran a 14-week friendship development program called  PEERS .  The program, originally designed for youth with autism, was adapted for teens with physical disability and called Teen Talk. Teens and parents participate in separate 90-minute weekly sessions. A key lesson learned “is that it’s not enough to focus on teaching skills, we need to give youth opportunities to practise and generalize these skills in school and in the community,” Sarah said. In addition, “parents are important partners in helping their children develop skills and make and maintain friends.” A parent said the program broke down complex skills for her daughter and gave her the chance to practise them. She noted that friendships for youth today are less face to face and more online. Parents in the program found school inclusion to be too challenging for many youth, the parent speaker said, and that their children had had greater success making friends in separate programs for kids with similar abilities. “It takes time to get to know our kids and how many typical individuals take the time to get to know the person underneath?” she asked. The parent said that it’s during the teen and young adult years that youth most need support in creating social networks. “Don’t cut off services at age 18,” she said. “And don’t leave it up to parents,” who already have their hands full addressing a multitude of needs in their child. “A great way that I made friends was by getting involved in clubs and places in the community and volunteering,” said Farrah Sattaur, a young adult who spoke.  “I think parents should make it a point to connect with their child's teacher because parents know their child best. They should also focus on their child’s abilities, rather than disabilities, and try to figure out their child’s interests. Sometimes it’s hard to figure out a child’s interests. Look for clues, like if your child is always happy around your dog and looking for the dog.  “Teachers should connect with parents, EAs and special-ed teachers to make their programs and activities more accessible. For children and youth who find it a challenge to make friends, just be yourself and believe you can do it.”

The Impact of One Autistic Child

Walgreen VP Randy Lewis has an autistic son named Austin.   Austin changed Randy and Randy changed Walgreens and Walgreens changed the lives of more of the disabled and is now changing the way companies think about our children. Contrast this with my last post.  The solution to disability is not terminating the lives of the disabled. ... and also Walgreens Rocks!

A Poem by Scott Lentine
" "
 Here is my most recent poem from an event I attended  in Boston called All Aboard The Arc!, a charity event to help peoples with intellectual disabilities.  Scott 
 
 All Aboard The Arc! Anthem 
 
 Breaking down barriers 
 
 Opening up doors 
 
 Letting every individual’s opportunities soar 
 
 This is what All Aboard The Arc stands for 
 
 Changing norms that is the goal 
 
 Making sure society does not leave us out in the cold 
 
 Struggling every day to gain equal rights 
 
 
 Obtaining this vision through passion and might 
 
 
 I’m taking this journey with you 
 
 I want to be a member of your crew 
 
 I am pleased that my ideas have gained a new world view 
 
 Together we can see our dreams come true 
 
 We are here at All Aboard The Arc! on the 18th of May 
 
 Your participation helped make this a bright day 
 
 You can see individuals demonstrate their true abilities 
 
 All in part for a great charity

Author Donna Thomson ( The Four Walls of My Freedom ) directed me to a book called  Cognitive Disability and its Challenge to Moral Philosophy . It's a collection of essays that address philosophical questions raised by people with cognitive disabilities, which the authors define as those with intellectual disability, autism and Alzheimer's disease. 
 
I haven't read the book yet, but the introduction notes that people with intellectual disability fall short of many of the traditional philosophical criteria for personhood, notably, the ability to reason. 
 
I googled a couple of the authors and came upon  this fascinating podcast  of a talk by Sophia Isako Wong, an associate professor of philosophy at Long Island University in Brooklyn, New York. Wong's presentation is titled  Duties of Justice to Citizens with Cognitive Disabilities  and asks: \"Do we have different or lesser duties of justice to citizens simply because they are labelled with cognitive disabilities?\"  
 
She looks at  Harvard philosopher John Rawl's theory of justice  which includes the fully-cooperating assumption: \"I have assumed...that while citizens do not have equal capacities, they do have, at least to the essential minimum, the moral, intellectual and physical capabilities that enable them to be fully cooperating members of society over a complete life.\" 
 
Some interpret this passage to mean that people with cognitive disabilities don't count as fully cooperating members of society. 
 
I encourage you to watch Sophia's podcast (I haven't watched the entire presentation). I have taken the book of essays out of Holland Bloorview's library and the content looks fascinating. One of the editors -- Eva Feder Kittay -- is a philosophy professor at Stony Brook University and has an adult daughter with intellectual disability. I think Eva would be a wonderful contributor to BLOOM and hope to seek her out.

This quote from  No Ordinary Boy  author Jennifer Johannesen (above with son Owen) sums up what I got last night from her BLOOM talk at Holland Bloorview. 
 
“Your own experience of your child can improve and blossom and grow in a way that is not attached to  achieving  anything.” 
 
Jennifer spoke about a shift in how she looked at Owen's disabilities: from that of high-achieving new mom who undertook her complex son's care like a 'project,' to one who realized after he died that she had stopped seeing his deafness as a disability. When she was asked to speak recently at an agency that serves children who are deaf, she at first didn't make the connection. 
 
Jennifer -- you inspire me! Louise

 By Louise Kinross A community garden and farmer’s market, arts programs, yoga and a café are part of a Toronto housing community Skye Gross (above left) envisions will bring adults with disabilities and artists together to live and work.  “This is a radical departure from anything we’ve seen before,” says Skye, whose daughter Rachael, 18, has complex medical and developmental needs. “The current housing, recreation and job opportunities for people like my daughter are minimal, expensive, isolating and stigmatizing. I don’t want that for her, so I decided to build something better.” Skye joined with Jan MacKie (right) and Karin Farkashidy (centre) to create the non-profit  Triluma Living Collaborative , which aims to develop this new model of housing. The three women have a long history as leaders in Holland Bloorview’s Spiral Garden and Centre for the Arts. “We’re looking to create a holistic community that will be completely inclusive, not just of people with developmental challenges, but of artists, wellness practitioners, families and community organizers,” Skye says. The project will incorporate housing as well as commercial ventures that draw the public in.  Triluma is a response to the current housing crisis for adults with developmental disabilities in Ontario.  Earlier this year,  a report  from the Select Committee on Developmental Services said there were 12,000 Ontario adults on a list for group homes with a wait of 20 years. The report also noted that 2,300 families of adults are waiting for respite in a province with only 225 available respite beds. Since then, the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services has partnered with MaRS—the medical research and social innovation hub in Toronto—to develop and test new housing models. In April, MaRS issued a  Challenge Brief  with this question: “What would homes and communities need to look like for citizens with developmental disabilities to achieve citizenship: to live in the communities they choose, to grow and lead full lives?” Skye hopes Triluma will be chosen as a MaRS incubator project to receive pilot money. “No matter how lovely I make our beautiful, accessible home, eventually I’m not going to be here anymore and I don’t want my daughter being thrust into a strange environment with people she doesn’t know,” Skye says. “People want affordability, an end to isolation, and this notion of meaningful livelihood—as opposed to killing time watching TV. Our model addresses those elements.”  Skye hopes that a Triluma community will be operational in five years. “To start with we’ll need government support, but we won’t rely on ongoing government funding. Our financial model will allow residents to pay a reasonable rent in exchange for contributing their time to building and sustaining the community.”  That could mean growing food in the garden and selling it at a weekly market, or working in the café or in an arts program. To launch their inclusive community building model, Triluma is offering  Welcoming Back the Light  workshops on Sunday Dec. 7 and 14 from 2-4:30 p.m. at Evergreen Brick Works.

 In the opening of the trailer for  Becoming Bulletproof , one of the actors says: “You never really see anybody with a disability on TV.” Becoming Bulletproof  documents the remaking of a 1920 Western film called Bulletproof, with a twist: its actors include people with Down syndrome and cerebral palsy as well as those without disabilities. One of the filmmakers describes it as “an experiment in extreme diversity.” The actors meet every year at  Zeno Mountain Farm  in Vermont to write, produce and star in short films. The farm was founded by two brothers and their wives with the goal of building friendships through projects in film, art, theatre, sports and music. No one is paid to work with the group and no one pays to come and participate. The group is funded by donations and all proceeds from  Becoming Bulletproof  go to Zeno Mountain Farm. The film, which has won a number of awards at festivals, had a screening Monday at the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled. 
 
 I hope to learn more about how and why Zeno Mountain Farm was created and perhaps interview one of the filmmakers. Stay tuned! Louise

 Emilie, 9 (centre), is  travelling the world  from her home of Lyon, France to meet children with disabilities, learn about their experiences and break social isolation. Emilie has cerebral palsy. 
 
 
 
 Most recently she and her mother Agn è s spent three weeks in Peru. During this time they lived with three families: one had a child with Down syndrome, one had a child with autism and one had a child with cerebral palsy. 
 
 
 
 \"We followed their everyday life, [rehabilitation] and school and shared ideas to improve quality of life,\" says Agn è s  Rairoux, Emilie's mother. \"It was a fascinating and positive experience.\" 
 
 
 
 The family has started an association called  Handiworld  where you can watch a video clip of Emilie explaining her world tour. 
 
 
 
 We hope they may make a visit to Holland Bloorview during a trip to Canada!

 By Louise Kinross 
 
 
 
 Emily Chan, 19, has come full circle. This summer she’s a researcher in the Ward Family Summer Student Program at Holland Bloorview. As a  University of Toronto  student who just finished her second year in mental health studies and health policy, Emily hopes to become a clinical psychologist working with children with disabilities. To her studies she brings a lifetime of firsthand experience. Emily, who has a rare neuromuscular condition, spent the first six years of her life living on the complex continuing care unit at Holland Bloorview. She’s attended our reverse-integration kindergarten, volunteered to bring a patient voice to research projects here, participated in life skills programs and is currently co-chair of our youth advisory.     “I’ve had many people come up recently and say ‘What are you doing here?’” Emily says. “When I say ‘I’m working as a researcher’ and show them my orange badge, especially those who knew me as an inpatient, they’re shocked.” BLOOM caught up with Emily since we last  interviewed her . BLOOM: What did it feel like to walk through the doors of Holland Bloorview as a research student after your life-long connection as a client? Emily Chan:  I’ve come here for so long and seen so many staff working here, and to be able to now be one of them, feels very surreal. I have so much respect for everyone that works here and now I’ve joined that community of workers. It’s an honour for sure. I love the work that we do here and it’s nice to be part of something you can relate to in a very personal way.   BLOOM: Why did you want to be a student here? Emily Chan:  First of all I have a sense of familiarity. I’m very familiar with the people here, the researchers as well because I’ve participated in research. I know a lot of the clients here. It came naturally to gravitate here. Somewhere else I would feel more out of place. Being able to contribute to the whole of what we do is unique because I used to be part of it and now I’m helping to contribute in a different way. BLOOM: What do you hope to learn? Emily Chan:   I hope to be able to apply knowledge I’ve learned at school to a real-life setting. I also want to learn how more about how the hospital conducts research and the internal workings of research: the ethics of it, how to write up a research proposal, how to conduct a study—skills that I’ll be able to carry with me through the rest of my academic career. I know the work we do here is so special and I’m interested to see the impact it has on children and families. BLOOM: I know a lot of the buildings on the downtown campus of U of T aren’t accessible. What’s it been like to be a student who uses a wheelchair? Emily Chan:  I’m on the Scarborough campus, which is great. It’s very small and nice in the sense that I have a real sense of community with my peers and I see people I know and cross paths with them often. The Scarborough campus is also only a 10-minute drive from my house so it frees up a lot of my time to do extracurricular clubs.  
 
 All of the buildings are modern and relatively new and there are lots of elevators and ramps already in place. Many of the buildings are interconnected so in the winter I don’t have to go outside in the freezing cold with snow on the ground and pray my wheelchair doesn’t break down. The structure of the campus is very accessible. The elevators do break down but there’s nothing I can do about that. BLOOM: When we last spoke you talked about how you’d been teased because of your disability in Grade 2. And that at high school, some teens taunted you. How are you treated as a person with a disability at U o T? Emily Chan:  It’s shocking to me but I feel very much like any other student there. I used to always be stared at and feel out of place and obviously different from my peers. But at university—I don’t know if people have matured or it’s just the nature of the community—but  I don’t get stared at very often. I don’t feel significantly different from my peers. They’re always willing to lend me a hand  if I need something to be moved out of the way or if my table needs to be adjusted. They’re very accommodating and understanding. I haven’t had a bad experience there which is very interesting. I’m quite surprised. BLOOM: What research project are you working on here? Emily Chan:  I’m working on a project with Sally Lindsay that looks at the benefits of volunteering for youth with and without disabilities. I’ve interviewed a bunch of participants and asked about their experiences: What they’ve gotten out of it, the benefits and challenges. It’s an interesting project because I myself have volunteered here for the last four years. When I’m doing my analysis it makes it easier for me to understand what people are saying because I’ve been through the experience. BLOOM: What volunteer work have you done here? Emily Chan:  I’ve been a youth mentor and sat on a couple of research projects to give the perspective of youth who’ve had clinical experience here. I’m now the co-chair of the youth advisory council. BLOOM: What part of the research on volunteering are you working on ? Emily Chan:   I’m in the middle of analyzing the interviews for major themes. I’m working towards a poster presentation at the end of the program. BLOOM: Has anything about the research surprised you ? Emily Chan:  I think one thing that youth with disabilities struggle with a lot is finding their place in the volunteering world. As a person with a disability you can think 'how am I supposed to be able to contribute to society when the idea that people have is that I’m the recipient of volunteer services?' We have to turn the tables around. Youth with disabilities have something to offer and we don’t always need help. It’s a newer concept for people to grasp.   BLOOM: Do you think youth feel hesitant to apply for volunteer work because of stereotypes about disability, or do you think when they do apply, they may face negative attitudes? Emily Chan:  I think it’s a bit of both. They might feel scared to reach out and say ‘Hey I’m a person with a disability but I’m very interested in volunteering. Would you have anything for me to do?’ They might be afraid people will say no.  It’s also an attitude thing that people perceive us as not being able to help but needing help. The word ‘help’ is a bothersome word that creates a hierarchy between the ‘helper’ and ‘helpee.’ The helper supposedly has something the helpee doesn’t have, that they’re lacking. That creates an unequal relationship between two people. BLOOM: What does your personal experience with disability and Holland Bloorview bring to your research work? Emily Chan:  I lived here for the first six years of my life so I’ve received a lot of care and help from different people on that end. After I was discharged and came home and was growing up I felt an obligation to give back, so I came back and volunteered. I’ve also participated in Youth at Work and other life skills programs. Youth at Work was major in helping me develop skills. They gave me that hands-on experience to go out in the community and be able to find and work a real job for two weeks. So I’ve had a lot of experience that I can apply to the research I’m doing now. BLOOM: What’s been the biggest challenge of being a research student? Emily Chan:  Getting people to not see me as a client and more as part of the staff. It’s a little bit of a role shift for me and them. I need them to treat me more or less as an equal and not so much as a client who requires services here.  And I have to make people see I’ve grown up and developed my own mind and I know what I’m doing and don’t need someone’s assistance—not that assistance is a bad thing. I need to break that image of me being a client as opposed to a researcher here. It seems that seeing a former inpatient who was discharged and came back into Holland Bloorview in a different role is not something they see often. BLOOM: Would you like to see anything change in clinical care or research about children or adults with disabilities? Emily Chan:  I think incorporating more of a client perspective here. Clients who have been discharged or are within the system have a lot to say about the workings of Holland Bloorview. Who else knows it better than people who have been through it themselves? About six months ago I approached the new CEO, Julia Hanigsberg, and said ‘I used to be a former client here and I have some things I want to discuss with you about it.’ She was willing and we had a nice conversation about my observations. I think it’s being able to embrace different lenses on how you approach an issue. We’re taking steps in the right direction but I think we could have more youth on different research projects to give their perspectives.  BLOOM: It would be wonderful to also adapt our research so that people who don’t speak conventionally can have a voice. Emily Chan:  Just yesterday I went to a talk where a researcher spoke about a project where she had people draw their interpretations of what it’s like to have a concussion. We rely so much on verbal communication that we can forget about other forms. Having a drawing can be so rich in and of itself. Sometimes words can’t capture the whole image of what you’re going through in terms of your feelings.  BLOOM: What advice would you give staff working with children with a variety of disabilities? Emily Chan:  Respect them. Respect is a very major one. We need to break down that barrier between helper and helpee and make it more of a collaborative effort. So instead of saying ‘How can I help you?’ ask more questions: ‘How can we work together to further advance your quality of life?’ We need to bring the client and family in as an integral part of care and knock down that barrier between clinician and client. Even though the clinician might be an expert in their field, the child is the expert in their own lived experiences. It’s important not to make assumptions. BLOOM: What about advice for parents? Emily Chan:  A lot of disabilities can come with the whole mental burden of not being able to do the same things as your peers. Not being able to walk like your peers or not being able to communicate on the same level. It can be very mentally frustrating. I have some friends who struggle with feeling that no one in this world understands what they’re going through, because they have such a unique set of lived experiences.  As children here grow older they can realize that they’re different from their peers and it can be a very isolating feeling. We need to start conversations by asking if someone is mentally okay, not just if they’re physically okay, and if there’s anything we can do to support mental health. We need to be very open and not treat issues like depression or anxiety as a taboo topic.

 Run Notes: 
 I am temporarily taking a break from tracking my mileage and pace. 
 May 25:  Turns out I wasn’t back. 
 April 28:  I think I’m back. Thank God, I think I’m back. 
 April 15:  I’ve been having a really hard time getting motivated lately. Today I couldn’t force myself outside, so I just put some random program on my treadmill and figured that as long as I was moving, it was better than sitting or napping. 
 April 13:  Gah. I need to start actually running again. 
 March 29:  This was the Alum Run 5K in DC. It is *crazy* how much faster I ran today than I have run all month. I have no idea what it was. It didn’t feel like much more exertion either. It was definitely flat, but it’s not like I’ve been out running hills all month. 
 March 14:  This was the Gate River Run 15K. My official time was 2:01:44 with a 13:05 min/mile. (Difference due to 9.47 vs. 9.3 miles.) I was really proud of myself and what I did in this race. I ran it really slowly, but, except for water stops, I ran the whole, whole thing. 
 March 10:  I am running a 15K race on Saturday. Clearly I’m prepared. Silver lining: That race will more than double my mileage thus far for March. So there’s that. 
 February 28:  I know how slow this run was. I have a 15K coming up in two weeks and I had to know if I am still capable of running more than five miles. Turns out I am, thank god, but it also turns out that all the sidewalks in the world are buried under ice, forcing runners to walk part of their runs. Also, I haven’t run very much recently, so I’m pretty slow. Dammit. 
 February 26:  My treadmill is dying. This is really bad for me. Please direct your thoughts toward efforts to get the snow to melt so I can run outside. 
 February 24:  In terms of running, February has not gone well. I gotta get my shit together. 
 February 1:  This was the Penguin Pace. I ran it about 3-1/2 minutes faster than I did last year. Yay, me. 
 January 30:  I hit my monthly goal today, but it looks like I’m not going to hit my stretch goal of 70 miles a month. Some people run more than this many miles in a WEEK. I can’t even fathom how they do that. I mean, I guess they’re probably substantially faster than I am, but still. 
 January 28:  Super slow run today because my path was icy. Also I fell at mile 3.5. And then I had to roll off  of the ice sheet so I wouldn’t break through to the icy puddle below if I sat up or tried to stand where I fell. All pretty standard, really. 
 January 25:  I paused my Garmin at a streetlight and forgot to turn it back on for a good chunk of time. Maybe a half mile? 
 January 18:  This run felt so great! I haven’t run more than 3ish miles for such a long time that it felt great to know that I actually could still run a longer distance. I did get bitten by a dog, but it only ripped my pants and didn’t actually get to the leg itself, so it could have gone worse. 
 January 15 & 17:  My Garmin was glitchy these days, so I don’t have exact info for these runs.

 Run Notes: 
 December 31:  Assuming I make it through my 5K tomorrow, my streak will have been successfully completed! Yay, me! 
 December 27:  I really didn’t want to run today. Really, really. I’m glad I sucked it up though. Only five more days until I finish my streak. 
 December 24:  I was so desperate to get off the treadmill that I took off in the rain to return a Netflix DVD directly to the post office, passing multiple mailboxes on the way there. Totally worth it. 
 December 18:  Oh man, I am craaaaawling toward my 600 miles this year goal. But at least I’m still moving forward. I’m hoping to do a long run this weekend. I really, really want to do a long run  outside. 
 December 17:  I really didn’t want to run today, so my solution was to bang out a mile on the treadmill really fast. Trust me when I say that this counts as really fast for me. 
 December 13:  Alex’s first 1.5 miles without walking. Go, Alex! 
 December 9:  Running a streak is weird. I have definitely run days that I wouldn’t have were I not streaking, but I’ve run mostly short distances instead of the even relatively short (but longer than these) 3.5 milers. Part of it is for sure because I’m on the treadmill and I hate the fucking treadmill. Or maybe it’s because I’m tired because I don’t have rest days. (But I can’t be that tired from running a mile, right?) I’m sticking to it, but I don’t think I’ll fall in love with it and extend it past new year’s. It’s an interesting thing. 
 December 7:  I ran while angry tonight. It kind of worked out for me. 
 December 5:  Guess who really didn’t want to run on the treadmill today? 
 December 3:  I am attempting a Thanksgiving to New Year’s Day running streak. Today was the first day that I wasn’t able to get anywhere near a running path or treadmill until 8:30pm. I’m happy to report that it didn’t even occur to me to flake, even though I still have a lot of stuff to do tonight. 
 November 27:  This was the Turkey Chase 10K. Turns out Bethesda, where this race was held, is really hilly, and not in the “why don’t you run down all the hills” way. 
 November 6:  I started thinking about my 10K this weekend and considering whether I actually  can  still run more than 2.3 mile intervals. I can. Yay! 
 November 4:  Oof. Heavy legs today. 
 November 2:  This was a run with Alex. There will be a lot of these shorter, slower runs as I run intervals with him. He’s so awesome for working on this. He was even sick today, which is why this outing was extra slow. (But still faster than my first 8K pace, if that tells you anything.) 
 October 31:  This run felt so good! Some days you really don’t want to get out on the road, but when you do, it feels great. This was one of those days. Also, I’m really enjoying not having any races longer than a 10K on my calendar, letting me not worry about running many long runs. 
 October 27:  Interval run with Alex. He’s doing great! 
 October 19:  I’m running with Alex so this is an interval run. Also my Garmin was out of battery power so I just put in a guesstimate of time. 
 October 10-11:  This was the Bourbon Chase. The data isn’t totally accurate as I didn’t start and stop my watch at exactly the right time for each run. In fact, on the first run, I forgot to turn it on until a half mile or so into the run. 
 October 5:  These were hill reps. This is a substantially better pace than the last time I did this specific workout on July 8 and July 23. I feel like a strong runner these days. 
 October 1:  I had to stop because my ankle hurt so much. Worrisome. 
 September 23:  I was not in the mood to run today. The ONLY reason I went out is because I have to run the Bourbon Chase in two weeks. The thing that is so great about running is that two miles in, I was having one of my best runs of the fall in terms of enjoyment. I felt easy and smooth and good and my music was perfect and I ran straight through a quiet little family of deer, two babies on one side of the path, two adults on the other, and they barely glanced at me. I would have felt and seen none of these things sitting at home. I’m really glad to be a runner. 
 September 1:  It was approximately 90 billion degrees during this run. I did a good amount of walking. 
 August 30:  This second run was the Electric Run 5K that I ran with Sam. 1.81 miles is where we went from running then run/walking to straight up walking. 
 August 29:  The difference between a good run (today) and a bad run (Wednesday) is ridiculous. I don’t even think it was about the distance. I just felt SO much better today. Today I really remembered why I run.  Later:  Oh. I just looked at the elevation graph. It was about elevation. It was TOTALLY about elevation. 
 August 27:  This was kind of a terrible run. It was hot out and I was having a hard go of it. This distance and pace isn’t super accurate either because it reflects some walking that I did during my run, but I also did a fair amount of walking that isn’t included in that time/distance that the Garmin measured. So this is like a vague reflection of my outing today. That said, the fact that I did 12:42 during a walk/run of 11.41 miles is hopefully a good sign that I can do my half marathon in under 12:26, which is the course cut off time. Also, my route today was hillier than my half marathon, which is also a hopeful sign. Because I am slow like a motherfucker on hills. 
 August 17:  I like that I am back running enough so that this morning when I woke up, I knew that I had to do a run today, but “only six miles.” That said, there was nothing “only” about this run. There was a bad combination of heat, not being hydrated enough, and oh god that sandwich I ate earlier that I started to regret almost immediately after leaving the house. This run turned into more of an amble, but at least I ran the damn thing, up to and including the hill by my house. 
 July 27:  This first run was a 5K race and a PR. It was great. Weirdly, my official time was 20 seconds longer than this. I’m not sure why. I’m pretty sure I started and stopped my Garmin right at the start and the finish—certainly not 20 seconds early or late. 
 July 23:  Another hill workout. This time was three full trips up and down the hill. It was hot. And steep. I thought I might die. 
 July 22:  I have this hill by my house that I usually have to run up to get home. Today I checked the length and elevation climb of said hill. It climbs 145 feet in .43 miles. Doing hill repeats there ought to get me in shape. 
 July 19:  This was the Rockville Twilighter 5K. I was worried about it because I’ve been having a hard time running lately, which is worrisome in general. But then I ran this 5-mile course in cool temps with little humidity and felt great and ran well. It was extremely encouraging. I also ran without headphones, which was fun. 
 July 9:  Slow treadmill run. Remind me never to take a month off from running again. Getting back is hard. 
 July 8:  My first dedicated hill workout. I did 2-3/4 runs down and up the big hill by my house. At 1pm. In 90-degree heat. There was some walking involved. Ugh. 
 June 14 & 17:  Both were walk/runs. 
 June 7:  This was Colleen’s BA5K. It was a PR, even if I only ran 3.08 miles. I swear I ran the whole course. I was more than a minute faster than my previous 5K PR. Although this is a very flat course. 
 May 11:  Interval training. ZR Workout #3 on track: 2.08 miles; ZR Default Workout on track: 2.18 miles. 
 May 9:  Interval training. ZR Workout #2 on track. 
 May 4:  Interval training. ZR Default Workout on track. 
 April 28:  I was super tired today. Lot of walk breaks. 
 April 27:  This was Pike’s Peek 10K. A PR. I am super proud of myself. 
 April 24:  Today was  this run . 
 April 9:  I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kinda learning to love the treadmill. 
 April 5:  Today was Ben’s Run 5k. I wanted to race under 36 minutes, but I just missed that. That said, I ran .14 miles more than a 5k, so I probably hit my 5k goal. Still, technically, I’m still not under that 36 minute mark. However, I ran 2 minutes and 10 seconds faster than I ran my last 5k, which was two months ago, so I’m going to count this as a win. 
 April 3:  This is approximate because of a user error in correctly pushing on/off buttons on my Garmin. In related news, I’m pretty tired today and finishing my workout on the elliptical where I can lean on something. 
 March 25:  Bad news: I have only run outside three times in March. Good news: I am learning how to kick ass at running on the treadmill. Bad news: I have only run hills three times in March. Good news: What used to feel fast (12 min/mi) on the treadmill is now my easy treadmill pace. 
 March 4:  My blisters hurt. 
 March 2:  This was the Reston 10-miler. Oh my, this was hard. I was sick in the days coming into this race and really worried about it. Honestly though, even if I hadn’t been sick, I think I would have done about the same pace. I was aiming for a 13 min/mi pace, so it looks like I did it! I’m super proud of myself. 
 February 23:  This was a great run. Except for when I faceplanted in the middle of it. 
 February 20:  This was my test run to see how I’d do on a long run not on the treadmill. Considering I’m aiming for a 10 min/mi pace, I think I did great, especially considering the pace I turned in included the times I had to slow to a walk to hike over piles of snow. This amount of time was not insubstantial. Hopefully this will not be an obstacle during my race. I also felt good and like I could run another couple miles at the end, so that is encouraging, especially since the last 1 1/2 miles of my race next week is primarily downhill. Yay, me! 
 February 19:  Woohoo! Fifty miles this month already! If I keep this up, I’ll make up for slacking off in January. My goal this year is at least 600 miles, so I’m on target! 
 February 16:  I was going to run longer today, but it is hazardous and deep in snow out there. I miss sidewalks. Also, I’ve changed my goals in terms of my 10-mile race in two weeks. The time cutoff is a 13:30 min/mi pace, so I am aiming for a 13 min/mi pace. For the next two weeks, I’m not trying to hit 12 min or 11 min. I am aiming for a solid 13 min/mi pace. I know it’s slow, but I figure I can train for the 10-mile distance or for a faster shorter distance. I might sign up for another 5k soon to work on speed. 
 February 8:  Shit, I run so slow now. I feel a little sad about it and am regretting not running for much of November and December. I’m currently panic training for a 10-miler I’m running on March 3 at which I have to average at least a 13:30 min/mi before they close the course. 
 February 2:  This was the Penguin Pace 5k. I placed 426th out of 519. 
 January 27:  You may notice that I haven’t run much lately. There are reasons. Have you been outside? It is fucking cold out there. Also, my knee tweak was bothering me and I was worried that running on it would cause permanent damage, blah, blah, blah, so I just used my elliptical, but the knee wasn’t getting any better so I finally went out and bought a knee sleeve and OMG, guess what? My knee felt better whilst running. You  should  know, however, that it is extremely difficult to run on unshoveled/icy sidewalks. 
 January 13:  Today was my first outdoor run of the year. I cannot tell you how good it felt. I definitely have to get off the treadmill and back on the road more often. It is sooo much better. It’s harder too though. And slower. Treadmills are flat. I also have to do some more core work to make my back stronger again. 
 January 12:  Ugh. Tired. 
 January 8:  It turns out that I am physically incapable of running farther than two miles at a time on a treadmill. I am also mentally incapable of forcing myself to run outside in the polar vortex. Therefore I decided to run faster on the treadmill for two miles.  It’s  something. 
 January 4:  A big part of the reason I didn’t run in November and December was because it didn’t feel good. I was tired and had a hard time motivating myself to get outside to run and once I was there, I was just too tired to run that far. Even after I ran, I didn’t feel all that good. After today’s run, I felt great and I remembered why I love to run. I hope to feel that coming back more and more. 
 January 2:  It turns out that if you don’t run for two months that you lose a lot of your stamina. Also, treadmills suck and I’m way slower on them. Still, new year, new opportunity. I’m back on track.

 Run Notes: 
 December 31:  This was a really slow run/walk on the treadmill, but I wanted to get one more run in before the new year. I’m proud of how I ran in 2013 and I hope to make 2014 even better. 
 November 28:  Mental note: start running with a hat; the air is cold and my ears  will  freeze solid. Also, this was my first non-treadmill run since I hurt my knee and my knee was totally fine. Yippee! 
 November 26:  I’ve been resting my knee. Today I went for a run and 1.16 miles is when I felt my knee start to twinge, so I slowed down to a walk from there. Hopefully next time I’ll get farther. 
 November 20:  Motherfucker. I did something to tweak my knee today. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. 
 November 11:  So slow. I was on the treadmill. I decided that some days it is okay to run super slow as long as I am running. After all, it is better to spend 40 minutes on the treadmill (I walked for a while after I stopped running) than 40 minutes on the couch. FYI, entries without pace notations probably happened on the treadmill. 
 November 10:  I headed out not realizing I was running directly into a strong headwind. It was kind of brutal. I was supposed to run almost five miles to Sam’s soccer game, but asked to be picked up instead because it was so horrible out there. 
 November 5 & 6:  These were less runs and more run/walks. I only added 5 miles and an hour to my totals because I didn’t run all of it. 
 November 3:  This was the first 10k I’ve run. (Run for the Parks 10k) It’s such a great starting point for me to improve upon. Yay, me. Also, I think it would have gone better had I actually trained for it. At all. 
 October 28:  I ran around a field at Sam’s soccer practice. My pace was actually probably substantially faster, but I had to stop and rein in Jack and Quinn every time I passed them because they were constantly harassing people walking dogs. They love dogs. 
 October 16-17:  These were run/walks. They weren’t great, but they got me back out there, which is what I’m aiming for in October. 
 September 21:  This was the Kensington 8k. I ran it 17 minutes faster this year than I ran it last year. I may have peaked. I doubt I will ever see this kind of improvement in one year again. :) 
 September 13 & 14:  These three runs are my Reach the Beach runs. My first and third runs seem to be my fastest pace ever. In fact, only 1-1/2 miles of those runs had pace averages of more than 12 minutes per mile. I even ran a couple of sub-11 minute miles. I feel incredibly awesome about this. 
 September 4:  I needed this one so bad. This is the distance and pace requirement of all three of my Reach the Beach relay legs. I’m so relieved that I am able to put this one up there now, just before the race. Now I just have to be able to do it two more times in 24 hours. 
 September 2:  You know what sucks to run in? 91-degree humidity. Ugh. 
 July 29:  Last time I ran in DC, it was 90-something degrees and humid. Running when it is neither of those things is not just an entirely different ballgame, but practically a different sport. 
 July 26:  This was the BlogHer 5K. Guess what, people? Chicago is flat. That is the only explanation I can come up with for the time on that run. Either that or a GPS malfunction, which is entirely possible. 
 July 16-22:  Running outside has been challenging because it’s so hot. Some of these runs included stretches where I walked. The 12 minute mile runs were on a treadmill. 
 July 15:  It turns out that July is really hot. My 10am run this morning needed a couple of minutes of walking mixed in with the run. 
 May 30:  Hip pain is back. :( 
 May 23 & 29:  I had two great races on two days in a row and then a run on which I couldn’t get past 3.71 miles. I think it’s because it’s getting so hot out, I’m having a tough time and I have to look at when and with how much water I run. For the next few weeks, because I’m having a tough running time right now, I’m going to focus on diet and overall fitness and just try to get in 1-3 miles a day with one longer run a week. I’m going to try to get my groove back. 
 May 18:  I would like you to look at that pace. I felt so awesome about that race. 
 May 5:  Shitty day, shitty run. 
 May 3:  Today someone was telling me about someone he used to run with who ran really slow—like 12 minute miles—when she was pregnant. I cried a little inside and then I went outside and ran two very fast (for me) miles. I will take inspiration everywhere I can get it. 
 April 29:  I managed to talk Alex into going running with me. I’m starting him on the couch to 5K program. It’s actually working out really nicely because he runs waaaaay faster than me, so while he’s working on increasing his endurance, I’m working on increasing my speed. Win-win! 
 April 27:  This was a weird run. I got lost and had to slow down and even stop a little bit to look at my phone for a map. I stopped my GPS a couple times when I did this. I actually went 5 miles in an hour and ten minutes or so with a 14:05 min/mi average. When I ran, I must have been going faster than I thought. 
 April 14:  It felt great to do a long run. It gave me a lot of time to be mad at hills. 
 April 13:  In addition to this run, I jogged a half mile or so with Sam and Quinn. It was extremely demoralizing when they jogged backwards in their Crocs and still ran faster than me. I hate kids. 
 April 12:  I didn’t have a chance to run while my kids were at school, so I made them hang out at a track while I ran around and around in circles. In related news, circles are boring. 
 April 11:  I ran in circles on grass at Sam’s soccer practice, while also watching my kiddos. Hence the super slow pace. But at least I was out there. Bonus: I didn’t twist an ankle on the field. 
 April 10:  90 godsdamn degrees. First run in a long time. But it felt soooo good.

To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,—   
 
One clover, and a bee,   
 
And revery.   
 
The revery alone will do   
 
If bees are few.

"31341" "46" "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/20/movers-and-fakers/" "Movers and Fakers" "It’s been a while since I’ve posted any insect photos.  But it’s autumn, which means that the Monarchs Are On The Move.  A couple of weeks ago I came home and was walking up to the front door when I passed the pair of butterfly bushes ( Buddleia davidii ) and noticed a rather runty-looking Monarch nectaring. Then I did a double-take, and thought to myself, “That’s not a Monarch — THAT’S A VICEROY!”  (This was one of those odd times when I mentally caption dialog, even the all-caps.)  I dashed back to my car to grab my camera, as I didn’t have a photograph of this particular butterfly yet. The Viceroy (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae  Basilarchia archippus ) looks very similar to the Monarch:  it’s an orange butterfly with a black body, black margins the wings, and a few white spots in the margins.  However, its wingspan is smaller (about 3 inches / 80 mm), and the hindwings have a thin stripe running parallel to the outer margin. For comparison, here’s a photo  of a nearby New England Aster ( Aster novi-angliae)  with a Monarch (Lepidoptera: Danaidae  Danaus plexippus ).  The wingspan of this butterfly is about 4 inches / 100 mm.  Of course the Monarch is famous for it’s transcontinental migrations.  The butterflies heading south to over-winter in Mexico are not those which came up this spring, but rather are their grandchildren or great-grandchildren.  In other words, these particular butterflies are migrating to a place where they have  never been.   Monarchs & Viceroys are also a famous example of “Batesian Mimicry”.  Monarch caterpillars eat milkweeds, and retain the icky poisons in the milky sap of the plants.  If a bird or some other animal eats a Monarch, it’s likely to soon throw up, and the bird learns that  those orange and black butterflies are nasty!   (Of course, that individual butterfly is now history, but its brethren gain some protection from the bird’s learning experience.) The Viceroy catepillars generally eat willow and poplar leaves, so the butterflies don’t have the poisons that would cause such a strong reaction.  But the butterflies look similar enough that the Viceroys gain this protection by mimicking Monarchs.  Interestingly, we now find that some Viceroy caterpillars do include milkweeds in their diet, which only reinforces the predators’ response to the mimicry. The New England Aster is a meter-high late-blooming perennial.  As a garden specimen, it’s less-than-stellar for its gangly, leggy growth, somewhat floppy habit, and propensity to seed volunteers.  As a wildlife habitat resources, it’s fabulous for providing late-season nectar, and mine are always draped in numbers of Monarchs when they make a refuelling stop.

			    Cutting the sundried head off one of the mammoth sunflowers growing by the deck and tossing it into the chicken enclosure. They fan out around it and systematically peck in turn until they've devoured every last seed, even the hull.    We'll have to plant more next year. Heh.

Happy Squirrel Appreciation Day!
" "
Because we should always appreciate our small, furry friends.  *There are 365 species of squirrel. Maybe we should start a \"Squirrel Species Appreciation Day\" with a new species every day. It would make an awesome desk calendar.  *Once a female squirrel breeds with a male, she never breeds again with that male.  *Squirrels do not leave their nests at night.  *Squirrels sharpen their teeth by chewing on sticks.  *Squirrels laugh. They also use chirping sounds to indicate a wide range of emotion and alarm signals, in conjunction with tail movements. If a squirrel is chirping very fast and flicking their tail, it is laughing at you.  *When a squirrel finds a nut, they open it with their teeth, then rub it on their face. This applies a scent so they can find it later- even under a foot of snow.  *When a squirrel's nest becomes infested with fleas or other parasites, it will abandon it and build a new one.  *A squirrel's incisors grow 6 inches per year.  *Squirrels prefer to build their nursery nests in oak trees.  *The average life span for a wild squirrel is 3-5 years.

Joy! by Joyce Carol Thomas
" "
This lovely board-book was given to us by friends in 2004 to celebrate the arrival of our younger daughter into our lives.  It has nothing to do with autism in particular, but everything to do with... JOY. Joy! by Joyce Carol Thomas pictures by Pamela Johnson You are my joy In every season Summer, fall, winter, spring You touch my heartstrings You are my joy You are my joy Freed in the whipporwill's wing Heard in the tall grass that sings In the laughter that rings From the sunny side of porches You are my joy Snug in a scarf and jacket Rolling in leaves Spun from autumn trees In a yard lit by sunset You are my joy Lulled by the sound of Icicle chimes And water rhymes Tap-dancing on sidewalks You are my joy Pointing at rainbows Circling the earth As it gives birth To flowers You are my joy In every season Summer, fall, winter, spring You make my heart sing You are my joy!

 Translation: “And he finds me that way and I love him doing that. And he rocks me aroooound and he rocks me and he rocks me… Daddy can you say  YAY ? (Daddy cackling) And he rocks me around.  No, let’s turn it off. I’m all done.” 
 Before you start to question our parenting abilities (or music taste) let me say that I have no idea where the lyrics came from.  I don’t often say “he rocks me.”  Not that often anyway.  So I’m just not sure.  
 (Also, Miles currently looks about ten.  This is a bit of an old video, but I had to share it.)  __________ We were riding in the car recently and Miles asked about marriage.  Kind of. Miles – “But why do they live together?” Me- “Because they’re married.”  Miles- “But why?” Me-“You mean why do people get married?” Miles- “Yes.” Me-“Well, people get married because they love each other and it’s a way of making a choice to always be together, live in the same house and share a family forever.”  Miles-“But why do you have to get all tied up to be loved?” Silence. (except for stifled laughs from Ryan and I) Me-“What do you mean?” Miles- repeats exact question. Ryan (oh, wise one)- “Miles, do you mean ‘tying the knot’?” Miles – “ YEEEES , why do you do that?” Me- (long explanation of what “tie the knot” does and DOES NOT mean.) ___________ More guest posts to come next week.  But only half the week.  Because if I don’t get back to blogging, my head could explode.  There are many MANY words in there.  
 Have a good weekend.
 Thank you for allowing me to pop up in your inbox 
and for reading my words, silly or serious.

 Before you start to question our parenting abilities (or music taste) let me say that I have no idea where the lyrics came from.  I don’t often say “he rocks me.”  Not that often anyway.  So I’m just not sure.

Miles – “But why do they live together?” Me- “Because they’re married.”  Miles- “But why?” Me-“You mean why do people get married?” Miles- “Yes.” Me-“Well, people get married because they love each other and it’s a way of making a choice to always be together, live in the same house and share a family forever.”  Miles-“But why do you have to get all tied up to be loved?” Silence. (except for stifled laughs from Ryan and I) Me-“What do you mean?” Miles- repeats exact question. Ryan (oh, wise one)- “Miles, do you mean ‘tying the knot’?” Miles – “ YEEEES , why do you do that?” Me- (long explanation of what “tie the knot” does and DOES NOT mean.) ___________ More guest posts to come next week.

 Posted on Wednesday~February 25, 2009 It’s no secret that I’m a total scatter-brain.  I’m in my own little world quite often. I’ve humiliated myself due to my busy and randomly over-flowing mind more times than I can count.  Being this way does make for good stories though.  So I’m rolling with my homies and telling one of the stories over at   Mama Manifesto   today.  See you there.  (If you want.) 
 (GRANDMA, PUT YOUR CURSOR ARROW THINGY ON THE WORDS MAMA MANIFESTO AND CLICK! MAGICALLY, YOU’LL ARRIVE AT MY POST! LOVE YOU)

 Thursday~November 26, 2009 
 My friend  Lindsey  gave me a gift today by sharing this quote with me, 
   
 “Gratitude is  noticing  the extraordinary in the ordinary.  And then taking the nanosecond to  feel  it.”  (K.K. Kaplan)
 (Oh, how I love that! Thank you, Lindsey!) 
 Happy Thanksgiving! (Dear My Side of the Family, We miss you today!) 
 Thank you for allowing me to pop up in your inbox

 You don’t have to be nice and good all the time to be unconditionally loved.  
 Toddlers know this best.

 Mommy: “That’s right! O is for Olivia!”

 Posted on Thursday~January 29 th , 2009 
 On his 3rd birthday last summer, Miles received a bird bath from Grandma Mary. His favorite part, of course–filling it up.
 Speaking of Miles: I’m stepping out of the shower recently and he comes flying into the bathroom, stops short, stares at me and says, “I like your butt and your  boobers .  And your squishy belly.”
 Gee, thanks. _______________ For more pictures worth a thousand words, visit Cheaper Than Therapy. (click on the picture.)

   Some of my favorite photos of  G’pa  Glenn… The first, he and wife,  G’ma  Helen.  I love the second one because this is SO him, being all silly and cheesy to get a laugh… The third, last year at his birthday party, still smiling.  He was the bomb  diggity .  The funeral was a true celebration, full of good memories and laughter, just as he would have wanted.  Thank you all for your comments and emails – you’re the bomb  diggity  too!

 Little Brother, you’re up. No really. It’ll be okay… 
 
 
 
 No. You may not have either of them. They are MINE. The End.
 Oh P.S. I want to say thank you for your comments on  my last post . Because of this bumpy sobriety journey, that kind of post means much to me, and so your words of encouragement, grace, friendship, and love…well, they totally lift me up.   Thank you.

 ~Miles and gal pal, Olivia~ (This picture was taken when they were two. Now they’re big three-year- olds , practically grown-ups.) Some pictures really are worth a thousand words, no? Look at how she’s looking at him!  I love it. There may even be a thousand captions for this one. Any ideas? “He’s just not that into you,” comes to mind. Or, “Wow.  That boy needs a haircut.” ___________ 
 For more pictures worth a thousand words, head on over to Cheaper than Therapy: 
   
 
 
 Thank you for allowing me to pop up in your inbox

Autism Quote of the Decade - 2nd Place - MADSEC Autism Task Force Report ABA Conclusion
" "
 Conclusions   There is a wealth of validated and peer-reviewed studies supporting the efficacy of ABA    methods to improve and sustain socially significant behaviors in every domain, in individuals    with  autism . Importantly, results reported include “meaningful” outcomes such as increased    social skills, communication skills academic performance, and overall cognitive functioning.    These reflect clinically-significant quality of life improvements. While studies varied as to the    magnitude of gains, all have demonstrated long term retention of gains made.   Other major contributions of ABA to the education and treatment of individuals with  autism     include:       •   a large number of empirically-based systematic instruction methods that lead to the        acquisition of skills, and to the decrease/elimination of aberrant behaviors;         •   a technology for systematically evaluating the efficacy of interventions intended to affect       individual learning and behavior; and        •   substantial cost/benefit.       Over 30 years of rigorous research and peer review of applied behavior analysis’ effectiveness    for individuals with  autism  demonstrate ABA has been objectively substantiated as effective    based upon the scope and quality of science. Professionals considering applied behavior   analysis should portray the method as objectively substantiated as effective. Methods of applied    behavior analysis should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of any intervention used to   help individuals with  autism . Researchers should continue to vigorously investigate behavioral   intervention as the most promising area of research and treatment benefitting individuals with   autism  known today. Early interventionists should leverage early  autism  diagnosis with the    proven efficacy of intensive ABA for optimal outcome and long-term cost benefit.

Misleading Autism Treatment Statements at About.com Autism
" "
 Lisa Jo Rudy at  About.com Autism , for reasons unknown to me has made misleading statements about the evidence in support of  the efficacy of various autism treatments.  Coming on the heels of the recent Deborah Fein study showing that 10-20% of subject children with autism recovered from their autism with Intensive Early Behavioral Intervention ... ABA ... it is surprising to see  About.com Autism  apparently react to that study with the assertion that all autism therapies are created equal.   Ms Rudy and  About.com Autism  appear to have turned their backs on evidence based assessments of autism treatments. Ms Rudy stated in  Can All Positive, Intensive Therapies Help Kids with Autism? : As a result, there's no good way to know whether a child who received Floortime would have done better with RDI or ABA. Certainly, evidence shows that most children with autism improve to varying degrees with intensive therapy, no matter what its name. Apart from the recent Fein study demonstrating full recovery as set out above other studies and reviews of those studies have unequivocally indicated that only ABA enjoys a solid evidence basis in support of its effectiveness: The  MADSEC (Maine) Autism Task Force  assessed the evidence basis in support of various autism interventions as of 2000 and found that only one, ABA, met the highest standard: \"Based upon a thorough examination of numerous methodologies considered as interventions   for children with autism, the MADSEC Autism Task Force has characterized the interventions   reviewed as follows: • Substantiated as effective based upon the scope and quality of research: Applied behavior analysis . In addition, applied behavior analysis’ evaluative procedures are   effective not only with behaviorally-based interventions, but also for the systematic   evaluation of the efficacy of any intervention intended to affect individual learning and   behavior. ABA’s emphasis on functional assessment and positive behavioral support will   help meet heightened standards of IDEA ‘97. Its emphasis on measurable goals and   reliable   data collection will substantiate the child’s progress in the event of due process. In describing the evidence backed benefits of ABA the MADSEC Report noted that: There is a wealth of validated and peer-reviewed studies supporting the efficacy of ABA   methods to improve and sustain socially significant behaviors in every domain, in individuals   with autism. Importantly, results reported include “meaningful” outcomes such as increased   social skills, communication skills academic performance, and overall cognitive functioning.   These reflect clinically-significant quality of life improvements. While studies varied as to the magnitude of gains, all have demonstrated long term retention of gains made. Other major contributions of ABA to the education and treatment of individuals with autism   include: • a large number of empirically-based systematic instruction methods that lead to the   acquisition of skills, and to the decrease/elimination of aberrant behaviors; • a technology for systematically evaluating the efficacy of interventions intended to affect   individual learning and behavior; and • substantial cost/benefit. Over 30 years of rigorous research and peer review of applied behavior analysis’ effectiveness for individuals with autism demonstrate ABA has been objectively substantiated as effective based upon the scope and quality of science. Professionals considering applied behavior analysis should portray the method as objectively substantiated as effective. Methods of applied behavior analysis should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of any intervention used to help individuals with autism. Researchers should continue to vigorously investigate behavioral intervention as the most promising area of research and treatment benefiting individuals with autism known today. Early interventionists should leverage early autism diagnosis with The  American Academy of Pediatrics  Management of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (2007)   report described the level of evidence of ABA effectiveness in a manner that no other treatment mentioned in the report even remotely approximated: Applied Behavior Analysis Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the process of applying interventions that are based on the principles of learning derived from experimental psychology research to systematically change behavior and to demonstrate that the interventions used are responsible for the observable   improvement in behavior. ABA methods are used to increase and maintain desirable adaptive behaviors, reduce interfering maladaptive behaviors or narrow the conditions under which they occur, teach new skills, and generalize behaviors to new environments or situations. ABA focuses on the reliable measurement and objective evaluation of observable behavior within relevant settings including the home, school, and community. The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been well documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject methodology21,25,27,28 and in controlled studies of comprehensive early intensive behavioral intervention programs in university and community settings.29–40 Children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior, and their outcomes have been significantly better than those of children in control groups.31–40 To these reviews of studies supporting ABA effectiveness in treating autism can be added the US Surgeon General and the NY State Department of Health.  Now the Fein study on autism recovery would add to the information basis of such reports. We are decades past the point where  About.com Autism  can claim that all autism interventions are created equal as long as they are positive and done early and intensively.  There is no evidence to support the  About.com  position.   The  About.com Autism  position is in essence a rejection of an evidence based approach to assessing autism interventions. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

CMAJ: Current Evidence Based, Effective  Autism Treatments and Interventions: ABA and Only ABA 
" "
 
 
 
 
An article in the January 13, 2014 issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal,   Autism spectrum disorder: advances in evidence-based  practice ,   confirms what American authorities have told us for decades, from the US Surgeon General to MADSEC and the American Academy of Pediatrics, ABA still represents evidence based, effective best treatment practice while \" Research on non-ABA–based treatments is sparse and shows limited efficacy.\": 
 
 
 
 Autism spectrum disorder: advances in evidence-based  practice 
 
 
 
 \"What treatments and interventions are available, and are they effective? The goal of existing interventions is to facilitate the acquisition of skills, remove barriers to learning and improve functional skills and quality of life.  
 
 
 
 Behavioural interventions 
 
 
 
 Current best practices for preschool-aged children with ASD include a focus on improving language, cognitive and adaptive skills using applied behaviour analysis (ABA) techniques.58  Applied behaviour analysis refers to the application of empirically derived learning principles(i.e., the antecedent–behaviour–consequence contingency) to produce meaningful changes in behaviour.59  Such strategies are carefully engineered and implemented through a variety of approaches (e.g., discrete trial teaching to more naturalistic learning contexts) to teach skills and reduce problem behaviour. Applied behaviour analysis interventions can be provided in a variety of settings (e.g., home, specialized treatment centres, specialized or public schools) by a range of front-line therapists, ideally supervised by a psychologist or board-certified behaviour analyst who specializes in ASD.  
 
 
 
  A recent overview of meta-analyses60 found
significantly enhanced outcomes associated with
early intensive ABA-based treatment (typically for
2–3 yr) in four of five included meta-analyses
(effect sizes 0.30 to > 1); these findings have since
been bolstered by a sixth meta-analysis.61 Gains
appear to be greatest in verbal intelligence
quotient (IQ) and language communication
domains,62,63 for children with stronger pretreatment
skills, if treatment is started earlier,64 and
with greater intensity or duration of intervention.
60–62,64 These gains achieved in various domains
have been summarized in a recent Cochrane
review.63 Although the overall quality of evidence
is low, it is the best evidence available.
A recent study in Ontario reported predictors
of outcome that account for some heterogeneity
in treatment response.65 
 
 
 
 A recent RCT supported
the efficacy of ABA-based intervention in toddlers
by showing improvements in IQ, adaptive
skills and diagnostic classification.37 Models vary,
notably by how ABA principles are implemented,
but everyday contexts (e.g., free play v. “tabletop”)
and activities based on the child’s interests
(v. therapist’s agenda) have advantages, including
greater generalization of learning.66 Questions
remain about which forms and intensities of treatment
are most effective for which children.  
 
 
 
 Research on non-ABA–based treatments is
sparse and shows limited efficacy.67 Translation of
evidence-based intervention into community
practice is being evaluated, including in Canada.68
A key question is whether effective high-quality
programs can be less costly and more sustainable;
the findings from Nova Scotia are promising.38
Studies of the effectiveness of treatment programs
for older children, youth and adults with
ASD are scarce. Benefits have been reported for
structured teaching practices, including ABA based

New York Times'  Slanted Article On  DIR/Floortime and Autism
" "
The  New York Times  has published in its print and online editions a lengthy piece by Melissa Fay Greene promoting DIR/Floortime.  The  article acknowledges to some extent the value of ABA as an autism intervention but implies that ABA is outdated and that DIR/Floortime is a new modern improved form of autism intervention.  The usual cliches about ABA being rote learning are trotted out along with the positive buzzwords used to promote DIR/Floortime \"relationship\", \"respectful of  the child\".  The article indicates that experts do not endorse any one method. What the article does not do is mention the fact that there is  no empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of DIR/Floortime as an autism intervention.  The  MADSEC Autism Task Force Report (2000 rev. ed.)  described DIR Flootime as without scientific evaluation of any kind. MADSEC  Autism Task Force Report, page 6: • Without scientific evaluation of any kind: Greenspan’s DIR/”Floor Time,” Son-Rise. MADSEC  Autism Task Force Report, page 43: Discussion There have been no peer-reviewed, published studies of Greenspan’s DIR/Floor Time’s effectiveness for children with autism. Conclusions There have been no peer-reviewed, published studies of Greenspan’s DIR/Floor Time’s effectiveness for children with autism. Researchers should consider investigation using research   protocols. Professionals considering Greenspan’s Floor Time should portray the method as   without peer-reviewed scientific evaluation, and should disclose this status to key decision   makers influencing the child’s intervention. The American Academy of Pediatrics reviewed autism interventions in  Management of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders(2007)  and stated, at page 5,  with respect to RID that: Relationship-focused early intervention models include Greenspan and Wieder’s developmental, individual-difference, relationship-based (DIR) model,55 Gutstein and Sheely’s relationship-development intervention (RDI),56 and the responsive-teaching (RT) curriculum developed by Mahoney et al.57,58 The DIR approach focuses on (1) “floor-time” play sessions and other strategies that are purported to enhance relationships and emotional and social interactions to facilitate emotional and cognitive growth and development and (2) therapies to remediate “biologically based processing capacities,” such as auditory processing and language, motor planning and sequencing, sensory modulation, and visual-spatial processing. Published evidence of the efficacy of the DIR model is limited to an unblinded review of case records (with significant methodologic flaws, including inadequate documentation of the intervention, comparison to a suboptimal control group, and lack of documentation of treatment integrity and how outcomes were assessed by informal procedures55) and a descriptive follow-up study of a small subset (8%) of the original group of patients.59 The article also fails to indicate the value of ABA as an autism intervention and the large body of evidence supporting its effectiveness: MADSEC (2000) Conclusions There is a wealth of validated and peer-reviewed studies supporting the efficacy of ABA methods to improve and sustain socially significant behaviors in every domain, in individuals with autism. Importantly, results reported include “meaningful” outcomes such as increased social skills, communication skills academic performance, and overall cognitive functioning. These reflect clinically-significant quality of life improvements. While studies varied as to the magnitude of gains, all have demonstrated long term retention of gains made. Other major contributions of ABA to the education and treatment of individuals with autism include: • a large number of empirically-based systematic instruction methods that lead to the acquisition of skills, and to the decrease/elimination of aberrant behaviors; • a technology for systematically evaluating the efficacy of interventions intended to affect individual learning and behavior; and • substantial cost/benefit. Over 30 years of rigorous research and peer review of applied behavior analysis’ effectiveness for individuals with autism demonstrate ABA has been objectively substantiated as effective based upon the scope and quality of science. Professionals considering applied behavior analysis should portray the method as objectively substantiated as effective. Methods of applied   behavior analysis should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of any intervention used to   help individuals with autism. Researchers should continue to vigorously investigate behavioral   intervention as the most promising area of research and treatment benefitting individuals with   autism known today. Early interventionists should leverage early autism diagnosis with the   proven efficacy of intensive ABA for optimal outcome and long-term cost benefit. American Academy of Pediatrics (2007) The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been well documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject methodology21,25,27,28 and in  controlled studies of comprehensive early intensive behavioral intervention programs in university and community settings.29–40 Children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior, and their outcomes have been significantly better than those of children in control groups.31–40 The New York Times is still a news source of great influence.  When it is using that influence in promoting interventions for children with autism,  a neurological disorder, it should do its homework and present an accurate and credible review of the professional literature.  Simply offering a guest column to a promoter of an intervention lacking in empirical verification of its effectiveness does a disservice to autistic children whose decision makers, family or public, could be misled by the NYT and its weighty reputation. autism

Why ABA for Autism? Because Children with Autism Disorders Deserve Evidence-Based Intervention and ABA Meets That Standard 
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Autism Canada Foundation, a Canadian autism charity,  promotes itself as \"The PREMIER Resource for Information on Autism Spectrum Disorders\" but  typically downplays the importance of evidence support for ABA as the Premier autism intervention while promoting interventions with less substantial  evidence bases as determined by study and  credible authorities.   
 
  Why criticize Autism Canada Foundation an autism charity? Why ABA for Autism? Why Evidence Based Intervention?  Because, as stated by  Couper and Sampson  in the Medical Journal of Australia 11 years ago,  ineffective therapies, while they may be immediately harmless, waste the child's valuable therapy time and parents' money.  Delay in implementing effective treatment may have a negative impact on the child's ultimate outcome.  ABA is the only intervention to date that meets the evidence based standard in every credible review, a fact downplayed by the Autism Canada Foundation. 
 
 
 
 ABA has for many years been confirmed by study and credible authorities as  the most substantially evidence based effective autism intervention.  If parents choose to try other methods they should in fact make  informed  choices. Autism Canada is a charitable organization which will be staging an autism conference this October called  Changing the Course of Autism  2014.  The brochure highlights RDI and the Son-Rise program but makes no express mention of  Applied Behavior Analysis.   
 
 As the following credible reviews indicate RDI and Son-Rise are not supported by the same level of evidence of their effectiveness as ABA ( I can't find any authoritative review mentioning any level of evidence  support for Son-Rise).   What the Autism Canada conference attendees are unlikely to be informed is that when it comes to autism therapies it  is not a close call - ABA was and remains the most substantiated, evidence based, effective autism intervention.  
 
 The US Surgeon General, the  MADSEC  Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities  (Maine Autism Task Force) Report (2000 revision ) ,    American Academy of Pediatrics, Management of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders , and a recent article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal all confirm ABA as the most effective autism intervention (specific treatment necessary for associated medical conditions - eg. seizures, gastro intestinal).  And as Couper and Sampson wrote ...  Children with autism deserve evidence based intervention :

 Jennifer J Couper and Amanda J
Sampson, in the 2003 editorial in the MJA, reviewed some of the evidence in support of the effectiveness  of behavioral
interventions for autism. The authors stressed the importance of an evidence
based approach to autism interventions: 
 
 
 
 \"While ineffective therapies
may be harmless, they waste parents' money and the child's valuable therapy
time. Furthermore, the delay in implementing effective treatment may compromise
the child's outcome.\"

 Couper and Sampson reviewed
the evidence at that time (2003) in relation to behavioral treatment for
autism: 
 
 
 
 The early intervention that
has been subjected to the most rigorous assessment is behavioural intervention.
There is now definite evidence that behavioural intervention improves
cognitive, communication, adaptive and social skills in young children with
autism. In 1987, Lovaas showed apparent recovery, persisting into adolescence,
in nine of 19 young children who received an intensive home-based intervention
based on applied behavioural analysis, a scientific method of reinforcing
adaptive and reducing maladaptive behaviours.5,6 Subsequent studies also showed
that behavioural intervention caused significant, albeit somewhat lesser,
gains.7-11 This has modified the orthodox view that autism is always a severe,
lifelong disability. Criticisms of the adequacy of the design and power of
these studies are being addressed by the multisite Lovaas replication Early
Autism Project. The first US site has released data (Wisconsin Early Autism
Project).12 Again, after three to four years of intensive applied behavioural
analysis intervention, about half the preschool children with autism acquired
near-normal functioning in language, performance IQ and adaptability.
Ninety-two per cent of intervention children acquired some language. Control
children who received special education showed no gains in IQ or
adaptability.12

 Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the process of
applying interventions that are based on the principles of learning derived
from experimental psychology research to systematically change behavior and to
demonstrate that the interventions used are responsible for the observable
improvement in behavior. ABA methods are used to increase and maintain
desirable adaptive behaviors, reduce interfering maladaptive behaviors or
narrow the conditions under which they occur, teach new skills, and generalize
behaviors to new environments or situations. ABA focuses on the reliable
measurement and objective evaluation of observable behavior within relevant
settings including the home, school, and community. The effectiveness of
ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been well documented through 5 decades of
research by using single-subject methodology21,25,27,28 and in controlled
studies of comprehensive early intensive behavioral intervention programs in
university and community settings.29–40 Children who receive early intensive
behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in
IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some
measures of social behavior, and their outcomes have been significantly better
than those of children in control groups.31–40\"

   An article in the
January 13, 2014 issue of the  Canadian Medical Association Journal, Autismspectrum disorder: advances in evidence-based practice ,  confirms what American
authorities have told us for decades, from the US Surgeon General to MADSEC and
the American Academy of Pediatrics, ABA still represents evidence based,
effective best treatment practice while \"Research on non-ABA–based
treatments is sparse and shows limited efficacy.\":  
 
 
 
 \"  Autism spectrum

interventions are available, and are they effective?  
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
   The goal of
existing interventions is to facilitate the acquisition of skills, remove
barriers to learning and improve functional skills and quality of life.  
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
   Behavioural
interventions  
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
     Current best practices for preschool-aged
children with ASD include a focus on improving language, cognitive and adaptive
skills using applied behaviour analysis (ABA) techniques.5 8 Applied behaviour
analysis refers to the application of empirically derived learning
principles(i.e., the antecedent–behaviour–consequence contingency) to produce
meaningful changes in behaviour.59 Such strategies are carefully engineered and
implemented through a variety of approaches (e.g., discrete trial teaching to
more naturalistic learning contexts) to teach skills and reduce problem
behaviour. Applied behaviour analysis interventions can be provided in a
variety of settings (e.g., home, specialized treatment centres, specialized or
public schools) by a range of front-line therapists, ideally supervised by a
psychologist or board-certified behaviour analyst who specializes in ASD.  
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
   A recent overview
of meta-analyses60 found significantly enhanced outcomes associated with early
intensive ABA-based treatment (typically for 2–3 yr) in four of five included
meta-analyses (effect sizes 0.30 to > 1); these findings have since been
bolstered by a sixth meta-analysis. 61 Gains appear to be greatest in verbal
intelligence quotient (IQ) and language communication domains,62,63 for
children with stronger pretreatment skills, if treatment is started earlier,64
and with greater intensity or duration of intervention. 60–62,64 These gains
achieved in various domains have been summarized in a recent Cochrane review.63
Although the overall quality of evidence is low, it is the best evidence
available. A recent study in Ontario reported predictors of outcome that
account for some heterogeneity in treatment response.65  
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
   A recent RCT
supported the efficacy of ABA-based intervention in toddlers by showing
improvements in IQ, adaptive skills and diagnostic classification. 37 Models
vary, notably by how ABA principles are implemented, but everyday contexts
(e.g., free play v. “tabletop”) and activities based on the child’s interests
(v. therapist’s agenda) have advantages, including greater generalization of
learning.66 Questions remain about which forms and intensities of treatment are
most effective for which children.  
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
   Research on
non-ABA–based treatments is sparse and shows limited efficacy. 67 Translation of
evidence-based intervention into community practice is being evaluated,
including in Canada.68 A key question is whether effective high-quality
programs can be less costly and more sustainable; the findings from Nova Scotia
are promising.38 Studies of the effectiveness of treatment programs for older
children, youth and adults with ASD are scarce. Benefits have been reported for
structured teaching practices, including ABA based interventions, for a wide
range of skill deficits and maladaptive behaviours.58\" [Highlighting added - HLD] 
 
 
   
 
 Hopefully conferences such as the Autism Canada Foundation 2014 conference are not seeking to change the course of autism intervention away from evidence based interventions toward largely  anecdotal approaches.  Hopefully attendees and those who access the conference information will be informed of the importance of evidence based support for autism interventions and the level of credible evidence in support of ABA effectiveness, a level of evidence support which remains unmatched by ANY other behavioural, social or educational intervention.

Help For Your Autistic Child? Consult Credible Autism Authorities
" "
 If you are seeking help for your autistic child you should certainly consult your local professionals.  If you do so you may want to make sure they are up to date and aware of some of the leading reviews of the effectiveness of various autism interventions.  One thing you absolutely should NOT do is listen to anti-ABA activists.  Their opposition to ABA is usually based on ideology, emotion and their own personal rejection of autism as a disorder or disability. Some credible agencies which have reviewed the scientific basis supporting the effectiveness of which hundreds of studies over several decades supporting the effectiveness of ABA as an effective autism intervention include:   American Academy of Pediatrics - Management of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders 2007 MADSEC (Maine) Autism Task Force Report 2000 (rev ed) US Surgeon General 1999 NY State Dept of Health 2005 (rev ed) This is what the AAP and MADSEC reports stated: American Academy of Pediatrics (2007):   The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been well documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject methodology21,25,27,28 and in controlled studies of comprehensive early intensive behavioral intervention programs in university and community settings.29–40 Children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior, and their outcomes have been significantly better than those of children in control groups.31–40   MADSEC Autism Task Force Report (2000):   Over the past 30 years, several thousand published research studies have documented the effectiveness of ABA across a wide range of: • populations (children and adults with mental illness, developmental disabilities and learning disorders) • interventionists (parents, teachers and staff) • settings (schools, homes, institutions, group homes, hospitals and business offices), and • behaviors (language; social, academic, leisure and functional life skills; aggression, selfinjury, oppositional and stereotyped behaviors)   …   The effectiveness of ABA-based interventions with persons with autism is well documented, with current research replicating already-proven methods and further developing the field.   Documentation of the efficacy of ABA-based interventions with persons with autism emerged in the 1960s, with comprehensive evaluations beginning in the early 1970s. Hingtgen & Bryson (1972) reviewed over 400 research articles pertinent to the field of autism that were published between 1964 and 1970. They concluded that behaviorally-based interventions demonstrated the most consistent results. In a follow-up study, DeMeyer, Hingtgen & Jackson (1981) reviewed over 1,100 additional studies that appeared in the 1970s. They examined studies that included behaviorally-based interventions as well as interventions based upon a wide range of theoretical foundations. Following a comprehensive review of these studies, DeMeyer, Hingtgen & Jackson (1982) concluded “. . .the overwhelming evidence strongly suggest that the treatment of choice for maximal expansion of the autistic child’s behavioral repertoire is a systematic behavioral education program, involving as many child contact hours as possible, and using therapists (including parents) who have been trained in the behavioral techniques” (p.435).  Support of the consistent effectiveness and broad-based application of ABA methods with  persons with autism is found in hundreds of additional published reports.  [highlighting added HL Doherty]   Baglio, Benavidiz, Compton, et al (1996) reviewed 251 studies from 1980 to 1995 that reported on the efficacy of behaviorally-based interventions with persons with autism. Baglio, et al (1996) concluded that since 1980, research on behavioral treatment of autistic children has become increasingly sophisticated and encompassing, and that interventions based upon ABA have consistentlyresulted in positive behavioral outcomes. In their review, categories of target behaviors included aberrant behaviors (ie self injury, aggression), language (ie receptive and expressive skills, augmentative communication), daily living skills (self-care, domestic skills), community living skills (vocational, public transportation and shopping skills), academics (reading, math, spelling, written language), and social skills (reciprocal social interactions, age-appropriate social skills).   In 1987, Lovaas published his report of research conducted with 38 autistic children using methods of applied behavior analysis 40 hours per week. Treatment occurred in the home and school setting. After the first two years, some of the children in the treatment group were able to enter kindergarten with assistance of only 10 hours of discrete trial training per week, and required only minimal assistance while completing first grade. Others, those who did not progress to independent school functioning early in treatment, continued in 40 hours per week of treatment for up to 6 years. All of the children in the study were re-evaluated between the ages of six and seven by independent evaluators who were blind as to whether the child had been in the treatment or control groups. There were several significant findings:   1) In the treatment group, 47% passed “normal” first grade and scored average or above on IQ tests. Of the control groups, only one child had a normal first grade placement and average IQ. 2) Eight of the remaining children in the treatment group were successful in a language disordered classroom and scored a mean IQ of 70 (range = 56-95). Of the control groups, 18 students were in a language disordered class (mean IQ = 70). 3) Two students in the treatment group were in a class for autistic or retarded children and scored in the profound MR range. By comparison, 21 of the control students were in autistic/MR classes, with a mean IQ of 40. 4) In contrast to the treatment group which showed significant gains in tested IQ, the control groups’ mean IQ did not improve. The mean post-treatment IQ was 83.3 for the treatment group, while only 53.3 for the control groups. In 1993, McEachin, et al investigated the nine students who achieved the best outcomes  in the 1987 Lovaas study. After a thorough evaluation of adaptive functioning, IQ and personality conducted by professionals blind as to the child’s treatment status, evaluators could not distinguish treatment subjects from those who were not. Subsequent to the work of Lovaas and his associates, a number of investigators have addressed outcomes from intensive intervention programs for children with autism. For example, the May Institute reported outcomes on 14 children with autism who received 15 - 20 hours of discrete trial training (Anderson, et al, 1987). While results were not as striking as those reported by Lovaas, significant gains were reported which exceeded those obtained in more traditional treatment paradigms. Similarly, Sheinkopf and Siegel (1998) have recently reported on interventions based upon discrete trial training which resulted in significant gains in the treated children’s’ IQ, as well as a reduction in the symptoms of autism. It should be noted that subjects in the May and Sheinkopf and Siegel studies were given a far less intense program than those of the Lovaas study, which may have implications regarding the impact of intensity on the effectiveness of treatment. ... Conclusions There is a wealth of validated and peer-reviewed studies supporting the efficacy of ABA methods to improve and sustain socially significant behaviors in every domain, in individuals with autism. Importantly, results reported include “meaningful” outcomes such as increased social skills, communication skills academic performance, and overall cognitive functioning. These reflect clinically-significant quality of life improvements. While studies varied as to the magnitude of gains, all have demonstrated long term retention of gains made. Other major contributions of ABA to the education and treatment of individuals with autism include: • a large number of empirically-based systematic instruction methods that lead to the acquisition of skills, and to the decrease/elimination of aberrant behaviors; • a technology for systematically evaluating the efficacy of interventions intended to affect individual learning and behavior; and • substantial cost/benefit. Over 30 years of rigorous research and peer review of applied behavior analysis’ effectiveness   for individuals with autism demonstrate ABA has been objectively substantiated as effective   based upon the scope and quality of science.

Autism Gold Standard Intervention - Nova Scotia ABA/IEBI Autism Program Produces Positive Reslts
" "
 This has not been a good week for those who  insist that there is no consensus on a gold standard intervention for autistic children. The AAP description of ABA as an intervention with more than 5 decades of studies providing positive results for autistic children is followed by the results from a Nova Scotia  IEBI/ABA study showing positive results.  It's enough to give anti-ABA crusaders a real headache. Autism Treatment Program Getting Positive Results  Department of Health October 30, 2007 12:00    A program designed to enhance social and communication skills for young children with autism spectrum disorder is providing added benefits to their families. The interim results of an independent program evaluation conducted by IWK Health Centre Research Services and Dalhousie University indicates that after one year of Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention (EIBI)treatment, virtually all 27 children in the first phase of the program had significantly improved communication skills. According to tests and parental feedback, they also had improved problem-solving skills and reduced behavioural problems. ... Many of the children were about a year and a half behind in language-development skills when they began EIBI treatment. On average, children gained more than a year's worth of language skills in the first 12 months of treatment.

Evidence Based Autism Interventions
" "
The expression \"evidence based\" is often encountered in discussion of autism treatments or interventions. Parents, government officials, professionals and researchers will use the expression when discussing the effectiveness of various interventions in treating or curing autism. A well known article in the Journal of the Australian Medical Association, linked on the sidebar of this blog site, is entitled \" Autistic Children Deserve Evidence Based Intervention \". But what does the expression \"evidence based\" mean and which autism interventions, if any, meet the evidence based standard?   It is important for parents and political decision makers trying to determine what interventions to provide autistic persons to understand the concept of \"evidence based\" interventions. There have been many quack autism interventions offered both by self promoters and wishful thinkers. Such interventions waste valuable development time of autistic children, waste family and government funds, and in some cases, actually cause direct harm. Unfortunately there have also been those who are opposed to curing or treating autistic persons, those who wish to promote alternative interventions, or who wish to avoid expending public resources to provide treatment, who attack  Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) despite the quality and quantity of research supporting the efficacy of ABA as a health and education intervention for autistic children. CAIRN , the  Canadian Autism Intervention Network , defines \"evidence based\": By evidence-based, we mean the best available information based on scientifically rigorous research that produces consistent findings no matter how many times the study is repeated. CAIRN also notes that there are substantial differences in the quality of evidence. It lists on its web site the characteristics of studies that provide high quality evidence.  Systematic reviews A systematic review uses a clear and systematic method of finding and appraising relevant, high quality research studies whose combined results are used to answer a pre-determined question about treatment. The strength of the systematic review is in its ability to combine data from studies of different populations in different settings to show if a treatment is widely applicable. By pooling data from patients in a number of studies, thus increasing the sample size, a systematic review can increase the reliability of the findings, showing whether a treatment actually works or may be useless or even harmful. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) In RCTs, research subjects are randomly placed in one of two groups. One group receives the intervention that the study has been designed to measure; the other group (known as the control group) does not. The control group may receive a placebo, no treatment, or another therapy. Study participants (and ideally, the researchers) do not know to which group they have been assigned. RCTs are considered the second strongest level of evidence for the effectiveness of a treatment. The strength of the RCT is that it helps ensure that the two groups under study do not have any important differences between them that could influence whether or not the treatment they receive works. Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) In a controlled clinical trial, one group receives a therapy and the other (control group) does not. As in RCTs, the control group may receive a placebo, no treatment, or another therapy. Unlike RCTs, however, the participants are not randomly assigned to each group. With some populations, or in some situations, it is not possible to randomly assign participants to one group or another. CCTs still use a comparison group and efforts are made to ensure that the two groups do not have serious differences between them that could influence the results of the study. Multiple and single case studies In multiple and single case studies, subjects are tested to establish a baseline. They are then given an intervention, after which they are re-tested to determine what change, if any, has occurred. Sometimes, especially when there is great variability in a condition, or small numbers of people with a condition, it is not possible to conduct research with two groups. In multiple and single case studies, the participants are used as their own comparison when they are given alternating treatments, or a treatment and then no treatment. Although not providing the same strength of evidence as an RCT or CCT, when done rigorously, these studies can yield valuable information about treatments.  In its February 2000 (Rev.) Autism Task Force Report the Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities (MADSEC) reported the results of its thorough review of the professional literature on educational interventions for autism. The MADSEC Task Force also interviewed leading practicioners of various autism interventions. It concluded that only one intervention met the standard of being an evidence based effective autism intervention - ABA. • Substantiated as effective based upon the scope and quality of research: Applied behavior analysis . In addition, applied behavior analysis’ evaluative procedures are effective not only with behaviorally-based interventions, but also for the systematic evaluation of the efficacy of any intervention intended to affect individual learning and behavior. ABA’s emphasis on functional assessment and positive behavioral support will help meet heightened standards of IDEA ‘97. Its emphasis on measurable goals and reliable data collection will substantiate the child’s progress in the event of due process. ...... Conclusions There is a wealth of validated and peer-reviewed studies supporting the efficacy of ABA methods to improve and sustain socially significant behaviors in every domain, in individuals with autism. Importantly, results reported include “meaningful” outcomes such as increased social skills, communication skills academic performance, and overall cognitive functioning. These reflect clinically-significant quality of life improvements. While studies varied as to the magnitude of gains, all have demonstrated long term retention of gains made. Other major contributions of ABA to the education and treatment of individuals with autism include: • a large number of empirically-based systematic instruction methods that lead to the acquisition of skills, and to the decrease/elimination of aberrant behaviors; • a technology for systematically evaluating the efficacy of interventions intended to affect individual learning and behavior; and • substantial cost/benefit. Over 30 years of rigorous research and peer review of applied behavior analysis’ effectiveness for individuals with autism demonstrate ABA has been objectively substantiated as effective based upon the scope and quality of science . Since the publication of the MADSEC Autism Task Force Report there have been more studies confirming ABA as the most effective autism intervention. In \" A comparison of intensive behavior analytic and eclectic treatments for young children with autism \" published in Research in Developmental Disabilities, 26, (2005), pp. 359-383, the authors, Jane S. Howard, Coleen R. Sparkman, Howard G. Cohen, Gina Green, Harold Stanislaw reported the results of a non randomized comparison trial with three intervention groups of children with autism spectrum disorders. 29 children received one-on-one intensive behavioral therapy for 25 to 40 hours per week (IBT group); 16 received eclectic therapy (multiple treatment methods) with a teacher to student ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 for 30 hours per week (AP group); and 16 received a non-intensive, eclectic, small group, public early intervention program for 15 hours per week (GP group.) The study's authors reported that 14 months after initiation of the interventions, the intensive behavioral therapy group scored significantly higher on all measures, with the exception of motor skills, where there was no difference among groups. Alan Harchik,  senior Vice President with the May Institute, has written an excellent article on the topic of evidence based interventions. Mr. Harchik describes evidence based standards and cautions against the use of the many treatments and interventions for autism that do not meet that standard including sensory integration, facilitated communication, auditory integration, chelation and hyperbaric oxygen treatments. The term evidence-based practice is frequently used in the fields of science and medicine. It refers to procedures that have been tested using scientific research methods and shown to be most likely to produce positive results. This means that objective studies have been conducted using reliable data collection methods, consistent implementation of the treatments and the careful control of the research conditions. The research findings are then published in professional journals after review by a panel of experts in the field.  Mr. Harchik, like the MADSEC Autism Task Force Report, concludes that ABA is the intervention with the most evidence supporting its effectiveness. \" For children with autism, the procedures that have the most evidence supporting their effectiveness are those that use applied behavior analysis. .... applied behavior analysis methods include an assessment of the factors that are impeding learning or maintaining behavior problems, using positive rewards, teaching in small steps, using prompts and guidance, and collecting data to monitor progress.  \" The studies and expertise which provide evidence of the efficacy of ABA in autism intervention have not persuaded some who oppose the use of ABA interventions with autistic persons. Some will continue to insist on an unattainable standard being met before they will acknowledge the efficacy of ABA. For others though, for parents, professionals and government decision makers seeking to help autistic children now ABA, their only agenda is to find out what works, what really works, based on the best available evidence. To date, ABA is the only intervention for which claims of efficacy meet the high quality evidence based standard. That is why parents and sincere autism advocates try to obtain  passage of legislation in Canada and the United States to ensure the availability of ABA treatment for autistic children.

ABA Most Effective In Educating Autistic Children
" "
In New Brunswick an interdepartmental committee was struck (Health, Education and Family Services) to study services available for autistic persons in New Brunswick and make recommendations.  It sat from 1999 to 2001 and issued its report in November 2001. Its report then went unread by the lead Minister of the day, Health Minister Elvy Robichaud, for a further year. The committee studiously avoided making any recommendations about the effectiveness of any particular intervention.   The criteria for \"Community\" Autism Centres seeking funding from the government has required that these centres not promote any specific intervention and instead  provide information on various interventions. Meanwhile our good neighbors in the State of Maine took a different approach.  There the stakeholders group involved in education of autistic children examined the professional literature concerning efficacy of autism interventions and concluded in the MADSEC Autism Task Force Report 1999, revised Feb. 2000, that ONLY Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) could be said to be evidence based effective intervention for educating autistic children. Since then specific studies have confirmed the superiority of ABA in educating autistic children.  The Lovaas site has an excellent summary of the most significant of the hundreds of studies which substantiate ABA as the intervention of choice in educating autistic children: http://www.lovaas.com/resources.php Research Articles Between 1985 and 2005, there were over 500 articles published concerning Applied Behavior Analysis and autism. Here is some of the key information from those sources. 1987 study by Dr. Lovaas              Lovaas, O. I. (1987) . Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young autistic children. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 55, 3-9.                    Original research in peer-reviewed journals indicating that 90% of children substantially improved when utilizing the Lovaas Model of Applied Behavior Analysis, compared to the control group. Close to half attained a normal IQ and tested within the normal range on adaptive and social skills. 1993 follow up study McEachin, J. J., Smith, T., & Lovaas, O. I. (1993 ). Long-term outcome for children with autism who received early intensive behavioral treatment. American Journal on Mental Retardation, 97 (4), 359-372.                    Follow-up research in early adolescence showed that children in the 1987 study maintained their skills and could succeed in life without costly special education and residential services.        1998 cost-benefit analysis of intensive, early behavioral intervention. Jacobson, John W., Mulick, James A., & Green, Gina. (1998 ). \"Cost-Benefit Estimates for Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for Young Children with AutismÑGeneral Model and Single State Case.\" Behavioral Interventions, 13, 201-226.                    Demonstrates that providing behavioral treatment to all children with autism for three years, delivered between the ages of 2 to 6 years, would save approximately $200,000 per child for ages 3-22 years and up to $1,000,000 per child for ages 3-55 years. The savings per child even takes into account that some children will not benefit at all from behavioral treatment and some will only make modest gains. 1999 report from the New York State health department             http://www.health.state.ny.us/community/infants_children/early_intervention/autism/ch4_pt2.htm Recommends a minimum of 20 hours per week of individualized behavioral interventions using ABA techniques, based on strong evidence in the research 2000 report from the Surgeon General             http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter3/sec6.html Acknowledges the efficacy of applied behavioral methods in the treatment of children with autism and cites the \"well-designed study carried out by Lovaas and colleagues\" 2002 study by Dr. Eikeseth directly comparing two treatments Eikeseth, Svein, Smith, Tristram, & Eldevik, Erik Jahr Sigmund. (2002). Intensive Behavioral Treatment at School for 4- to 7-Year-Old Children with Autism. Behavior Modification, 26, 49-68.                    Demonstrates that a focused behavioral treatment program is far superior than an eclectic special education approach that uses a variety of treatments. (Children in both groups received the same number of hours of treatment by qualified personnel.) 2005 replication study by Dr. Jane Howard directly comparing two treatments Howard, Jane S. , Sparkman, Coleen R., Cohen, Howard G., Green, Gina, & Stanislaw, Harold. (2005). A Comparison of Intensive Behavior Analytic and Eclectic Treatments for Young Children with Autism. Research in Developmental Disabilities, 26 (4), 359-383.                    Again demonstrates that a focused behavioral treatment program is far superior than an eclectic special education approach that uses a variety of treatments. (Children in both groups received the same number of hours of treatment by qualified personnel.)        2005 study by Dr. Sallows, replicating the 1987 Lovaas study results              Sallows, Glen O. & Graupner, Tamlynn D. (2005). Intensive Behavioral Treatment for Children with Autism: Four-Year Outcome and Predictors. American Journal on Mental Retardation, 110 (6), 417-438.                    Replication study of the Lovaas Model of Applied Behavior Analysis by an independent author. Dr. Sallows states, \"We found that 48% of all children showed rapid learning, achieved average posttreatment scores, and at age 7, were succeeding in regular education classrooms. These results are consistent with those reported by Lovaas and colleagues (Lovaas, 1987; McEachin, Smith, & Lovaas, 1993).\" 2006 study by Dr. Cohen Howard, again replicating the 1987 Lovaas study results Cohen, Howard, Amerine-Dickens, Mila, Smith, Tristram. (2006). Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment: Replication of the UCLA Model in a Community Setting. Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics, 27 (2), 145-155. Another replication study of the Lovaas Model of Applied Behavior Analysis by an independent author. Children in behavioral treatment scored significantly higher in IQ and adaptive behavior scores than the comparison group. Further, 29% (6 of 21) children were fully included in regular education without assistance and another 52% (11 of 21) were included with support. This compares to only 5% (1 of 21) children in the control group who were placed in regular education. Despite this wealth of literature supporting the efficacy of ABA as an educational intervention for autistic children there remains opposition to its use for that purpose.  There are many ulterior motives some cost based others emotion based. Arguments are also advanced on the basis that studies generally are not based on a random assignment to control groups.  What these criticisms ignore are that as the trial judge in the Auton case concluded after reviewing the expert evidence in that case, whether done by design or not the assignments did not indicate any bias in group assignment - the assignments were not substantially different than they would have been under pure random assignment.  Such criticisms also gloss over the ethical problems posed by random assignment to groups in which children would receive educational interventions which are generally believed not to be effective in educating autistic children.  The criticisms also ignore the reality that children have to be educated now. Parents will not accept waiting another generation for academics and anti-ABA die-hards to be convinced.  Our children need to be educated now. Hundreds of studies support the efficacy of ABA in educating autistic children.  It is long past time to give our children the opportunity of a real education and development to the best of their potential.

Study Watch : Systematic review of early intensive behavioral interventions for children with autism.
" "
 Systematic review of early intensive behavioral interventions for children with autism. Recent reviews highlight limitations in the evidence base for early interventions for children with autism. We conducted a systematic review of controlled studies of early intensive behavioral interventions (EIBI) for young children with autism. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria (including two randomized controlled trials). At group level, EIBI resulted in improved outcomes (primarily measured by IQ) compared to comparison groups. At an individual level, however, there was considerable variability in outcome, with some evidence that initial IQ (but not age) was related to progress. This review provides evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI for some, but not all, preschool children with autism. Or to paraphrase, we reviewed other studies and it looks like it works on the whole but we don't know why it works or doesn't work on an individual level.  I need to read this one.

In her book \"Science for Sale in the Autism Wars\" (p68), Sabrina Freeman states that only four of the 19 experimental group autistic children in Lovaas (1987) received a treatment including physical aversives, thus minimizing their role in this landmark study. As often happens with statements from Canada's leading autism advocates, it's impossible to say whether Dr Freeman is unfamiliar with the scientific literature, or is familiar with it and is misrepresenting it. Lovaas (1987) identifies \"a slap on the thigh\" (along with \"a loud 'no'\") as part of the treatment for the 19 autistic children in the experimental group, but not for the 19 autistic children in Control Group 1, in his main experiment. By his \"main experiment\", I mean the non-randomized controlled trial with the celebrated 47% rate of \"normal functioning\" as its experimental group's outcome. This use of aversives is reiterated in Lovaas and Smith's (1988) more detailed description of the study reported in Lovaas (1987).  However, as I've  previously written , Dr Lovaas also took measures to demonstrate that this \"aversive procedure\", as Dr Freeman puts it in her book, was an effective and indeed essential component in the treatment received by the 19 experimental group children. This involved what Dr Lovaas called a \"within-subjects replication design\", in which the use of physical aversives was manipulated in four children from the experimental group and four from Control Group 1. This study-within-a-study is reported to be a success:  During baseline, when the contingent-aversive component was absent, small and unstable reductions were observed in the large amount of inappropriate behaviors, and similar small and unstable increases were observed in appropriate baheviors such as play and language. These changes were insufficient to allow for the subjects' successful mainstreaming. Introduction of contingent aversives resulted in a sudden and stable reduction in the inappropriate behaviors and a sudden and stable increase in appropriate behaviors.  (p7) Dr Lovaas concludes, about contingent aversives, that  ...at least one component in the treatment program functioned to produce change, which helps to reduce the effect of placebo variables.  (p7) And, ...the within-subjects study showed that at least one treatment component contributed to the favorable outcome in the intensive treatment (experimental) group.  (p8) And further: In the within-subjects studies that were reported, contingent aversives were isolated as one significant variable. Therefore, it is unlikely that treatment effects could be repeated without this component.  (p8) Two other papers from Dr Lovaas' group from around the same time (Epstein et al., 1985, which reports on 6 of the 19 experimental group children; and Lovaas et al., 1987, which describes part of the study-within-the-study) also refer to the importance of contingent aversives in the study design and findings which were later reported in Lovaas (1987).  The literature leaves no doubt that all 19 autistic children in the experimental group in Lovaas (1987) were subject to contingent aversives. There's also ample evidence that this \"treatment component\" was, in a separate experiment involving 4 experimental and 4 control group children, found then argued to be essential in achieving the famous result in the main experiment in Lovaas (1987). Dr Freeman's misreporting of the literature serves her purpose, in dismissing as \"spurious\" any concerns about aversives. But it also exemplifies the disrespect our most important autism advocates have for peer-reviewed science.  In fact, there's a later ABA intervention study from UCLA in which only four autistic children in an experimental group were subject to contingent aversives, but Dr Freeman does not mention this study or reference it in her book. That's going to be part three. References: Epstein, L.J., Taubman, M.T., and Lovaas, O.I. (1985). Changes in self-stimulatory behaviors with treatment.

EIBI as Intervention of Choice for Young Children with Autism
" "
 \".... the results of our meta-analysis supports the  implication that  early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) should be the  intervention of choice for young children with autism.\" Sigmund Eldevik, Richard Hastings, and Carl Hughes ,  Bangor College, UK Erik Jahr ,  Akershus University Hospital, Norway        Svein Eikeseth ,  Akershus University College, Norway     Scott Cross ,  Lovaas Institute for Early Intervention, USA The recent meta-analysis by Eldevik and others must be very disheartening to anti-ABA crusaders in their efforts to disparage ABA  intervention  for children with autism.    Parents seeking to actually help their autistic children though can take heart that yet another study supports their struggle to obtain ABA intervention for their children.  Hopefully public decision makers will be guided by this and previous studies and reviews in determining how best to help autistic children.  The meta-analysis was summarized in  Meta-analyses of research findings can help guide practice and policy    in Issue  # 9, of the newsletter of the Association of Professional Behavior Analysts.  In conducting their meta-analysis the authors identified 34 studies through a systematic  literature search and included 9 studies that had either a  comparison or a control group.  The authors found statistically significant improvements in IQ and adaptive behavior. They also reviewed a recent meta-analysis published in 2009 (Spreckley & Boyd) that purported to show that EIBI produced no better effects than what was described as standard care.  The Eldevik team identified several serious errors in  the Spreckley & Boyd meta-analysis though one of which I found particularly interesting, a misunderstanding by the authors of the Spreckly & Boyd meta-analyis of how EIBI and ABA are delivered: \"That analysis had a number of serious limitations, however. First, only 4 studies were included, so the full range of evidence for EIBI was not reviewed. Second, it was not clear from the report how EIBI was defined, so the studies may not reflect genuine EIBI as it is understood in our field.  Third, and perhaps most problematic, the authors (Australian physical therapists) seemed to misunderstand how genuine EIBI is delivered, and what a study by Sallows and Graupner (2005) showed.  In that study, one group of children with autism received EIBI directed by professional behavior analysts, and the other group received EIBI managed by their parents, who received training and frequent consultation from the behavior analysts. Both groups had comparably large gains on several measures after 4 years of EIBI.  Spreckley and Boyd (2009) incorrectly characterized the parent-managed EIBI as “standard care,” i.e., non-ABA intervention. Because there were few differences between the groups after treatment, those authors concluded that EIBI was no more effective than what they erroneously treated as “standard care.”\" The misunderstanding of how EIBI and ABA are actually delivered is an impression that seems to permeate much of the online criticisms of ABA, particularly those by people who have absolutely no experience with ABA.  Eldevik, Jahr, Eikeseth and Cross have performed a valuable service by helping to replace anti-ABA ideology with still more demonstrated evidence of ABA effectiveness.  autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

Five papers published or epublished so far in 2008, along with a sixth which has sat in press all year, have in one way or another reviewed the ABA group designs, sometimes alongside other approaches to autism.  The solitary RCT (where the intended comparison between randomized groups was actually carried out) in the 47-year history of ABA-based autism interventions--a small, largely failed study--is now drowned in an enormous murk of systematic, quasi-systematic, and not-systematic-at-all reviews. At this point in autism and autism advocacy history, no one should be surprised that this phenomenon encompasses dueling meta-analyses.  As with every other Verbatim, providing quotes doesn't mean I agree with them or the papers they are situated in. Here are quotes from the conclusions of three of the 2008 reviews: Intervention studies suffer from methodological problems that preclude definitive conclusions regarding their efficacy. [...] While this review suggests that Lovaas may improve some core symptoms of ASD compared to special education, these findings are based on pooling outcomes from a few, methodologically weak studies with few participants and relatively short-term follow-up. [...] Future studies on the effectiveness of these interventions need to be more rigorous.   (Ospina et al., 2008) Given the few RCT studies, the few models that have been tested, and the large differences in interventions that are being published, it is clear that the field is still very early in the process of determining what kinds of interventions are most efficacious in early autism, the variables that mediate and moderate treatment effects, and the degree of both short-term and long-term improvement that can be expected for an individual child.   (Rogers & Vismara, 2008) Currently there is inadequate evidence that ABI [applied behavioral intervention] has better outcomes than standard care for children with autism. Appropriately powered clinical trials with broader outcomes are required.

AutismPro - \"Somewhat\" Evidence Based Internet Autism Intervention or Not Evidence Based At All?
" "
 Based upon a thorough examination of numerous methodologies considered as interventions    for children with  autism , the  MADSEC   Autism   Task   Force  has characterized the interventions    reviewed as follows:       •   Substantiated as effective, based upon the scope and quality of research :         Applied behavior analysis. In addition, applied behavior analysis’ evaluative procedures are    effective not only with behaviorally-based interventions, but also for the systematic   evaluation of the efficacy of  any  intervention intended to affect individual learning and    behavior. ABA’s emphasis on functional assessment and positive behavioral support will    help meet heightened standards of IDEA ‘97. Its emphasis on measurable goals and reliable    data collection will substantiate the child’s progress in the event of due process.        •   Shows promise, but is not yet objectively substantiated as effective for individuals       with  autism  using controlled studies and subject to the rigors of good science:   Auditory Integration Training, The Miller Method  , Sensory Integration, and TEACCH.       •   Repeatedly subjected to the rigors of science, which leads numerous researchers to       conclude the intervention is not effective, may be harmful, or may lead to unintended    consequences:   Facilitated Communication.       •   Not scientifically evaluated:    Beware the magic bullet solution.   Beware the cheap and easy fix. Whenever a crisis arises anywhere there always seems to be someone willing to sell a magic solution to the problem.  Autism disorder diagnoses are soaring, the costs of  treating these serious neurological disorders are soaring, the costs of not treating autism disorders,  in terms of increased state funded adult autism care are also soaring.  A solution must be found so what is the solution? For years parents and professionals have been urging government and educational service providers to implement evidence based approaches to treating and educating autistic children.  The ASD's are serious neurological disorders that require a serious evidence based approach.  And time is important in the developmental life span of children to ensure the maximum results. In  Children With Autism Deserve Evidence Based Interventions, The Evidence for Behavioural Therapy , Jennifer J Couper, Head, Endocrinology and Diabetes Centre Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, and University of Adelaide, SA and Amanda J Sampson, Ultrasonologist, Royal Women’s Hospital, Carlton, VIC reviewed the professional literature on autism interventions and discussed some of the moral issues relevant to provision of evidence based interventions for children with autism: \" While ineffective therapies may be harmless, they waste parents’ money and the child’s valuable therapy time. Furthermore, the delay in implementing effective treatment may compromise the child’s outcome. \" In New Brunswick the Inter Departmental Committee on Autism Services met for 18 months before concluding that there were precious few autism specific services in New Brunswick. One of the strengths of the IDC Report finally issued in November 2001 though was an emphasis on provision of evidence based interventions for autistic children.  Now, however, the New Brunswick Department of Education, without consulting the Autism Society New Brunswick, is engaged in what it describes as a pilot project involving AutismPro, a non-evidence based autism intervention tool created in part in New Brunswick and advocated for strenuously by senior levels of the New Brunswick Department of Education.  The establishment of this pilot project, especially when established in secrecy by Department officials, represents a significant departure from the commitment to evidence based interventions made in the 2001 IDC Report. In fact the entire world is being tempted to abandon the evidence based approach to autism disorder interventions and instead is being sold a much different approach - the \"somewhat\" evidence based approach of AutismPro, a commercial, untested, unstudied,  unverified, product sold by Virtual Experts Clinic Inc. Unfortunately civil servants looking for  cheap solutions, especially senior education bureaucrats looking to maintain control over their department costs and agendas, are eager to adopt this product which is advertised as based on \"evidence based interventions\" a somewhat questionable claim. VEC Inc., the owner of AutismPro,  is a  master of SelfPromotion. VEC Inc's  self congratulatory PR releases on the business newswire services ensure that the world is led to believe that AutismPro is a can't miss product, the magic bullet solution to the world's growing autism crisis.  What none of the AutismPro SelfPromotion information does is indicate how the product in any way meets an evidence based standard as an effective autism intervention.  Quite the contrary, the  VEC Inc's own public statements suggest  that AutismPro is NOT an evidence based effective autism intervention; or at best might be properly described as \"somewhat\" evidence based. Evidence Based Autism Interventions On the AutismPro website under  AutismPro Research AutismPro Uses Evidence-Based Methods    it states that the AutismPro product offers three \"evidence based\" methods of autism intervention: Behavioral,Developmental,Social Behavior. (It would be interesting to know if the symbols eg. heart for social, were intended to attract users to specific methods) These groupings of methods are simply categories of intervention types, not actual interventions.  Many of the interventions listed under these three categories are not in fact recognized as evidence based effective interventions for autism, at least not in any of the major reviews of autism interventions conducted in the last 10 years.  There have been several reviews conducted by US state and federal agencies. In the  MADSEC (Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities)  Autism Task Force Report, February 2000 (Rev. Ed. )  it was concluded  that: Based upon a thorough examination of numerous methodologies considered as interventions for children with autism, the MADSEC Autism Task Force has characterized the interventions reviewed as follows: •  Substantiated as effective , based upon the scope and quality of research: Applied behavior analysis. In addition, applied behavior analysis’ evaluative procedures are effective not only with behaviorally-based interventions, but also for the systematic evaluation of the efficacy of any intervention intended to affect individual learning and behavior. ABA’s emphasis on functional assessment and positive behavioral support will help meet heightened standards of IDEA ‘97. Its emphasis on measurable goals and reliable data collection will substantiate the child’s progress in the event of due process. • Shows promise, but is  not yet objectively substantiated   as effective  for individuals with autism using controlled studies and subject to the rigors of good science: Auditory Integration Training, The Miller Method, Sensory Integration, and TEACCH . • Repeatedly subjected to the rigors of science, which leads numerous researchers to conclude the intervention is not effective, may be harmful, or may lead to unintended consequences: Facilitated Communication. •  Not scientifically evaluated: Greenspan’s DIR/”Floor Time,” Son-Rise. The MADSEC Autism Task Force Report Rev. Ed. was issued in 2000.  Since then there have been other studies and professional review of autism interventions.  Very recently, on October 29, 2007,  the  American Academy of Pediatrics  issued its on-line review of educational interventions for autistic children Management of  Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders  in which it conducted a review of educational interventions for autistic children and concluded with respect to ABA that: \" The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been well documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject methodology21,25,27,28 and in controlled studies of comprehensive early intensive behavioral intervention programs in university and community settings.29–40 Children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior, and their outcomes have been significantly better than those of children in control groups.31–40. Other methods and interventions offered by AutismPro did not fare so well in the AAP review of the evidence basis for effectiveness as an autism intervention.  Starting with the best of the rest (TEACCH)  and working downward in the AAP summary the evidence of effectiveness goes from scant to non-existent: Several reports have documented progress in children who have received TEACCH services as well as parent satisfaction and improvement in parent teaching skills, but these reports were not from controlled studies of treatment outcomes.44–49 In a controlled trial, Ozonoff and Cathcart50 found that children treated with a TEACCH-based home program for 4 months in addition to their local day treatment programs improved significantly more than children in the control group who received local day treatment services only. Developmental Models Developmental models are based on use of developmental theory to organize hypotheses regarding the fundamental nature of ASDs and design approaches to address the deficits. The Denver model, for example, is based largely on remediating key deficits in imitation, emotion sharing, theory of mind, and social perception by using play, interpersonal relationships, and activities to foster symbolic thought and teach the power of communication.12 This program has shifted from a center-based treatment unit to service delivery in homes and inclusive school environments.  Several studies have demonstrated improvements in cognitive, motor, play, and social skills beyond what would be expected on the basis of initial developmental rates in children who are treated according to the Denver model, but controlled trials are lacking.5 1–54 Relationship-focused early intervention models include Greenspan and Wieder's developmental, individual-difference, relationship-based (DIR) model,55 Gutstein and Sheely's relationship-development intervention (RDI),56 and the responsive-teaching (RT) curriculum developed by Mahoney et al.57,58 The DIR approach focuses on (1) \"floor-time\" play sessions and other strategies that are purported to enhance relationships and emotional and social interactions to facilitate emotional and cognitive growth and development and (2) therapies to remediate \"biologically based processing capacities,\" such as auditory processing and language, motor planning and sequencing, sensory modulation, and visual-spatial processing.  Published evidence of the efficacy of the DIR model is limited to an unblinded review of case records (with significant methodologic flaws, including inadequate documentation of the intervention, comparison to a suboptimal control group, and lack of documentation of treatment integrity and how outcomes were assessed by informal procedures55) and a descriptive follow-up study of a small subset (8%) of the original group of patients.59  RDI focuses on activities that elicit interactive behaviors with the goal of engaging the child in a social relationship so that he or she discovers the value of positive interpersonal activity and becomes more motivated to learn the skills necessary to sustain these relationships.56 Some reviewers have praised the face validity of this model, which targets the core impairment in social reciprocity.  However, the evidence of efficacy of RDI is anecdotal; published empirical scientific research is lacking at this time. One study reported beneficial effects of RT on young children with ASDs or other developmental disabilities .58 Parents were taught to use RT strategies to encourage their children to acquire and use pivotal developmental behaviors (attention, persistence, interest, initiation, cooperation, joint attention, and affect). Children in both groups improved significantly on nonstandardized play-based measures of cognition and communication and standardized parent ratings of socioemotional functioning.  Although a control group was lacking and the potential role of concurrent educational services was unclear, the improvements were beyond what the authors expected from maturational factors alone .58 The AAP Report continues with an evaluation of other interventions for which there is some evidence of efficacy as autism interventions but only ABA intervention boasts a lengthy history as an evidence based effective intervention for autism: All treatments, including educational interventions, should be based on sound theoretical constructs, rigorous methodologies, and empirical studies of efficacy.15  Proponents of behavior analytic approaches have been the most active in using scientific methods to evaluate their work, and most studies of comprehensive treatment programs that meet minimal scientific standards involve treatment of preschoolers using behavioral approaches. 16,38 However, there is still a need for additional research, including large controlled studies with randomization and assessment of treatment fidelity.  Empirical scientific support for developmental models and other interventions is more limited, and well-controlled systematic studies of efficacy are needed. The professional reviews of autism interventions indicate that only behavioral based approaches to autism intervention have a substantial empirical or evidence based of support for their efficacy.  Of the behavioral interventions ABA is by far the most studied, subjected to rigorous study providing evidence of efficacy. The developmental and social categories of intervention listed on the AutismPro website do not enjoy  anywhere near the same evidence basis for claims of efficacy in treating autism. As said in the AAP Report: All treatments, including educational interventions, should be based on sound theoretical constructs, rigorous methodologies, and empirical studies of efficacy.15 Proponents of behavior analytic approaches have been the most active in using scientific methods to evaluate their work, and most studies of comprehensive treatment programs that meet minimal scientific standards involve treatment of preschoolers using behavioral approaches.16,38 However, there is still a need for additional research, including large controlled studies with randomization and assessment of treatment fidelity. Empirical scientific support for developmental models and other interventions is more limited, and well-controlled systematic studies of efficacy are needed. AutismPro Is an Eclectic Intervention Tool AutismPro does not actually appear to offer a specific evidence based intervention.  Although it references ABA (usually as being ABA \"based\") in some of its press releases and on its web site it does not appear that a straightforward ABA intervention is offered.  As VECInc states on its web site in  You Asked About AutismPro  AutismPro borrows elements from various intervention methods, which methods themselves have stronger or weaker evidence  bases in support of their efficacy.  By taking elements of these programs and combining them in a new eclectic mix VECInc. is essentially creating a new intervention altogether; one with no evidentiary basis for its efficacy. Does AutismPro incorporate such therapeutic teaching methods as Applied Behavior Analysis and DIR/Floortime? Somewhat. AutismPro integrates the fundamental components behind the continuum of  well-researched behavioral, developmental, and social methods for teaching a child with autism  and organizes them into clear choices, recommendations and training within the Strategy Plan section of the program. Does AutismPro incorporate such strategies as TEACCH, PECS, and Social Stories? Somewhat.  AutismPro integrates the fundamental principles behind dozens of well-researched strategies  for adapting the environment or activity for a child with autism, and organizes them into clear choices, recommendations and training within the Support Plan section of the program. How does AutismPro help me choose a method of instruction? AutismPro saves you time and effort by organizing the confusing and intimidating range of commonly accepted educational therapy methods in autism into a series of educated and supported choices. You choose the  philosophical approach  (behavioral, social and developmental) with which you feel most comfortable, and you’re free to make modifications to suit your child’s needs. Does AutismPro introduce new methods for autism therapy? No.  The methods in AutismPro are a comprehensive integration of strategies from commonly accepted educational therapy options in autism,  delivered on a new platform and organized according to a new cohesive conceptual framework. With AutismPro you get practical descriptions rather than a confusing list of strategy names, allowing you to more easily compare choices and make decisions.   Eclectic is one of those buzz words like community, inclusion, natural etc. which imply that the objects they describe are inherently good in some undefined way.  Studies of eclectic approaches to educating autistic children do not support that belief.  As stated in the AAP Report: Most educational programs available to young children with ASDs are based in their communities, and often, an \"eclectic\" treatment approach is used, which draws on a combination of methods including applied behavior analytic methods such as DTT; structured teaching procedures; speech-language therapy, with or without picture communication or related augmentative or alternative communication strategies; SI therapy; and typical preschool activities. Three studies that compared intensive ABA programs (25–40 hours/week) to equally intensive eclectic approaches have suggested that ABA programs were significantly more effective.31,32,34 Another study that involved children with ASDs and global developmental delay/mental retardation retrospectively compared a less intensive ABA program (mean: 12 hours) to a comparably intensive eclectic approach and found statistically significant but clinically modest outcomes that favored those in the ABA group.33 Although the groups of children were similar on key dependent measures before treatment began, these studies were limited because of parent-determined rather than random assignment to treatment group. The Medium is the Message AutismPro is an eclectic autism intervention because it selects principles and elements of various interventions.  And those interventions themselves enjoy varying degrees of evidence based supports.  As a new eclectic mix it is impossible to say that AutismPro is itself an \"evidence based\" intervention tool.  The use of the internet also raise questions about the extent to which AutismPro can accurately be described as \"evidence based\".  Autism is a neurological disorder which often presents serious environmental issues for autistic children.  A specific location, even if identical in all obvious aspects to another location, may be problematic for an autistic child. Slight environmental changes may have dramatic effects on an autistic child not always obvious to someone else. Autism is not a motor vehicle registry or corporate affairs data bank both of which lend themselves readily to two way internet based communication of significant information. Autism is a very \"environment sensitive\" condition.  The further removed in place and time that persons, whether actual advisors, or program writers, are from the specific environment involved, the less likely they will be able to offer reliable solutions to autism challenges.  Delivery of autism interventions by internet is something in itself which is radically new.  To suggest that an internet based intervention service which is promoted as revolutionary is also evidence based is illogical, inconsistent and inaccurate. autism

According to Canada's eminent autism advocates, anyone who criticizes ABA-based autism interventions is, to put it more politely than they do, ignorant, misguided and reprehensible (you can see this on their flagship website, which I respond to  here ; see also  here ). It looks like I'm going to overlook this forcefully-promoted pillar of autism advocacy--that ABA is above science, ethics, and scrutiny--again. Harold Doherty, an influential and powerful Canadian autism advocate, has helpfully supplied what he sees as definitive evidence that  ABA-based interventions are \"Most Effective In Educating Autistic Children\" . This is interesting, because Mr Doherty also supports the view that ABA-based autism interventions are not education at all, but are \"medically necessary\" treatment. In fact, right now, we have one set of autism advocates heavily lobbying Parliamentarians (Senators and MPs) to alter the law and mandate ABA-based autism interventions as \"medically necessary\" for all autistics in Canada. And we have another set of autism advocates going to the Supreme Court of Canada, just down the street, to deny that ABA-based autism interventions are medical treatment or \"medically necessary\" treatment or medical in any way at all.  Those are the autism advocates who support the Wynberg trial decision.   But back to Mr Doherty's science.  Mr Doherty supplies three sources to support the effectiveness of ABA as education for autistic children. One is the MADSEC report. One is a list of papers or reports, and short descriptions of same, provided on Dr Lovaas' website (the Lovaas Institute, you can see this page  here ; Mr Doherty has copied parts of this into his post). The last is the Auton trial decision. The MADSEC report bases its conclusions on a total of three ABA controlled trials, Lovaas (1987; and follow-up, McEachin et al., 1993), Birnbrauer and Leach (1993), and Sheinkopf and Siegel (1998). The first two are prospective, while the last is retrospective. Lovaas (1987) and follow-up are dependent on the use of aversives, and therefore represent a treatment which is no longer acceptable. Birnbrauer and Leach have presented a 10-year follow-up, showing that the few children who did well in their study (four of them, none of whom achieved \"normal functioning\") did not maintain these gains on follow-up (Birnbrauer and Leach, 2006). Sheinkopf and Siegel (1998), the retrospective study, features no autistics who achieved \"normal functioning\", and also shows no correlation between intensity of treatment and outcome measures. Lovaas (2002) forcefully criticizes this study, and does not accept its validity. Then there is the list from Dr Lovaas' website, or the parts of it reproduced by Mr Doherty on his blog. First there is this claim, Between 1985 and 2005, there were over 500 articles published concerning Applied Behavior Analysis and autism. I don't dispute this at all. I've read quite a few of these articles. Dr Lovaas does not make any claims as to what these articles have found or their quality. Arguing that quantity of articles is evidence of treatment effectiveness is akin to arguing that the ToM, EF, and/or WCC accounts of autism must be correct because there are hundreds of articles about these theories, or that social skills training must be effective because there is an impressive number of articles about this kind of intervention. Here's the rest of the list Mr Doherty provides from Dr Lovaas' website: Lovaas (1987):  In multiple post-1987 papers (e.g., Smith & Lovaas, 1998), and in the book Dr Lovaas recommends (Lovaas, 2002), Lovaas and colleagues have underlined the problem of the 10 non-normal-functioning children profiting little from ABA. E.g., their IQs did not increase at all, even though some stayed in their ABA programs for 10 years. Lovaas (2002) has stated that these children must stay in ABA programs for life. There is also the essential role of physical punishment (contingent aversives) in this study, which you can read about  here, complete with quotes from Lovaas (1987).  A Rett's girl was in Control Group 1, which was not reported until Boyd (1998). The savant abilities of at least one of the experimental group children were extinguished (Epstein et al., 1985; I wrote about this  here ). Also of interest to Mr Doherty (who has weighed in about high and low functioning in autism, as well as about savant syndrome), five of the autistic children in Control Group 1 (a group which had poor outcomes) were high-functioning. Mr Doherty is a leading autism advocate, so I will assume he knows where that fact is reported.  McEachin, Smith & Lovaas (1993):  the follow-up into school ages of Lovaas (1987): See above. One of the \"normal functioning\" children loses this status. Jacobson et al. (1998):  This paper lacks a factual foundation, because in 46 years of behaviour analytic research in autism, there is no peer-reviewed paper which reports data about the adult outcomes of children who received 3 years of ABA-based intervention between the ages of 2-6. There is no controlled trial of a non-aversive early ABA/IBI that has a published follow-up into school ages (the one presented follow-up presented a failure; Birnbrauer & Leach, 2006). Also, Canada's autism advocates have rejected this level of service (3 years of ABA) as unacceptable, and Dr Lovaas claims that children who do not achieve \"normal functioning\" by age 7 must stay in ABA programs for their entire lives (Lovaas, 2002).   The NYSDOH report:  This report found only four studies (of the 232 looked at) of ABA-based early intensive interventions that met their standards: Lovaas (1987) together with McEachin et al. (1993); Birnbrauer and Leach (1993); Smith et al. (1997); and Sheinkopf and Siegel (1998). All these papers have been described above except Smith et al. (1997), a retrospective study (not a true experimental design) showing very limited results (increase in IQ of 8 points, almost half of which is accounted for by one participant; no \"normal functioning\").  The Surgeon General's report:  The only ABA-based study cited is Lovaas (1987) together with McEachin et al. (1993).  Eikeseth et al. (2002):  A ME-Book (Lovaas, 1981) based ABA program is compared to a an unknown intensity of ABA plus a lot of contradictory approaches (this is called \"eclectic\" treatment). The groups are unmatched, and finish with no significant differences, even though the experimental group had greater gains. The study is for one year only. None of the children achieve \"normal functioning\". Howard et al. (2005):  This is also a one-year study that compares an ABA-based intensive intervention (for which there is no manual), to \"eclectic\" treatment (ABA of unknown quantity or quality, plus contradictory approaches), as well as to generic segregated special education. The groups aren't matched. None of the children achieve \"normal functioning\". The reported \"effectiveness\" of the ABA-based treatment does not take into account the total failure of two children, who could not continue in ABA, and whose data were discarded. Sallows & Graupner (2005):  The 48% rate of \"rapid learners\" can only be achieved by combining the control group with the experimental group, producing an uncontrolled trial. The control group performed better than the experimental group. This was not a feature of Lovaas (1987). This paper shows that neither intensity nor quality of ABA-based interventions is relevant to outcomes. Cohen et al. (2006, see below) point out that this study does not have a comparison group. Also, Sallows & Graupner (2005) report using a wide variety of approaches apart from Lovaas ABA, including non-behaviour analytic approaches. And finally,  Cohen et al. (2006):  The limited number of significant differences between outcome measures in the unmatched groups vanishes when non-matched variables are accounted for, with the one exception of classroom placement. Kasari (2006) has pointed out that classroom placement is a measure of parent pressure, rather than of child achievement. The control condition is segregated special education, of less intensity (less hrs/wk) than the ABA treatment. Mr Doherty's last source is the Auton trial judge, and the Auton trial decision. This is his evidence that randomized assignment, a standard used to protect and benefit all non-autistics, should not apply to autistics. Mr Doherty further adds that there are ethical implications to randomized assignment. This is on the assumption that Lovaas-type ABA is known to be effective and therefore, you cannot deprive any autistics of this treatment. So let's sum up Mr Doherty's science. The evidence from the MADSEC report (which did not have to pass peer review) amounts to very little in the absence of an aversive-based study. Only Sheinkopf & Siegel (1998) is left, a retrospective study that Lovaas (2002) strongly objects to. Mr Doherty may be arguing that autistics don't need controlled trials either.  The list of studies and reports from Dr Lovaas' site is selective, and the selected studies are selectively reported. Dr Lovaas does not include all the ABA controlled trials, and he includes only one uncontrolled trial. Sheer number of studies (without reference to their quality, content, relevance, etc.) is not evidence of effectiveness. Using the website of an organization which provides a particular treatment as evidence for the effectiveness of that treatment represents the kind of low standards that autism advocates demand for autistics. Finally, Mr Doherty uses the Auton trial decision to deny the importance of randomization. This assumes that this decision is scientifically accurate, and is based on peer-reviewed science. That is demonstrably not the case (e.g., see the description of the 1 in 64 study, which was not even in evidence). However, let's accept this for now and look at the evidence in Auton. There were only two controlled trials of ABA-based interventions in the evidence in Auton (in fact, these were the only primary sources reporting data about ABA-based interventions). These would necessarily be the studies being referred to by the trial judge re the importance of randomized assignment. One of them (Lovaas, 1987, and follow-up) is dependent on aversives, and represents a treatment that is currently unacceptable. The other (Smith et al., 1997) is not a true experimental design. It is retrospective, and, as reported above, has weak results which did not support the claims made by the Auton parents. These two studies are insufficient to argue that failing to enroll all autistics in non-aversive ABA programs (on the grounds that their effectiveness has been proven) is unethical.  ABA/IBI does have one existing randomized controlled trial (Smith, Groen & Wynn, 2000, 2001). This is left off Dr Lovaas' page, even though it was conducted at UCLA by behaviour analysts he trained and oversaw, and is of greater importance than Lovaas (1987). Smith, Groen & Wynn (2000, 2001) represents both the scientifc standards that would apply to Mr Doherty and all non-autistics (a randomized controlled trial), and the outcome of a treatment that is not, unlike the treatment reported in Lovaas (1987), dependent on contingent aversives.  A description and criticism of Smith, Groen & Wynn (also, accurate information about the NYSDOH report, and about the importance of randomized assignment) can be found  here . I'll add that the reported increase in IQ is confined to the PDD-NOS group. Also, there is a second erratum (Dr Gernsbacher describes one of the published errata, which eliminates the reported result in language) published by the authors to correct another important error in the text (re educational placement). There is also the Canadian study, Eaves and Ho (2004), which shows no effect of kind or amount of any currently marketed autism treatment in the \"critical\" 2-5 yr range. About half the children in this study were in ABA programs, and their outcomes did not differ from the children who were not in ABA programs. I can also suggest comparing the standards, quality, etc., of the reports and sources favoured by Mr Doherty (MADSEC report, Dr Lovaas' website, the Auton trial decision) with the sources which have concluded that when it comes to autism interventions, we do not have sufficient information to decide what is effective for all autistic individuals (e.g., NRC, 2001; Volkmar et al., 2004). The NRC also alluded to the absence of basic ethical considerations in the entire body of autism intervention research. I agree with Mr Doherty that there has been and no doubt will continue to be a lot of incompetent, non-valid and self-interested criticism of ABA-based interventions, including from behaviour analysts. Indeed, this poverty of criticism is why I wrote  The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists , almost three years ago, and also in part why I wrote a series here about aversives. Putting sourced and referenced accurate information on the record is important, so that sweeping statements (e.g., about criticisms of ABA) by influential and powerful leaders like Mr Doherty can be verified against the public record. The record shows that I've been as harsh a critic of incompetent criticisms of ABA-based interventions as any behaviour analyst. This does not mean that accurate criticism of these interventions is non-existent, unnecessary, reprehensible, or impossible. There is also the problem of ethics, a more important issue than the \"effectiveness\" issue, which is written about above. It is more important because an apparently effective treatment may be unethical. This has been shown in the area of ABA-based interventions, by the strong and decisive ethical objections, including from behaviour analysts, to Dr Lovaas' other NIH-funded early ABA/IBI--which was also demanded by parents and said to be the only effective treatment for the targeted pathology. My attempt to  \"point out that ethical standards which have improved the circumstances of all other persons would equally benefit autistics, and would also improve the state of the science\" , has been met with extreme opposition (including defamation) by autism advocates.  The above does not represent anything more than a brief response to some aspects of Mr Doherty's post. I haven't touched on major issues in the behaviour analytic literature, like diagnostic standards, accounting (or not) for medication, etc. I've only provided tiny, superficial descriptions of studies and reports, though what I wrote can be verified, and they're all studies and reports that I know well (I don't know exactly which 500 studies Dr Lovaas is referring to, but I've probably read a lot of them). I haven't gone into the existence of a successful controlled trial of a non-ABA-based intervention, reported in a peer-reviewed journal. Etc. And I've barely mentioned ethical consideration, which is paramount. I've failed to suggest that Mr Doherty provide sources for the kinds of criticism he considers should not be made. I've forgotten to point out the dramatic contrast between the huge amount of existing autism research and the concurrent poverty of knowledge about autism and about how to help autistic people--a contrast which might have something to do with the effectiveness of autism advocacy. And later, I'll try to post an outline of some of the major bases on which ABA-based interventions can and should be criticized.  The onus is on autism advocates like Mr Doherty to show how discarding basic scientific and ethical standards, the standards which protect and benefit themselves, helps autistics. My own suggestion is that  lousy scientific and ethical standards  are  bad for everyone , including those who, like autism advocates, demand that they be imposed on autistics. (If this post looks like it was written in pieces by a person busy doing other things, that's because it was; some of the information above has already been provided on this blog, see e.g.,  here  and  here  , as well as on my website, but autism advocacy involves repeating the same things over and over, which means responding can be tedious).

RDI Is NOT an Evidence Based Intervention
" "
In New Brunswick several  years ago there was little in the way of autism specific services.  An interdepartmental committee comprised of representatives of the Departments of Family and  Community Services (Now called Social Development), Education and Health, the \"IDC\", some autism \"community\" representatives and some professionals met for  18 months before issuing a report which stated that obvious fact.  The failure of the IDC Committee, publicly at least, to discuss the need for autism treatments and to identify treatments that should be offered to autistic children in New Brunswick, is what prompted me to become publicly involved in autism advocacy in New Brunswick.   One positive development  that  came out of the IDC review though  was a commitment by the New Brunswick government to evidence based treatments. That commitment to evidence based interventions is of critical importance for New Brunswick's  autistic children and youth  and  has been largely honored since then by the Province of New Brunswick.   There is, however, despite the existence of a high quality autism intervention training program at UNB, persistent pressure from some pockets, particularly in the Saint John and St. Andrews areas, to employ non-evidence based interventions with autistic pre-schoolers and students.  In Saint John in particular,  the \"anything but ABA\" sentiments of some influential people in the autism \"community\" have resulted in negative and inaccurate perceptions of ABA amongst some parents busy with the demands of child raising,  dealing with their children's autism and, like all of us, struggling to get by.  At the same time the \"anything but ABA\" group tends to promote any intervention with a nice sounding name that looks fun on its face, anything as long as it is not ABA. The intervention which is currently in vogue amongst New Brunswick's \"anything but ABA\" lobby is RDI.  RDI sounds so  nice - Relationship Development Intervention.    After all how can one possibly be against \"Relationship Development\"?    And it is an \"Intervention\"!   It sounds so professional it must be evidence based right?   Well no, not really. One of the leading reviews of the evidence basis of the effectiveness of autism interventions is the  MADSEC Autism Task Force Report  which reviewed the professional literature in 1999-2000 and concluded at pages 60-61: Based upon a thorough examination of numerous methodologies considered as interventions for children with autism, the MADSEC Autism Task Force has characterized the interventions reviewed as follows: •  Substantiated as effective, based upon the scope and quality of research: Applied behavior analysis.  In addition, applied behavior analysis’ evaluative procedures are  effective not only with behaviorally-based interventions, but also for the systematic evaluation of the efficacy of any intervention intended to affect individual learning and behavior. ABA’s emphasis on functional assessment and positive behavioral support will help meet heightened standards of IDEA ‘97. Its emphasis on measurable goals and reliable data collection will substantiate the child’s progress in the event of due process. •  Shows promise,   but is  not yet objectively substantiated as effective  for individuals  with autism using controlled studies and subject to the rigors of good science: Auditory Integration Training, The Miller Method, Sensory Integration, and TEACCH. •  Repeatedly subjected to the rigors of science, which leads numerous researchers to  conclude the intervention is  not effective, may be harmful, or may lead to unintended  consequences: Facilitated Communication. • Not scientifically evaluated: Greenspan’s DIR/”Floor Time,” Son-Rise. There is no mention of RDI in the 1999-2000 MADSEC review but RDI has emerged more prominently since then in autism workshops offered in New Brunswick and elsewhere and there has been another important and more recent review of the scientific studies of the effectiveness of autism interventions -  the American Academy of Pediatrics report   Management of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders   published online October 29, 2007.   The AAP concluded, at page 1165m  with respect to the evidence basis of RDI that: RDI focuses on activities that elicit interactive behaviors with the goal of engaging the child in a social relationship so that he or she discovers the value of positive interpersonal activity and becomes more motivated to learn the skills necessary to sustain these relationships.56 Some reviewers have praised the face validity of this model, which targets the core impairment in social reciprocity.  However, the evidence of efficacy of RDI is anecdotal; published empirical scientific research is lacking at this time. (Bold highlighting added for emphasis -HLD) If a reader wants to understand how weak the evidence in support of RDI effectiveness is, as summarized by the AAP above, they can compare it to the AAP summary, at page 1164,  of the evidence in support of effectiveness of ABA: The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been well documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject methodology21,25,27,28 and in controlled studies of comprehensive early intensive behavioral intervention programs in university and community settings.29–40 Children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior, and their outcomes have been significantly better than those of children in control groups.31–40 When the New Brunswick government committed to evidence based approaches to treating and educating autistic children it adopted a very sound policy which has helped many autistic children. Even in Saint John where the \"anything but ABA\" sentiment has been strongest, autistic children receive evidence based  intervention at the Stepping Stones autism agency.  But why is it important to provide evidence based interventions? In  Children with autism deserve evidence-based intervention ,  The evidence for behavioural therapy ,    MJA 2003; 178 (9): 424-425, Jennifer J Couper and Amanda J Sampson,   reviewed some of the evidence in support of the efficacy of behavioral interventions for autism.  The authors stressed the importance of an evidence based approach to autism interventions: While ineffective therapies may be harmless, they waste parents' money and the child's valuable therapy time. Furthermore, the delay in implementing effective treatment may compromise the child's outcome.  The choice of autism interventions offered by New Brunswick autism agencies should be determined by the evidence basis in support of their effectiveness.  Failure to provide evidence based effective autism interventions may compromise the outcome for children with autism disorders in New Brunswick. Autistic children deserve evidence based intervention. At this time RDI does not meet that standard.   autism

Autism Recovery: More Evidence of ABA Effectiveness
" "
 It has been a very bad week for the anti-ABA, anti-autism treatment crowd. Laurent Mottron, Morton Ann Gernsbacher and Michelle Dawson, amongst others,  are probably not happy with the latest autism research news out of Chicago where a study was presented at an autism conference by University of Connecticut psychology professor Deborah Fein showing recovery of between 10 and 20% of subjects originally diagnosed as autistic who were later determined to have lost the autism diagnosis after years of intensive applied behavioral analysis. The recovery story itself is not knew.  The highly respected Dr. Doreen Granpeesheh and other researchers and clinical psychologists, who actually work with autistic children,  have presented stories of autistic children who have recovered after years of  ABA treatment.  What is most significant in this instance is the rigour of the analysis which resulted in the initial autism diagnosis and the thorough documentation involved in the study as reported in the  Washington Post :  Autism researcher Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer of the advocacy group Autism Speaks, called Fein's research a breakthrough.    \"Even though a number of us out in the clinical field have seen kids who appear to recover,\" it has never been documented as thoroughly as Fein's work, Dawson said.  Previous studies have suggested between 3 percent and 25 percent of autistic kids recover. Fein says her studies have shown the range is 10 percent to 20 percent.    But even after lots of therapy _ often carefully designed educational and social activities with rewards _ most autistic children remain autistic.     Recovery is \"not a realistic expectation for the majority of kids,\" but parents should know it can happen, Fein said.  Fein is being responsible in cautioning that recovery will not happen for most children with autism who receive ABA.  But that does not mean that it is an all or nothing proposition either.  Gains in reducing problem behaviors as in self injurious behavior and aggression, and skill acquisition with ABA use are well documented as noted in the  American Academy of Pediatrics Management of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders report (2007) : The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been well documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject methodology21,25,27,28 and in controlled studies of comprehensive early intensive behavioral intervention programs in university and community settings.29–40 Children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior, and their outcomes have been significantly better than those of children in control groups.31–4 ABA for autism.   The evidence of ABA effectiveness in treating autism has grown over the past decade despite the ideological obstinacy of those who condemn ABA.  This week that evidence grew yet again.  autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

The ABA non-randomized controlled trial  presented by Patricia Howlin at the International Meeting for Autism Research this year   has recently been made available online. You can find the abstract of this in press paper  here   [edit: If you follow the link, you'll see that this paper has now been published]: Magiati, I., Charman, T., & Howlin, P. (in press). A two-year prospective follow-up study of community-based early intensive behavioural intervention and specialist nursery provision for children with autism spectrum disorders.  Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.   As I wrote earlier , Dr Howlin's study is a prospective, community-based study comparing the outcomes of 28 autistic children receiving home-based intensive ABA-based interventions (the ABA group) with a control group of 16 autistic children receiving \"autism specific nursery provision\" (the nursery group). The interventions are described as being \"typical\" of ABA and nursery services available in the UK. The children were between 23 and 54 months and had a very wide range of IQs (16 to 138) at intake. They were followed up after ~26 months.  The ABA group received intensive 1:1 Lovaas-type ABA, with two children receiving additional Verbal Behaviour services. For 20 ABA group children, ABA services were provided by \"recognised ABA organisations in the UK, Norway or USA\", while the remaining 8 children had independent providers. The nursery group was distributed across 10 different schools. They received what would be called \"eclectic\" intervention, where the \"most common named practices\" included TEACCH, PECS (an ABA-based approach), Makaton, and SPELL (from a 2001 guide published by the UK National Autistic Society), as well as \"other developmental and behavioural teaching methods\".  And--as reported in the abstract--after a bit more than 2 years, there were no significant differences to report between the ABA and nursery groups in a multitude of outcome measures. On only one measure was a difference approaching significance found in favour of the ABA group (Vineland Daily Living Skills, where  p =.06). In contrast, there were major individual differences among the children in progress made, regardless of which group the children were in.  As happens in non-randomized controlled trials, the two groups were not matched on many variables at intake. The authors accounted for only one of these unmatched variables--a significant difference in mean intake IQ which favoured the ABA group (83 for the ABA group; 65 for the nursery group). Other significant differences at intake (e.g., Vineland socialization, Vineland composite, parental education) favoured the ABA group and were not accounted for, while other unaccounted for differences favouring the ABA group were just short of being significant (e.g., the ABA group was younger at intake). None of the between-group differences at intake favoured the nursery group.  The authors also made no attempt to account for gender. The nursery group had a higher percentage (33%) of females than the ABA group (4%). In my view (and apparently, in the authors' view), this isn't a major issue and if anything--according to the lore that autistic females are at a disadvantage--this difference would again favour the ABA group. The ABA group also had the advantage of receiving a significantly more intensive intervention than the nursery group, both at the outset of treatment and at follow-up, with the ABA group at ~33hrs/wk (range 18-40) and the nursery group at ~26hrs/wk (range 15-30). Within each group, intensity of intervention did not change from the outset to follow-up. That is, the children's need for services did not decrease over the course of about two years. The nursery group received little in the way of 1:1 intervention (6hrs/wk average, compared to the ABA group, where the full ~33hrs/wk  was 1:1). Because they received a more intensive intervention, the ABA group also received a significantly higher total number of intervention hours than did the nursery group--an average of 3415 hours versus 2266 hours per child. This is a difference of 1149 hours favouring the ABA group.  Using the average intensity of intervention for the ABA group, the ABA group received an equivalent of 35 weeks more in the way of intervention time than the nursery group children. Using the average intensity of intervention received by the nursery group, the nursery group received an equivalent of 44 weeks less in the way of intervention time than the ABA group children. That is, for the amount of intervention to be equivalent in both groups, the nursery group children would have had to receive an additional 44 weeks of intervention (at their average intensity of intervention). On the other hand, this study found no relationship whatsoever between intensity of intervention and any outcome measure. This is keeping in mind that the range of intensity in the ABA group was 18-40hrs/wk. In my  IMFAR poster this year , I mentioned the failure of the ABA literature to relate higher intensity of ABA-based interventions with better outcomes, and in Dr Howlin's study, that failure continues. Another factor that had no effect on outcomes was age at intake. Whether the children were younger or older at intake, across the range from 23 to 54 months, made no difference to how well they did. The popular if not ubiquitous contention that, when it comes to autism interventions, \"earlier is better\" has failed--again--to be supported by evidence from a controlled trial (for a previous failure, right up to intake at age 7, see Eikeseth et al., 2002, 2007).  And regardless of the ABA group starting with an average IQ well within the \"high-functioning\" range (indeed, the intake IQ here for the ABA group is the same as the  follow-up  IQ in Lovaas, 1987), after ~2 years of intensive ABA, all children in this group were still receiving ABA services and none was in a mainstream school without 1:1 assistance. This is also regardless that almost one-third of the ABA group did not have the specific diagnosis of autism at intake, instead being assigned a subthreshold \"ASD\" diagnosis. On average, neither group did well. They both made progress in age-equivalent scores but, as the abstract reports, standard scores changed little. Individuals either did well or did poorly, and this was unrelated to which kind of intervention they received, the intensity of intervention, or the age at which intervention began. This is similar to what was found in a recent Canadian observational study (Eaves & Ho, 2004).  Dr Howlin's study, like all studies, has weaknesses and limitations (and of course I want a lot more information about practically everything), some of which are addressed by the authors. I find it ironic that the authors argue for autism-specialized services by citing Cohen et al. (2006). While it is difficult to compare across studies, it could be argued that the control group in Cohen et al. (2006), which received completely inadequate services that no one should recommend (generic segregated special education of low intensity), fared better by the usual standards than  both  groups--the ABA group and the nursery group--receiving autism-specialized services in Dr Howlin's study. Dr Howlin and colleagues also fail to point out that when unmatched intake variables are accounted for in Cohen et al. (2006), the few significant differences between groups (ABA vs generic segregated special education) in all but one outcome measure (classroom placement) disappear.  Dr Howlin and colleagues conclude that: Our data support the growing consensus that no one intervention for children with ASD is universally superior to all others ( NIASA, 2003 ).  My own conclusion is one  I've arrived at before : after more than 60 years of autism research, encompassing the colossal existing autism intervention literature, researchers still cannot scientifically claim to know how to help autistic individuals (Volkmar et al., 2004). The best adult outcomes reported in the autism literature continue to belong to individuals who grew up before the current era of early interventions and who as children met the narrowest, strictest autism diagnostic criteria ever devised (Dawson et al., in press).  I'm prepared to agree with Dr Howlin that autism-specific services are important. But even the evidence Dr Howlin and colleagues drum up in support of these services glaringly reveals how poorly autism research has served the interests of autistics. Even if you leave out ethical concerns that would be paramount with any non-autistic population, the major currently-popularized and -marketed autism educational interventions (as opposed to non-popularized non-marketed science-based approaches; see Aldred et al., 2004; Gernsbacher, 2006) leave little to choose from. Autistics deserve a whole lot better.  References: Aldred, C., Green, J., & Adams, C. (2004).

AAP's \"Other Report\" Endorses ABA as Autism Treatment
" "
Most of the autism news and blog coverage dealt with the American Academy of Pediatrics report calling for early autism screening for all children, including two screenings before age 2.  Good advice.  The AAP also issues a second report. However, the AAP's other report went virtually unmentioned amongst news sources, autism bloggers and neurodiversity bloggers. The second AAP report,   Management of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders ,  reviewed autism interventions and had this to say about ABA treatment for autism  (Bold Text Highlighting added for emphasis - HLD) :    Applied Behavior Analysis  Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the process of applying interventions   that are based on the principles of learning derived from experimental   psychology research to systematically change behavior and to   demonstrate that the interventions used are responsible for   the observable improvement in behavior. ABA methods are used   to increase and maintain desirable adaptive behaviors, reduce   interfering maladaptive behaviors or narrow the conditions under   which they occur, teach new skills, and generalize behaviors   to new environments or situations. ABA focuses on the reliable   measurement and objective evaluation of observable behavior   within relevant settings including the home, school, and community.   The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been   well documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject   methodology 21 , 25 , 27 , 28   and in controlled studies of comprehensive   early intensive behavioral intervention programs in university   and community settings . 29 – 40   Children who receive early   intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial,   sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive   behavior as well as some measures of social behavior, and their   outcomes have been significantly better than those of children   in control groups . 31 – 40     Highly structured comprehensive early intervention programs   for children with ASDs, such as the Young Autism Project developed   by Lovaas 35 , 41  at the University of California Los Angeles,   rely heavily on discrete trial training (DTT) methodology, but   this is only one of many techniques used within the realm of   ABA. DTT methods are useful in establishing learning readiness   by teaching foundation skills such as attention, compliance,   imitation, and discrimination learning, as well as a variety   of other skills. However, DTT has been criticized because of   problems with generalization of learned behaviors to spontaneous   use in natural environments and because the highly structured   teaching environment is not representative of natural adult-child   interactions. Traditional ABA techniques have been modified   to address these issues. Naturalistic behavioral interventions,   such as incidental teaching and natural language paradigm/pivotal   response training, may enhance generalization of skills. 13     Functional behavior analysis, or functional assessment, is an   important aspect of behaviorally based treatment of unwanted   behaviors. Most problem behaviors serve an adaptive function   of some type and are reinforced by their consequences, such   as attainment of (1) adult attention, (2) a desired object,   activity, or sensation, or (3) escape from an undesired situation   or demand. Functional assessment is a rigorous, empirically   based method of gathering information that can be used to maximize   the effectiveness and efficiency of behavioral support interventions. 42   It includes formulating a clear description of the problem behavior   (including frequency and intensity); identifying the antecedents,   consequences, and other environmental factors that maintain   the behavior; developing hypotheses that specify the motivating   function of the behavior; and collecting direct observational   data to test the hypothesis. Functional analysis also is useful   in identifying antecedents and consequences that are associated   with increased frequency of desirable behaviors so that they   can be used to evoke new adaptive behaviors.

 Today I left my worries behind.  I am back home in sunny southern California visiting my family and friends -sans children.  I had the best massage of my entire life (thank you Ma Lee at Spa Pura) followed by lunch with one of my dear friends.  It was so nice and my phone didn't ring one time.  Here's to the good life! Cheers! 
 
 
 
 
 Me and my dear friend R- 
 Once upon a time back in our 20's, we were roommates / party girls...hitting all of the local L.A. nightclubs.  Now we are PTA, Girl-scout leading, carpool driving, school volunteering, putting-our- children-first,  moms. 
 
For today...we were carefree! Thank you Ms. R- I love you today and always. 
 
BTW...this restaurant La Grande Orange in Pasadena, CA -best Red Velvet cake and Key Lime pie EVER!!!

 Wishing my dearest  Drama Mama  a very happy, happy birthday! 
 I tried to get the video of your recent party to add here but…funny…it was missing!   I hope you enjoy this instead.  (It’s “family friendly” but very funny!)

Conor Is 15 Today!!

Conor is 15 today and it is all about Conor -  unlike any other day of the year ;-)  Our buddy has some fun on his Southpaw Enterprises therapy ball and, of yeah,   has a bit of cake.  The Little Einsteins are a favorite of Conor's and made it to the birthday cake.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOMMY!!!
" "
 Happy happy birthday to the most awesomest Mommy that ever ever was, the coolest, most wonderful Grandma ever, and one of the most fantastic ladies you'll ever meet (and probably the nicest).  I love you, Mom. Thank you for being supportive, understanding, caring, and snuggly.  I love you 44.

I’ve received a few responses to the RDSP post I made last week and some planners wish to give some information. I hope to give everyone a fair say as I will be doing interviews for publication of financial planners on how to plan for yourself and your autistic child’s future.  Many thanks to David from RBC for writing this guest piece for this blog. If you have any questions, you can contact David:

 A written financial plan is a tool that will help you reach your personal financial goals more effectively. Here is a some info on some things single moms and dads of special needs kids should consider. This is a start. – RDSP 
– Henson Trusts 
– Tax Planning for Persons with Disabilities 
– Financial Planning Worksheet 
– list of two estate planning lawyers that have worked with Henson Trusts I can help you if you provide the necessary information. It’s essential that you be as accurate as possible because your answers form the starting point for your plan. All information is confidential. Don’t think of this as “paperwork”. It’s about your future. By filling out this worksheet completely, you’ll give me what I need to make you feel secure and comfortable about your understanding of your investment, estate planning and insurance needs. Whether you’re planning for retirement, your children’s education, trying to reduce your taxes, or just looking for financial clarity, the process starts here because it will help you answer three key questions: 
 
•	Where am I now? 
•	Where do I want to be? 
•	How do I get there? Please be as thorough as possible. Don’t omit any information – it’s all important for helping you reach your personal financial goals. Fill the sheet for both you and your spouse. David has provided a sheet (which I’m sorry did not translate as a proper spreadsheet herein) that he would ask his clients to get them started. Maybe some of you might find this helpful or you can contact David yourself: Personal Marital status

Life insurance serves two purposes. First, it can replace the income of a spouse in the event of death. Second, it can offset estate taxes, which lets you transfer as much of your property as possible to your heirs – instead of the government. Essentially insurance keeps you on track for your financial plan. Consider what your family would face if you or your spouse died sudden: funeral expenses, your mortgage and day-to-day living expenses would all have to be covered. Immediate expenses  (there are other more complex calculations we can do, but for now let’s capture the basic information) Mortgage 
Emergency funds 
Funeral ($5,000 plus)

Walking: Autism Society Acceptance Walk
" "
 
 
 All of us at Joey's Stage Door Stars art show last year. 
 
 Today is the day!  
 
There had been hullabaloo about where to put your money to show support for autistic people and families, where the money goes to help people with autism. What can we do to increase support services, access to therapies, get people help they need. Well, here it is. 
 
The  Autism Society's  Intervention Assistance Fund provides mini-grants directly to families, so they can access the supports and therapies they need to help autistic people grow and become the independent, happy people they can be. This isn't just for kids, either: these people provide adult services, and make adult services available and affordable.  
 
In case you miss it from their website: 
 
 
 
 Intervention Assistance Fund Mini-grants 
ASNV’s Intervention Assistance Fund awards quarterly mini-grants to 
eligible adults with autism and families of those on the spectrum to 
help defray costs of therapies, medical procedures, training and other 
treatments.  Click here 
 to find eligibility requirements and application instructions.  ASNV 
has a designated subcommittee that evaluates the applications and 
administers the program.  You can donate directly to the  Intervention Assistance Fund  and 100% of your donation goes to support local families. 
Your donation goes to the fund, which then goes to the families and autistic adults who need support and services.They help cover families who otherwise can't get traditional services such as OT and speech therapies, but also help with \"uncovered\" services such as adult support, equine therapy, art therapy, safety equipment, behavioral therapies, assistive technology, summer camps, respite care, psychological evaluations, and even training workshops. THESE PEOPLE HELP.  
 
The Fredricksburg Walk raised $22,000 for the fund last year. Our team goal is a modest $500, but we know every dollar is a huge help to access therapies, training, and supports that directly help people with autism, and that would otherwise be beyond the reach of adults and families.

"20877" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/12/20/special-needs-trusts/" "Special Needs Trusts" "In the United States,  adults with disabilities can receive support through social security .  But, if you have over $2,000 in assets, you don’t qualify.  This leaves parents of disabled children in a bit of a quandary: how do you provide for your children after you are gone?   From Lawyer.com : In order to qualify for the Social Security Administration’s Supplemental Security Income Benefits, (“SSI”), a disabled adult can’t hold more than $2,000 in assets, excluding a car and a home. SSI benefits, which average about $400 per month, must be spent on food, clothing and shelter expenses. 
 Eligibility for SSI makes a disabled person eligible for food stamps and Medicaid, which pays medical expenses, nursing home care and mental health services. Medicaid eligibility also makes a disabled person eligible for many local community services, as well. 
 As these benefits add greatly to a disabled person’s ability to care for him or herself, you wouldn’t want to give your disabled child property that would disqualify him or her from receiving these benefits.  One way to plan for the future is with a “special needs trust” also known as a “supplemental needs trust”.  This is a trust fund to supply those needs beyond those which Social Security might provide.  One doesn’t have to put money into the trust right away, but can leave money to the trust on death.   The whole process of wills, trusts, supplemental needs trusts and so on can be pretty daunting, both legally and financially.  Getting a lawyer to set these up can cost a few thousand dollars.   It can be money well spent, and it can be more money than you might be able to afford right now.   One excellent source of do-it-yourself legal advice is Nolo press.  Nolo has a book on supplemental needs trusts:  Special Needs Trusts/Protect Your Child’s Financial Future .  I haven’t read this one yet, but I have found other books by Nolo to be well worth the money (this one is under $30).

 If you provide ongoing care for a disabled individual, then
you may need to be the one who applies for benefits on his or her behalf. There
are additionally some state and local programs that provide additional benefits
directly to full-time caregivers of the disabled, which means that you may also
be able to receive some financial support yourself for filling the role of
caregiver to another individual.  
 
 
 
 Situations
in which Caregivers May Need to Assist  
 
 Any condition that compromises the mental capacity of a
disabled individual may require a caregiver to step in to facilitate the
application process for Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits.  
 
 Parents of minor children with special needs or disabilities
must also apply on behalf of their kids.  
 
 If you provide care for a developmentally disabled adult or
adults with Alzheimer’s/Dementia, you may need to initiate and provide support
and guidance throughout the disability application process as well.  
 
 A caregiver may need to apply for disability on behalf of
his or her charge in many other instances too, including for coma patients and
for individuals that are in and out of consciousness, for example.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The
Application Process 
 
 When applying for benefits online, you have options
available to describe whom it is that the application is for and who is
completing the application. These options include: 
 
 ·        Filling
out an application for yourself 
 
 ·        Filling
out an application for someone else who is with you 
 
 ·        Filling
out an application for someone else who is not with you 
 
 
 
 You must indicate that you are completing the application on
behalf of someone else, and if that person is unable to comprehend the process
and sign the application, then there will be additional steps required for
applying for benefits on their behalf. Those details will be covered in the
article section, which follows, on the topic of seeking assistance from an
advocate or attorney. 
 
 You can also apply in-person, at your local SSA office on
behalf of the disabled person in your care. However, he or she will still need
to sign the application. Review the next section to know how to handle an
application for SSD benefits, if the person in your care is not mentally
competent.  
 
 
 
 Seeking
Assistance from an Advocate or Attorney 
 
 As the SSA requires the signature of the applicant on the
formal application for SSD benefits, you may need to seek additional legal
assistance in order to act on behalf of an applicant with compromised or
otherwise limited mental capacity.  
 
 In other words, if the person for whom you are applying for
benefits is unable to understand the SSD application process and is unable to
sign the application, then you will need to either: 
 
 ·        Have
the legally designated representative of the disabled individual sign on behalf
of the applicant and submit the associated documentation to the SSA to prove he
or she is legally allowed to do so, 
 
 
 
 OR 
 
 
 
 ·        Seek
legal help to have a designated representative assigned to handle legal and
medical matters for the person that is in your care, including the formal
disability application process. 
 
 
 
 Becoming
a Representative Payee 
 
 If the individual is approved to receive SSD benefits, you
may also need to apply to be a representative payee with the SSA.  
 
 This simply means that benefit checks will be issued to you
to use for providing the care and support your charge needs. This is a legally
binding relationship that requires you to communicate honestly and openly with
the SSA a minimum of four times per year regarding the manner in which benefit
funds are being spent.  
 
 The application is Form SSA-11, and can be found  here :  http://www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-11.pdf 
 It is important to note however, that in most circumstance, the SSA
requires this application form be completed during an in-person interview
appoint with an SSA representative, typically at your local SSA office.  
 
 
 
 Applying
for Caregiver Benefits  
 
 As previously mentioned, there are some local and state
benefit programs available that may provide direct financial and other support
services for you as the caregiver of a disabled person.  
 
 These programs are typically administered through the
department of family services in your home state, and may include the
following: 
 
 ·        Referral
services and other information 
 
 ·        Assistance
in gaining access to other services 
 
 ·        Support
groups, training, and individual counseling services 
 
 ·        Caregiver
respite programs, to give you a break from your role as caregiver 
 
 ·        Supplemental
supportive care services 
 
 ·        Income,
usually in the form of Medicaid waiver payments issued to you as the caregiver
of a Medicaid recipient 
 
 To know for certain what caregiver benefits may be available
in your area, you must reach out to your local department of family services or
another similar social services agency to make inquiries.

"40474" "57" "http://susansenator.com/blog/2014/08/new-development-for-disabled-housing-mortgages/" "New Development for Disabled Housing Mortgages!" "Valuable home-purchasing information for anyone in the country with a developmental disability looking for a possible low percentage down mortgage. I received this information from  Autism Housing Pathways’  Cathy Boyle. It may now be possible for parents to buy with very little down through Fannie Mae if the property is for a son or daughter with a developmental disability! How to get a 5% down mortgage from Fannie Mae if you are buying a property for a son or daughter with a developmental or physical disability : 
 A parent (or parents) who is a natural person (i.e., not an LLC, or a co-op)  can get a Fannie Mae loan for 5% down,  and there is no cap on the parent’s income. 
 Fannie Mae considers it to be owner-occupied by the parent who does not live there, if the child is unable to work or doesn’t have enough income. 
 The parent is still allowed to have their own primary residence. 
 You may collect income from residents, but this income cannot be used for the mortgage qualification. 
 You will need to check with an accountant to determine whether the mortgage interest is tax deductible. It is quite possible that the IRS will consider it an investment property (i.e., the mortgage interest wouldn’t be deductible). 
 The key language is in the  Fannie Mae selling guide . Note: If a property is used as a group home, and a natural-person individual occupies the property as a principal residence or as a second home, Fannie Mae’s terms and conditions for such occupancy status as provided will be applicable. 
Also please note, this is different from the Fannie Mae HomeChoice program, in which the individual with a disability is the owner of the property, and the family member is a non-occupying co-borrower. In this case, the family owns the house. This *should* allow the person with a disability to use a Sec. 8 voucher, provided the local housing authority permits the family to be the landlord as a reasonable accommodation. This is not true of HomeChoice, which doesn’t permit the use of a Sec. 8 rental voucher. This is a very exciting discovery. As always, neither I, nor Cathy Boyle, nor Autism Housing Pathways, is engaged in providing financial or legal advice. Always double check everything with your own financial and legal advisers.

Healthcare reform and kids with special needs: what the new law means
" "
 
 
 
 
 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA): Is it a good thing for kids with special needs? I really didn't have a clue how it will affect children with disabilities, and what cons there might be. Then Morris Klein, an attorney practicing in Bethesda, Maryland
and the District of Columbia, kindly agreed to answer questions. He is a member
of the  Special Needs Alliance , a fellow of the  National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys  and an elder law attorney certified by the  National Elder Law Foundation . 
 
 
 
 
If you read this and still have q's, Mr. Klein will do his best to jump into the comments section and answer them, so feel free to ask. 
 
 
 
 When will changes for the ACA start taking place? 
 
In 2014, although some states may seek to delay the deadline
because they'll want to see how the Supreme Court ruled before taking any
action to begin implementing the program. 
 
 
 
 Can you explain just how the ACA will affect kids with
disabilities? 
 
Children with disabilities will have more options for
private healthcare coverage: 
 
 
 
• Insurers will not be able to deny coverage for any child
based on a pre-existing condition, nor can a premium rate be charged for such
coverage. 
 
• Insurers can no longer place lifetime limits on many
benefits and, beginning in 2014, limits will be eliminated for most plans. 
 
• Child-only policies must now be made available. This will
facilitate coverage for kids whose parents have employer-provided insurance
that doesn’t include dependent coverage or who are being raised by
grandparents. 
 
• Insurers must offer various wellness programs, such as
well-child screenings, immunizations and, beginning in 2014, dental and vision
care for children. 
 
• Insurers will no longer be able to rescind policies because
the applicant unintentionally made a mistake on the application. In the past
minor oversights –even clerical errors—have resulted in lost coverage.  
 
 
 
Previously, pre-existing conditions and lifetime coverage
caps have led to situations in which a child’s only coverage option was
Medicaid, unavailable to middle class families due to its strict eligibility
guidelines. Families will also have access to insurance options through
state-based “Health Benefit Exchanges.” There will be federal subsidies to help
with the cost of private insurance for families living at the poverty level ($9,220
for a family of four).     
 
 
 
 How does the ACA change the Medicaid program? 
 
In addition to expanding the number of persons eligible for
Medicaid, the ACA requires states to maintain currently eligibility standards
and benefits for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) under Medicaid until
2019 and to extend funding for CHIP through 2015. CHIP-eligible children who
are unable to enroll in the program due to enrollment caps will be eligible for
tax credits in the insurance exchanges. 
 
 
 
 What cons, if any, do you see in the Affordable Care Act for
kids? 
 
Poor persons in states that elect not to expand Medicaid are
at risk; we do not yet know how much health insurance will cost once the ACA is
implemented in 2014. Also, starting in 2013, healthcare Flexible Spending Accounts will be
limited to $2500 per year per family, with annual adjustments for inflation (formerly, private employers could set their own caps on healthcare FSAs). Parents who
use healthcare FSAs to pay for services, therapies and equipment for their children not covered by insurance may consider the limit a negative. 
 
 
 
 What are the financial implications of the ACA—can parents
expect to save money? How so? 
 
People who had to pay for healthcare out-of-pocket because
they could not obtain health insurance will benefit. Even people who have
health insurance now may save money because additional health services will be
covered by insurance, such as vision programs for children.

How to Track Medical Bills Efficiently
" "
Click. Hey, a Billing Error! By  KAJA WHITEHOUSE February 12, 2006 Wall Street Journal Tracking medical bills and payments is a complicated task that even the most organized people can find daunting. But new software tools can help. Rick and Barrie Rappaport of Chicago struggled for years to gain control of the rush of medical bills associated with their daughter's rare genetic disorder. At one point, they tried logging all their information on an Excel spreadsheet. When that proved cumbersome, they organized file folders for each member of the family and the corresponding doctors. No matter what they tried, \"it was never easy,\" says Barrie Rappaport, a book-publishing analyst. \"I always found it overwhelming.\" To resolve this problem, people like the Rappaports are turning to software programs that allow them to easily view their medical bills in relation to their insurance coverage and the payments they have made. These tools can help people identify billing errors. They can also do much more, including flagging appointments and helping people determine whether they are eligible to deduct medical expenses on their tax returns. A Growing Responsibility Gaining control of medical spending is an increasingly important part of managing household finances. As medical costs rise, consumers are taking on a greater share of the expenses, with higher deductibles and co-pays. Meanwhile, missed payments can have a deleterious effect on consumers' credit ratings. There are at least three software products that can help: Medical Expense Wizard ($59.95) was introduced in 2003 by medical administrator Pamela Selby-Moore, who is also a cancer survivor. Software giant Intuit launched Quicken Medical Expense Manager ($49.99) last winter, followed by SimoHealth, which launched a free product last summer. When you receive a medical service, you typically receive a bill -- and may be asked to pay immediately. You also receive a corresponding \"explanation of benefits,\" or EOB, from the insurance company. The EOB is not a bill. It simply tells you what insurance will cover. Ideally, you shouldn't pay your medical bills until you have compared them with the corresponding EOBs to make sure everything lines up. Some people don't check their bills against the EOBs. Even worse, some patients mistakenly pay the EOB amount in addition to the amount billed. Multiple Bills Another complication: It can take months for all the related bills to arrive. A routine doctor's visit or minor medical procedure can result in a slew of bills from a multitude of service providers, including the doctor and laboratories. The software programs allow people to enter the information from their EOBs and their medical bills in the same place. This way, people can keep track of the bills and EOBs that have yet to arrive. Once they have everything, consumers can more easily spot billing errors. These programs also can help at tax time. Taxpayers can take a deduction when their total medical spending for the year exceeds 7.5% of their adjusted gross income. The programs tally up your spending and can identify which medical expenses qualify. Medical Expense Wizard and Quicken Medical Expense Manager offer more bells and whistles than the free SimoHealth product. Both Quicken and Medical Expense Wizard provide pre-formatted dispute letters that allow people who spot billing errors to easily address the problem. People using those two programs can also set reminders when phone calls need to be made or bills need to be paid. Meanwhile, the Quicken and SimoHealth programs have features to help people manage their flexible spending accounts. For more information and to order or download the software, see  www.medicalexpensewizard.com ,  www.quickenmedical.com  and  www.simohealth.com .

"20902" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/01/25/california-regional-center-on-probation/" "California regional center on probation" "The  California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS)  has a simple charger: “The California Department of Developmental Services is the agency through which the State of California provides services and supports to individuals with developmental disabilities.”   The CDDS works under the framework of the  Lanterman Act .  Key to the Lanterman Act is the concept that the state would empower local, private agencies to both manage and provide these services.  From the management side, this lead to the  Regional Center  system.  Regional Centers are local nonprofits which contract with service providers to serve the clients (developmentally disabled) in their area.   One of these regional centers is IRC– Inland Regional Center , which serves Riverside and San Bernadino counties (inland from Los Angeles). The Sacramento Bee (the main newspaper for the State’s capital) ran this story earlier this month:  California housing for developmentally disabled has high cost . Now, I got to admit, I read that title and though, “uh-oh.  Here comes another of those stories criticizing services for the disabled.  But, here are the first few paragraphs of that story: In 2006, a state-funded center serving developmentally disabled people spent $2.9 million to develop four houses for its clients in Riverside County. 
 Just months after the houses were completed, the county assessor’s office estimated the properties were worth $1.1 million less than the Inland Regional Center had paid to build them. 
 Four years later, they’re worth 31 percent of their cost. 
 The $2 million loss, as documented by tax records and assessor data, wasn’t just the result of a bad real estate bet made with public money by the regional center, which is part of the state’s system of 21 nonprofits charged with arranging care for developmentally disabled people. I don’t know what is worse, the idea that services for the developmentally disabled cost too much on their own, or that some sort of mismanagement is costing taxpayers extra in their support of the developmentally disabled. The Sacramento Bee has followed up recently with the story:  Southern California center serving disabled put on probation The state Department of Developmental Services has placed on probation the largest of 21 publicly funded regional centers serving developmentally disabled people, saying it illegally used state money to develop housing, violated the center’s contract with the state and circumvented a statutory freeze placed on rates paid to care providers. 
 The department sent a letter dated Jan. 19 about its actions to the center’s board in Southern California. Ouch. Ouch on so many levels.  Yes, as a taxpayer, I hate the idea of my money being wasted.  On the other hand, this goes to the fact that organizations like the regional centers hold much more than the obvious (supplying support).  They hold a large part of the reputation of the community.  In times like these, with the economic stresses we are under, we can’t afford stories like those above.

This year,  we will be a team at the Autism Acceptance Walk  on April 27. The Walk is an event to support the Autism Society of Northern Virginia, and to raise money for their Intervention Assistance Fund. This is a program that provides \"mini-grants\" to families to help pay for therapies and services their loved ones need to function and improve their lives. 
 
In other words, we are raising money to go directly to autistic people to help them. Now.

How much do they support research?  How much do they pay their executives?  This became a big question about a year ago when it became public how much Autism Speaks pays their top people.  Since the 2009 form 990 (IRS forms from non-profit organizations) are now public, I thought I’d take a quick look at some of the organizations out there.  More importantly, we are in a tough financial time and charities get hit hard in recessions.   Autism Speaks revenue: $45.5M down from $66.4M

 ratio of salary to program service expenses: 320,442/586,12 4=0.55 This is similar to Autism Speaks and Generation Rescue.   Checking a few figures.   First, it was claimed a while back that the National Autism Association had thousands of dues paying members.  The lowest dues level for the NAA is $35/year.  The amount of dues collected was $12,465.  This suggests a maximum of 356 dues paying members. Second, the $15k payment to the Age of Autism intrigued me.  Age of Autism portrays itself as an autism organization in advocacy efforts.  They are not, however, a charitable organization.  The Age of Autism is a limited liability corporation registered to Dan Olmsted.  Because of this, financial records are not public.  But we can attempt an estimate with public information: Age of Autism has 4 sponsors listed on their website.  (SafeMinds, Generation Rescue, the National Autism Association and TACA).  Assuming that all 4 are paying $15k per year, this would mean $60k/year from sponsors.  In addition, they received advertising revenue. A link on the top of the Age of Autism blog takes you to where you can see advertising rates.  AoA has two types of ads, leaderboard ads (at $10/day) and sidebar ads (varying from $25/week with no image to $250/week for a large ad with picture).  They have no leaderboard right now, but 6 sidebar ads.  Using an estimate average of $210/week based on the sizes I see (and the fact that this divides easily by 7), that gives $30/day per sidebar.  I am assuming that the ads for the books are gratis.  If they fill the leaderboard ad, AoA could be getting $190/day from advertisements.  365 days of that gives $69,350.  Together with sponsorship, the Age of Autism is bringing in an estimated $129,350 a year.  They have to pay for hosting, but they also get donations.  They do not specify how the money is distributed.

"22411" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/10/26/tough-fiscal-times-in-california/" "Tough fiscal times in California" "Two stories out recently point to the tightening budgets that the  This one isn’t caused by economy.  This is mismanagement.  In  AUDIT: Inland Regional Center must repay $10 million , the Press Enterprise discusses the results of an audit of one of California’s Regional Centers.  The Regional Centers are private non-profit organizations which administer funds for California’s developmentally disabled population.  Inland Regional Center (IRC) has had problems for the past few years and  been placed on probation . From the Press Enterprise story: As for the center’s ability to repay the $9.8 million in improper expenses cited in the audit, that would be all but impossible, she said. 
 “We’re going to have to get direction from the department on that. We don’t have $10 million,” Fitzgibbons said. “We’re really working hard to improve things and do the best job we can do.” Well, they’ve been audited and IRC has to repay the state $10M.  That’s a lot of money, and could mean a reduction in services for the clients of IRC.  People who are not responsible for the mismanagement. The nonprofit agency that serves developmentally disabled residents in Inland Southern California improperly spent almost $10 million and must repay the state, according to a highly critical audit released Friday that found continued widespread problems at the San Bernardino-based Inland Regional Center. One example of misspent funds  was when $1M allocated for  services for people with hearing, speech and/or vision impairment was used for the operation expenses in their resource library. Another recent story: San Diego Unified School District is facing insolvency and possible takeover by the state: http://www.kqed.org/assets/flash/kqedplayer.swf California required school districts to budget as though there would be no cuts in funding.  However, California also has automatic cuts in place should revenues not meet specific “trigger” levels.  If the state misses the revenue levels, they will cut funds to the districts.  While special education is not specifically mentioned, Special Education tends to be a focus of budget minded administrators, with comments of “encroachment” commonly heard.

"40424" "57" "http://susansenator.com/blog/2013/10/help-families-finance-adult-autism-housing/" "Help families finance adult autism housing" "Here is a plea for action that came my way via autism advocate Cathy Boyle, who founded a wonderful organization called  Autism Housing Pathways . I have edited a little bit for expedience: ****How do autism families figure out the financing for their adult child’s housing?**** While there are a number of programs aimed at providing financing for lower-income and first-time home buyers, families creating housing are largely treated — unfairly — as purchasers of vacation homes. However, there is one mortgage product aimed at these families:  Fannie Mae’s Community HomeChoice , a variant of Fannie Mae’s MyCommunity Mortgage. HomeChoice permits family members to be considered “non-occupying co-borrowers.” This means their income can help, in that the family’s income can be considered in determining the ability of borrowers to repay,  while still allowing the individuals with disabilities to be considered low income , and thus qualify for the program. Here is the important part:  Community HomeChoice allows individuals with disabilities to put 3% down, and only $500 of it has to be their own money; the rest can be from family members!!! Unfortunately, currently in Massachusetts there do not appear to be any mortgage lenders offering HomeChoice. Fannie Mae does not have the ability to identify lenders offering specific products. Most (if not all) Massachusetts participants in MyCommunity do not engage in manual underwriting, which is necessary to use the HomeChoice option. Cathy Boyle, who sent me this notice, has been in discussions with officials at MassHousing regarding the possibility of MassHousing working with a small group of lending institutions (probably 6 or 7) scattered around the state, to offer HomeChoice. There is some openness to the idea. She has been told that it would be helpful to get as many public comments as possible on MassHousing’s draft strategic plan asking for this option. MassHousing is accepting public comments until the close of business on November 8th.  You can comment here, using the talking points listed below. * Individuals with disabilities and their families need a mortgage product that has a 3% down payment and that recognizes the need for family members to help financially * Fannie Mae’s Community HomeChoice is such a product * Community HomeChoice does not appear to be offered by any lender in the state * MassHousing should work with a small group of lenders to make Community HomeChoice available throughout the state * Such an initiative would fit into MassHousing’s proposed objectives of expanding housing options for special populations and expanding home ownership opportunities for underserved populations If you would, please cc Cathy Boyle at  ccampboyle@comcast.net on your comments, so she can have a running total of who has commented.

Trusts for kids with special needs: what to know, what to do
" "
 
 
 
 
 
What is a special needs trust? I didn't find out until years after Max was born. One of the hardest parts of planning for your child’s
financial future is  accepting  that you need to plan. Dave and I procrastinated,
both because we were overwhelmed with Max's day-to-day care and because, if I’m
being honest, we were in denial. I felt a little reassured to hear
that the financial planner I’ve been working with on this series of sponsored posts also didn't jump right on it. “I didn’t do financial planning till my
daughter was 12—I was just worrying about taking care of her,” says Sal Salvo, a SpecialCare Planner with Summit Marketing Inc., a general agency of  Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) . 
 
 
 
 
 
During our most recent session, we discussed a special needs trust. I basically
knew what it is but I still had a whole lot of questions. I got the complete run-down—and I'm sharing it with you. 
 
 
 
 
 What exactly is a special needs trust?   
It's a way of making sure a child is eligible for all possible government benefits. According to current laws, if a child with disabilities who
turns 18 has more than $2000 in their name, they won't qualify to receive
certain benefits from the government. That includes Social Security Income (SSI) and
Medicaid benefits such as a home health aide, therapy, work programs, daycare
programs and respite programs. Parents create a “trust”—a legal way to hold assets for the benefit of another—to put
money in so that their child will not have assets over $2000 in their name, and
still qualify for those government benefits. For more info about SSI and Medicaid (MediCAL in California), visit the sites for  Supplemental Security Income  (SSI) and the  U.S. Department of Health & Human Services . Medicaid rules vary by state, so it's good to check the federal site for info. You can also reach SSI at (800) 772-1213. 
 
 
 
 
 
 What don’t people get about special needs trusts? 
 
I don’t think people understand how important they are! Without a special needs trust, any inheritance left to a child with special needs may disqualify that child for government benefits.    
 
 
 
 What types of special needs trusts exist? 
 
There are two main types of special needs trusts. The most
common is a  third party special needs  trust  or a supplemental care special needs trust. That trust is designed so
that other people’s assets can be put into the trust—money from parents,
grandparents, aunts, uncles and siblings. This allows family to provide supplemental
care for a child with special needs, without jepordizing government support. The money can go toward clothing, vacations, hobbies, furnishings and transportation and augmentative communication equipment, but not room and board. These are all things that can improve the child’s lifestyle without losing potential government support. With this kind of trust, no monies need to be paid back to the government.  
 
 
 
The second type of trust is  a payback trust,  which is less common. It is also known as a self-funded pooled disability trust. This is for a
child who has assets, such as an inheritance, a settlement from a
lawsuit, or even grandparents who set up a college savings plan. With this trust, the government keeps track of SSI and Medicaid
benefits given to the child. When the child passes, the government presents a
bill to the family to pay it back and the trust covers those costs. If there’s
anything left, the money can go to the rest of the family.  
 
 
 
 Is there anything else a trust can pay for? 
 
There are pretty tight rules but one major thing is that parents can pool resources and purchase a home for their children with special needs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 At what age should I start planning a special needs trust
for my child?  
 
From an economic point of view, a trust for a child with
special needs should be done as soon as possible. The bottom line is, a child with disabilities needs one in place by 18. By setting up a trust early (even if you don't fund it for a while), you can let grandparents or other relatives know in the event they plan to leave an inheritance. It must be paid directly to the trust, rather than put in the child's name. If by chance they pass away and leave your child money in his name, you'd have to do a payback trust (which is isn’t as attractive). So you want to get going on one early on. 
 
 
     
 
 How do you set up a special needs trust? 
 
First, you should ideally have a total plan in place for your child that you will have worked on with a professional familiar with planning for someone with special needs. To set up the trust, you need to hire an attorney who specializes in
special needs estate planning; they’ll know how to do it so
your child doesn’t forfeit any benefits. A lot of people think an attorney can do anything, but
think of it this way: If you need open-heart surgery, you’re not not going to a
podiatrist! You need a special needs attorney. This attorney can also check to make sure that your child's assets are protected—for instance, that your 401k or pension does not list your
child with special needs. Some additional resources:  The Academy of Special Needs Planners  and  The Special Needs Alliance . 
 
 Who handles the investments for a special needs trust? 
 
 
You will need to choose a trustee no matter what type of trust you have, someone who manages trust assets. A corporate trustee, such as a bank or trust company, can best handle this. T he trust should be invested in a diversified manner, and with an investment strategy that generates a good rate of return.  Some parents think it's a good idea to choose a family member to be trustee, but in some places the law forbids that and a family member might not be best equipped to handle this. Does Uncle Joe really know how to manage money and file trust tax forms, or is he better focused on caring for your child? You should, however, inform grandparents and relatives about the trust so that if they were considering leaving money to a child with special needs,
they can leave it specifically to the Special Needs Trust.

			     This  is what I'm referring to when  I say there's a gap  (I know, it seems inconceivable, right?).  This  is the \"extra help\" I mentioned. Hotter doesn't automatically qualify because we make too much for him to be on Medicaid and he doesn't get SSI (need-based Social Security for broken people who are also poor), he gets SSD (Social Security for people are are permanently broken and can never work again). 
    Sigh. 
    We're going to go and camp out at the Social Security office on Tuesday (I have off that day to take Hotter to some appointments), and see if there's any way around losing the \"extra help.\"

"40176" "57" "http://susansenator.com/blog/2012/01/tax-credits-for-hiring-certain-groups/" "Tax Credits for Hiring Certain Groups" "Here is something for employers to think about. There are tax incentives granted by the US federal government for those who hire people who traditionally have faced great barriers to finding work:  The Work Opportunity Tax Credit.  This existed in a different form before, as the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit Program. This is a quote from  Worksupport.com , my source: Employers electing the credit must reduce the wage deduction on their business tax return by the amount of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit taken. Unlike the wage deduction, WOTC is applied against an employer’s bottom-line liability and offsets taxes due on a dollar-for-dollar basis. I learned this because I had asked one of my favorite autism adulthood gurus  Peter Gerhardt  if he knew of such a thing. I also have wondered if autistic people can invoke Affirmative Action to help them get hired, to make the playing field more even. Peter said that the closest thing to this, however, is the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) that makes it illegal to discriminate against those with disabilities when hiring or in the workplace. This program may be common knowledge but I suspect that it wouldn’t hurt to tell people about it a few thousand times.

"15288" "25" "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/03/on-privilege/" "On Privilege" "
 Over the last several months I have been exposed to a lot of statements regarding privilege.  This concept of privilege has been used to cite “white privilege,” “straight privilege” and “neurotypical privilege,” just to name a few.  These concepts seek to describe the discrepancy of treatment between individuals among a majority and a minority. 
 From the minority perspective, this language describes experienced differences.  In other words, the discrepancy is real.  However, this does not make the concept of  privilege  (as used in this context) real.  It is this concept I seek to address. 
 Consider a few of the  dictionary definitions  of  privilege : 
 
 a right, immunity, or benefit enjoyed only by a person beyond the advantages of most 
 a special right, immunity, or exemption granted to persons in authority or office to free them from certain obligations or liabilities 
 any of the rights common to all citizens under a modern constitutional government 
 
 The dictionary definition of  privilege  does not support the use of the word in the context of a discrepancy between the majority and the minority.  For example, men tend to be assumed competent in work situations whereas women are more likely to be assumed incompetent in the same situation.  The men who are assumed competent are not  privileged ; the women who are assumed incompetent are  disadvantaged .  There is a subtle, but significant difference. 
 Consider a few of the  dictionary definitions  of  disadvantage : 
 
 absence or deprivation of advantage or equality 
 to subject to disadvantage 
 
 The word  disadvantage  more accurately describes the discrepancy of treatment.  Being  privileged  suggests that you are getting something you shouldn’t have, that you are being treated as  special  or above the norm.  If you are assumed to be competent at your job, you are not being treated special and you are not being assessed as above the norm.  You are being treated fairly.  On the other hand, being  disadvantaged  suggests that you are being denied something you should have, that you are being treated as  inferior , below the norm.  If you are assumed to be incompetent at your job, you are being denied fair treatment. 
 The majority is not being given special rights above what most receive.  The minority is being denied rights and  privileges  (3 rd  definition listed) that they are entitled to and put at a disadvantage. 
 So, the use of  privilege  to describe the discrepancy between the majority and the minority is linguistically and rhetorically incorrect.  Perhaps more importantly, it’s also politically damaging.  When you  accuse  someone of being privileged, you are saying they have a benefit they are not entitled to.  This puts that person on the defensive.  Unless they are highly sympathetic to your cause, they are going to resist your  false   accusation  and miss your valid claim of discrepancy of treatment.  You are discredited for making a false accusation; the real meat of your message isn’t even heard.  On the other hand, if the person is highly sympathetic to your cause, they are going to feel  guilty , because they’ve internalized your  false   accusation  and will feel responsible for having a benefit they shouldn’t or, more accurately, for having the benefit you were denied through no fault of their own. 
 Whether the individual you accuse of being privileged is sympathetic or not, a statement regarding privilege implies that individual has done something wrong by being “privileged.”  They’ve done nothing wrong (at least, not by  accepting  their “privilege”), because they are being treated fairly.  The wrong is not in the majority having privileges (3 rd  definition again), but in the minority being denied these same privileges.  Thus, the majority isn’t  privileged  (1 st  or 2 nd  definition), the minority is  disadvantaged . 
 People need to understand the discrepancy of treatment between the majority and the minority.  When you’re in the majority, it’s difficult to imagine that those ordinary, every-day benefits you take for granted are denied to others on the basis of spurious reasons like skin color, gender, sexual orientation, or neurological makeup.  People need to learn about the real examples of these discrepancies.  Listing the benefits they enjoy and take for granted that are denied to others is an effective way to make people aware of the real discrepancies minority groups experience.  But calling them  privileges  is a mistake.  It conveys the wrong message.  It is inaccurate, because it is the wrong word.  Leave  privileged  to the powerful few—the senators and CEOs, the princes and dictators, the celebrities and the tycoons—and stick to accurate words that describe the majority, like  benefits ,  rights , and  advantages .  The difference may be subtle, but truth is powerful.

 Power is everything. 
 At least, that’s what some would have us believe.  
 They believe it.  To them, power is above morality, above duty, above right and wrong.  What is moral, but what the people in power claim it to be?  What is duty, but what the people in power say it to be?  What is right and wrong, but that they tell us it is so?  And, because they are the ones with power those things—morality, duty, right and wrong—don’t really apply to them, unless there is someone with more power to declare that it does. 
 I believe in truth.  I believe  right  and  wrong  are absolutes, but that we—being finite and subjective—cannot always perceive them accurately.  I believe morality is our imperfect pursuit to perceive right and wrong.  And I believe our sense of duty is derived from our morality.  I do not believe the absolute versions of these things are subject to human power.  But our perceptions of them are.  And, in our finite and subjective existence, our perceptions are all we really have. 
 Power is abstract—it is not seen, but it is experienced.  It is derived from both influence and force.  Ideally, power is exercised through influence—we persuade one another, changing each other’s perceptions until common ground is found and a common effort is exerted.  This is the power of advocacy.  
 Often, power is exercised through force.  On the national and international level, we make laws and we enforce them.  We go to war.  We enforce treaties.  We withhold trade.  On an individual level, we sue.  We fight.  We argue.  We pick up our disobedient child and carry them away—away to bed, away from the busy street, away from the candy aisle. 
 Force is not the ideal.  It may not be right, in an absolute sense.  But, sometimes it is necessary.  Sometimes, in our finite and subjective existences, it is the best we can manage, and our reasons for using force are worth the costs.  Because we’re not perfect.  Because our systems are not perfect.  Because, however much we should be able to persuade our children not to run into the street, however much we should be able to persuade nations not to bomb the hell out of each other, however much we should be able to persuade people not to kill each other—sometimes we can’t, sometimes we fail, and so we resort to force. 
 To exert force, there must be power.  For our societies and our systems to function, there must be power.  We don’t know another way—at least not one that is widely effective. 
 But power corrupts. 
 Corrupted power leads to influence and force being exerted, not for the sake of the good, but for the sake of the people in power.  For those who believe power is everything, being the one in power is the goal.  Whether they began as corrupted individuals or were corrupted by the power they exercised, they corrupt the power they use.  They exercise what power they have to maintain that power, and to get more. 
 Bullying is one form of corrupted power exercised through force.  Bullying, as exercised in the adult world, is often—if not always—an abuse of power.

 Intersex and autism - biological variation or disorder? 
 
 I've been researching intersex for a blog post I'm thinking about for my  God Confusion blog . It is estimated as much as 4% of population have some degree of intersex (biologically between male & female). The medical profession made intersex invisible for decades because it was thought to be 'abnormal'. Most people that are intersex would never know it, because they have typical anatomy for male or female and can produce offspring. Instead of accepting differences, for decades psychiatrists, psychologists and religious fundamentalists have preached that intersex is a defect/deformity/disorder that needs to be fixed. All this has done is create shame and stigma and many broken people.  In order to fit binary sex categories, many children were mutilated with surgery. In the western world, everyone is assigned a legal sex, and too bad if you're intersex and been assigned the sex that prevents you from legally marrying (heterosexual marriage has also been ingrained by religious fundamentalists).  I've read several comments by religious people that claim intersex people are not entitled to marry at all. Even recently, there has been hate speech and claims that people that are intersex are immoral.  My thinking is intersex is a biological variation, not a deformity (it's society that's turned it into a deformity). The labels 'male' and 'female' are human assignments and people have been mutilated for decades to conform to two categories. Biologically, sex is not binary, but is more of a continuum.  There are over 40 different known 'conditions', mostly genetic that result in intersex. Not many of them result in unambiguous genitalia. Intersex is the preferred catch-all label instead of misleading labels such as hermaphrodite.  All labels are human constructs. By their very nature, they exclude people. Labels often carry stigma - look at the stigma that goes with mental illness. I never tell a potential workplace I've suffered depression, as I won't get the job. Part of the reason I write under a pen-name is because of stigma about the topics I write about. It gives me a buffer against ignorant bigots.  I read some heart-breaking stories by people that are intersex - the suffering they endured being made out to be freaks by society. Advocates educate people about the facts, myths and reality of intersex. One pointed out they are not defined by their intersex - they are a human being and intersex is a part of who they are. For years autism and Asperger's were seen by the psychology and the medical profession as a disorder to be fixed. Like intersex, it was thought to be rare and abnormal. It is now estimated that 1% of the population are/have Asperger's. Asperger's is on the autistic spectrum and there are plans by psychiatry to dispense of the 'Asperger's' label and just have one category, autism.  Psychology/psychiatry is often at odds with personal experience. Autism advocates have spoken out where  'experts' reinforce stigma .  My thinking is that autism/Asperger's is a variation of human personality. Most of my difficulties come because of misunderstanding from society. Like intersex, any way of behaving differently from the majority of society is seen as abnormal, wrong and immoral. The same goes for atheism.  I am an advocate for autism/Asperger's and atheism because I have experienced first hand the stigma from society of being different. My own  family don't accept me  for my differences - I don't fit their narrow black-and-white worldview ingrained by religion. Yet, I am not defined by my autism and atheism. That is not all of me - I am also a mother, a wife, a musician, a thinker, a writer, an INTP. I'm a woman (heck, there's a 1 in 25 chance I'm intersex but don't know it).  I'm heterosexual (and sometimes feel I'm asexual as I don't have a particularly high sex drive). I'm celiac and I'm sensitive. I'm part-Maori and part-European. I'm a New Zealand citizen and an Australian resident. These are all labels that only give a glimpse of me.  I am a human being - a multifaceted human being, not just a single dimension. Here's one that upsets a lot of people - I'm an animal and an ape. Yes, humans are classified as apes. Doesn't bother me - I like animals.  Male and female gender roles are labels constructed by society. Gender is what sex a person feels inside, irrespective of their biological sex. I'm female, but not a 'girly' female. I studied a degree dominated by males. Women were oppressed for centuries. Now it's swung the other way somewhat.  Anyone outside the 'norm' still gets despised by much of society (because of the influence of Abrahamic religion) - feminine boys, masculine girls. Bisexuals, gays, transgender etc. Tribal groups often embraced difference such as intersex and transgender - they were considered special and a gift.  I'm all for accepting differences and not being forced to conform to some narrow black-and-white views imposed on individuals by the ignorance of society. The majority bullying minority individuals and groups into submission.  This can only take place with education and challenging current worldviews. Let's do what we can to discard bigoted stereotypes and promote understanding.

 One of the great strengths of humanity is our ability to reach across the differences that divide us to find similarities that unite us.  One of the great weaknesses of humanity is our failure to reach across the differences that divide, and instead to build them up and make those differences seem even greater than they truly are. 
 In studying my craft as a writer, I am reading  Story Engineering  by Larry Brooks .  In this book, Brooks writes about the differences between first-dimensional, second-dimensional, and third-dimensional characterization.  First-dimensional characterization is the surface stuff—often determined by how the character wants to be perceived.  Second-dimensional characterization is the backstory and worldview—how the character came to be, through his or her experiences, where and who they are now.  Third-dimensional characterization is the choices and action the character makes, which Brooks argues is how characters (and people) reveal who they really are. 
 Many people want to be perceived as one thing and they work hard to accomplish this goal by wearing certain clothes, affecting certain manners, sharing certain opinions, and creating a façade which they expect others to see and appreciate.  Yet, when their manners and opinions are tested, when they must act, it is often the influence of their personal history and their worldviews that shape their choices, either in defiance of who they were raised to be or in submission to it.  This may or may not resemble how they wish to be perceived. 
 When we choose to reach across our differences to find similarities—or when we fail to do so—we show who we are regardless of the first-dimensional affectations we assume.  The community in which we interact is not strictly the autism or autistic community, nor is it strictly the greater autism community.  We interact in a community of peoples with and without disabilities, peoples with many kinds of differences and many kinds of similarities.  Our ability to reach across definitions, labels, and differences defines a meaningful aspect of who we are.  Words are not enough.  We must show ourselves based on our actions.

"13030" "19" "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/emotional-discussions/" "Emotional discussions" "Another thing that’s happened to me in a debate more than once recently is that somebody tries to belittle me out of the discussion on the grounds that I’m “over-emotional,” and therefore can’t expect to be taken seriously. It took me a long time to learn that almost whenever someone tells you that you’re being “too emotional,” what they mean is that you are being perfectly appropriately emotional about something that they simply don’t want to have to acknowledge or think about.  That being emotional is not a disqualification from argument.  Being emotional is human. Un-emotionality is not the equivalent of having a rational argument, or a reliable indicator that someone does.  It is not the same as having a grasp of facts or science or of the actual conditions under discussion. Emotionality is not personal attack. Personal attack is personal attack, and while there is such a thing as lashing out gratuitously or needlessly, the sole fact of someone’s being emotional, is not it. That someone is emotional does not mean that they have not, or are not capable, of considering their own arguments logically or rationally. Rationality and emotionality coexist within individuals.  They are not a zero-sum quantity; they are not opposing or mutually exclusive characteristics.  Or aren’t there people who are both highly rational and highly emotional, as well as people who are both unemotional and deeply irrational?  Because an opponent displays emotion, does not invalidate the logical grounding of their argument, and isn’t an excuse from addressing the actual substance of their argument.  Emotionality itself is neither evidence nor lack of evidence. To be emotional in argument is not the same as committing the logical fallacy of emotional argument, which is to assert that the emotional consequences, or the intensity with which something is felt, is itself evidence of the rightness or wrongness of a position.  Ironically, it is those who would invalidate a position based on the emotionality of the arguer, who are  actually  engaging in emotional argument—taking the position that emotionality alone invalidates a position or standing in a debate, and not the validity of the argument itself. ***** What it probably does mean when someone is emotional is that the topic under discussion means a great deal to them.  That they’ve been affected personally by a situation, or suffered serious and personal consequences of how a problem is perceived and debated—often by people who do not know the realities of the situation as intimately as they do. It means that somebody cares, that they’re passionate and invested.  And none of those traits precludes the ability to think productively about a problem.  Otherwise, you claim that no one who is truly, individually affected by a problem has any standing to talk about it and to be heard.  That the poor have no place in discussions of poverty, that the disabled have no place in discussions of disability rights, that racial and ethnic minorities have no place discussing racism, and gender/sexual minorities have no place discussing discrimination and bigotry against those identities—if they can’t be perfectly unemotional about it, to an arbitrary standard set by those who are not personally, directly affected by the topic at hand. Does that sound either fair or rational? ***** Do we really believe that any major civil rights or human rights victory, whether in a court of law or in our culture, was accomplished without emotional engagement?  The end of South African apartheid, or Jim Crow laws in the US?  The fight for women’s suffrage and enfranchisement?  The aftermath of the Stonewall riots and of Matthew Shepherd’s murder in terms of LGBT rights and acceptance?  The disability rights movement for the rights and inclusion of disabled people that preceded the passage of the ADA? As logically grounded as all of those movements have been, they have all involved intense and even disruptive degrees of emotion.  And as certain as I am that their very emotional intensity was probably cited as a strike against their credibility at the time…who, now, would dare to say that the emotional investment of their participants should have disqualified their arguments and demands from serious consideration by the majority? It’s an incredibly unfair standard when only those with the luxury of being able to be unemotional about a topic are granted the credibility to discuss it.  Particularly regarding the concrete consequences that the way it’s discussed has for people’s actual lives. When someone claims that you are too emotional to be having an argument, it is they who are refusing to engage with the substance of your argument.  They are saying that the only recourse they have is to disqualify you from the debate, because they have no actual refutation to what you are saying.  And that the grounds on which they can do so are that you care too much, that you mean what you are saying.  That the problem at hand is not purely abstract or intellectual to you, but that it means something real.

Cultural Construct Misconceptions
" "
Readers might see this entry as entirely theoretical. Well, I find concepts and ideas fascinating and that's why I'm writing about this, so bare with me. Also, I think this particular concept is in fact useful. I get the feeling there are several misconceptions about the notion of autism as a  cultural construct , and I hope to address them with a list of points and a follow-up example. Some of these misconceptions are aspects of the theory that I have been confused about myself. Saying that autism is a cultural construct is simply an ideology. Actually, a cultural construct or social construct theory about an entity is a scientific theory that is falsifiable. It should not be confused with Neurodiversity, which is an ideology. Claiming that autism is a cultural construct is equivalent to claiming that autism is not \"real\" - that it does not exist, or that it's not useful. No. Cultural constructs are very real and useful. Language is a cultural construct. Countries are a cultural construct. Money is a cultural construct. Believe me, I'm not about to cash all my savings and throw them away because money is a cultural construct. The purpose of cultural constructionism is to understand the usefulness of cultural constructs. It means that people cannot identify as autistic. That's not correct. See the Example section below. It means there are no differences between autistics and non-autistics. The fact that differences between autistics and non-autistics can be found is not surprising. Differences can probably be found across any behavioral spectrum, regardless of where the spectrum is divided. Differences can be found between men and women; between races; between any two groups of people, in fact. These differences are often found to occur 'in average' (i.e. they can't be generalized), but this is not a requirement of cultural construct theory. It means autism does not have a cause or a treatment. Again, this is not correct. Cultural constructs may have underlying mechanisms which are not only cultural, including but not limited to genetic mechanisms. See the Example section below. Cultural construct theory only applies to 'mild' cases of autism. There is no such limit imposed by cultural construct theory, and there is no non-cultural way to define such a boundary. Cultural construct theory does not have a practical application. I think cultural construct theory can help explain the \"autism epidemic\" and help decipher some of the causes of autism. Current thinking of autism as an identifiable \"brain disease\" is leading nowhere. The example below provides a model which could be helpful in this regard. Example A straightforward cultural construct is  short stature . Consider how short stature is defined. Should only the bottom percentile of the population in height be considered short? How about the bottom 5%? 10%? Is it real? Of course. Does it have causes? Yes, it probably has many causes, including genetics. Is it pathological? In some cases it probably is. Is pathology determined by severity? Not necessarily. Is it treatable? Human Growth Hormone (HGH) can help - whether it's advisable to use it is debatable. Can people identify as short? Evidently. Is it absolute? \"Short\" surely has a different meaning in different cultures. Can it be a burden and lead to suffering? I'm sure it can. A more relevant example of a cultural construct is  mental retardation . Consider how the questions above are answered in regards to this construct. Further Reading - Timimi, S. Taylor, E.  ADHD is best understood as a cultural construct . The British Journal of Psychiatry (2004). - Timimi, S.  Diagnosis of autism: Current epidemic has social context . BMJ (2004).

 The first proposed chapter for my book, tentatively entitled “ Neurodiversity  at Work: A Manager’s Guide,” is designed to introduce the concept of neurodiversity in a business-friendly context. 
 Most of what is written about neurodiversity is from a social justice perspective.  While there are very real reasons for this, a consequence is that information about neurodiversity is not presented in the language most business people speak.  So this first chapter will ground the relevance of the social justice issue to the business world by translating the social justice language to the business language. 
 What does it mean to be  neurologically diverse  or  neurodiverse ? 
 As used in this book,  neurologically diverse  and  neurodiverse  are two different terms.  Understanding both is important to understanding how neurodiversity impacts the workplace. 
 Neurologically  references the structures and mechanisms of the nervous system, including the brain, and the effects the nervous system has on how people experience life.   Diversity  references the fact that there is no one neurological state.  We all are neurologically diverse. 
 Neurodiverse , on the other hand, represents a sense of identity.  Someone is  neurodiverse , in this sense, rather than being  neurotypical .  Societies tend to prefer a certain set of neurological traits; this set of preferred traits is perceived as neurotypical.  In some societies, including the United States, traits that deviate from this preferred “norm” are perceived as damaged or insufficient.  This creates stigma and an environment of prejudice against anyone who demonstrates  neurodiverse  traits.  This prejudice can be extreme, such as the prejudice faced by people with so-called low functioning autism, which is considered an extreme deviation from the norm.  This prejudice can also be relatively mild, such as the prejudice faced by people with depression, which is considered a less extreme deviation from the norm. 
 So, what does it mean to be neurologically diverse?  It’s means you’re a human being.  Humanity is neurologically diverse.  What does it mean to be neurodiverse?  It means you are part of a perceived “undesirable minority” and will face stigma and prejudice as a member of the workforce.  This prejudice and stigma will continue unless managers learn to manage a neurologically diverse workforce or you learn to hide your undesirable differences.  It also means you may carry a label of mental disorder, as your neurotype may have been medicalized due to its undesirability.  
 At least an  estimated  26.2% of the American adult population could identify as neurodiverse, or one in four adults.  According to the 2004 census, that’s an estimated 57.7 million people in America alone.  This minority is too large and too important to ignore, but the business world often ignores the needs of this population. 
 What is  neurodiversity ? 
 Neurodiversity  is about the confluence of two distinct beliefs: 
 1) People are naturally and normally neurologically different.  Some of these natural, normal differences are labeled “abnormal,” “disorders,” “syndromes,” or other value-laden labels that interferes with our ability to understand the different subsets of human neurology. 
 2) Human beings are valuable, in all their diversity, in and of themselves. 
 As such,  neurodiversity  is a social justice movement that is affiliated with the disability rights arm of the civil rights movement.   Neurodiversity  is also strongly tied to autistic advocates, who advocate for acceptance and accommodations for autism, so they can better interact with societies that devalue the autistic ways of being.  As used in this text,  neurodiversity  is not exclusive to autistics, but encompasses the wide set of neurodiverse individuals who participate in the workforce.  This includes individuals with autism, mood disorders, attention deficit disorders, and other neurotypes that may or may not involve a medical diagnosis. 
 How does this social concept apply to the business environment? 
 Consumers are neurologically diverse.  Workers are neurologically diverse.  Business is, by extension, an interaction of neurologically diverse individuals for profit. 
 Understanding, respecting, and accommodating neurological diversity is an important business survival strategy as the world changes in the face of social pressures from neurodiversity advocates.  Businesses have long struggled with issues stemming from a neurologically diverse workforce, but have yet to come to terms with these issues. 
 The time is now; because, as pressure mounts, if businesses cannot or will not respond, consumer and legislative pressure will  force  businesses to respond in ways that suit bureaucratic form rather than the flexible business environment and the needs of your workers.

 “The true meaning of valuing diversity is to respect and enjoy a wide range of cultural and individual differences, thereby including everybody,” ( The Fundamentals of Organizational Behavior,  4 th  ed., by Andrew J. DuBrin, 2007, pg. 381). 
 Diversity goes beyond recognizing that we are different in measurable ways.  Diversity goes beyond tolerance.  Diversity goes beyond offering assistance to excluded individuals.  Diversity is about  inclusion . 
 In some sense, I have ignored those diagnosed with Asperger’s who object to being lumped into the same diagnostic category as my children.  Their words, their behavior—it’s beneath my contempt, it makes me angry, and it’s so hypocritical, so absurd that it really doesn’t warrant a response.  Except it does, because there are those who claim their words represent  neurodiversity .  It got that response from people much more influential than I. 
 This post is not about them, though the words I write could apply.  This about what I consider the fundamentals of  neurodiversity  to be. 
 Consider the difference between  cultural diversity  and  affirmative action .  Both seek to include people with different racial, ethnic, and national profiles in the workplace.  One does so by focusing  on  differences and disadvantages.  The other focuses  on  similarities and strengths.  One assumes that those who weren’t born white Americans need  help  getting a job.  The other assumes that everyone needs  opportunities  and can  add value  to a firm. 
 Neurodiversity  is to  cultural diversity  what  empowerment  is to  affirmative action .   Neurodiversity  and  empowerment  parallel each other in many respects; but, they are not synonyms, they are not the same.  Both have their place, but they are not the same. 
 Neurodiversity  is not about services, accommodations, treatment methods, or any of the issues that are often in the forefront of our dialogues.  People who believe in  neurodiversity  do not share the same opinion about all of these things.  Those issues are not the essence of  neurodiversity . 
 Neurodiversity  is about two things: 
 1) People are naturally and normally neurologically different.  Some of these natural, normal differences are labeled “abnormal,” “disorders,” “syndromes,” or other value-laden labels that interferes with our ability to understand the different subsets of human neurology. 
 2) Human beings are valuable, in all their diversity, in and of themselves. 
 This means: 
 1) You can not  claim to value diversity and claim to be superior.  Those two statements cannot be combined without the use of a logical fallacy.  It would not, however, invalidate a claim to value diversity if you are struggling with  feelings of superiority . 
 2) You  can  claim to value diversity and yet desire assistance, accommodations, and/or medical treatments.  The use of assistance, accommodation, and/or medical treatments does not invalidate a claim of valuing diversity. 
 3) You can not  claim to value diversity and claim to be inferior.  Those two statements cannot be combined without the use of a logical fallacy.  It would not, however, invalidate a claim to value diversity if you are struggling with  feelings of inferiority . 
 4) You  can  claim to value diversity and dislike specific people because of the things they say or do that are within their control.  For example, you can dislike someone who bullies you and still value diversity. 
 5) You can not  claim to value diversity and dislike individuals or groups based on traits beyond their control.  For example, you cannot dislike someone who embarrasses you by having a seizure in public and still value diversity. 
 6) You can support the research of human differences and still value diversity.  For example, you can support the research into the various causes of autism and still support neurodiversity. 
 7) You cannot support the forced eradication of a group based on an undesirable trait and still value diversity.  For example, you cannot support diversity and research a way to identify and eliminate autistic fetuses. 
 8) You can advocate techniques that minimize or “un-does” challenges and still value diversity.  For example, a person can support the inclusion of individuals with spinal cord injuries  and  support researching ways to correct damage to their spinal cords.  A person can also support the inclusion of individuals who cannot talk  and  support researching ways to give them access to speech. 
 9) You cannot advocate the “cure” of a diverse group and still value diversity.  For example, you cannot support racial diversity  and  try to cure “blackness.”  Neither can you support neurodiversity  and  try to cure autism or bi-polar or any other neurological subtype. 
 Neurodiversity  is about recognizing that the human race has natural neurological variations, accepting the individuals with all those variations, and including them in society.  It is about giving people the power and the opportunity to achieve their own individual potential, not quantifying that potential and dismissing those who do not “measure up” from consideration.  A belief in  neurodiversity  does not preclude the experience of disability.  A belief in  neurodiversity  does not preclude the desire to overcome the experience of disability, either temporarily or permanently.  A belief in  neurodiversity  doesn’t even preclude a belief that the government has no business extending entitlements or “special rights” to disadvantaged groups.  A belief in  neurodiversity  does, however, preclude the belief that you are in any way superior to another on the basis of things beyond your or their control.  Being smarter doesn’t make you better.  Being more socially adaptable doesn’t make you better.  Being more emotionally stable doesn’t make you better.  If you want to feel “better,” then  use  your abilities (whatever they are) to  help others .  Not only will you really feel better, but it’ll be a better feeling than any false sense of superiority could ever give you.

 “Acceptance of autism” is seen by some as a passive and defeatist stance, by others as a positive first step towards the best future for your child, and by yet others as an un-necessary statement that implies either a negative view of autistic people, or un-necessary because “autism” is a meaningless word. These variations don’t simply imply different attitudes towards autism; they are also evident of different meanings of “acceptance.” To further complicate the matter, crucial explanatory / contextual words are often left out when people talk about their acceptance of autism (acceptance of the existence of autism, the challenges of autism, the permanence of autism, etc). In this post I am going to attempt to tease apart some of these differences, in an effort to provide clarity to debates and arguments that include the question (or accusation) of whether someone has accepted autism or not. The word “acceptance” often imports an inherently negative attitude towards whatever is being accepted. For example, you might accept cancer, but there would be no need to accept that birds sing beautiful songs – there is no “coming to terms with” the latter. In this way, “acceptance” is referring to a mental state. In this initial sense of the word, some people will always take offense to the notion that one needs “acceptance” of autism; since it is not some negative thing that one has to come to terms with. However, discovering that someone has autism may initiate a grieving process, which need not be seen as a negative thing either; the grieving can be the adjustment and learning process through which a parent (for example) comes out the other end better informed and armed with the attitudes and skills that will help their child. So, coming out the other end of the grieving process might be called acceptance in this initial sense of “coming to terms” with autism, but the attitude that is arrived at may itself be particularly  positive . Which is to say – accepting autism might mean the person has moved from a negative attitude towards a decidedly positive one,  or it may mean they saw autism as negative, and have accepted that negativity at a cognitive level (perhaps moved beyond denial). “Acceptance” of autism can also refer to the existence of the condition. Autism is – after all – a contested term which is essentially defined by a grouping of symptoms designated from time to time by professionals in the field (rather than by, say, a simple blood-test or physical malformation). This type of acceptance can also be part of the initial meaning (accepting that person X has autism), since learning what autism is, is part of that process of coming to terms with person X having it. So accepting autism in this “existence” sense, can mean two distinct things; accepting that autism exists as a condition, and accepting that autism is the condition that person X has. Once someone accepts autism in the “coming to terms” sense, and the “existence” sense (in both forms), there comes the question of what they do about it – here I mean specifically in regards to coping with the symptoms. Again, there is more than one meaning here: They might accept autism’s symptoms by their inaction (“this is autism, I fully accept it and its manifestations”), or they might accept it by their action (“this is autism, I fully accept the challenges it presents and are ready to meet all of them with open eyes, dedicated to the task.”) These two types of acceptance in regards to the symptoms, are quite opposite in the resulting activity caused by the attitude. Closely related to the above version of in/activity autism acceptance re symptoms, is acceptance of autism as a permanent  condition. Here, accepting autism gets tied into the question of cause and cure (whereas above it was re the symptoms). If you “accept” autism in this sense, then some will see you as giving up on the fight for a cure: “I accept autism / I accept that it can’t be changed, my son will always have it”. This is often thought to include inactivity re symptoms (the previous type of acceptance) – but this is not necessarily true. You might accept that autism can’t be  removed  (that the child will always have it), yet be extremely active in efforts to alleviate the severity of the symptoms. The question of permanence – whether someone can be rid of autism or not – is separate from the acceptance of autism as inherent to the person. So, you might be attacked for not “accepting” your child –  despite  loving them, fighting for their rights, working on improving their skills, thinking it’s permanent, etc – because you haven’t accepted that your child is  inseparable  from autism. So if you were to say “I don’t think there will ever be a cure, and I love my child completely, but if there was a cure I would give it to my child”, you may very well be accused of not accepting them (often without further explanation of what it is you’re not accepting). All of these variations might be meant when someone says “I accept autism” or “I don’t accept autism”. The context will not always make their meaning clear, and frequently people do not elaborate on what they mean by acceptance either. I have attempted to elucidate the most common meanings (categories) I have come across, and to show how there are also variations within those categories. So, to summarise thus far: 
 “I accept autism” coming to terms sense: “I have come to terms with autism” (may be a process from negative to positive, or negative to accepting a negative). 
 “I accept autism” existence sense: “Autism exists” (may be in relation to the condition, or/and in relation to someone having the condition). 
 “I accept autism” in/activity sense re symptoms: In/actions re symptoms, reveal that they know this is autism, and their attitudes towards it. As in “my acceptance of autism is seen in how I am dedicated to the task of helping my autistic son” or “my acceptance of autism is seen in how I fully accept and do not fight its manifestations.” 
 “I accept autism” permanence sense: “I accept that autism cannot be removed from the child”. 
 “I accept autism” inherent sense: “I accept that autism is inherent to the child’s being / personality, so that to fight or feel badly towards autism, is to fight or feel badly towards the person affected.” 
 There is one more key element that I think must be mentioned to clarify debates and underlying emotions that involve the question of acceptance of autism. That is recognising categories that refer to superior knowledge; access to an objective truth that others must also reach before they too have seen the light. And categories that refer to the correct or superior attitude, making those who do not hold the same acceptance (or non-acceptance) as unworthy (morally, or as parents, etc). Categories where superior or objective truth are part of the claim, are 2, 4 and 5. So if someone doesn’t accept autism in those meanings, then they might be told they are ignorant. Categories where superior attitude is part of the claim, are 1, 3 and again 5 (which is perhaps why 5 is so often debated and so emotional – it comes under both categories as I’ve presented them here). So, to not have (or to have) accepted autism under those meanings, can be seen as grounds for moral judgment. There are obviously other ways in which people leave out the “of” or “that” when they talk about acceptance of autism (“acceptance that autism…”, “acceptance of autism’s…”), but many of the other examples I can think of, are either expressly stated at the time, or they fit into the broader categories captured in 1 to 5. For example, the claim “you need to accept that mercury causes autism” might be expressly stated, or comes particularly under category 4. Have I messed up this analysis – made it overly complicated or unhelpful – have I overlooked some core categories or meanings? Probably! This is just one night’s musings. Do let me know how you would have changed or refined it. Regardless of its precision or gaps, I hope I have made it clear that the question of “accepting” autism – and the moral and intellectual judgments that come along with statements of acceptance – are not one question, but many, and to avoid un-necessary upset and confusion, it is always worth making it clear what is being accepted: “Acceptance of autism” does not say it all.

"Philip Patston is a disabled white gay comedian, who asks us to think again about our use of labels. He recently took part in a TEDx talk in Auckland, which I share below and encourage you to watch and share too. It’s entitled “The Label Libel, A New Look at Diversity.” Patston covers a lot of ground in his talk; I just want to emphasize and reflect on certain elements that spoke to me as someone immersed in the autism world. What I say below is more tightly tailored to the disability world I see everyday than the more general issues he addresses. Though Patston rightly recognises the importance and value of using labels, he challenges us to take a closer look at the dysfunction of labels. Even within disability movements, there is a tendency to rely too heavily on labels to capture a “sameness,” that does a disservice to the uniqueness of the labeled individual. He asks us to consider that we each carry multiple aspects of humanity (ethnicity, health, gender, etc), which are scales of grey rather than black and white divisions. For example, healthy versus unhealthy is not always a useful and accurate division (a lesson I’ve learnt through my autistic son’s insistence that I label every conceivable food as one or the other!) Patston challenges us to get away from thinking of people in terms of the labels we place on them (or indeed, that they may place on themselves), and instead focus on commonality and uniqueness: In each of those aspects of humanity, we have things in common with others, and things that make us unique from others. So using a label can mask these divisions, not just in terms of the grey rather than the black and white on each scale, but also in terms of keeping an eye on the uniqueness we always retain despite carrying around our common labels. He uses a metaphor of “decay,” but in a positive way (which is quite clever, in the very fact that it undercuts the label of “decay” – you’ll have to watch his leaf analogy to truly appreciate the idea). There are two ways in which he asks us to decay existing paradigms, that I want to comment on: Identity, and agreement. Both of which commonly arise as issues in the autism community. In regards to identity, Patston encourages us to decay the notion that we are one thing, and not another. He wants us to resist locking ourselves (and others) into labels, which have the effect of highlighting one aspect of ourselves in a way that hides or belittles the rest of who we are. Which is to say (to restate what I said two paragraphs back), that not only can labels be misleading in their commonality and their black / white categorization, but they can also overly simplify our true complexity and lived realities. Over the past year I have become increasingly wary about the amount of power given to the idea of autism, when someone adopts it as the core of their identity, a power that is highlighted in times of diagnostic change. I accept that some take great comfort and positivity from choosing autism as their identity, but I think we must be careful about accepting any rhetoric that tells us this is the  only  way to truly accept and recognise “autism.” We should be wary (and critical) of the claim that those who deny autism as identity, are doing damage and an injustice to themselves (and to their children.) Which brings me to the second point of decay: Agreement. Patston thinks we should decay our need for agreement in community. That we should recognise that there is diversity ever-present even within a community that yet binds itself to a cause. A classic example of where this goes awry: a community might insist on and chastise those who do not use the “correct” language when referring to particular ideas. In the autism community, there is often talk that we must only use one phrase or word to talk about ourselves and others, and an outcry when people dare to not abide (for example, “autistic” versus “has autism,” and “disability” versus “differently abled”). By insisting on agreement and harshly judging those who do not conform, we again downplay the reality – the true diversity – among us: We may carry the commonality of living with autism (either in ourselves or our loved ones), but we also each bring with us uniqueness in our other aspects of humanity, and in our experiences and perspectives. Which is where I find the contradiction in the Autism Neurodiversity movement, quite maddening at times: To cry out for acceptance of diversity, but insist there is one right version of it. To group together under one title that names itself by diversity, but in doing so already defines how that diversity must be thought of and talked about. (For an extended examination of my views on the movement, see my post “ Acceptance of Diversity within Neurodiversity..? “) Similarly the insistence I’ve heard over the past couple of years that we should all just get along, that we should stop fighting with each other and focus on agreeing that we need more services and funding for all autistic people. In one sense, this accepts uniqueness, in that it acknowledges we have different views on terminology and the origins and nature of autism. However, it also assumes that agreement is possible in areas that are actually just as (beautifully) diverse: Our views on what is good for autistic people, on what is the good life, on politics, and economics, and on so many other ways in which true diversity remains. Insisting on agreement, ultimately aims to silence true disagreement, which sounds trite, but let me explain: It is better to acknowledge and hear the disagreement, than to hide it away and deny it is there or should even be there. The diversity of ideas about how to see and think about autism, forces us to confront our own assumptions, and challenges us to defend them. We may not like being put in that position – it may feel uncomfortable and even threatening – but denying others views don’t make them go away, and may leave those other people feeling just as uncomfortable and threatened. Better to speak openly and honestly and recognise diversity, than to pretend to speak for everyone in a group when really you speak for the portion that happens to already agree with you. A lot of this talk of accepting diversity may sound close to relativism or nihilism, but I argue it’s not that extreme, for two reasons: There is not the denial of truths and knowledge, rather the recognition of the complex and challenging reality that we all carry these commonalities and uniquenesses. Further, there is the explicit acceptance that there is positive value in the use and recognition of labels, but that value must be tempered by recognition of the down-sides and oversimplification caused by labels too. Making you agree with Patston’s own words, or with my elaboration and application of the them to the autism world, is not the end goal of my post. I only want to share these ideas, and share my musings on them, to see what comes of it. Not to force you to accept and agree and conform, but to re-think and reflect and re-see. At the very least, I think there is objective good that comes from pondering the use and misuse of labels, in particular in thinking about the point that if we must use labels – and it appears that we must – that as much as possible we must use them for the betterment of those labeled, rather than to hurt, restrict, or hide an individual’s uniqueness. But those are just the musings of a white atheist Jewish New Zealand mother… for want of a better label.

 Image via Wikipedia 
 When talking about my son, I will variously refer to him as “autistic” or that he is a child “with autism.” My choice at any point in time depends on what makes the sentence flow better, and provides the clearest meaning. However, for a significant number of people, their choice between the terms reflects what they think of as a more enlightened perspective and awareness of autism, than people who choose the other option. But which one is “more enlightened”, and why? It’s not nearly as straightforward as some claim. Such terminology choices supposedly reflect attitudes and beliefs about autism. Specifically: whether autism is one trait of many in an individual, or central to their identity; whether its existence is permanent or transitory; and whether autism is something horrible or beautiful. Furthermore, is the relevant attitude towards autism that is supposedly reflected in the chosen words, a reflection of the views of the person using the word, or a reflection of society’s attitudes towards autism as appreciated by the person using the word? Frankly, you’re going to be damned no matter which term you choose, and I’m far more interested in the substance of what someone says rather than getting hooked up on whether they used “autistic” or “has autism”. But I do think it’s worth explaining the depth of confusion and contradiction involved in claims that choosing one type of terminology over another reveals something vital about your attitude towards autism. I’m going to begin with the attitude that autism is just a trait of a person, rather than the whole identity of the person. Usually, those holding this view will argue for the use of the terminology , “has/with autism” rather than “autistic.” But is the trait a changeable one, or an inherent one? Is it something that can be altered with time (eg, is autism curable), or is it more like eye colour (you can make it look different externally but it is always there underneath)? If it’s the former, you’re more likely to use “has autism”, if it’s the latter, you’re more likely to say “is autistic” despite the fact that it is just a trait. So already we see that the idea of autism being a trait rather than central to identity, isn’t a clear-cut answer to chosen terminology. But it gets worse. Let’s accept that it is either transitory or permanent, but definitely a trait (rather than central to the person); that still won’t mean one type of phrase is more accurate or enlightened than the other. For example, let’s say my eyes are blue. You could say I have blue eyes or I am blue-eyed. Both is OK, though the former does perhaps feel more natural. But if you use the latter, you have not denied it is merely a trait, and made the error of equating my entire being with the trait (as many claim re using the word “autistic”), you are just making an observation about something I have. That hardly makes the person who calls someone else “blue-eyed”, cruel by equating my whole being with my blue-eyedness. Even if we accept that autism is just a trait, and it is important to not equate the whole person with the trait by referring to them as “autistic” (which I have already pointed out, isn’t a particularly strong argument), the moral relevance of that equating it with identity, depends on your view of whether autism is a good thing or a bad thing. If the “trait” of autism is seen as a negative thing, then you are far more likely to want to distance it from the person; it is just something they  have , not something they  are . Whereby using the terminology “has autism” might make more sense. But if the owning of the autism trait, is seen as a trait, but a positive one, you are more likely to have no compunctions about the phrase, “is autistic”, since it’s not going to demean or mark out the person in some cruel way. But who’s opinion towards autism matters? If you’re worried about society’s attitude towards autism – you know it’s not the end of the world but society thinks it is – then you may push for the “has autism” designation. But if society’s attitude does suck monkey balls, and you want to change it, you might actually encourage people to use “autistic” as a show of pride and intentional ownership of the supposed trait. The strongest position for consistently using “has autism” then, is reflected by the view that (a) autism is at least potentially transitory, rather than a permanent aspect of the person, (b) autism is a trait rather than a larger aspect of identity, and (c) it is a negative trait. As soon as you start to vary from those three parts, the argument for preferential use of “has autism” weakens even further (and it was pretty weak to begin with). Basically, the analogy of some unpleasant disease would be the strongest comparison. In the same way that you wouldn’t call some one “cancerian” (unless you were referring to their star-sign), you would say they “have cancer.” What then, are the active (rather than re-active) claims for using the term “autistic”, and do these arguments fare any better in their persuasive force? “Autistic”, like “Jewish” or “African” can be used as a partial descriptor of identity. Except, autism is more than “one of many” aspects of someone’s identity. Whether autism is transitory (potentially curable) or permanent, it affects so much of how the individuals observes, understands, and operates within the world, that referring to someone as “autistic” tells you a lot about them. Most people who actively adopt the word “autistic” in preference to “has autism”, see autism as something inherent to the person; that even if the symptoms of autism can be covered up with enough behavioural training and will-power, that autism still permeates the thought-processes of the person so that they remain “autistic” (even though autism is identified by its symptoms). Many people who choose to use the word “autistic” also adopt it as a power-term; signifying pride and belonging. Considering the largely negative opinions of society (at least historically) towards autism, this might be seen as a movement to own and redefine a label in a positive way “yes, my son / I am autistic, you got a problem with that?”. Alternately, it can just be seen as an acceptance of a truth about one-self at a more observational (less emotive) level: “I am autistic” much like “I am female.” Usually it’s a mix of the two: A sort of acceptance of an observational truth. The attack that calling someone autistic, means you are ignoring the person behind the autism, is a presumption that the autism and the person are separable, which is not self-evident. It is also a presumption that calling someone autistic means we have forgotten the rest of their identity. This is rather absurd; it would be like saying that calling someone “Christian” means you have forgotten their gender, their hair colour, their relationship status, etc. This idea – that calling someone autistic appears to cancel out other aspects of their identity – again seems to turn on the notion that knowing or seeing someone as autistic, damages or hurts them in some way. And now we’re back to the negative view of autism, and whose negative view is relevant (society’s or the individual speaking) and how that attitude can be changed (by proudly adopting the terminology, or by fighting it by showing the person behind the label). It would seem that the strongest position for using the word “autistic” to define a person in preference to “has autism” is (a) when autism is seen as a permanent aspect of a  person, (b) that is central to their identity rather than a trait (for example), and (c) autism is seen as having positive connotations. As soon as you soften any of these three notions, you’ll strengthen the pull of the alternate phrase, “has autism.” Frankly though, a preference for the use of either “has autism” or “is autistic” isn’t strong either way. And the presumptions people place on others about their beliefs, for using one term rather than the other, are usually poorly or inadequately thought-out (or at least, poorly or inadequately expressed). At the very least, attacking some poor soul for not using what you think is the “right” terminology, is not wise. Better to always read what they have to say; look at their content rather than their turn of phrase. Particularly if their message contradicts your assumptions about the beliefs expressed in the chosen phrase. Like I said at the start, I prefer to pick and choose the terminology as suits my writing style at the time. Sometimes “has autism” is cumbersome and drags out a sentence. Sometimes “autistic” doesn’t provide the right emphasis or deliver the right punch. Hell, sometimes I choose which one I want purely cause it sounds great: “The awesome artistic autistic” sounds better than “the awesome artistic person with autism.” Or “The child with a beautiful mind, a soaring soul, and autism” delivers a different feel and focus than “the autistic child with a beautiful mind and a soaring soul.” Sometimes the message you are trying to get across with your writing is held back by being forced to choose a particular phraseology. There are times when there are objective and convincing arguments for the choice of one phrase over another, but in my own musings and experience, I do not think choosing between “autistic” and “has autism” is one of those cases.

"12946" "19" "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2015/11/27/religious-erasure-is-still-erasure/" "Religious erasure is still erasure" "I lost a Facebook friend a few weeks ago. We didn’t know each other offline.  I wonder if things would’ve gone differently if we had.  A meme featuring what sounded like a Richard Dawkins-derived quote was shared. I protested. The conversation didn’t recover. So here’s the thing. I understand that a lot of people say strident and absolutist things about religion out of anger at their own experiences. I can completely and fully accept someone else’s right to be hurt and resentful of their own bad religious experience. I am fully aware that such experiences are all too common and entirely real. No shortage of people have no shortage of solid reasons to be resentful of the religion they grew up with. And I still just can’t deal with it when they go around declaring that “religion” is only ever this oppressive, anti-thought, patriarchal monolith. Because almost intrinsically, what that’s saying is, “Your faith tradition, your community, your religious background, don’t exist. Because religion that isn’t like  this  doesn’t exist.” It’s no more true than the fact that the taiga exists makes deciduous forests not exist. Those are both ecosystems. They’re both forests. They share some important features of forest ecosystems. But they are also different ecosystems in vital ways. Temperate rainforests and tropical rainforests also both exist. Subtropical deserts and alpine deserts both exist. I think I have not seen any other topic, especially among otherwise very well-educated, liberal people, about which it is still so accepted to say “My experience is the only genuine one. This was my experience, so that’s the way it  really  is.” And not just accepted, but considered clever and enlightened. We don’t accept that with regard to sexuality or ethnic or cultural background, or gender, or even linguistic background (with AAVE and Appalachian dialects increasingly recognized as fully valid ways to speak English—there isn’t just one static, proper incarnation of “real” English). We increasingly don’t accept it with regard to neurology or disability. (What I’m absolutely not saying is that anti-religious bigotry is the “last acceptable prejudice.” It isn’t. It’s simply a popular one in some factions of society. It’s not the last acceptable prejudice, but it is one of the broadest common examples of a No True Scotsman fallacy.) But it is hugely acceptable and even considered laudable in many intellectual circles to declare “This is what religion is and this is what religion does and this is categorically true because it was my experience.” Things get painfully ironic when anti-religion absolutists claiming that faith fundamentally precludes the exercise of rational skills, refuse to apply those same skills themselves when, and only when, the topic is the mere existence of varieties of religious faith other than those with which they are familiar. Then very observable facts don’t matter. World history doesn’t matter. Cultural diversity isn’t a thing. Religion only ever behaves in one way. Listen. I have spent the vast majority of my life fighting my own erasure in multiple ways. There are so damned many ways in which people have tried to write me out of my own experience. “No, you can’t be both this and this.” Real people don’t work like that.  I  don’t understand, so  you  are mistaken about your own experience. You are what we say you are and your experiences are what we say they are. It didn’t work when I was ten, and it doesn’t now. I don’t believe for a single solitary second that religious belief should be held above criticism or interrogation, or that the implications of statements of faith shouldn’t have to stand up to some kind of critical or ethical examination. There are all kinds of debates about religious thought that I’m happy to have, and that we should as a society be having. Pretty much the  one  fight that I just can’t with right now is that religious faith like that which I’ve experienced my entire life doesn’t actually exist. Or isn’t actually religion because it’s not what someone who doesn’t share that experience has decided it must be. (And anyway, if religion is only, ever, inevitably repressive, misogynistic, homophobic, anti-intellectual, authoritarian, etc…. then how do we expect to be able to ask religious communities to be better? If the only true alternative is that they cease to exist? We actually  lose  a lot of ability to make useful criticisms if religion can only be considered as this insidious, monolithic, one-dimensional thing, not taking into account actual diversity of belief and practice.) And I’m just at a point right now where I can’t cope with it or engage with it. And I don’t think that fully owning the fact that so many people have been hurt by religion means that I have to shut up and take it in the face of blatant denial of the very existence or possibility of experiences that are not that, or of communities like the one I grew up in and like the one I’m blessed enough to have now, and of even more faith experiences outside even my own ability to imagine or conceive of. There’s a difference between listening, and consenting to erasure. But having these arguments turns out to be constructive an infinitesimally small percentage of the time. Relationships in which I have to continually defend the existence and acceptability of something pretty integral to who I am and my experience of the world are not relationships I have the energy for right now. And frankly I become skeptical of your feminism or your anti-racism or your neurodiversity acceptance if you then go and say “Religion should be eradicated.” That’s a serious qualifier on your support for the self-determination of people whose religious or faith experience is intrinsically tied up with their lived experience of gender, family, racial identity, culture, or neurodivergence. I think people can be not bad people, and be validly hurt in ways that don’t play well together, and with sadness, I conclude that that may be the case if someone else’s pain means that they have to make these absolutist pronouncements that fundamentally misrepresent or erase another group of people and their belief systems.

 Generally I consider myself pretty open-minded.  That being said, open-mindedness is not about lacking prejudice, but the willingness to re-evaluate and discard prejudices when faced with new information.  Prejudices and bias are natural human tendencies, resulting from our subjective perceptions and limited ability to process and extrapolate information from our environment.  Their naturalness, however, doesn’t justify acting on prejudice.  Thus, wrong is not in the holding of prejudices, but in the unwillingness to let them go and/or acting on the prejudices we hold in a way that harms others.  As we are subjected to new information, open-minded people re-evaluate and possibly change the prejudices they hold—but they’re still prejudices, because we never have all the pertinent information and never are able to filter that information we do have without bias.  For Christians, this statement would fall under:  “For all have sinned and all have fallen short of the glory of God.”  Thus is the imperfection of man while in this mortal coil. 
 Being open-minded does not prevent one from having strong, even near-immutable beliefs.  For me, one of these beliefs is the importance of ethical and moral behavior.  For clarification, I distinguish ethical beliefs as being wholly individual and moral beliefs as being those that are formed in conjunction with a socially recognized belief structure (often, but not exclusively, religious in nature).  For example, Catholicism is a moral belief system.  Ethical beliefs that are formed in conjunction with a belief in and adherence to the Catholic religion are moral beliefs.  In kind, science is a moral belief system, which can (but is not always) practiced with the adherence others give to religions.  Ethical beliefs that are formed in conjunction with a belief in and adherence to science are moral beliefs.  I care less  what  your morals are based on, and more on how  highly  you raise your standards and how much you  strive  to follow them.  Any belief system, when practiced with the requisite high standards and effort, makes you a beneficial force (though others may consider your standards and efforts misguided) unto the rest of humanity.  And that, for me, is the crux.  If your beliefs lead you toward benefiting others, then I would hold that your ethics are good; if your beliefs lead you toward self-gain at the expense of others, then I would hold that your ethics are bad.  Having good ethics, of course, is insufficient if you don’t strive to live by them. 
 So, one of my immutable or near-immutable beliefs is that everyone can choose to have high ethical standards and everyone can strive to live those standards.  For this reason, I have never held developmental disabilities or lack of sanity as a sufficient “excuse” to justify or explain away unethical behavior.  For example, I’ve always believed that a mass murder is no less responsible and no less punishable, just because he happens to be insane.  A man is no less responsible and no less punishable for raping another human being, just because he happens to be developmental delayed. 
 I have thought for quite a while that my ethical and moral standards were, well, immutable.  I couldn’t imagine any piece of information that would shake these beliefs.  Then, in reading from a textbook, I ran into two little words that carried a punch that knocked me off of my proverbial socks and high-horse all at once:  morally challenged. 
 As I started this discussion, I said that I consider myself to be open-minded and this involves re-evaluating my prejudices when faced with new information.  Thus, when I ran into this statement I had to stop and re-evaluate my position: 
 Another key contributor to a person’s ethics and morality is his or her  level of moral development .  Some workers are morally advanced, while others are morally challenged—a condition that often develops early in life. 
 The Fundamentals of Organizational Behavior,  4 th  ed., by Andrew J. DuBrin, 2007, pg. 75 
 Hm?  Moral deficiencies described in the language of disability.  You know, that makes a reasonable amount of logical sense—I can’t just dismiss it out of hand.  But, the implications (at least for me) are rather huge.  So, what to do?   Research! 
 From what I can gather, the above passage refer to (without actually discussing) Kohlberg’s Theory of Moral Reasoning, which I found in  this link  (it’s a PDF of a chapter from a textbook).  The link had the following table: 
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 It does not assert at which level someone would need to be at in order to be considered “morally challenged.”  I also found the following  PowerPoint presentation  online.  This explores how contemporary U.S. values (as they’re taught) are affecting society (psst, it’s not good!). 
 One thing the PowerPoint suggests, which I’m going to say flat out, is that it does not seem likely that contemporary U.S. society will come to see being “morally challenged” as a disability any time soon.  It seems, rather, that we encourage this state.  Yes, I know—you’re shocked (sarcastically speaking). 
 But if being morally challenged should rightfully be considered a form of developmental disability, which the above theory implies even if it were never explicitly stated, then should I not take that into consideration when I try to hold others to my standards of ethical development?  (I reiterate: this doesn’t mean I believe everyone should share my ethical and moral beliefs, but that they should develop postconventional moral reasoning skills and have high standards of ethical and moral behavior of their own). 
 To clarify, I do not believe that someone’s value or inherent worth should be subject to their intellectual development or capabilities.  Nor do I believe that someone’s value or inherent worth should be subject to their physical development or capabilities.  If moral development can be similarly hindered, impaired, or “capped”, then should I not extend the same sense of value to those who are morally challenged as I would to someone who his intellectually or physically challenged?  My instinctive reaction is  NO!!!!   People who are morally impaired, but are not impaired in any other way have done this world great damage; they continue to do so.  I resist, on a strong emotional level, giving them any room for “excuses” like having a disability. 
 But, then my own ethics kick in.  Ethically speaking, part of the reason for not de-valuing someone with a disability is because having the disability is not their fault (this is only  part  of the reasoning; I’m not suggesting this is the best or most important reason).  If someone is morally challenged, and thus commits an immoral act, would it also be “not their fault?”  Not to mention (this is one of those much more important reasons) that, despite the harm they do, they still have inherent value as a fellow human being. 
 I’m torn.  I really am.  Emotionally, I find this “excuse” unacceptable.  Ethically and intellectually, I stand back and look at my reaction and see some of the same unreasonable prejudice flung at the friends and family I care so dearly for and write so much about. 
 Is being “morally challenged” a disability?  And how does the social model influence that?  Socially speaking, being morally challenged is an asset.  It lets people rationalize doing all sorts of things for the sake of self-interest.  Therefore, if the social model is exactly right, then being “morally challenged” isn’t a disability at all.  (Otherwise, I’m misunderstanding the implications of the social model, which is entirely possible.)  In fact, if the social model were to apply, then being morally developed would be the disability and all those unethical people should offer us accommodations to compensate for our lack of unethicalness.  Which, of course, is absurd on two counts:  1) I don’t want to gain advantages through mine or anyone else’s unethical behavior, which would include accommodations of this sort; 2) unethical people would not voluntarily offer accommodations of this sort and, were this line of thinking valid, ethical people would lack the power to enforce the accommodations on those uncooperative “unethicals.” 
 However, if there is something inherent about the state of being disabled, something that is exacerbated by the social model, then whether it is recognized as such or not being “morally challenged” would be a disability.  If so, then what does it mean?  Are people who are morally challenged fully culpable for their actions as is someone who is not morally challenged?  If not, then how would we measure that to determine what level of responsibility they hold?  Or am I simply taking a theoretical explanation of ethical behavior too far without enough evidence to justify the theory? 
 It’s times like these when I almost wished I was a prejudiced, unethical schmuck who could cling to my beliefs even after they’ve been legitimately questioned.  This re-evaluation process takes work, and it’s rarely simple.  Am I resisting this re-evaluation on a purely emotional level or is there a real flaw with my analysis thus far?  I don’t know, so I have to pick at it and put it out there.  It would be simpler if I just accepted that my prejudice was right and good, and left it at that.  But, then again, the sheer number of people who do that is one of the things that makes this world such a difficult place to live.

"15326" "25" "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2012/01/worthiness/" "Worthiness" "
 Worthiness is a concept that haunts much of human existence.  In a world of finite resources, we cannot seem to grasp the infinite worth of our fellow human beings.  Being creatures of such a world, even our religions reflect our desire to designate worthy and unworthy human beings.  Science does no better in this regard.  Politics often does worse. 
 People define worthy attributes in myriad ways.  For some, the predominant consideration is genealogy.  Genealogical worthiness permeates much of the Bible, particularly the Old Testament, and it has hardened the hearts of many Jews, Muslims, and Christians.  There are those who are worthy and there are those who are Gentiles; there are those who are worthy and there are those who are infidels.  (Christians use both terms to describe those who are unworthy, plus they have the legacy of Election—which I do not claim to understand.) 
 Genealogical worthiness is also present in science, though perhaps it could be better called gene-o-logical, since scientists tend to be less concerned with the specific ancestors from whom you’ve sprung and more concerned with the actual genes you’ve inherited. 
 Genealogical worthiness also permeates politics.  Both Nationalism (which can have some positive aspects to it) and genocide (which is 100% negative) are products of political ideas of genealogical worthiness.  But there are others.  Eugenics was a strange hybrid of politics and science, and its effects linger in contemporary politics despite the many efforts to destroy this debunked theory. 
 But genealogical worthiness is far from the only consideration.  After all, nobody chooses their genealogy and many of us are willing to give at least a little consideration to choice.  Those who choose to pursue higher education are often considered “more worthy” than those who don’t—considerations of equal opportunity are often negated in these arguments.  Those who choose to purchase responsibly are often considered “more worthy” than those who don’t—what makes a worthy purchase depends, of course, on the prevailing perspective, from the responsible use of credit to green living and many considerations in between. 
 And, of course, worthiness is also a matter of ability.  Those who are able are obviously more worthy than those who aren’t—and for many this belief is so obvious, so strongly assumed, that the assumptions it is based on are never even questioned. 
 The worthiness of people with autism is degraded on all three counts.  Genealogically or gene-o-logically, autistics are inferior.  There’s something wrong with the genes and that makes them at least susceptible to autism.  Shame on them.  They’re not worthy.  But, of course, being autistic—at least,  acting  autistic is a choice.  Passing—the contemporary equivalent to being cured—is a choice.  It’s a choice to do the work to be able to pass and it’s a choice to do the work to actually pass.  Those who fail to pass have made the wrong choices—opportunity, or lack thereof, to learn effective passing strategies is irrelevant, because if they really wanted to learn, then they would have.  Choosing not to pass makes them unworthy.  Shame on them.  Finally, ability makes them unworthy.  They are not as able as neurologically typical people, and they should be.  They should be able to mingle successfully in a crowded room full of noisy party-goers.  They should be able to sit quietly in a classroom and absorb the teacher’s lectures like a sponge.  They should be able to hold down a job without accommodations—who do they think they are to ask, they’re not even worthy to have a job considering how many able people are out of work.  Shame on them.  Strike one, strike two, strike three, autism is out. 
 The above paragraph is, of course, an illustrative example.  I believe it happens; I believe people think like that.  But I am not one of them. 
 Human worth cannot truly and accurately be measured by our genealogy (or gene-o-logy).  Human worth cannot truly and accurately be measured by our choices, at least not without considering our genuine opportunities and our unique circumstances.  (And it shouldn’t be about how much we choose to accomplish in order to “prove” our worth, but whether we choose to hurt others for personal pleasure and gain.)  Human worth most certainly cannot be measured by our abilities. 
 Hello, I am the mother of three children with autism.  I am worthy to live, to reproduce, and to raise my children.  All four of my children are worthy of living, dreaming, loving, and having opportunities for personal growth and betterment.  Whether you are autistic or not, you are worthy.  Whether you are college educated or not, you are worthy.  Whether you are rich and powerful or not, you are worthy.  Whether you are able to live a normal and independent life or not, you are worthy. 
 You are of infinite worth beyond human imagination just for being you.  And so is everyone else.

"6628" "8" "https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/two-versions-of-pathologizing-normal/" "Two Versions of “Pathologizing Normal.”" "I recently realised that people with diametrically opposing views on the existence and validity of conditions like autism, appear to make the same argument about the modern trend to “pathologize normality.” So I decided to break-down the argument that is otherwise so briefly summarised in that phrase. At which point it became clear that the “pathologizing normal” argument can stand for (at least) two very different views of humanity and of mental difference; that the seeming agreement on the phenomenon was strictly superficial. So, for the sake of clarity – and the hope of more open dialogue next time I encounter the phrase – I want to attempt to explain these two versions, as I understand them. The first version goes something like this: There is a modern trend to put labels on completely normal children. On children who are just a little shy or withdrawn, or just full of energy, or just poorly disciplined. These children don’t have ADHD or Aspergers or ODD etc, they’re just the perfectly normal kids we’ve always had in society, but are now receiving these trending labels because of various motivations. Examples of those motivations include parents who refuse to accept their own parenting is at fault, and clinicians who want to make money from providing therapies and drugs to these kids. When it comes to adults seeking and attaining these labels for themselves, it is because these adults want excuses to behave poorly / avoid taking responsibility for their behaviour. The fact is that conditions like these don’t exist. It’s just the pathologization of normal (however undesirable or unpleasant that “normal” may be). The second version of the argument goes something like this: Conditions like Aspergers, ADHD etc, are real “conditions,” but they are part of the normal human spectrum of experience and existence. These conditions are treated though as if they are wrong and need “correcting:” These people are put on drugs and through endless therapies and in other ways told that what they are is wrong and must change. Instead we should be supporting and encouraging these individuals to be the best they can with their talents, and to work with their challenges in a positive light. We shouldn’t be labeling them as sick or deficient, to do so is to pathologize normal. This second argument often comes hand-in-hand with an attack on any attempt to define “normal.” They frequently question the validity of a distinction between “normal” and “abnormal,” instead using the word “normal” in this context to capture the point that human experience is brilliantly diverse and valid in all its diversity: That pathologizing people with Aspergers (etc) is a denial and attack on that necessary and natural diversity. Both versions of the argument have a few things in common: Concern about the impact – and abuse – of labels; concern about the perceived readiness with which professionals turn to drugs to deal with “troubled” people; and concern that various conditions are included in mental health manuals at all (or the ways in which those conditions are defined in those manuals). However the views clearly and seriously diverge when it comes to perceptions about the legitimacy of the conditions at issue, and that is at the very core of the first version of the argument. Furthermore, the seeming agreement on the concerns listed above, is largely superficial. For example, whereas the first version of the argument would see a label like “Aspergers” to be negative and unhelpful, the second version may see the label as something helpful and positive to be proud of. And whereas the first version argumenters might want conditions like these wiped from the “mental health” manuals altogether (and not continue to exist anywhere else either), the second version arguers may wish the conditions to be less negatively defined and not be considered a type of “disorder” rather than a difference. So next time you encounter someone who wants to run a short-hand argument that we’re seeing a modern trend of pathologizing the normal – that what was once treated (or should be treated) as normal and natural, has come to be seen as sick and abnormal – before you agree with them and wonder how you disagree on everything else but see eye-to-eye on this, now perhaps you’ll be better able to identify just how deep that disagreement really runs. I, at least, have been in this position in the past and not being able to pin-point the very real difference in views. I’d be interested to hear whether you have used the shorthand “pathologizing normal,” what you personally meant by it, and why you hold the view. I know some of my commenters in the past have tried to argue that this is a modern trend, I would love to hear whether I’ve captured your concerns, or if there’s a third version of this argument that I haven’t even considered yet.

"16071" "26" "http://www.esteeklar.com/2012/10/06/reflections-on-the-acceptance-of-disability-in-society/" "Reflections on the Acceptance of Disability in Society" "Is there a place for the disabled in society? The purpose of the title is from historical readings that the disabled in history were displaced and living on the margins of society. Who were considered/are considered valued members of society?  Socities have been obsessed with placing the disabled into a variety of contexts that justifies human existence, or fears (demons, monsters, mad, deviants) making the normal the privileged members. Without a comparative measure, as it were, what would we humans deem ourselves to be?  I have a series of questions that I’ll be considering (probably for a lifetime). Feel free to try and contribute thoughts in the comment box. Pro/claiming Autistic Identity: Is claiming biological identify leading to another possible eugenics movement? Is there a danger to biological self-identification? How important are self-identification and self-advocacy and pride-movements?  Are pride movements perpetuating the dis/abled dichotomies that already oppress? Do you think they have a positive purpose? Should there be a point at which we stop advancing pride movements, in other words, move beyond them? When is a good time to do so? How important is the label autism to accommodation if autism is a social construct? (It is). Where “special” and enforcing “inclusion” have already proved challenging, maybe even impossible thus far, is it so because we continue to place the disabled out of the confines of the norm. In other words, are we continuing to perpetuate a false dichotomy that does little to value and serve, but more to segregate and isolate? By wanting inclusion, we are saying we are excluded? Does this stance further the goal itself, or not any longer? Who Gets To Produce Knowledge About Autism? The DSMV, behavioural analysis and observation, and the categorization of people.  Who gets to diagnose whom? Who gets to produce knowledge and categories about autism? In the past, and to a large extent today, it is non-autistic or “normal” people and we now witness a gradual inclusion of disabled “voices” to this mix. Do disabled individuals appropriate notions of impairment and abnormality enforced by long-held categories made originally by people who have not had disabilities? After all, autistic people are still largely tokenized minorities among autism charities, autism committees, and as participants in autism research studies. Accommodation and Acceptance: To what extent is the citing of needs/impairments an important part (or not) of acknowledging that we are all part of the abled-disabled continuum, which herein, I have already parsed?  Do you think the term autism and/or disability will exist one hundred years from now? Or are we a society that simply wears the same dress, just in different colours?  Have we learned anything from autistic self-advocates that assist us to simply accept autistic individuals and value the right of all people to exist, be educated, and be valued, no matter what level of disability, in society? Utopias and ideals have perpetuated individual and societal notions about what we should be – what we are versus what we aspire to be. To what extent may this continue to be a driving force (as in survivial of the fittest) under an capitalist/economic lens, and where are we now with this “force” in viewing the disabled as part of this? As disability has always been a part of human existence, despite eugenics movement’s attempts at normalizing society and eradicating “deviant” people from the norms, how far have we come to accepting, embracing and valuing human difference? After all, while the eugenicists caused great harm to many people, and have continued to do so as a legacy, they didn’t succeed in eradicating human difference.* Reference: *In reference to the eugenics movement from Davis, “Constructing Normalcy” in  Enforcing Normalcy: Disability Deafness and the Body , pp. 23-49, 1995: “The conflation of disability with depravity itself expressed itself in the formulation ‘defective class.’ As the president of the University of Wisconsin declared after World War One, ‘we know enough about eugenics so that if the knowledge were applied, the defective classes would disappear within a generation.’ At it must be reiterated that the eugenics movement was not stocked with eccentrics…Rockefeller, Churchill, Roosevelt, H.G. Wells, John Maynard Keynes”…among a longer list. Some food for thought when thinking about such questions.

 As you’re no doubt aware, an ad hominem attack is fallacious where the person making the argument is attacked instead of the argument itself. When addressing an argument, you need to deal with the premises and logic that lead to the conclusion, not the  person  presenting those premises and logic. However, if one of the premises is an appeal to authority (“Joe is a scientific expert, and Joe says this scientific proposition is true, therefore it is true”) then an ad hominem attack can be justified because it is attacking one of the premises (Joe’s authority). Again though, the relevant aspect of the authority must be attacked – you could attack Joe’s scientific expertise, but attacking his marital status would be irrelevant. This brings me to a very common attack made on autistic people, when they express a positive opinion about autism. A classic example can be seen in the particularly controversial  Amanda Baggs , who does not see autism is an inherently negative thing – rather as a difference – despite it having a severe impact on her daily life. You can see her most well-known video on  Youtube here . There are a lot of ways one can attack her opinions and attitudes towards autism. One of the more extreme ways is to attack the idea that she even has autism: To attack the diagnosis. This attack is potentially valid, because she purports to speak from experience, so if you can attack the experience aspect of her “argument”, then the ad hominem is going to the appeal to authority, and so is not (inherently at least) fallacious. However, unless you can definitely disprove someone’s diagnosis of autism (which is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible), then attacking the diagnosis is not a good or worthwhile argument. (Although I must say, some people have done a  remarkably intensive job  of trying to prove Amanda Baggs doesn’t have autism.) It is also a particularly cruel attack; denying someone’s life experiences, and calling them a liar who is harming genuinely afflicted people, is rather extreme. It is always going to be a better approach to deal with the other premises and logic that make up their argument. (For example, attacking the choice to live off government assistance and other people’s daily help while “sinking into autism”, instead of working towards the ability to live independently as much as possible.) This style of attack – attacking the diagnosis instead of the argument – is also commonly used against people with Aspergers or high functioning autism, especially when they argue that autism is “difference” rather than “disability” (you’ll find plenty of examples in the comments sections of blogs about autism). The attack often takes one of two forms. Either “you don’t really have autism” or “Aspergers isn’t really autism” (therefore you can’t speak on behalf of autistic people who are genuinely suffering). The first of those attacks, as mentioned previously, is difficult or impossible to prove, and the second is quite simply false (and is going to be “even more” false if /when the  new diagnostic criteria get rid of the term Aspergers altogether, folding it into the word “autism” ). When people speak from their own experience of autism, and the opinions they share about autism don’t match our own, the better starting point is to remind such people (and ourselves) that autism is a spectrum disorder, with enormous variations in quality of life and autism’s impact on their lives. Yes, autism can affect how the world is interacted with and understood in some very similar ways across the entirety of the spectrum, but how big an impact that has on an individual’s life, and whether it affects what they personally choose to do with their life, still differs. One person on the spectrum simply cannot speak for all people on the spectrum, because of such individual differences. Their personal experiences though can provide insights, understanding, awareness. These debates about one person with a disability trying to speak on behalf of all people with that disability, are not unique to the autism community. The attack on the word “disability” – preferring to refer to it as “difference” – is also common. A good example is the ongoing debate within the deaf community, where some  attack others for encouraging and using cochlear implants that allow people in their community to hear better . There will always be debates about whether something is a disability or a difference, with one side saying the other is unenlightened and trying to murder-by-cure, with the other side fighting back just as strongly for the freedom, independence, and quality of life that is otherwise restricted by the condition. We need to accept the presence of that ongoing dialogue, and be open to the range of voices who want to add to it – whether speaking as a person with autism, or indeed a person without autism (not having autism doesn’t mean your opinions and insights about autism are invalid or irrelevant either). It’s hard not to be emotional when debating autism, especially when children and their futures are involved. When people get emotional, they resort to ad hominems very quickly. And ad hominem attacks usually feed return ad hominem attacks. It can get ugly pretty quickly. These debates are important though. Trying to focus on the structure of the arguments put forward – the premises, the logic – is the respectful, and stronger, approach. Being aware of the fact you’re making an ad hominem attack – and understanding when such an attack is actually justified (because yes, it sometimes is) – is a good starting point. *** Please note that the point of this piece is not to attack Amanda Baggs, or the deaf community, or indeed any one  other  than those who wrongfully use ad hominem attacks in debates about disabilities versus difference.

Showcase: Autistic Hoya's The Significance of Semantics: Person-First Language: Why It Matters
" "
 The Significance of Semantics: Person-First Language: Why It Matters by Lydia At the Adult Services Subcommittee's final meeting last Wednesday, much to do was made about semantic disagreements -- \"ASD individual\" versus \"individual with ASD,\" and of course, the dreaded \"person with autism\" or \"person who has autism\" versus \"autistic person.\" These issues of semantics are hot button issues, and rightfully so. Words and language are powerful tools by which an individual can express ideas, whether abstract, actionable, or concrete. As a writer and editor, I know firsthand that language and the meanings we attach to words very much impact, influence, develop, and change the attitudes that we have toward the subjects of discussion. That is why people are easily insulted or upset by word choices. Changing a phrase -- even if it holds the same literal meaning -- alters the subtle connotations and nuances of the speech, and communicates a different meaning and context than the original phrasing. In the autism community, many self-advocates and their allies prefer terminology such as \"Autistic,\" \"Autistic person,\" or \"Autistic individual\" because we understand autism as an inherent part of an individual's identity -- the same way one refers to \"Muslims,\" \"African-Americans,\" \"Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender/Queer,\" \"Chinese,\" \"gifted,\" \"athletic,\" or \"Jewish.\" On the other hand, many parents of Autistic people and professionals who work with Autistic people prefer terminology such as \"person with autism,\" \"people with autism,\" or \"individual with ASD\" because they do not consider autism to be part of an individual's identity and do not want their children to be identified or referred to as \"Autistic.\" They want \"person-first language,\" that puts \"person\" before any identifier such as \"autism,\" in order to emphasize the humanity of their children. Yet, while I have been familiar with this rift among the autism community over the use of \"person with autism\" as opposed to \"Autistic person,\" I hadn't fully explored the diversity of perspectives on the topic until now. During last Wednesday's meeting, one subcommittee member, who I believe is the parent of an Autistic child, and an Autistic self-advocate expressed disagreement over the terms. Feedback from one of our members suggested changing \"ASD individual\" in our report to \"individual with ASD.\" The Autistic self-advocate sitting beside me, who also has an Autistic brother, voiced her objection to use of the term. \"I disagree,\" she said as the suggestion was read aloud. \"I'm not a person with autism; I am Autistic.\" Immediately, a mother sitting next to her responded, \"I come from a time where that word, 'autistic,' had -- still has -- a negative meaning. It's offensive. When someone refers to my son as 'the autistic,' I cringe at that word; I get ready to defend him.\" After our meeting, I took the time to explore a wealth of opinions online about the use of person-first language -- from those who support it and those who oppose it. The theory behind person-first language is that it puts the person before the disability or the condition, and emphasizes the value and worth of the individual by recognizing them as a person instead of a condition. And that's a great idea. In fact, when discussing specific people, I have never once heard anyone -- self-advocate, parent, teacher, or otherwise -- refer to a person as anything except by his or her name. I can't think of any teacher -- at least any decent one -- who would refer to a student as \"that Autistic kid,\" or \"that kid with autism.\" And I certainly can't think of any parent who wouldn't refer to his or her child by name. But why are we self-advocates so opposed to this terminology? Aren't we all about de-emphasizing and correcting inaccurate, misleading, and harmful stereotypes and attitudes? Right? From that other perspective, you would think we would support the use of person-first language, because we want to be seen as people with equal rights, value, and worth to non-Autistic people. But we don't. Because when people say \"person with autism,\" it does have an attitudinal nuance. It suggests that the person can beseparated from autism, which simply isn't true. It is impossible to separate a person from autism, just as it is impossible to separate a person from the color of his or her skin. One argument I encountered in one of the more cogently-written papers in favor of person-first language expostulates that because cancer patients are referred to as \"people with cancer\" or \"people who have cancer,\" as opposed to \"cancerous people,\" the same principle should be used with autism. There are some fundamental flaws with this analogy, however. Cancer is a disease that ultimately kills if not treated or put into long-term remission. There is absolutely nothing positive, edifying, or meaningful about cancer. Cancer is not a part of a person's identity or the way in which an individual experiences and understands the world around him or her. It is not all-pervasive. Autism, however, is not a disease. It is a neurological, developmental condition; it is considered a disorder, and it is disabling in many and varied ways. It is lifelong. It does not harm or kill of its own accord. It is an edifying and meaningful component of a person's identity, and it defines the ways in which an individual experiences and understands the world around him or her. It is all-pervasive. What I found most interesting in reading this selection of articles and blog posts is that many of the samearguments are used for both positions, but with separate sides, naturally, coming to very divergent and contradictory conclusions. Firstly, I saw in at least two articles in favor of using \"person with autism\" that the authors strongly oppose language referring to disabilities like \"suffers from,\" (i.e. \"Alan suffers from Asperger's syndrome;\" \"Joey, an autism sufferer;\" etc.) which has traditionally been a talking point of self-advocates as well. I do understand that not everyone who supports the use of terminology \"person with autism\" would disagree with language like \"suffers from,\" but it is still interesting that there are those who do. It suggests a fundamental shared value -- that people with different neurological conditions are not \"suffering\" because of their difference or disability. Secondly, as alluded earlier, those on both sides want to emphasize the value and worth of the person. Person-first language advocates believe the best way to do this is through literally putting the noun identifying \"person\" before any other identifiers. (As noted in one of the other articles opposing person-first language, however, English is a language that puts adjectives before nouns, whereas there are multiple languages that always place adjectives after nouns. In Spanish, for example, \"person with autism\" is \"persona con autismo,\" while \"Autistic person\" becomes \"persona autística.\" In both cases, autism/Autistic follows the noun.) Person-first language opponents believe the best way to do this is by recognizing and edifying the person's identity as an Autistic person as opposed to shunting an essential part of the person's identity to the side in favor of political correctness. It is impossible to affirm the value and worth of an Autistic person without recognizing his or her identity asan Autistic person. Referring to me as \"a person with autism,\" or \"an individual with ASD\" demeans who I am because it denies who I am. Lastly, what is most interesting indeed is the shared expressed sentiments that using or not using person-first language is necessary to change and shift societal attitudes toward Autistic people. Returning to the premise of this article, this is the sole reason why this debate continues to be argued and why many people on both sides regularly emerge upset and feel personally attacked. Language does play a large role in shaping societal attitudes. But let's think about what we are doing when we use these terms. When we say \"person with autism,\" we say that it is unfortunate and an accident that a person is Autistic. We affirm that the person has value and worth, and that autism is entirely separate from what gives him or her value and worth. In fact, we are saying that autism is detrimental to value and worth as a person, which is why we separate the condition with the word \"with\" or \"has.\" Ultimately, what we are saying when we say \"person with autism\" is that the person would be better off if not Autistic, and that it would have been better if he or she had been born typical. We suppress the individual's identity as an Autistic person because we are saying that autism is something inherently bad like a disease. Yet, when we say \"Autistic person,\" we recognize, affirm, and validate an individual's identity as an Autistic person. We recognize the value and worth of that individual as an Autistic person -- that being Autistic is not a condition absolutely irreconcilable with regarding people as inherently valuable and worth something. We affirm the individual's potential to grow and mature, to overcome challenges and disability, and to live a meaningful life as an Autistic. Ultimately, we are accepting that the individual is different from non-Autistic people--and that that's not a tragedy, and we are showing that we are not afraid or ashamed to recognize that difference. That's why, when I read a few articles scoffing entirely at the debate, and dismissing it as ultimately irrelevant (insisting that each person should use the terminology he or she prefers and to ignore what other people say or write), I was concerned. The question of person-first language is definitely important and cannot be disregarded. The way we use language affects those around us -- in our immediate communities and in society at large. Trends of language have the power to transform ideas and attitudes. To dismiss this as \"a silly semantics argument\" denies the power of language. What does, however, disturb me is the vitriol during debates about this (and similar) topics in the autism community. While it is, as repeatedly emphasized, an important debate with huge ramifications both short-term and long-term, hurling ad hominem insults, making baseless accusations, and shouting over tables (or computer screens) at the people on the other side ultimately demeans both you and them. It shows great immaturity, inability to civilly and peaceably discuss important topics, and insensitivity to the personal experiences vested in each of us with a stake in this debate. Having strong opinions on a topic and being able to have a respectful discussion with someone else are not mutually exclusive. So what can we do moving forward? Or, more importantly, what should we do? To those of you who use \"person with autism,\" I will always respect your Constitutional right to express yourself however you like, but I urge you to reconsider the consequences of using such language. To those of you who use \"Autistic person,\" I urge you to consistently use such phrasing everywhere possible, whenever discussing autism and issues that affect Autistic people, and to develop coherent, rational explanations for why you prefer this terminology, so that you can engage in such mutually respectful and civil exchanges with others. That, actually, goes for everyone. If we ever want to accomplish anything as a community, as a movement, or as advocates, we cannot allow ourselves to be constantly divided by infighting and vicious bullying -- and yes, that occurs from all sides of these debates, not just one. It is imperative that we learn to engage critically and respectfully with one another, and to value each individual's voice and feelings as equally important. Otherwise, we'll become even more dysfunctional than my subcommittee has been in recent months. -- Interested in other perspectives? Here are some links to feed your curiosity.

"15266" "25" "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2010/06/on-engaging-and-prejudice/" "On Engaging and Prejudice (1 of 3)" "
 Executive Summary:   To engage with others we must actively participate in our interactions with them.  This requires us to exert mental effort and also risks challenging our thoughts, feelings, and worldviews.  Because we do not want to exert the necessary effort or take this risk with people who are very different from ourselves, we rely on stereotypes.  This leads to prejudice and discrimination.  In order to avoid prejudice and discrimination, we have to engage with others—especially those who are different from ourselves. 
   
 Engage  has many definitions; I tend to use it in the more general sense of “to involve oneself or to participate,” which is the context in which I use it now. 
 Engaging  is an active state of being.  You can engage in a job.  Say you’re sorting through information at work.  While you’re doing this you could be distracted by whatever is on your mind.  Or you could engage in the task, focusing your mental prowess on the task at hand.  You will likely produce higher quality work if you engage on the job.  You can engage in a conversation.  Say you’re talking with your child.  While you’re doing this you could be distracted by the mental to-do list running through your head.  Or you could engage in the conversation, focusing your attention on what is important to your child.  You can engage in a story.  Say you’re reading a book or watching a movie.  You could go into that “glazed” state where you are absorbing the entertainment and “rotting your brain.”  Or you could engage in the story by paying attention to the creative work and trying to experience what the artists were trying to express.  You bring something of yourself to the experience and come out of it with something truly unique—a communion of sorts between the artist and yourself.  In each of these examples, you are bringing something of yourself to the task and making for a richer experience by engaging.  It requires both an effort on your part and willingness to open yourself up to something outside of yourself, but in return you get a higher quality experience. 
  I propose that one of the reasons prejudice (and the discrimination that results from prejudice) is so prevalent in our society is because of a lack of engagement.  I propose this lack of engagement can also explain the divisive politics that rages through the U.S. and other examples of polarization. 
 Basically my theory is this:  To communicate effectively and productively with someone who thinks and feels differently than you do, you need to engage with that person.  The more differently that person thinks or feels, the more you need to engage with that person in order to gain the kind of understanding necessary for genuine communication to occur.  We fail to do so for two basic reasons.  First, engaging is work.  It necessitates that we exert a significant amount of mental effort.  It is much easier to just be there, not really listening, not really understanding; relying on our assumptions to fill in the gaps left by our failure to engage.  Second, engaging can be uncomfortable.  When we engage in someone who is significantly different from ourselves we are willfully challenging our own assumptions, ideas, and worldviews.  This is inherently uncomfortable and human beings tend to develop self-defense mechanisms to prevent such a challenge from occurring. 
 So, instead of engaging we stereotype.  These stereotypes can be positive, but are more often negative.  Even when positive, these stereotypes are destructive because they prevent understanding and dehumanize the “other” in the process.  In this sense, stereotypes are very similar to a template.  Imagine you are trying to start a new blog.  You find a template that has the right look (stereotype), but after you start using it you realize the content you want to include doesn’t fit the template.  The work-intensive method would be to start from scratch and build your own template that has the look you want but also meets the needs of the content you want to provide.  A less work-intensive method would be to modify the template to account for the content you want to add but cannot fit.  However, it is more likely that you will simply trash the content that doesn’t fit—you don’t really  need  it anyway—and stick to the template you’ve chosen.  If people were blogs, then the template would be  what  they are (doctor, Republican, person with disabilities) and the content would be  who  they are (their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and the conclusions they’ve drawn from them).  Our failure to engage trashes the content of the person in favor of the imperfect, inappropriate template we chose to interpret their content through. 
 This occurs at what I would call the macro level.  We stereotype groups of people and put them into the templates we’ve chosen for them.  When we meet individuals who belong to those groups, we trash any content ( who  they are) in favor of the template we assume they fit into (our own concept of  what  they are).  This also occurs at what I would call the micro level, which constitutes using templates of people we know instead of engaging with them at a particular time and place.  That will be the subject of my next post.

Coeliac disease risk not affected by early feeding practices
" "
I'd like to bring three papers to your attention, all united by their discussion of  coeliac (celiac) disease , that most classic of autoimmune conditions  in the most part  managed by the use of a lifelong gluten-free diet. 
 
First up are  the papers by Elena Lionetti and colleagues  [1] and  Sabine Vriezinga and colleagues  [2] which unfortunately pour cold water on the notion that the risk of developing coeliac disease (CD) can be somehow mitigated via the use of either the early or delayed introduction of gluten nor seemingly affected by breastfeeding habits. Indeed, as science has known about for sometime, genes and specifically the  HLA genotype  linked to CD, seem to be the important predictors of disease outside of gluten consumption itself. 
 
Both the Lionetti and Vriezinga papers were published in the  New England Journal of Medicine  and were accompanied by  an editorial  by Jonas Ludviggson among others (he of the ' not CD but something else potentially linking gluten and some autism '). Both studies were based on randomised controlled trials. 
 
The Lionetti study involved either the introduction of gluten at 6 or 12 months to at-risk infants (those with a first-degree relative with CD) and then examining: \" the prevalence of celiac disease autoimmunity and of overt celiac disease among the children at 5 years of age \". The numbers of participants involved featured in the hundreds so this was by no means an under-powered trial. The authors concluded that: \" Neither the delayed introduction of gluten nor breast-feeding modified the risk of celiac disease among at-risk infants, although the later introduction of gluten was associated with a delayed onset of disease \". 
 
The Vriezinga study looked at whether introducing gluten early (between 4-6 months) might also offset the risk of CD. Again based on a pretty impressive participant number (N=944) comprising children with a first-degree relative with CD as well as being \" positive for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 \", participants were randomly assigned to either \" 100 mg of immunologically active gluten daily \" or  a placebo . Again, biopsy confirmed CD and some of the various serology associated with CD were the outcomes. The authors concluded: \" As compared with placebo, the introduction of small quantities of gluten at 16 to 24 weeks of age did not reduce the risk of celiac disease by 3 years of age in this group of high-risk children \". 
 
The final paper to discuss today is  that published by Elfström and colleagues  [3] (open-access  here ) and the findings of their systematic review and meta-analysis looking at \" associations between coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes \".  Type 1 diabetes , distinct from  type 2 diabetes , is  an autoimmune condition  whereby the insulin producing cells of the body have been destroyed. The Elfström paper coincidentally carrying Dr Ludviggson as a co-author, concluded that: \" More than one in twenty patients with type 1 diabetes have biopsy-verified coeliac disease \" and onwards that there may be some substance to the idea that birds of an autoimmune feather flock together ( see here ). Indeed, I've previously covered the possibility of a connection between Type 1 diabetes and CD ( see here ) and how, for example, some of the research on [General]  zonulin  might be potentially very informative to this area ( see here ). 
 
There's little more for me to say in this post aside from reiterating that when it comes to CD, genotype combined with gluten exposure seems to be the most important factors in disease onset and progression. That's not to say that a gluten-free diet might be the only tool in the management arsenal ( see here ) nor that other variables might not potentially impact on CD risk ( see here ) but for now, screening and where indicated, gluten avoidance, seem to be the primary measures to be undertaken.

Gluten free diet adherence reduces depression in coeliac disease
" "
 I was really quite interested in  the paper by Seref Simsek and colleagues  [1] looking at how adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in cases of paediatric  coeliac disease  might also confer psychological benefits too. To quote: \"[a]  Significant decrease was observed in the depression scores... of celiac patients who were able to actually adhere to the GFD compared with nonadherent patients. \" 
 
So: \" The aim of this study was to investigate the level of depression and quality of life in children with celiac disease (CD). In addition, it aimed to examine the relations of depression level and life quality with adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). \" Coeliac disease by the way, is the archetypal 'gluten can affect health' condition. It's been known for a while that outside of the intestinal manifestations of the diagnosis, there may also be other effects  including those potential influencing psychology and behaviour too  [2]. 
 
Looking at responses from 25 children diagnosed with CD and 25 asymptomatic controls, researchers reported finding no significant differences \" in the depression scores between the patients and the control subjects. \" Said depression scores were based on the use of the Depression Scale for Children. 
 
But... \" total scores and scores of the emotional well-being subscale of the measure of Quality of Life Scale for Children were significantly lower in patients with CD compared with the control group. \" This is perhaps not new news. Further: \" Adherence to GFD was associated with reduction in depression symptoms. \" 
 
Although there are a few ways that one can interpret the Simsek findings, I'm gonna set them within the context of some of that other research talking about psychological outcomes associated with CD and it's management via a GFD including  that related to psychopathology . On the periphery of CD is the suggestion of a spectrum of gluten-related 'issues' many of which have gathered under the label of  non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).  There is still some debate about NCGS and whether it is real or not ( see here ) but for the purposes of this post I'm gonna err on the side of saying yes,  for some people it might be a real issue  [3]. With that in mind, other research has similarly suggested that gluten exposure might, under certain circumstances, have an effect on 'emotional disposition' ( see here ). The paper discussed in that previous post was a gold-standard randomised, double-blind trial  by Simone Peters and colleagues  [4] who concluded that current feelings of depression may indeed be linked to gluten consumption albeit with more research to do. 
 
Obviously this research area is crying out for a lot more investigations. I draw back from saying that the very wide spectrum of depression is merely a 'gluten thing' because the evidence does not corroborate such an assertion. Depression is multi-faceted and probably has lots of aetiological factors associated with the various presentations of it ( see here  and  see here ). If however, there may be certain types of depression or depressive symptoms that overlap with real medical conditions such as CD, the onus should be on determining whether a gluten-free diet might be doing so much more than managing the physical presentation of the condition. Y'know, the gut-brain axis thing...

Atopic disease and adolescent psychotic experiences
" "
I was intrigued to read  the paper by Khandaker and colleagues  [1] (open-access  here ) reporting results based on a longitudinal study that suggested: \" Childhood atopic disorders increase the risk of  psychotic experiences  in adolescence \". 
 
 
 
 Bish, bash, Bosch @ Wikipedia  
 
I've talked about the issue of  atopic disease  and it's potential overlap with something like neurodevelopment before on this blog ( see here ) based on the possibility of a neuro-immune interaction ( i.e.  that our immune system might be involved in many more processes than just fighting infection  as per the microglia work ) as  suggested by Meldrum and colleagues  [2]. The recent paper  from Chang and colleagues  [3] reporting a possible connection between allergic disease and behavioural issues in preschoolers adds to that debate. I very much consider the Khandaker findings to be of a similar ilk in terms of potential mechanisms of effect (accepting though that correlation does not necessarily mean causation). 
 
In brief, Khandaker  et al  followed several thousand children over the course of their trial (data from  the ALSPAC  cohort which  has just received some good news ), detailing the presence of atopic diseases such as  asthma  and  eczema  of participants at age 10 and any subsequent psychotic experiences at age 13. Various markers linked to inflammation ( C-reactive protein  and  IL-6 ) were also assessed at age 9. It was then a case of comparing those with atopic disease, whether present singularly or combinatorially, with those without atopic disease on whether the risk of a psychotic episode (PE) was more or less likely. And it was more likely in the atopic group; although strangely enough those markers of inflammatory processes did not seem to \" mediate association between atopy and PEs \" bearing in mind that inflammatory markers were not seemingly assessed at the time of the PE. 
 
As per the authors findings, I'm not yet able to provide a specific hypothesis to explain the Khandaker findings. I do hark back to my previous chatter about the 'skin-brain axis' for example ( see here ) as potentially being important although not specifically related to the psychosis findings.  The accompanying literature on psychocutaneous disorders  [4] \" conditions that are characterized by psychiatric and skin manifestations \" may very well be something of a research focus to account for at least the proposed eczema - PE link. 
 
With regards to asthma, well there is  the suggestion from Moreno and colleagues  [5] that asthma was one of a number of conditions \" more frequent in individuals with psychotic symptoms but no psychosis diagnosis \" but again, comparatively little to suggest a mechanism of connection outside of individual case reports on steroid medication for example ( used for some cases of asthma ) being  linked to the presence of psychotic episodes  [6]. I could be really speculative and talk about physiological mechanisms other than atopy potentially linked to such somatic and psychiatric symptoms such as that encompassed by  the body of work looking at dietary elements  [7] (and  this paper by Faith Dickerson and colleagues  [8]) but don't want to get ahead of myself given the lack of testing for such parameters in the Khandaker paper. 
 
What however we can take from the Khandaker results is that a possible connection between somatic and psychiatric symptoms should remain an important area of research particularly with regards to shared genetics, epigenetics or biological markers. Perhaps also that more emphasis should be placed on screening for psychotic episodes and related conditions in cases where atopy is present. The tantalising question of whether treating somatic symptoms might have a potential knock-on effect on psychiatric symptoms or vice-versa also remains, as for example, per the recent update on  the use of anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia by Sommer and colleagues  [9]. There doesn't at the moment appear to be an awful lot of research on the potential usefulness of antihistamines ( H1-receptor antagonists ) commonly used to treat allergic disorders, in cases of psychosis or conditions manifesting psychosis. When however it comes to  H2-receptor antagonists  and accepting that these medicines  are not generally viewed as antihistamines , I am drawn to  the chatter about famotidine and schizophrenia  [10] for example, something which I think  was also mentioned with regards to autism at one point  [11] and seemingly never heard of again. So, with no medical advice given or intended, there's still quite a bit more research to do in this area. 
 
To close, having watched  the recent BBC4 documentary  about The Doors and really appreciating the musical talent they were, a classic:  Riders on the Storm ... sit back and enjoy.

Early pregnancy maternal hypothyroxinemia and offspring ADHD symptoms
" "
\" Children exposed to maternal hypothyroxinemia in early pregnancy had more ADHD  [ attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ]  symptoms, independent of confounders. This finding suggests that intrauterine exposure to insufficient thyroid hormone levels influences neurodevelopment in offspring. \" 
 
That was the bottom line  reported by Thiago Modesto and colleagues  [1] looking at how \" mild thyroid hormone insufficiency \" in early pregnancy might link into offspring behavioural outcomes a few years down the line. Based on data collected as part of the  Generation R  initiative - itself the source of  previous research looking at the potential involvement of thyroid hormones and offspring outcome  - researchers looked at maternal hypothyroxinemia \" characterized by low levels of free thyroxine coexisting with reference thyrotropin levels \" during pregnancy and how it correlated (or not) with parental report of offspring ADHD type behaviours based on scores on the  Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised Short Form . They reported something of a possible association where: \" Maternal hypothyroxinemia... in early pregnancy was associated with higher scores for ADHD symptoms in children at 8 years of age after adjustments for child and maternal factors (ie, sex, ethnicity, maternal age, maternal educational level, and income). \" Interestingly too, when those presenting with  thyroid peroxidase antibodies  (a marker of autoimmune-related issues) were excluded from the analyses, the results did not differ to any great extent suggesting that the processes of being exposed to too lower a dose of thyroid hormone during early pregnancy seems to be the important factor outside of the possible reasons for such lower levels such as autoimmunity. 
 
I've been pretty interested in the various [peer-reviewed] research looking at pregnancy thyroid hormones and offspring developmental outcomes down the years. In amongst that collected research, the idea that ADHD (or ADHD type symptoms) and even the presentation of autism might tie into the pregnancy levels of thyroid hormones has been quite a frequent feature ( see here for example ). Indeed, other research such as that  from Libbe Kooistra and colleagues  [2] over 10 years ago, had indicated that \" maternal hypothyroxinemia constitutes a serious risk factor for neurodevelopmental difficulties \" potentially detectable even as young as 3 weeks of age. Insofar as a role for autoimmunity in relation to pregnancy thyroid functions and offspring outcome, I'm also not quite ready to move on from a possible association as per other findings with autism in mind ( see here ). 
 
Questions remains about the hows and whys of such an association and whether more could be done to extend screening for thyroid hormones particularly during early pregnancy in order to intervene and potentially 'offset' any additional developmental risks to offspring. Without making any clinical recommendations or giving anything like medical advice, I would also be interested to see how such thyroid findings might intersect with the body of work looking at issues with iodine availability ( see here ) and whether a wider research aim of looking at what happens in cases of pregnancy iodine deficiency in relation to thyroid hormone production and subsequent offspring development and behaviour is merited. It's not as if there isn't  already some basis for further research inspection  [3] in this area, also potentially extending into [some] autism ( see here ) too...

Vitamin D status affecting autoimmune disease risk?
" "
 I want to bring  the paper from Tea Skaaby and colleagues  [1] to your attention for today's brief blog post and their observation that there may be: \" a possible protective role of a higher  vitamin D  status on  autoimmune disease \". Autoimmune disease by the way, reflects a breakdown in communication and tolerance of 'self' whereby the body attacks healthy tissue. 
 
Their findings, based on an analysis of \" a total of 12,555 individuals from three population-based studies with measurements of vitamin D status ( 25-hydroxy vitamin D ) \" hinted that \" for a 10 nmol/l higher vitamin D \" the  hazard ratios  for quite a few autoimmune conditions seemed to be reduced albeit with some quite wide  confidence intervals (CIs) . Overall however, the authors found a reduced HR \" for any autoimmune disease (HR = 0.94 % CI 0.90, 0.98) \" with that increasing levels of vitamin D. 
 
It's not necessarily new news that vitamin D seems to have some important biological effects  when it comes to immune function  [2] outside of the more classical physiological connections made to the stuff. Indeed,  the paper by Tamblyn and colleagues  [3] talking about an immunological role for vitamin D at the 'maternal-fetal interface' (where immune tolerance is required to \" prevent fetal rejection \") represents an area requiring far greater inspection particularly in light of guidance recommending vitamin D supplementation to pregnant women among other groups ( see here ). 
 
Without hopefully cherry-picking from the growing research literature looking at vitamin D and autoimmunity, I would also like to bring in  the paper by Dong Yeob Shin and colleagues  [4] (open-access) and the suggestion that low vitamin D status might be \" associated with anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody in autoimmune thyroiditis. \"  Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody  (TPOAb) and  autoimmune thyroiditis  have been of particular interest to this blog in light of some initial data suggesting a connection with certain cases of depression ( see here ). That also depression has been looked at through the vitamin D lens specifically from the deficiency point of view is an interesting correlation ( see here ) perhaps connecting psychiatry, autoimmunity and vitamin D. I say all this acknowledging that correlation is not the same as causation and that not everyone with depression will present with autoimmune thyroiditis or other autoimmune conditions. 
 
Certainly however, I'd wager that there is perhaps more to see when it comes to how the sunshine vitamin/hormone might link up with immune function (and dysfunction) and  perhaps beyond  taking into account some interesting work  with autism in mind  too. I'd be minded to also bring in the idea that permeability of a particular membrane might also be a spot requiring a little more study in light of  other research suggestions  [5] and some preliminary tie up with vitamin D ( see here ) combined with  more recent data  [6]. Just sayin'.

Allergic and autoimmune diseases and autism
" "
Comorbidity is quite a big topic of interest to me. Specifically comorbidity when talking about autism or schizophrenia or quite a few other behaviourally-defined conditions. 
 
 
 
 Venn-ting @ Wikipedia  
 
The reason for my interest? Well let's just say that although many a textbook so report, autism for example is not just the sum of its triad ( soon to be dyad ) of symptoms  but much, much more . 
 
That and the fact that based on the current data as it stands, a diagnosis of autism is seemingly protective of nothing and indeed, often significantly increases the risk that  one or more of quite a few other conditions  can appear alongside. 
 
I've talked about comorbidity quite a few times on this blog ( significantly over-represented...  and all that) but am drawn back into this area again following  the paper from Mu-Hong Chen and colleagues * describing the allergic and autoimmune comorbidity present in autism based on quite a large participant group. 
 
OK you can perhaps see why I might be interested in this paper given the words ' allergy ' and ' autoimmunity ' in the title and some link back to previous posts (see  here  and  here ).  Autoimmunity in particular , is something which I personally think is severely under-rated when it comes to conditions manifesting behavioural and developmental aspects, given  the more traditional somatic associations  that have been made. But that's just my thoughts... 
 
Anyhow, a few details about the Chen paper: 
 
 
 Quite a big study based on finding cases of autism (N=1596) among a  National Health Insurance Database  in Taiwan between 1996 and 2010.  
 Autism cases were compared (1:4 ratio) with age and gender-matched asymptomatic controls for the presence of various allergic and autoimmune-defined conditions. 
 Results: various allergy and atopic diseases were more readily associated with autism cases than controls including allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and asthma (odds ratios between 1.7-1.5). That added to quite a bit more frequency in autoimmune conditions such as  type 1 diabetes  (OR=4) and  Crohn's disease  (OR=1.46). Please note I've not included  confidence intervals (CIs)  (look them up in the paper if you're interested). 
 The authors conclude that there might be some important associations and potentially shared underlying mechanisms between these very somatically defined comorbidities and autism. 
 
 
I've talked previously about  autism in Taiwan  on this blog. That post was with reference to some data on the numbers of cases of autism being detailed in Taiwan and how even outside of Europe and North America, autism rates seem only to be going in one direction: up. I'm not wishing to get into any deep conversations about why they might be going up - see  the post on the CDC figures  - but rather that they are and what implications this might have for lots and lots of people and services right across the globe. 
 
This new data whilst retrospective and reliant on formal recorded diagnoses pretty much confirms what is already out there in the autism research literature. Type 1 diabetes has again  been something I've discussed before  with autism in mind and cumulatively suggest that this is something that should be considered for testing when a diagnosis of autism is given. I'm not by the way suggesting everyone with autism has diabetes, merely that the possibility of a greater risk should be considered. 
 
Same thing goes for the Crohn's disease overlap, accepting that chatter about inflammatory bowel diseases and autism is a little bit more of a controversial area ( should I mention gastrointestinal symptoms... ) and perhaps links into a few more recent findings  on things like gut permeability  and  gut bacteria  (speculatively). The allergy/atopy side of things is also something which needs to be looked at with greater assiduity bearing in mind  where conditions like asthma may eventually lead . 
 
I can't really say too much more about this study and its implications. Harking back to the opening sentence of this post, comorbidity is quite a big area of interest for me. Judging by these and other results, perhaps we need to really start looking at just how important it might be to at least some cases of autism.

Early childhood atopy and autism risk
" "
 
 
 De profundis clamo ad te, domine 
 
Regular readers will probably have heard something like this before so I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself: \" The presence of any  atopic disease  in early childhood increased the risk of developing ADHD  [ attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ] ... and ASD  [autism spectrum disorder] ... in later life \". 
 
So said  Mu-Hong Chen and colleagues  [1] with yet another ' big data ' paper coming out of Taiwan. 
 
There is little point in me turning this research into some sort of mega-post given that this topic has featured so heavily on this blog. In case you missed them, here are some of the relevant posts: 
 
 
 Allergic and autoimmune diseases and autism (2012) ( see here ) 
 Asthma increases risk of ADHD? (2013) ( see here ) 
 Asthma as a risk factor for autism? (2014) ( see here ) 
 Autism, ADHD and allergy: Taiwan and big data (again) (2014) ( see here ) 
 
 
Lazy? Yes, I am being a bit lazy in this post by just supplying older links but what more can I say apart from that there seems to be a complicated relationship between immune function and behaviour. Oh, and other research from this group might also be worthwhile looking at as per studies  linking epilepsy and atopic dermatitis  [2] and  major depression and/or bipolar disorder and asthma  [3] knowing about the various comorbidity relationships with autism ( see here  and  see here ). 
 
And  here is some lazy music to accompany my lazy post ...

Maternal diabetes and offspring autism risk
" "
The systematic review and meta-analysis  reported by Xu and colleagues * caught my eye recently. Concluding that: \" maternal diabetes was significantly associated with a greater risk of ASD in the offspring \" my interest was truly piqued. 
 
 
 Insulin @ Wikipedia   
 
 
 Diabetes  in relation to autism has cropped up a few times on this blog. I've talked about the possibility of a more general connection ( see here ) and also more specific as part of some of the  CHARGE  results ( see here ). 
 
Indeed those CHARGE results, based on  the study by Paula Krakowiak and colleagues ** (open-access) I remember  generated quite a bit of discussion  at the time of their publication given the suggested link with various facets making up  metabolic syndrome  in mums. 
 
I'm not really surprised by the Xu results when you think that the association between  gestational diabetes  and offspring autism risk has been talked about before based on some pretty strong association data. I note for example, that  the study by Lyall and colleagues *** ( open-access ) flagged up this association - \" gestational diabetes was associated with a significantly increased risk of ASD \" - based on quite a nice sample size. That and  the paper by Hannah Gardener and colleagues **** ( open-access ) who suggested that gestational diabetes was perhaps one of several factors which might elevate offspring risk as per the Krakowiak results. 
 
The question of mechanism of effect is slightly less clear it has to be said. In my  first post on autism and diabetes , quite a lot was made of the connection between  type 1 diabetes  and autism as per  the familial autoimmune  connection ( have a look at my Money post for example ). Granted this doesn't really add anything more specific than to say that autoimmune conditions can 'club together' ( see here ) which might take us down some other avenues particularly when talking about at least some autism comorbidity ( see here ). That and the implication that  autism might also be an autoimmune condition ***** as some have implied. 
 
As to any mechanism of gestational diabetes being linked to the aetiology of autism, well I'm afraid I can't offer anything too concrete at this point. There is some speculation that gestational diabetes might be linked to other cognitive and developmental issues as per  the research on ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) ****** and  schizophrenia *******. Indeed,  that paper by Van Lieshout & Voruganti (open-access)  on gestational diabetes and risk of offspring schizophrenia suggests: \" at least 3 prenatal mechanisms: hypoxia, oxidative stress and increased inflammation \" of potential effect. Suffice to say that all of them have also been banded around as being involved with cases of autism at various times (particularly  the roles of inflammation and oxidative stress ). I might also draw reader's attention to  the paper by Nousen and colleagues ******** too. 
 
The take-home message whilst still one of caution in singling out one particular factors as being linked to autism (or should that be  the autisms ?) is that maternal diabetes should be registering on the various investigations into pregnancy and birth factors linked to offspring autism risk to further explore mechanisms. Whether altering the presentation of maternal diabetes (lifestyle changes  or even reviewing medication *********) might also impact on offspring outcome is another question which should be on the lips of autism research...

Vitamin D, schizophrenia and CRP
" "
 A quote to begin: \" The evidence suggested that high levels of vitamin D may be linked to reduced risk of  schizophrenia  with elevated CRP  [ C-reactive protein ] . \" 
 
That was the bottom line  reported by Dao-min Zhu and colleagues  [1] who measured plasma concentrations of CRP and  25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]  in 93 people with schizophrenia and \" 93 family-matched controls. \" Finding that: \" Mean levels of CRP and 25(OH)D were 43.3% higher and 26.7% lower for patients compared to controls \" and that \" 25(OH)D were inversely associated with CRP in the patients, but not in the controls \" provided scope for the authors to conclude that there may be quite a bit more to see in this area. 
 
I've covered both schizophrenia and vitamin D ( see here ) and schizophrenia and CRP ( see here ) before on this blog. The trends described by Zhu  et al  pretty much follow what quite a large bank of research has indicated insofar as reduced vitamin D levels and elevated CRP bearing in mind  the potential plurality of the schizophrenias . I've not as yet tried to link the two concepts (vitamin D and CRP) together but have an idea of where science might want to go with this based on some of the peer-reviewed evidence. Oh, and at this point I'll drop in  the results from Liefaard and colleagues  [2]... 
 
 Gut hyperpermeability . As I've talked about before, the biological role of vitamin D has been stretched and stretched in recent years such that a deficiency/insufficiency of the stuff goes way beyond just impacting on bone health  and the 'English disease' . The idea that excessive intestinal (gut) permeability (yes,  leaky gut ) might show some connection to vitamin D levels ( see here ) is gaining popularity in recent years. Papers such as  the one from Assa and colleagues  [3] add to an increasing volume of literature suggesting that there is more to see in this area. This work has also started to  translate to humans as well as mice  [4]. Coupled to the idea that intestinal inflammation - a potential cause of gut barrier disruption - might also be a facet of some schizophrenia ( see here ) and I don't think I'm getting too ahead of myself in suggesting that there may be an 'association' here. 
 
The science should be pretty easy to do to confirm/refute any relationship; adding measuring gut permeability to the protocol followed by Zhu  et al  and perhaps even supplementing with vitamin D and re-checking gut permeability and inflammatory marker levels as a result. Given also the links being established between autism and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency ( see here ) and inflammation or markers of inflammation being a facet of some autism ( see here ), I dare say that science could explore that area too.

Asthma and ADHD (again)
" "
 \" Asthmatic children had a higher risk of also having ADHD. \" 
 
That was the conclusion reached  by Kirsten Holmberg and colleagues  [1] based on their analysis of rates of ADHD, and other variables found \" through the  Swedish Twin Register , linked to the  Swedish Medical Birth Register , the  National Patient Register  and the  Prescribed Drug Register . \" Said data came from over 20,000 twins who's parents were questioned when children were aged 9 or 12 years. 
 
For those unfamiliar with  the proposed connection  [2] between the respiratory condition(s) headed under the label of  asthma  and the presentation of  attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD), this is not the first time that peer-reviewed research has hinted at some kind of relationship. The 'big data' studies coming out of Taiwan for example, have similarly reported an association ( see here ). That part of any relationship between asthma and ADHD might also be mediated by the comorbid appearance of autism ( see here ) has also been proposed, although the the idea that autism (singularly) and asthma might overlap has been recently questioned ( see here ). 
 
Holmberg  et al  also reported that: \" The association  [between asthma and ADHD]  was not restricted to either of the two dimensions of ADHD \" following their analysis of the 'inattentive' and 'hyperactive/impulsive' domains that made up ADHD. They did find that asthma severity might however mediate the association with ADHD as per their reporting on an increased  odds ratio  (OR) \" for >4 asthma attacks in the last 12 months. \" 
 
What's more to say about this possible connection? Well, preferential screening for ADHD when a diagnosis of asthma is received might be something for healthcare professionals to consider first and foremost. Acknowledging also that there may be several facets to ADHD including those related to sleep for example ( see here ) one might also entertain some further clinical investigations here also in light of  what asthma can also do to sleeping patterns and routines  [3]. 
 
\" Asthma medication seems not to increase the risk of ADHD \" was another conclusion from Holmberg  et al  so to some degree allaying any fears that pharmacotherapy for asthma is 'causative' of ADHD. That being said, the idea that  certain medicines might be 'linked' to both asthma and/or ADHD  [4] is still deserving of further research consideration as has been previously mentioned on this blog ( see here  and  see here ). I might also put forward the idea that when it comes to overlapping variables potentially spanning asthma and ADHD, one might have a look at issues such as vitamin D availability ( see here  and  see here ) or even food ( see here  and  see here ) as potentially showing some shared involvement for some. 
 
For whatever reason, the evidence linking asthma and ADHD is growing...

The ties that bind? Comorbidity and autism (again)
" "
 \" It was found that 92.9% of participants presented with a family history of autoimmune disease. \" 
 
That was one of the headline findings reported  in the paper by Arlene Mannion & Geraldine Leader  [1] who conducted a follow-up study  to previous work  [2] looking at the important issue of  comorbidity and autism  with a specific focus on whether \" comorbid symptoms changed over time. \" 
 
Fifty-six children and adolescents diagnosed with DSM-IV autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participated in their study, drawn from a previous cohort of 89 involved in previous research by these authors. A range of measures were included for study including a focus on sleep and functional bowel issues. 
 
When it came to describing this smaller cohort two years after their original research participation, examination of current comorbid diagnoses alongside ASD showed a worrying trend insofar as rates of  epilepsy , attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and  anxiety disorder . An additional 5 children/young adults presented with ADHD at this second time of study for example. Three participants also presented with an anxiety disorder this time around. These are perhaps not unexpected findings ( see here  and  see here ). 
 
Drilling down further into the presented data, a few other trends are present: 
 
 
 Sleep issues were prevalent. Nearly 80% of participants showed signs of a sleep problem \" classified as a score of 41 or more on the CSHQ  [ Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire ].\" 
 Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, as measured on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Inventory from the  ATN , were also notable in this cohort. Nearly three-quarters of participants presented with at least on GI symptom within the last 3 months. A smaller group (7%) presented with 5 GI symptoms recently. GI symptoms also persisted in over 80% of participants during the 2-year period before this follow-up study. 
 GI and sleep issues also seemed to go hand-in-hand. Almost two-thirds of the cohort \" presented with both sleep problems and gastrointestinal symptoms \" as evidenced when specific GI symptoms were analysed (bloating, nausea, abdominal pains, diarrhoea and constipation). 
 Researchers also questioned about family medical history as well as participants. Alongside the figure already presented about familial autoimmune disease, various other \" psychological, developmental or medical disorder \" were noted. 
 Osteoarthritis, psoriasis and hypothyroidism ( Hashimoto's thyroiditis ) were the most common familial autoimmune conditions described in this cohort. Mention is however also made about Crohn's disease (n=9) and coeliac disease (n=4) too. 
 
 
 
Obviously one has to keep in mind a few salient points before getting to carried away with this information. The participant numbers on the first occasion (N=89) and this time around (N=56) are quite small. The authors also note that the use of \" parental report\"  might also be considered a limitation; balancing that however by making reference to  the Phillip Gorrindo paper  [3] covered in previous posts ( see here ) on how: \" Parents were sensitive to the existence, although not necessarily the nature, of GID  [gastrointestinal dysfunction]\". 
 
That all being said, the trends reported by Mannion & Leader are consistent with previous peer-reviewed data on the issue of comorbidity and autism. Sleep problems are pretty widespread ( see here ) as are functional bowel issues ( see here ). Indeed, even more pathological bowel issues seem to be 'over-represented' when it comes to a diagnosis of autism ( see here ). That the two issues might be somehow 'joined together' has also been previously raised in the research literature ( see here ). 
 
The reports on certain familial health conditions being associated with cases of autism is also not new news. I've long speculated about the role of familial  autoimmune  conditions and autism on this blog ( see here  and  see here ) on the back of research spanning several decades ( see here ). Talk specifically of a connection between the skin condition  psoriasis  and autism is included ( see here ) as is the idea that both inflammatory bowel conditions ( see here ) and more food-related bowel states ( see here ) might in some families, show a connection to autism. Much more study is implied  including a focus on the N=1  [4]. 
 
The idea that autoimmune disease specifically affecting the  thyroid  might also be a route of further scientific inquiry with autism in mind is something of real interest in light of quite a bit of other research in this area ( see here  and  see here ). As I've mentioned in previous posts, the idea that familial autoimmune disease affecting the thyroid  might also be related to the onset of presentation of offspring autism  [5] is a research topic crying out for further replication. The possibility of an association also opens up a number of other avenues for study based on the idea that autoimmune features might reflect one or more 'types' of autism ( see here ) or indeed, linked to one or more of the common comorbidities occurring alongside autism ( see here  and  see here ). Speculations are potentially aplenty in this area ( see here ) so we need more hard data.

Autism, ADHD and allergy: Taiwan and big data (again)
" "
\" Children with ADHD  [ attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ]  or ASD  [ autism spectrum disorder ]  had an increased risk of allergic comorbidities, and those with both ADHD and ASD had the highest \". 
 
 
 \"You built a time machine.. out of a DeLorean\" 
 
 
That was the conclusion arrived at in  the paper by Ting-Yang Lin and colleagues  [1]. For regular readers of this blog, this was yet another example of how Taiwan leads the way when it comes to the concept of ' big data ' specifically employed  with neurodevelopmental conditions in mind . That  Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database  is proving to be a very valuable resource indeed. 
 
A few details from the latest study: 
 
 
 \" 5386 children aged less than 18 years with ADHD alone, 578 with ASD alone, 458 with ADHD + ASD, and 25,688 non-ADHD/ASD age- and sex-matched (1:4) controls were enrolled in our study \". I don't think anyone can say that this was an underpowered study. 
 The presence of various allergic diseases including  asthma  and  atopic dermatitis  were looked at among participant groups and compared. 
 Results:  Odds ratios  (ORs) suggested that the autism, ADHD and combined autism + ADHD groups were all more likely to present with comorbid allergic conditions compared to asymptomatic controls. This, taking into account \" age, sex, and level of urbanization \". The combined group seemed to be a greater risk of allergic disease than the autism or ADHD alone groups (OR: 2.2 95%  CI : 1.83–2.79). 
 \" ASD children with more allergic comorbidities were associated with a greater likelihood of ADHD \".  
 
 
 
 
Quite a bit of this data taps into previous findings based on the examination of the Taiwanese insurance database insofar as the link between asthma ( see here  and  see here ) and neurodevelopmental diagnoses, so no real surprises there. The intriguing prospect that an increasing allergic burden in cases of autism seemed to elevate the risk of comorbid ADHD being present is the value-added part to the Lin study. What autism research is starting to understand is that comorbidity is quite a big issue ( see here ) and, outside of learning disability ( see here ) and epilepsy ( see here ), ADHD seems to figure quite prominently ( see here ).  
 
Bearing in mind that correlation is not the same as causation, I'd like to see quite a bit more investigation into that autism - allergy - ADHD relationship talked about by Lin  et al . Genetics might be a good starting point as per the growing realisation about 'common ground' when it comes to various behaviourally-defined conditions ( see here ). The recent paper looking at  the possible genetics of schizophrenia  [2] linking into immune functions ( see here ) might set the tone for further inquiry in this area. Given the growing body of research looking at immune function and autism ( see here  and  see here  for examples) one might see how allergic diseases may show  more than a passing connection to at least some cases . 
 
I'd also be minded to suggest that environment might also be something to look at with this possible relationship in mind. Food is something of a potential common denominator when it comes to at least some autism and some ADHD ( see here ) so perhaps further investigation might be required there.  The paper by de Theije and colleagues  [3] talked quite a bit about food allergy and autism and ADHD for example. I don't know enough about how food might tie into something like asthma or atopic eczema as to present any knowledgeable information about links. I'd hazard a guess that looking at something like the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and  things like the gut microbiota  [4] might also be worthwhile. 
 
Music to close, and  something uplifting from The Smiths ...

On fatty acid metabolism and autism and ADHD (again)
" "
 \" Children with ADHD  [ attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ]  and ASD  [autism spectrum disorder]  had low levels of EPA  [ eicosapentaenoic acid ] , DHA  [ docosahexaenoic acid ]  and AA  [ arachidonic acid ]  and high ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs  [ polyunsaturated fatty acid ]  and these correlated significantly with symptoms. Future research should further investigate abnormal fatty acid metabolism in these disorders. \" 
 
So said  the research publication by Natalie Parletta and colleagues  [1] ( open-access available here ) who completed assessments on  erythrocytes  in blood samples from \" 565 children aged 3-17 years with ADHD (n = 401), ASD (n = 85) or controls (n = 79). \" Alongside fatty acid analyses (undertaken at \" a commercial Pathology Laboratory \") researchers also included various behavioural measures with their participant group looking at aspects such as attention and impulsivity and also autistic symptoms (via the  CARS ). Importantly we are told that: \" Participants who had taken any nutritional supplement during the previous year were excluded \" from the study. 
 
Results:  well as I've mentioned, compared to the asymptomatic (not autism nor ADHD) controls, group values for those with autism or ADHD were lower in terms of EPA and DHA among other things. In fact we are told that: \" Children with ASD had lower DHA, EPA and AA and higher n-3/n-6 ratio than children with ADHD \" suggesting that fatty acid metabolism might be even more irregular in this group compared to the others. EPA and DHA specifically fall under the banner of omega-3 fatty acids and are generally thought to be the 'good guys'  when it comes to all-manner of health effects . I might particularly mention the word 'inflammation'  when it comes to this class of fatty acids  [2] which could be relevant to quite a bit of the autism spectrum as well ( see here ). When it however came to the overall ratio between omega 3 and  omega 6 fatty acids  (sometimes thought of the not-so-good guys), it was ADHD that beat autism that beat controls. The authors make a case for some interesting correlations between fatty acids levels and the various behavioural scores obtained but to be honest, I'm not all that impressed with the figures as they stand. 
 
I've used the word 'again' in the title of this post to denote how this is not the first time that unusual fatty acid metabolism has been described with both autism and ADHD in mind ( see here  and  see here  respectively). Minus any sweeping generalisations, the body of peer-reviewed evidence looking at fatty acids and autism or ADHD is pretty consistent in the the findings being reported that one for reason or another, there seems to be 'issues' with fatty acids and screening services should perhaps be preferentially offered as and when a diagnosis ( or both ) is received.\" This cross-sectional study is the largest of its kind, supporting previous work that showed low n-3 PUFA levels, particularly DHA, in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. \" Indeed. 
 
Then comes the question of whether supplementation as and when an atypical fatty acid profile is detected might be useful or not. The jury is still out on this side of things particularly when it comes to autism and the possible effects of supplementation ( see here ). For ADHD the evidence is a little stronger ( see here ) and  continues to garner research attention  [3] as a potentially cost-effective intervention option for some. I was also intrigued to read the authors' reasoning on a possible role for the trillions of wee beasties that call us home ( the gut microbiota ) and how: \" Another explanation could involve the influence of gut microbiota on PUFA uptake and metabolism. \" In an unrelated post, I've talked about research suggesting a possible role for fatty acids in terms of gut bacteria and something like obesity ( see here ). One therefore wonders how deep the rabbit hole might go? 
 
For now however, we have more scientific evidence for a potential role for fatty acid metabolism and at least some autism and ADHD...

More metabolomics, amino acids, gut bacteria and autism
" "
\" Here he goes again \" I hear you say as today's micro-post focuses on  a rather interesting paper from Xue Ming and colleagues * which, and I quote, \" detected abnormal amino acid metabolism, increased oxidative stress, and altered gut microbiomes in ASD \". 
 
 
 Ur-inal or mine? @ Wikipedia   
 
 
The name of the game was a favourite -omics of mine, metabolomics (see  this recent post for a brief overview ) and in particular how the appliance of some really quite powerful science to urine specimens provided by children with autism and aysmptomatic controls, revealed some interesting differences. 
 
A brief overview of the paper and results bearing in mind that I'm still pursuing the full-text paper: 
 
 
 Using a combination of both liquid- and gas chromatography based  mass spectrometry , urine specimens were analysed for 48 children diagnosed with as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 53 age-matched not-autism controls. 
 Results: after some nifty statistical analysis, urinary amino acid output was one of the most important factors and in particular several amino acids presenting in lower,  concentration controlled  levels in the ASD group over controls.  
 With shadows of the findings from  Prof. Jeremy Nicholson  a few years back ( see this post ), the authors conclude that \" several gut bacterial metabolites were significantly altered in ASD children who had gastrointestinal dysfunction \". 
 
 
As indicated, this post is a preliminary one and I hope to fill in a few gaps when I get the full-text paper. Nevertheless, such work as this from Ming and colleagues is indeed important fodder for this blog. We've been here before  both with autism and indeed conditions like schizophrenia too  albeit not necessarily presenting with the same patterns of findings. Indeed, very much like the rising prominence of disciplines like metabolomics to conditions like schizophrenia -  five serum and one urine metabolite for example  - there is perhaps some important data to be derived from such studies, at least on the functional differences between autism and not-autism. That outside of  the known metabolic disorders  with a focus on amino acid chemistry that can present with autism or autism-like characteristics. 
 
The gut bacteria-autism connection?  Don't get me started again , as once more another study suggests some potential involvement  from those trillions of bacterial masters . I haven't forgotten the old  correlation does not equal causation  mantra by the way, just pointing out that something seems a little bit unusual with gut bacteria in some cases of autism. 
 
More to follow...

Psychiatric comorbidity accompanying irritable bowel syndrome
" "
 OK, a few choice words to start: the  National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) , nationwide cohort study, large participant numbers. 
 
That's right. Yet again Taiwan continues to give when it comes to research based on that very useful national health insurance program. Regular readers will already know that  I'm a fan of this resource . This time around the results come in the form of  the paper published by Yao-Tung Lee and colleagues  [1] (open-access) who suggested that: \" Clinicians should pay particular attention to psychiatric comorbidities in IBS  [ irritable bowel syndrome ]  patients. \" 
 
Based on an analysis of nearly 5000 people diagnosed with IBS - a chronic condition affecting the digestive system \" defined according to the  ICD-9-CM code 564.1 \" and only including patients \" who were diagnosed by gastroenterologists and had at least two consensus IBS diagnoses \" - researchers set about looking at whether IBS may be associated with an elevated risk of various psychiatric disorders. A matched non-IBS control group was also examined (n=18,756) to determine whether various psychiatric diagnoses including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder were over-represented in the IBS cohort. 
 
Lo and behold, after some statistical analysis there was some indication of a greater frequency of psychiatric disorder diagnosed in the IBS group. Following the IBS group for quite a few years \" the most common subsequent psychiatric disorders were depressive disorder (239 patients), anxiety disorder (205 patients), and sleep disorder (153 patients). \" The incidence rates for these conditions and bipolar disorder were \" all significantly higher for the IBS cohort than for the comparison cohort. \" The bottom line: \" the incidences of subsequent depressive disorder, sleep disorder, anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder were significantly higher in the IBS cohort than in the control cohort. However, the incidence of schizophrenia was statistically nonsignificant in either cohort. \" 
 
Whilst this is interesting data, it is not necessarily new news that IBS might be also associated with psychological / psychiatric issues.  The paper by Fond  et al  [2] for example, said as much with their conclusion: \" Patients with IBS had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression than healthy controls. \" The strength of the Lee data is however in the power (size) and case ascertainment methods used by the NHIRD. 
 
The precise hows and whys of a possible relationship between IBS and psychiatric disorder are still a little up in the air. One could entertain the possibility that the discomfort and pain brought about by IBS might affect a person psychologically speaking perhaps making them more prone to presenting with something surpassing clinical diagnostic thresholds. Thinking back to some recent discussions on the power of placebo with IBS mentioned ( see here ) one can similarly see 'the mind at work' as corroborating something of a psychology - somatic link. 
 
That being said I'm also drawn to the idea that this data might be more fodder for  a gut-brain link  on a more biological level, that quite a few people are talking about these days. Y'know, the idea that what goes in our deepest, darkest recesses from a bacterial, immunological and barrier perspective ( the next triad ) might have something on an effect on the grey-pink matter floating around in our skull and onwards things like behaviour.  The discussion paper from Collins  [3] kinda sums things up from the suggested point of view that those trillions of wee beasties that call our gut home might be perturbed ( dysbiotic ) in cases of IBS and could be implicated in both gut and psychiatric expressions of IBS. The idea that gut barrier function might also be 'out' when it comes to IBS ( yes, the leaky gut ) has also  been banded around the peer-review arena in the past  [4]. There is quite a bit more to do on mechanisms but for now just realising that the effects of IBS might go so much further than the gut is an important sentiment.

Maternal pregnancy CRP levels and offspring autistic traits
" "
 Elevated levels of inflammatory markers present during pregnancy have been linked to quite a few labels and diagnoses down the years. Schizophrenia is a prime example as per various peer-reviewed science with that label in mind ( see here ). There is still quite a bit more research to do in these days of plural schizophrenias ( see here ) but  the intersection between immune function and psychiatry  is a growing area of interest. 
 
Autism is another label that has been talked about with elevated gestational inflammatory markers in mind ( see here ). CRP or  C-reactive protein  has tended to be a focus for many studies despite other  pentraxins  potentially also showing some effect ( see here ). It is therefore with autism in mind that today I'm discussing  the paper by Natasja Koks and colleagues  [1] and the suggestion that: \" the association between elevated levels of maternal CRP in pregnancy and autistic traits in children is confounded by maternal health-related and socioeconomic factors. \" 
 
Based initially on measured levels of pregnancy CRP before 18 weeks gestation in quite a large group of mums-to-be based in the Netherlands (N=4165), researchers also collected parental reports of offspring at 6 years of age \" using the  Social Responsiveness Scale , and the Pervasive Developmental Problem scale. \" They reported that compared to a reference group: \" elevated levels of CRP (>7.8 mg/L) in pregnant women were associated with higher Social Responsiveness Scale scores in children. \" The Social Responsiveness Scales (SRS) by the way has found some favour in terms of screening for autistic-like traits and symptoms as per other research ( see here ). 
 
But... things were not so straight-forward when it came to the relationship between pregnancy CRP levels as a marker of inflammation and 6-year old SRS scores as a marker of autistic traits. So: \" the effect was strongly attenuated after adjustment for several socioeconomic factors and in particular by maternal health-related factors including  body mass index . \" Further the authors reported \" no relation between maternal CRP levels and pervasive developmental problem. \" In other words, simplistic notions that 'more inflammation during pregnancy = more autistic traits in offspring' might need to be tempered to a degree. Anyone who has followed the autism research scene down the years will not be surprised at such sentiments. 
 
One obviously has to be a little guarded when it comes to studies such as this where variables stretching back into the important  nine months that made us  are 'correlated' with measures quite a few years later. As per similar work with an autism research slant looking at such widely-spaced apart variables ( see here ) there may be a multitude of other important variables and factors to consider. 
 
\" Further studies are needed to explore whether other maternal inflammatory markers during pregnancy, as a response to maternal inflammation, are associated with the development of autistic traits in the offspring. \" Going back to my previous discussions about CRP being only one of several potential inflammatory markers that might need to be explored ( including the various cytokines that have cropped up over the years ) I'd be minded to suggest that there is good sense in looking at a wider selection of immune related compounds when it comes to the question of immune mediation being potentially linked to at least some offspring autism or the presentation of autistic traits. Alongside ideas that acute inflammation might have some interesting links to things like social cognitive processing ( see here ) and that within the vast heterogeneity of autism, there may be cases where infection stands out as a possible aetiological factor ( see here ) there are plenty of avenues to be explored by science in this area.

Pregnancy vitamin D levels and offspring ADHD
" "
 \" Higher maternal circulating levels of  25(OH)D3  in pregnancy are associated with lower risk of developing ADHD  [ attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ] -like symptoms in childhood. \" 
 
 Eva Morales and colleagues  [1] came to that conclusion in their study -  prospective study  - looking at how estimated pregnancy  vitamin D  levels might have impacted on teacher-assessed ADHD-like symptoms in offspring when aged between 4 and 5 years old. Based on participants involved in the  INMA project  looking at how various environmental issues during pregnancy and into early infancy might impact on the 'physical, social and intellectual development' of children, researchers looked at over 1600 mother-child pairs.  25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] levels  were assayed for in pregnant women at 13 weeks gestation and offspring children were subsequently assessed for ADHD-like behaviours a few years later. 
 
Not only was a correlation reported between increasing vitamin D levels during pregnancy and lower levels of ADHD-type behaviours to be reported in young children, authors also: \" found an association of increasing maternal 25(OH)D3 with a lower risk of ADHD DSM-IV ...  and ICD-10  hyperkinetic disorder  in children \" albeit with statistics ( confidence intervals ) implying caution in the interpretation of results. 
 
Accepting that correlation is not the same as causation and that a whole host of factors probably affect the presence of ADHD-type behaviours in children, these are interesting results. I've covered vitamin D quite a few times on this blog ( see here ) and how widespread the correlations seem to be between a lack of the sunshine vitamin and a whole range of diagnoses and labels. Of particular note, are the various studies looking at vitamin D and autism; specifically the findings  from Fernell and colleagues  [2] (covered  in this post ) who suggested that low vitamin D levels in the very earliest days might \" act as a risk factor for ASD  [autism spectrum disorder]\" albeit with caveats. Yet more research  has appeared in recent days with autism in mind  [3]. 
 
Back to ADHD and vitamin D has also started to make something of a research appearance in recent times.  Bener and Kamal  [4] (covered  in this post ) in amongst their various data, suggested that \" vitamin D deficiency was higher in ADHD children \" than in controls. Other studies  have suggested similar things  [5]. That being said, there is still quite a bit more research to do in this area as per the rather less significant findings  reported by Strøm and colleagues  [6] looking at pregnancy levels of vitamin D and various \" offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. \" The idea that Strøm  et al  also assayed for pregnancy vitamin D levels over and above vitamin D levels directly in kids is comparable to the methods reported by Morales and colleagues. 
 
ADHD like many (all?) other diagnoses currently based on behavioural observations alone is a complicated entity. The Morales results, whilst interesting, are probably not the only issue pertinent to ADHD ( or do I start to pluralise that label too ) as per the recent results  reported by Alhraiwil  et al  [7] and their suggestion that: \" male gender, previous psychiatric illness in the family, vitamin D deficiency, poor school performance,  sleep problems , and nocturnal enuresis \" might all show some effect when it comes to ADHD. I might also add that the rise and rise of evidence talking about a possible connection between physical complaints such as asthma and ADHD ( see here ) should also not be ignored as part of any bigger picture. 
 
But the idea of a connection between vitamin D and ADHD is a tantalising one added to a growing nutritional element ( see here ). Bearing in mind my caveat about no medical or clinical advice given or intended, such an association also begs some further questions about the value of supplementation ( see here )...

Maternal thyroid dysfunction and autism or ADHD?
" "
The  paper by Andersen and colleagues  [1] talking about the risk of offspring  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) where mothers presented with \" maternal thyroid disease \" is the source material for this post. 
 
 
 The Circus @ Wikipedia  
 
 
Based on data derived from Denmark, and those  very useful Danish health registries  which seem to be producing all-manner of potentially important information ( see here ), researchers reported that: \" Maternal  hyperthyroidism  diagnosed and treated for the first time after the birth of the child increased the risk of ADHD in the child (adjusted HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.05-1.44), whereas  hypothyroidism  increased the risk of ASD (adjusted HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.14-1.59) \". 
 
Upon reading the suggested correlation between maternal hypothyroidism - where  thyroid function is reduced  - and something of an increased risk for an autism diagnosis in offspring, my mind headed back to  the study by Gustavo Román and colleagues  [2] talked about  in this post , and their findings of \" a consistent association between severe, early gestation maternal  hypothyroxinemia  and autistic symptoms in offspring \". Of course, there are some differences between the way the Anderson and Román studies were conducted (registry diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction post-pregnancy vs. laboratory testing of thyroid function during early pregnancy) but the similar direction of the findings with autism in mind is interesting. 
 
Equally interesting was the suggestion that maternal hyperthyroidism - an overactive thyroid - was related to some heightened risk of offspring ADHD in the Anderson cohort. A quick trawl of the limited research carried out in this area reveals some support for this assertion as per  the data produced by Päkkilä and colleagues  [3] who reported: \" Increases in maternal TSH  [ thyroid stimulating hormone ]  in early pregnancy showed weak but significant association with girls' ADHD symptoms \". That being said, I don't doubt that this is going to be a complicated relationship as per other reports on things like  maternal thyroid autoimmunity during pregnancy and offspring outcomes  [4] and  the issue of iodine and offspring outcome  [5] which has previously been talked about on this blog with autism in mind ( see here ). The fact that  autism and ADHD can and do present comorbid  in quite a few people adds to the complication. 
 
I'd be hard-pressed to offer anything definitive about how and why thyroid function might impact specifically on the risk of diagnoses such as ADHD and autism outside of what is already known about maternal thyroid function and infants ( see here ). I assume as part of a larger clinical picture, there may be some direct effects specifically acting on the infant during the nine months that made us as well as other peripheral effects acting on for example, delivery issues as per  the correlation between thyroid function and something like preterm birth risk  [6] which  might play some role  [7]. 
 
Similarly when talking about the 'hows' of how issues with thyroid function come about in mums-to-be, one is faced with an array of possible factors. I could start going on about  some of the genetics of thyroid disease  [8] but I have neither the time, space or expertise to provide any thorough overview. Environment can also play a role as per  the factors listed on this website  so take your pick as to what might be relevant or not to cases. With  the continuing interest in environmental effects and conditions like autism  and ADHD, I might direct you to some of the work done on  endocrine disruptors and thyroid functions  [9] but with the realisation that the picture is going to be a complicated one varying from one group to the next, even one person to the next. 
 
Still, the Anderson results further add to the interest looking at maternal thyroid function and offspring outcome and merit some further investigations in this area. Indeed,  thyroid function is turning up in all manner of places these days  [10] and perhaps point to  some interesting associations which might have some important knock-on effects  [11] ... 
 
So, New Kids On The Block making a come-back....  You Got It !

ADHD primes for psychosis and/or schizophrenia?
" "
 My efforts turn  once again to Taiwan  today and  the results reported by Yu-Chiau Shyu and colleagues  [1] that: \" Compared to the control group, the ADHD  [ attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ]  group showed significantly increased risk of developing any  psychotic disorder ... and  schizophrenia . \" 
 
As per the multitude of other instances where Taiwan is mentioned as a research powerhouse, the source data for the Shyu findings was the  Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database  and the analysis of data for over 73,000 people \" newly diagnosed with ADHD \" compared with a similar number of age- and sex-matched non-ADHD controls.  \"Having a diagnosis of any psychotic disorder and of schizophrenia were set as two different outcomes and were analyzed separately \" we are told, as was the possible role (or not) of  methylphenidate (MPH) treatment  of ADHD on psychosis / schizophrenia outcomes. 
 
In line with the opening paragraph, there was potentially something to see when it came to a previous diagnosis of ADHD priming someone for future psychotic disorder or schizophrenia. The adjusted  hazard ratios  (aHRs) - \" 5.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.30-6.30 and 4.65; 95% CI, 3.59-6.04 \" - for psychotic disorder and schizophrenia respectively are not to be sniffed at. Shyu  et al  also noted that where MPH use was part of the the ADHD intervention regime, there was a suggestion that MPH use increased the risk of developing psychotic disorder but not schizophrenia. Such a finding is  not unheard of in the peer-reviewed literature  [2]. The authors also noted that: \" Compared to ADHD patients without psychosis, patients with ADHD who developed psychosis had significantly older age at first diagnosis of ADHD (9.4±3.3years vs. 10.6±4.0years). \" 
 
This is not the first time that ADHD has been associated with psychosis and/or schizophrenia. The  results reported by Dalteg and colleagues  [3] are testament to the idea of a possible connection, even if moderated by variables such as substance abuse issues. Indeed, the idea that  a diagnosis of ADHD might elevate the risk of substance abuse  [4] is an important point given the various voices lending support to the idea that  substance abuse might also be a risk factor for psychosis  [5]. That being said, I don't want to stigmatise everyone with ADHD on the basis of this connection; there may be quite a few other 'shared pathways' also to consider ( see here ) and not just of the genetic variety as per nutritional issues for example ( see here  and  see here ). 
 
The Shyu results do however reiterate that birds of a developmental / psychiatric feather may very well flock together as per other research findings in related areas ( see here ). That such a connection can so severely affect quality of life potentially provides further evidence that continued efforts to alleviate childhood psychiatric issues should represent an important goal of modern-day medicine ( see here ) particularly in respect to the rising numbers being discussed ( see here )...

Asthma as a risk factor for autism?
" "
I start with a quote from the  paper by Po-Hsin Tsai and colleagues  [1]: \" This  prospective study  indicated a temporal relation between  asthma  and subsequent ASD  [autism spectrum disorder]  diagnosis, supporting the immune hypothesis of ASD pathogenesis\" . Based on a familiar collaboration residing in Taiwan ( see here  and  see here  for some discussions on previous data), yet more evidence is emerging of a correlation between immune function, physiology and behavioural / developmental conditions. 
 
 
 Chen Cheng-po @ Wikipedia  
 
 
I say more evidence because as per the links above, I've posted about other research from this group looking at  the comorbidity of allergic and autoimmune diseases in cases of autism  [2] and more recently evidence linking  early life asthma with a heightened risk of subsequent attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  [3]. 
 
So here goes with yet more data from this group based on their analysis of the  National Health Insurance Research Database  (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Natasa also receives a thank you for bringing the full-text of this paper to my [virtual] desk. 
 
 
 An asthma cohort was plucked from the NHIRD based on the random selection of 1 million persons on the database. Those aged between 0-3 years and with a physician diagnosis of asthma ( ICD diagnosis ) (n=2134) were age- and sex-matched with 4 control patients (1:4 ratio) with no asthma and no recorded history of psychiatric disorder (n=8536). Researchers then looked at the frequency of \" Psychiatrists diagnosed ASD \" ( ICD-9 autism ) up to some 8 years later. Other variables were also recorded for participants including  other atopic/allergic diseases  and level of urbanisation. 
 Results: well, as per the headline: \" The asthmatic group exhibited higher incidence rates of ASD (1.3% vs 0.7%, P=.007) \". As perhaps one would expect, levels of other allergic diseases were also more frequently reported for the asthma group. Also, the asthma group were slightly more likely to be living in urban areas than controls, although urbanisation was not reported to significantly increase the risk of ASD ( see a related post here ). 
 Interestingly, the authors also suggest that the presence of asthma \" influences the manifestation pattern of ASD \" based on the fact that asthmatics tended to be diagnosed with ASD later than those who were diagnosed with ASD in the control group (although this difference was not statistically significant: 5.6 years experimental group vs. 4.5 years control group). 
 
 
 
 
As the authors point out, there is some noticeable methodological strength in their findings based on the database used, the numbers of participants included and the prospective nature of their inquiry. They do however caution that a cause-and-effect relationship between asthma and autism is not proved from their data. This same sentiment could also be applied to  the recent attention  given to  the study by D’Onofrio and colleagues  [4] on that age-old (pardon the pun) issue of  older dads and autism risk . 
 
 
 
I've talked about asthma and autism previously on this blog ( see here ) and how there may indeed be some overlapping features when it comes to the two conditions. I also hark back to some of the work by Kevin Becker ( see this post ) and  his speculations on autism, asthma, inflammation and the Hygiene hypothesis  [5] (open-access) which may well have been borne out to some degree by the Tsai data. If you want to get even more speculative, you might also have a look at my past post talking about the opinions of Moises Velasquez-Manoff and the immune roots of autism ( see here )... [sorry for the sweeping generalisation by the way]. 
 
The only other things I'll add to the authors speculations about the 'mast cell activation' hypothesis ( see here ) as being linked to the findings is the possibility of a couple of other variables being potentially related too. So, how about medication being a common factor as per  the preliminary work throwing prenatal paracetamol (acetaminophen) into the research limelight ? Or,  with my sunshine vitamin interest in mind , how about  vitamin D as being something to tie the two conditions together  [6]? And then there's the bank of evidence talking about  maternal infection being linked to offspring asthma  [7] which invites further study of  a growing area of interest with autism in mind . Finally, there is all  the chatter about environmental exposures and asthma  [8] (open-access) some of which, without making a sweeping generalisation about the definition of 'environmental exposure', may  overlap with some autism discussions  [9]. Quite a few lines of potential further investigation methinks. 
 
 
 
Outside of the need for quite a lot more study on this association (importantly, replication with other geographical datasets) including  disentangling the very complicated issue of immune function and autism , there is a potentially important message to take from the Tsai data. Although perhaps only a small increased risk where early asthma is present, one might think about some additional screening for conditions like autism or ADHD just in case?

A field of dreams for kids with special needs
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Max and I got invited to CVS Caremark All Kids Can Baseball Camp in Boston. One of us was really psyched to go.... and it wasn't Max. I know how awesome the camp is after  writing about it last year . During the one-day experience at Fenway Park,  kids and teens on inclusive baseball teams get pointers from Red Sox batting coach Dave Magadan, pitch on the field, get a behind-the-scenes tour and see a game.  
 
 
 
But Max has stadium-phobia. I showed him some photos of the camp and he kept saying \"Nooooooo.\" So off I went. I figured maybe once he saw how much fun I had with the kids there, he'd want to go next year. That old make-him-jealous thing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The camp is in its eighth season; the day I was there, the Cheshire Challengers, a Little League Challenger Division from Connecticut, plus one player from The Miracle League were visiting. From the moment the kids lined up outside the stadium to get in, they were beyond excited. Also cool: It's Fenway Park's 100th season. 
 
 
I didn't think it wise to mention I'm a Yankees fan, though Coach Magadan won my heart. 
 
 
First up: a batting clinic in the batting cage the Red Sox use to warm up and practice. Coach Magadan gave pointers on positioning, swinging, keeping your eye on the top of the ball. But he was also an amazing cheerleader.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Next, the kids headed out to the field. It's gloriously green and lush, and I had serious lawn envy. I had a big, loopy grin on my face as I watched the kids at bat, looking determined and proud. I almost got walloped by a ball a couple of times. \"I think they're aiming for you!\" Coach Magadan said, laughing. When one kid whacked one out to center field, Magadan remarked that he'd be right at home in the game that evening. No matter how far a kid hit the ball, the coach was equally encouraging. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Right about now, you might be wondering how your child can get involved. The camp is open to inclusive teams in New England, and accepts 10 different teams each year. Applications are available starting in April or May; keep your eye out for them on the  CVS Caremark All Kids Can Facebook page  next spring. 
 
 
 
 
 
The players and their coaches 
 
 
 
 
 
Lunch in the dugout 
 
 
 
 
 
Wally stopped by, too. 
 
 
 
Later that day, the kids returned to Fenway to watch Red Sox batting practice and a game against the Toronto Blue Jays. On the train ride home, I thought of Max and just how much his Challenger team has done for his confidence. It's certainly changed my idea of what makes for a good baseball game. It's not about how far you hit the ball or how fast you get to a base—it's about doing it on your own terms, as people stand by cheering you on. And that's something generally good to keep in mind when you're raising a kid with special needs.

Big-deal events for kids with special needs
" "
 These are happy-making photos from an inclusive football skills camp, which took place last Saturday in Foxborough, Massachusetts, part of All Kids Can Patriots Day. It was sponsored, rather awesomely, by CVS Caremark All Kids Can and the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation, for the fourth year in a row.  Former New England Patriots players and coaches teamed with dozens of kids from Easter Seals Massachusetts to show them a thing or two about football. Pat Patriot with a participant Kids did huddles and stretches and learned how to block, kick and throw. The end goal: have fun! Kids also got to walk through a gigantic inflatable Patriots helmet. I do not think they sell them at Toys \"R\" Us. Patriot cheerleaders showed up, too, and does this teen look psyched or what? It is always great to hear about local big-deal activities for kids with special needs. In our area, every year the Jets invite kids from Max's school to a game. Last year, Dave and Max made it as far as the entryway before Max decided he wasn't having any. This year, we'll try again. It sure would help if the Jets could temporarily change their color to purple, instead of green. Hmmm.... Been to any great activities in your community lately for kids with special needs? Got any good ones coming up?

8 ways to get a child with special needs into sports
" "
 
 
 
 
 
Max spotted his baseball coach when he was  at camp  the other week, because she had a kid there too. She called to tell me that he ran right up to her with the biggest smile on his face, and pretended to swing a bat.  
 
 
 
Max is excited about all things softball. He has mixed feelings, however, about the special-needs soccer programs we've taken him to. Once, he ran screaming out of a karate studio, so there's no black belt in his immediate future, although he can give a pretty strong karate chop to your arm if your name is Sabrina and you're his sister and you have ticked him off.  
 
 
 
Now that he is a camp champ, taking him to the  All Kids Can Baseball Camp  next summer seems like a possibility. Sponsored by CVS Caremark, it's a one-day experience held at Fenway Park in Boston. Kids on  Little League Challenger teams ,  Miracle League teams , and other inclusive teams get to hang with the Red Sox batting coach, sit in the dugout, get a VIP tour of Fenway park, watch a Red Sox batting practice, then see a game. OK, so what if we're Yankees fans—that camp would be all kinds of awesome. 
 
 
 
 
 
Boston Red Sox hitting coach Dave Magadan helps a 9-year-old with her swing at batting camp. 
 
 
 
Through work I'm going to be doing with All Kids Can, a fund that sponsors programs and efforts for kids with special needs, I got to speak with a coach whose team has been to the baseball camp. Brenda Hyland of Swansea, Massachusetts, started a Little League Challenger Division team five years ago because she wanted her grandson, who has autism, to play ball. She shared some tips for getting kids involved in any sport, and I'm sharing photos readers sent of their kids doing sports.   
 
 
 
 To find sports for kids with special needs,  ask . \"My grandson's developmental pediatrician recommends kids to our team all the time. Ask the doctors, teachers and other experts in your life. They hear about these programs. And contact local support groups. In our area, for instance, we have Community Autism Resources, who know all about our team.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pacey , age 3 in this photo, is on a soccer team. 
 
 
 
 No worries, your child can do it.  \"One little boy in a walker this year decided he's not using the walker. He's wobbly and it takes him awhile to get to first, but he does it! Either way, the kids are having fun. That's what matters.  Any  child can play and have fun.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
Danielle, 17, has developmental delays. This is her at  The Long Island Show Series for Riders With Disabilities . 
 
 
 
 Ease them in.  \"If you have a child who's scared of new experiences, bring him or her to the field or wherever the sport is played ahead of time and let them see it. If a child loses it during a game, give him a break and let him sit with you or take a walk. It's not a good idea to leave—he'll think that if they don't want to be there next time, he just has to have a meltdown! You might also want to bring something he's comfortable with. One kid brought one of those big, fat bats to games and used that. After a few games, he used the regular bat.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kenyon , 9, has cerebral palsy and epilepsy. He plays on a Miracle League and also does assisted rock climbing, \"but his favorite is bowling,\" says Jen. 
 
 
 
 Keep at it.  \"Our grandson would sit around, watch TV and be on the computer all day long if we let him. He likes to say 'No baseball!' and we'll say 'Yes baseball!' Once he's there, he's thrilled.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Caleb , 5, \"was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus. He plays on a Miracle League team and loves it,\" says Cassie. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Talk about the friends your child will make.  \"When we went to the CVS baseball batting camp, two 12-year-old boys developed a friendship. They are both autistic, and don't have other friends. Boys don't want to hang with them because they do things younger kids do, like play with Ninja Turtle or Hot Wheels Cars. But these boys had baseball in common. It bonded them.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sarah Kate , 8, has cerebral palsy. This year, says mom Andi, \"she's done swim team, soccer and a fun run...so far!\" 
 
 
 
 Start a fan club on the fridge.  \"For one of our kids, there was always a picture of his brother on the fridge in a baseball uniform. After we took the team photo, his mom put the photo of him in uniform on the fridge, too. He was so excited!\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Alvin , 4, has aspergers and does gymnastics for social and motor skills. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ask parents about other activities.  \"From being on the team, we hear about other activities, like a basketball league and a bowling league for kids with special needs, and school programs, too. Parents have great resources.\" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Simon , 5, has cerebral palsy and epilepsy. He plays T-ball with League of Dreams. 
 
 
 
 
 Change your expectations.  \"We see parents pull their kids out of games because they're running around in the outfield instead of hitting the ball, and they think they are never going to play. I say give it a season! People are used to playing in a certain way. They expect an all-star—they just got a different kind. They're  all  all-stars to us.\"

Disney Cruise 2010: Max meets Minnie
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 Hello, Mouseketeers. We're back from our Disney Cruise/Disney World trip, our flight got in late and I'm wiped. I have lots of good stories, photos and tips to share, and yet more photos, but for now here's a video of Max hanging with Minnie Mouse on the cruise (hence her fabulous outfit). This scene is typical of our meet-'n-greets; every single one of the characters—I am not exaggerating—took extra time with Max, and other kids with special needs. Usually, Max would be awestruck at first. Then he'd want to make out with them. And then they'd just hang.  He really, really loved Minnie. It's Max's first crush! Given Disney's deep pockets, I have to assume they'd pay for the wedding.

A boy with cerebral palsy is a sports star of the year—and his brother, too
" "
 
 
 
Sports Illustrated Kids has declared not one but two kids to be  SportsKid of The Year , featuring them on their December issue. Actually, they're brothers. Actually, one of them has hypertonic cerebral palsy and can't walk. Actually, they enter triathlons together and one brother tows the other on a bike, pulls him in a raft and pushes him in a trailer. 
 
 
 
 
 
You may already know of Cayden Long, 7, and Conner Long, 9, of White House, Tennessee, since the two have been making headlines since they started participating in triathlons a year and a half ago. They go by the name  Team Long Brothers , and they've been traveling the East Coast to compete in races. 
 
I love that Cayden gets to participate in triathlons, and I am seriously inspired by Conner's extreme devotion and ingenuity. I hope that kids who see this understand that there are all sorts of ways to include kids with disabilities in activities, and that sometimes you just have to think outside the...bike. 
 
I only recently heard about the SportsKids honor. I shared this video on Facebook, and wanted to make sure all of you here saw it, too. Enjoy. Pass the tissues.

An autistic student's inspirational graduation speech
" "
This week is full of awesome people with special powers—first  Zach Anner , the guy with cp who's winning America's hearts in the Oprah My Own Show contest (and my new crush), and now Eric Duquette, a salutatorian at his high school in Smithfield, Rhode Island, who happens to have autism. Thanks to reader Marcy Nordstrom for this video about his graduation speech, she's always sending me cool stuff.

Woo hoo: teens with special needs named homecoming queens and kings
" "
 
 This article in USA Today  about students with special powers being named homecoming kings and queens made my day. As a spokesperson for the Special Olympics said,  \"It's really amazing to see because there was a time when they were never even invited to go to prom.\"  
 YEAH!!! 
 Max would be quite the studly homecoming king.  
 [Insert vision of your child as homecoming king/queen here.]

The Utter Chaos that is T-Ball
" "
Yes, it was my first official practice as one of the assistant coaches of T-Ball. Here is what I learned:  1. Even if one of the other coaches says they have coached multiple levels of t-ball and baseball before, that doesn't mean they have done it in the last 20 years, or remembered what kids know. Or don't know.  2. Six-year-olds who have never played baseball or T-Ball before have no idea what the field positions are. Or what a base is.  3. 11 out of 12 six-year-olds have never played baseball or T-Ball. At least, on our team that is true.  4. The 1 child who has played before still doesn't know the field positions, or what a base is.  5. 11 out of 12 six-year-olds don't own a baseball glove or hat, and therefore must borrow the coach's.  6. Even if you have no idea what a base is, or where to stand, or how to catch, or even to run around the bases, hitting the ball is fun. So as long as everyone gets to hit the ball, we're all good.

The happiest day of his life (seriously)
" "
 
 
 
Max's birthday party day was a bliss trip for him, and for me, too.  
 
Bliss for Max: 
 
A fire truck. His all-time favorite one, Ladder 31. 
 
Backing down our street and stopping at our house, accompanied by Fire Chief Joe and his favorite firefighter, Angelo. 
 
To escort him to his firefighter-themed birthday party at the civic house across the street from the fire station. 
 
Firefighter Angelo lifting him up into the truck, as he always does when Max visits the firehouse. 
 
And then a ride—an actual ride—in a fire truck. A dream come true for  a kid who is obsessed with fire trucks and fire stations,  and  who wants to be a firefighter  when he grows up. 
 
Bliss for me: 
 
The joy of surprising Max with
 something so beyond his wildest dreams, he's never thought to ask for 
it. The firefighters got the idea couple of months ago and told me during one of our regular weekend visits to the fire station. \"Would that be 
OK, Mom?\" Firefighter Angelo asked, and I got weepy. Like I've said before,  firefighters are some of the best people ever . 
 
Max
 only found out about it when I heard the fire truck arrive and I said, 
\"Would you like the fire truck to come get you for your birthday party?\"
 (Note the part in the video where he's gazing at awe in the fire truck 
and says, \" Me ?!\") 
 
Watching him get out-of-his-head happy. 
 
And being filled with sheer gratitude for a gift that Max will never, ever forget.

Some things Max has been enjoying lately: A  Zipper Ball  toy, which helps kids with motor coordination. You hold one end, your kid grabs the other and you slide the balls back and forth.  Easy-grip paintbrushes . Finger crayons : The bulbs are much simpler to grasp than regular crayons. Totlol : a YouTube-like site for kids.  DLTK's Crafts for Kids : has free printable pages for coloring and crafts. If you've found any great stuff your kids have been loving, share!

		 Jack has a hockey tournament coming up this weekend and, in a happy turn of events, it is within close driving distance of my house! No billion-hour bus trips for us this time! (Don’t worry; there is a travel tournament this spring with all its accompanying chaos.) Even better than that, all of Team Stimey will get to attend. I’m so excited! 
 Having been to hockey tournaments before with names such as  Special Hockey International Tournament (aka, SHIT)  and  Special Hockey Ex-traaah-vah-gaaaahn-za , I was a little disappointed that the people behind Jack’s upcoming tournament called it the UCT Winter Hockey Festival, giving me so little comedy fodder to work with. 
 Fortunately, I have all kinds of AWESOME fodder to work with, namely number 42! 
 The fella there on the left is Santa Claus. 
 That is Jack’s best friend there in the blue. He is number 43, which makes Jack endlessly happy that they are only one apart. It makes ME endlessly happy that the two of them get to skate together. 
 Also, in case you don’t see the full awesomeness potential in the above photo, here is a way cuter picture of #42: 
 I mention this, because…HOCKEY! TOURNAMENT! And also to invite any of you special hockey boosters in the area to come experience a little bit of what I am talking about when I talk about special hockey. 
 Going to a special hockey tournament is unlike anything I have ever done. It is  amazing.  It is  magic . 
 Jack and I welcome friends to join us at the  Gardens Ice House  in Laurel this Saturday and/or Sunday to watch some great hockey. The Cheetahs have four teams playing, from super competitive, skilled A teams to C teams with more players like Jack who are still working on the more advanced skills. 
 All of said teams kick ass and are super awesome to watch. 
 Jack’s team (the Montgomery Cheetahs C Team Purple) will be playing three games, as follows: 
 Saturday: 
1 pm: vs. Columbus Blue Jackets, Logsdon arena 
5:30 pm: Opening Ceremonies, Patrick arena 
 Sunday: 
8 am: vs. NOVA Cool Cats, Logsdon arena 
11 am: vs. Space Coast Supercanes, Whitey’s rink (This one is outside, I think. Bring blankets.) 
 If you come and can’t find us, just follow the sounds of Quinn shouting that he’s cold and miserable and/or the sight of a mop of unruly blond hair sticking up out of a mass of blankets that seem to be holding an iPad. 
 You don’t have to come see Jack though. There will be great hockey on every rink throughout the weekend. If you do want to see Jack though, be prepared for one of the following: 
 Jack on his game and playing hockey like a motherfucker, although in game form, not practice like this photo. 
 Jack being sooooo over hockey. This sometimes takes the form of his sitting belligerently on the bench. 
 Hopefully, gleeful Jack, happy and free and thrilled to be skating. In a perfect world, he wouldn’t be this blurry in real life. 
 I hope some of you can make it, but if not, be sure to check back here next week for all of the news, photos, and fun—oh, and also the  magic  of special hockey.

The perks of getting to know your fire department
" "
 
 
 
I got a voicemail the other day from our local fire chief. After an incident in town involving a delayed ambulance, I had emailed our mayor about our own experience with our city's Emergency Medical Services years ago, and the chief wanted to discuss it with me. \"If this is Fireman Max's mom, please tell him I say hello!\" he said. 
 
As if I needed any more proof that our firefighters are The Best. 
 
Ever since Max decided that he would like to be a firefighter, exciting things have happened. Both of us became ambassadors for  Kidde Fire Safety . We have also spent a lot of time at the fire station near our home, getting to know both the trucks and the firefighters. Max refers to one of the guys as his best friend. All of them have welcomed him and made him feel like one of their own. On his twelfth birthday,  a few firefighters showed up at our house  in his favorite truck and escorted him to his party. 
   
Even if your child does not aspire to be a firefighter, there's good reason to get to know your local fire department. Because.... 
 
 A fire station visit gets kids thinking about fire safety 
 
Aside from taking in the razzle-dazzle of the fire trucks, when kids visit a fire station they can ask questions about safety and the work firefighters do (and likely pick up a coloring book and hat, too).  
 
 Kids can get comfortable with firefighter gear 
 
Seeing a firefighter all decked out can be intimidating for young children, along with those of any age who have special needs; some have been known to run away from firefighters in emergency situations, out of fear. But when kids can see their tools and outfits, including their helmets and respirators, at the station or on firefighters, it can help make them less scared of encountering a firefighter in an emergency. 
 
 Firefighters are amazing confidence boosters 
 
I don't usually like to generalize, but all of the firefighters I have met in recent years—both at our local station and in ones we have visited in our travels—have been incredibly welcoming and encouraging to Max. The ones at our local department have made Max feel like he is capable of doing anything, exactly the message we have always sent to him. In their eyes, he is a hero. 
 
 It's good for firefighters to know your situation 
 
If
 you have any concerns about fire safety—whether an exit plan or a 
hazard—you can get insight and advice from your local fire station, and 
even schedule a free home fire safety inspection. If you have a child or other family member with 
special needs or who's elderly, you can ask that he or she be placed on a  special list so the fire department knows where their bedrooms are located in the house. 
(For more
 fire safety tips,  check out these  from Kidde  and these  from SafeKids). 
 
 We owe our firefighters appreciation 
 
While our local firefighters are paid municipal workers, there's not enough money in the world to compensate them for the work they do. Meanwhile, volunteer firefighters protect more than 50 percent of Americans, particularly in rural areas. They all deserve props for keeping us safe, and stopping by to say hi or bring some home-baked treats is one easy way of showing the love. 
 
This video pretty much sums up Max's relationship with firefighters.

One question you do not want to ask your kid
" "
 
 
 
 
Valentine's Day, Max was filled with love...for firefighters. I'd been pysched when he woke up and told me he wanted to make a card, only it turned out he wanted to make it for Firefighter Angelo, his bff at our local station. 
 
 
 
 
Max's speech therapist showed up later that day, with a plan to make cards. Once again, Max wanted to declare his love for firefighters (this time, Ed, too). And fire trucks. Oh, and Chicago. 
 
 
 
 
 
Hey, I'm not taking this personally. I appreciated this armchair-shrink comment from a Facebook reader: \" Well,
 his firefighter love is, in a way, an extension of your love for him 
and his for you. It's what gives him the opportunity to explore and 
enjoy his love of all things firefighter.\" 
 
Dave, however, regularly asks for trouble. At least once a day, the following exchange takes place at our house: 
 
Dave: \"Max, who do you love more—Daddy or Fireman Angelo?\" 
 
Max: \"AN-GE-LO!\" 
 
Dave: \"What?!\" 
 
Max: [Evil cackle] 
 
I am  so  not going there.

Equal fun at the playground for kids with special needs
" "
 A  Boundless Playground  in Greenville, South Carolina opened on Monday. If you've never heard of it, Boundless Playgrounds is a nonprofit that works with communities to develop playgrounds accessible to all kids, including ones with disabilities. There are more than 200 of them now, including ones in two Canadian provinces.  Is it awful to say that I am a leeetle bit jealous?  I am. We do not have an accessible playground in our area. The adapting has been done solely by me and Dave—going down slides with Max, climbing jungle gyms with Max, holding Max up to reach things, helping him settle into a swing. Max doesn't know any better; he's just having a good time. Me, I ache for one of these playgrounds because they encourage independence. Fun and feeling like you can do it: an unbeatable combo. Even if our 'hood lacks one, I'm grateful to the  CVS Caremark All Kids Can  program  for supporting Boundless Playgrounds  throughout the country. They've donated more than $4 million to projects since 2006—that's 60 Boundless Playgrounds. Soon they're going to be pitching in with the building of the 250th playground.  You can see if there is a Boundless Playground in your 'hood  here , find out how to get the wheels in motion  here , and register a playground project  here .  Of course, it would be so lovely if parents didn't have to take the initiative and accessible playgrounds were a de facto part of our lives. There are approximately 7 million kids with disabilities in this country, and I think it's safe to say the vast majority of them enjoy outdoor play—and want to have just as much fun as their peers.  Do you have an accessible playground in your area? How do you help your child enjoy playgrounds?  This is one of a series of posts sponsored by CVS Caremark All Kids Can, a more than $25 million commitment to making life better for children with disabilities. Please \"Like\" them  on Facebook —they deserve it.

Hi! Taking a break from Epcot to let you all know that today is Purple Day, created to raise awareness about epilepsy. You can read all about it at purpleday.org. We are having a fantastic time at Disney; they are beyond accommodating to kids with special needs.  Max introduces himself to everyone as Purple Max. His new favorite ride is...the monorail! He loves the characters, too. And Mickey Mouse ice-cream pops (my weakness as well). Please go learn more about Purple Day, and have a purplelicious weekend!

Winners, genius moms (that would be you) and Max's new name

 I was blown away by the response to the post on sharing your therapy-play tips, where commenters could  win a $50 CVS/pharmacy gift card . Us mamas are so creative, if I do say so myself! We learned about lentil therapy, yogurt therapy, PVC pipe therapy, iPod therapy, makeup therapy, big brother therapy, shaving cream therapy, dollar-store therapy, straw therapy, Jell-O therapy, origami therapy, Silly Putty therapy and the very unique \"long-suffering cat\" therapy. You guys even impressed the pros; one play therapist said she was going to pass ideas along to her parents. So yay, mom experts!  The 10 randomly-picked commenters who will each receive a CVS/pharmacy gift card are Carla, Kathy, Mary, Shelley, Kristan, Em, Junior, Ferfischer, Jennifer Thayer and Reese Dixon. Congrats! And a tremendous thank you to  CVS Caremark All Kids Can , an awe-inspiring program dedicated to helping children with disabilities. If you haven't yet checked out what they're all about, please do.  In other news, Jailen is going to be getting that fun dome from  the second Special Needs Swap Shop . Jessica, please send a photo of him using it!  If any of you have gadgets or enabling devices to offer up for kids with special needs, e-mail me and I can list it in a post. Also, let me know if any of you need something in particular; several readers are in the market for Pony walkers. Last news flash of the day: Max is now referring to himself as  Purple Max . We are not allowed to call him just \"Max\" anymore. It can't be long before he asks us to legally change his name.

Does Ari Ne'eman believe parents of low functioning autistic children want their kids to 'drop dead'?
" "
I just came across this rather entertaining video on youtube in which Ari Ne'eman's position on the NCD is endorsed. About 2 minutes and 30 seconds or so into the video what this individual says is rather shocking. He states that the parents of low functioning autistic children wish their kids would 'drop dead'. I wonder why Ari Ne'eman has not complained to youtube or has not gone out of his way to disavow this video that his supporter made. Or does Ne'eman himself believe this? We have seen in the past that  some supporters of neurodiversity  whose blog was linked on the autism hub stated that parents of autistic children who support a cure for their children are like members of the ku klux klan who are forced to raise black children. When your humble blogger asked hub owner Dave Seidel about this, he refused to denounce that statement. We have also seen  in the past  that neurodiversity blogger \"the autistic bitch from hell\" calls autistics that she does not agree with who want a cure \"uncle toms\". She has also stated that those of us who have had trouble keeping a job due to our disability are lazy loafers who just want a government handout and won't take responsibility for our lives. Also she has stated that those of us who don't agree with her positions should either be taken out and shot or turned into catfood. This person has donated to ASAN. It is rumored that \"the autistic bitch from hell\" is in fact attorney Meg Evans who is secretary of Ne'eman's organization, ASAN one of the top people in the organization barely below Ne'eman himself in the chain of command. To the best of my knowledge, Ne'eman has never denounced ABFH . I wonder if Ari Ne'eman would care to comment on this statement from one of his supporters. I wonder if President Obama will read my blog and comment why he would appoint an individual to a government position who keeps company with people like this. However, I won't hold my breath.

Lisa Jo Rudy's strange choices for the autism speaks board
" "
Lately, there has been some controversy concerning the fact that not a single person on the autism spectrum is on the board of autism speaks or has no position of power there.  Ordinarily I would agree that this is a legitimate beef.  It would be good if someone on the spectrum could add some input and I feel at least some persons on the spectrum (myself included at the risk of sounding arrogant) who are in favor of AS's stated goal of curing and preventing autism might make good candidates for board members.  Besides myself, some possible choices would be this lady who calls herself Droopy, who is nonverbal, but is very articulate using a keyboard.  Another good possible choice would be Tom Mckean.  Also Marty Murphy is another possible candidate.  However Lisa Jo Rudy of the autism about blog seems to have some other persons in mind.  She suggests Temple Grandin, Stephen Shore, Ari Neeman, John Michael Carley and Michelle Dawson.  Not a single one of these five persons is in favor of curing autism yet for some reason that is beyond my comprehension Rudy seems to feel that these five should be considered for an organization who is in favor of curation and prevention when all of them have publicly stated they are adamantly opposed to this notion. Two of the five have asperger's rather than autism and would not even have been diagnosable as autistic during their childhood based on the diagnostic criteria that was extant during that time.  Shore already serves on the IACC for some strange reason I can't fathom when he is against a cure for autism yet the IACC was created out of the combating autism act which states curation and prevention are goals.  Michelle Dawson, works in the laboratory of Laurent Mottron which receives funding from autism speaks in spite of the fact that in some of her writings she makes it quite plain how much she despises this organization, yet she continues to work in this lab and has not resigned in protest.  Should members of the Ku Klux Klan be appointed to serve as board members of the NAACP.  How about if the DNC just to be fair puts five republicans on their board of directors, after all the fact that they are all democrats must be unfair to the republicans.  It seems to me that most if not all of the people who complain about no autistics on the board of autism speaks are those with a neurodiversity agenda who are opposed to a cure and prevention and seem concerned that research funded by AS will someday lead to selective abortions of autistic fetuses.  Could these people have an ulterior motive for serving on this board.  It seems there is a pattern among at least some persons in the ND movement to attempt to hijack the capital of others who have worked hard to earn it.  Bob Wright worked very hard to acquire the capital for AS so his grandson might have a slim chance of a decent life that the ND people want to seem to deny his grandson in the unlikely event a cure or at least some other treatment from AS's scientific research were found in our lifetime.  Ditto for the persons who donated money to AS and organized the walks and walked so that their children and relatives could have a chance of a better life but have been called eugenecists by people who seem to think they should serve on their board.    Michelle Dawson has advocated that scientists who do not agree with the agenda of AS apply for research grants there.  Ari Neeman and others in the ASAN have urged persons to request things from the IACC which grew out of the combating autism act a law which they made very plain that they did not like and which they attempted to prevent congress from passing.  Yet they want to take advantage of this law they don't like.  It is quite possible that the ND movement just wants to take over the large capital of AS, as they are a movement whose numbers are too small to raise sufficient capital to start their own organization and fund raising efforts.  When I suggested that as a person on the spectrum who wants a cure for autism that I should be on the board and that if i were running the show the funding the lauren mottron lab receives from AS would be discontinued since they employ Michelle Dawson  this nasty neurodiversity hatemonger who calls themselves alyric who is apparently a pal of Dawson's berated me saying that what i was doing was malicious spite and made the nasty and abusive personal attack that my minder did not teach me any manners.  I think it is likely that an AS board member who agreed with the cure philosophy who was autistic would be called a token autistic and a house autistic and would result in the ND anticure movement starting yet another internet war on top of all the others they seem to have a proclivity to start.  Ms. Rudy's suggestions for board members clearly baffle me and I hope that if there is an AS board member on the spectrum  they will not be drawn from the ND crowd.

Kevin Leitch Goes Overboard, Opposes Interests of Children with Autism
" "
Yup Kevin Leitch opposes the interests and well being of autistic children. That is the logical conclusion of the false dichotomy Kevin Leitch creates when he  accuses  Bob Wright of opposing the interests ofautistic adults. Mr. Leitch has his knickers in a knot because Mr. Wright  commented on the activities of a few autistic adults in disrupting a benefit and therefore in Kevin's mind he is opposed to the interests of all autistic adults. Using Kevin Logic, in attacking Bob Wright for defending a benefit for autistic children, Kevin Leitch opposes the interests and well being of autistic children.   Autism is a spectrum and some like the ASAN supporters who stepped away from their keyboards to try and disrupt a benefit to help autistic children, have  abilities lacking in many severely autistic children and adults. Bob Wright said, much more politely than I would have done, that he wished his more severely impaired grandson had their abilities.  That is all he said. The protesters subscribe to an ideology promoted by a few high functioning adults with autism and Aspergers who oppose the idea of curing autism.  They are not content to oppose cures for themselves.  They oppose cures for other people's children and for other adults more severely impaired then them.  Mr. Leitch also subscribes to this ideology and is opposed to Autism Speaks and Bob Wright.  Kevin Leitch is so tied to this anti-cure ideology that he is willing to  shred whatever remains of his credibility and accuse Bob Wright of being opposed to autistic adults. Kevin Leitch's comments about Bob Wright are nonsense, pure and utter nonsense, and should not be taken seriously.  Give your head a shake Kev. You are losing it. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

Michael John Carley: Candidate for AS board of directors?
" "
One of the many complaints that neurodiversity proponents have about their favorite organization, autism speaks, is their apparent belief that AS disenfranchises those with autism in that no members of the board of directors are actually on the spectrum themselves. For some reason that remains a mystery to your humble blogger it is more important to these people to have someone serve as board of director of an organization to whose goals they have overt hostility than it is for autism speaks to employ someone with autism in their organization. I am not sure what the unemployment rate is among persons with autism, but it is a good guess that it is mighty high. I have previously written about the autism and the workplace promotion (which I won't link to) done by autism speaks in spite of the salient absence of a paid autistic employee in their group. One of the arguments made for putting a spectrumite on the board of directors of AS is that other autism organizations have persons on the spectrum in position of power. For example one of the board members of ASA is Valerie Paradiz, a Ph.D. in German literature, a former college professor, published author of a memoir and now an autism consultant and lecturer. She makes the claim (which I am skeptical of) that she herself is on the spectrum. I am mystified how this person gives a voice to someone like Dov Shestack or John Belmonte or any other non-speaking person with autism who requires round-the-clock care. Or even for someone on the spectrum relatively high functioning such as myself. It seems as though persons with autism who believe in an neurodiversity perspective may have cause to celebrate. It would seem that one of their own, Michael John Carley, who like Dr. Paradiz has a published memoir and is an autism lecturer (though not sure if he is a consultant) seems to have quite a friendly relationship with autism speaks. He has had AS president, Mark Roithmayr give his book a shout-out. He and former autism speaks executive, Allison Tepper Singer exchanged some articles of understanding in which they publicly exchanged views. Given the controversy over the recent \"I am autism\" video. Carley has  weighed in with his perspective . A neurodiversity blogger, Sarah, a cat in a dog's world, has given her take on Carley's perspective . We see from reading this that though Carley has never met Bob or Suzanne Wright he has met their grandson. So, there seems to be a friendship between Carley and some persons in AS. (though Tepper-Singer is no longer with the organization). Carley has tried to talk up autism speaks. He has disingenuously claimed that they are talking less about a cure. Sarah correctly called him on this. One place where Carley did hit the nail on the head was his assertion that certain individuals were jealous of the Wright's financial situation. Now this is probably the real reason ND wants an autistic person on the board-particularly an autistic who shares their perspective. They can't acquire the capital for their activities, so by getting on the board of autism speaks, they will be in a better position to acquire it for their own ends. Carley talks about how the research autism speaks will have some sort of global benefit. This is in spite of the fact that he has spoken for all autistics preaching the familiar \"acceptance not cure\" mantra on radio interviews. In his book \"Asperger's from the Inside out\" Carley has claimed that there is a universal feeling among those on the spectrum that they should not be cured. Naturally he neglected to consult either Roger Kulp or myself or any other pro-cure autistic. Carley who was able to get married, have children, work in a decent paying job and likely never spent a day of his life in a special education school, did not find out he had AS until age 36. Only after his son was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. This is the reason I only read bits and portions of his book and not the entire book. I do not feel he has anything to offer to me about information about the spectrum on a personal level. For these reasons, it concerns me that he actually has a shot of being the first person claiming to be on the spectrum who will gain one of the coveted board of directors positions at autism speaks. One would think that neurodiversity would be celebrating and dancing in the street that one of their own has a realistic shot of getting that big score, one of their own, being on the board. Apparently not. Sarah has certainly called him to task. The much nastier ND, \"the autistic bitch from hell\" has not minced her own words and has referred to Carley as a \"curebie suckup\" and a \"quisling\", slurs that the ND community has called your humble blogger in the past. Carley's ND detractors rightfully see him as someone who may have an ulterior motive in being involved with a pro-cure organization when Carley himself has said that a cure should not be found. Carley, an author, and autism lecturer, it would seem, makes a good portion of his living on the backs of persons with Asperger's and autism. He sees what a good idea it is to get involved with this organization. Amazing, Sarah, ABFH and I all agree on something! So, apparently Carley's appointment to the board won't shut up the ND lobbyists who so adamantly insist that one of their own be appointed to the board of directors. Carley's behavior may be, however, what it takes to get one of their own on the board. Here you have it ND's, one of your own may soon be on the board of autism speaks. He will lobby for acceptance rather than cure in the board meetings. He will lobby for the politically correct language you so desire. But somehow it would seem you are not happy with this. You see Carley for what he is. But you wanted someone on the spectrum on the board. Now you may have it. Perhaps in the future you neurodiversity proponents should be careful what you wish for.

We constantly hear from neurodiversity that funding medical research for autism is different from funding research for cancer or AIDS because the latter diseases kill people. Perhaps they should tell this to  the parents of christian DeJons  Perhaps Michelle Dawson, Morton Gernsbacher and Laurent Mottron as well as Autism Speaks  who donated half a million dollars to these people  should tell Christian's parents that  autism isn't harmful

autism's gadfly,  A Name Well Chosen, A Blog Worth Visiting
" "
If you want to read a good \"autism\" blog check out  autism's gadfly  hosted by Jonathan Mitchell.  He is truly a straight shooter who calls it the way he sees it. And doesn't mind, or maybe enjoys, challenging anyone's autism beliefs and opinions.  Although Jonathan is an adult with autism he is not anti-cure and does not embrace the Neurodiversity/Autism Rights ideologies - the full title of his blog is \" autism's gadfly  I don't need no stinkin' neurodiversity \" I enjoy reading Jonathon's comments even though we disagree on many points, particularly ABA. As he puts  it on his  web site  Jonathon is pro-cure, anti-neurodiversity, anti-special ed, anti-ABA.  Not being a fan of the Neurodiversity/alleged Autism Rights Movement I enjoy the shots he takes at the leaders of those \"movements\" although I wince when he calls parents well intentioned but misguided for advocating for specific treatments, including ABA. Good Morning America should do their viewers a favor and grant Jonathan the equal time he requested as an autistic person who does not share the Neurodiversity views advocated on their show by alleged Autism Rights advocate Ari Ne'eman. (Mr. Ne'eman was also accompanied by autism parent Kristina Chew who has embraced the  sweet surrender  of the anti-cure  Neurodiversity movement.) Not all autistic persons, even those who are high functioning, share Mr. Ne'eman's views.  And not all  agree with the heated rhetoric of Michelle  Dawson.    autism's gadfly is one that does not.  His unique perspective is well worth reading. autism

neurodiversity hatemongers dish it out can't take it
" "
In the people throwing stones from houses made out of fragile glass department, I just read  an interesting post  from well known neurodiversity blogger Amanda Baggs. She talks about how two stellar individuals from the neurodiversity movement, Kowalski, and Sadder but wiser girl have closed down their blogs due to bullying. Amanda neglects to go into the specifics, but implies there was stalking and death threats. I am also reminded of Kevin Leitch, owner of the left brain/right brain blog who closed LB/RB for a brief time, when the infamous John Best spent time being his daughter's sockpuppet with a \"daddy please cure me\" thing, who is another example of an ND blogger who did something similar but not cited by Amanda.  We have to wonder if the old cliche hate begets hate applies here.  The first time I had heard of Sadder but Wiser girl, she was writing about how much dissatisfaction she had with your humble blogger's beliefs that autism should be cured, nonverbal autistics should be able to speak.  She also went on to compare me to a Jew who helped the Nazis during the holocaust and claimed I was the type who would gladly jump in a crematorium.  Kowalski, one half of the Kowalski and Turner duo, wrote a blog post about how parents who support autism speaks and want a cure for autism are like members of the Ku Klux Klan who are forced to raise black children. Sadder but Wiser girl commented how much she agreed with K &T on this point, so in addition to believing that I am like a Jew who helps the nazis, she also believes that parents of autistic children who support autism speaks and want a cure for their children are like KKK members forced to raise black children.   Though Amanda is quite vague about the specifics, we have to wonder if whatever bullying these two August bloggers have received, alleged or otherwise, was maybe due to such harsh criticism of individuals who either want a better life or want to improve the life of their children. Amanda certainly knows about bullying.  She is one of the owners of the web page autistics.org who implied that the now defunct organization Cure Autism Now only had as their goal the development of a prenatal test so that autistic fetuses could be aborted with her nasty cartoon with the autistic fetus in a trashcan with the letters CAN written on it and the caption, \"The real meaning of autism prevention\".  Amanda has billed her organization as the real voice of autism.  Neurodiversity complaining about bullying is absurd as the majority of them are incredible bullies themselves.  In addition to SBWG's comments about me, I have had my parents insulted, I have been mocked and ridiculed and libeled.  One nasty blogger even went so far as to write a libelous post claiming I was at an autism dinner and looked up Portia Iversen's dress and became so enamored, I immediately became a traitor to the autistic rights movement.  I have had people use me as a sock puppet and forge my name to saying certain things.  I have been cussed out and ridiculed by one stellar individual who also said that I should become the homosexual bed partner of another anti-ND blogger and go to a state where homosexuals can legally marry.  Phil Gluyas also created a blog Mitchell's gadfly, just directed to me where he and his friends would constantly insult me.  When he realized he could not shut me up, he finally closed down Mitchell's gadfly.  I am proud to say in spite of all this abuse I have endured, I have not closed down autism's gadfly.  I am proud to be one of the few voices on the internet to speak out against this ugly cult called neurodiversity.  It seems as if neurodiversity wants to dish it out they should be able to take it.  Just shows what a pathetic movement they really are.

Neurodiversity Hate Video Extremism
" "
 Much of the autism advocacy in the past 10-20 years has been led by parents seeking to treat and cure their own autistic children, either by ABA therapy or by seeking cures.  Parent advocates have come under attack from some high functioning autistic persons who have formed a loose coalition of bloggers who oppose the right of other peoples' autistic children to be treated or cured for their autistic disorders. Most of the Neurodiversity commentary has been civil.   Some has been silly, snide and sarcastic.  Now some extremist ND bloggers are confessing their hatred of parent autism advocates openly on the internet as shown in this Christschool video promoted on  Autism Street . It will be interesting to see if ASAN and Neurodiversity leaders like Ari Ne'eman, Dora Raymaker and Kristina Chew, and Change.org,  distance themselves from this hate video.  Chew and Ne'eman once complained about offensive imagery about autistics.  Will they now drink deep from the well of hypocrisy and embrace this blatant hate video message? In the video CS literally demonizes autism (parent) advocates seeking  to cure their own children.  This video constitutes hate propaganda, contrary to the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child.  The video is also a direct and offensive attack on the rights of parents to advocate for their children, and the rights of children as declared by the United Nations to have their parents advocate on their behalf. autism   var addthis_pub = 'AutismRealityNB';

Ari Ne'eman disenfranchises pro-cure and nonverbal autistics yet again
" "
I see that once again, neurodiversity spokesman, Ari Ne'eman is shooting his mouth off yet again  yet again, claiming that the \"autistic community\" takes offense at eradicating autism. I have to wonder, yet again, does the \"autistic community\" include me? Does it include Jake Crosby, Stephanie Keil, Oliver Canby, JediKnight, Tom McKean, Sue Rubin and numerous others on the spectrum who have expressed desire for a cure? How about Connor Doherty who may not be in a position to speak for himself. What about Sean Lapin, Dov Shestack, John Belmonte and many other autistic persons who have limited to nonexistent speech who are incapable of rebutting Ne'eman's nonsense and asking him to butt out and speak for himself and and not for other autistics. Ne'eman also stated in this diatribe at Harvard that autism should be looked upon as a disability and not a disease, yet neglects to explain the difference between a disability and a disease. As has been meticulously documented in numerous posts on autism's gadfly, Ne'eman has repeatedly stated that he does not believe that autism is a disability in spite of claiming he never said anything to that effect. We have to wonder why he is now backpedaling and now stating autism should be looked upon as a disability. Could there be political reasons? Ari Ne'eman and ASAN, I resent you trying to speak for all autistic persons. Almost all of us, myself included, are lower functioning (or more impaired for those who express distaste at the low functioning high functioning dichotomy) than you are. There are others who can't speak and say that they would like autism eradicated. There are others, besides me, who have expressed a desire for a cure. Their numbers seem to be ever growing. Remember, Ari, nothing about us without us.

Michael John Carley disses nonAsperger's lower functioning autistics
" "
I have recently read  an interesting post  on the autism jabberwocky blog about neurodiversitite Michael John Carley. Roger Kulp of the new \"smash the spectrum\" blog  mentions Carley in his post also . It would seem that Mr. Carley, an individual who was able to get married, have two children, support a family and was not diagnosed with an ASD until age 36 and only after one of his sons was diagnosed with an ASD feels that the new changes in the DSM which would eliminate Asperger's and make all ASD's part of a group just called autism are in his words \"hard to swallow\". Carley has stated in his book Asperger's from the inside out that there is a universal feeling among persons on the autism spectrum that they don't want to be cured.  He seems to want to speak for me in spite of being Asperger's which means he likely never had a speech delay as I had or spent several years in special education as I did.  Naturally Carley has no basis for this blanket statement other than various things he has read on wrongplanet or other ND websites.  So he spreads the same baloney that Alex Plank spreads. Carley takes pride in his Asperger's diagnosis because he states that Einstein and Jefferson had Asperger's syndrome. As at least some readers of the gadfly blog know  I have written an essay  which refutes this notion by Carley and other NDs. Carley apparently does not like the idea of being called autistic because it means he would be classified along with persons who head bang or who are adults in diapers rather than being able to fancy himself another Albert Einstein or Thomas Jefferson. MJ, author of the autism jabberwocky blog, who, if I am not mistaken, has two twin daughters who are both on the more severe end of the spectrum (I guess if MJ reads this he can correct me if I am wrong), naturally took umbrage at this comment. Carley's beliefs seem to be rather condescending if not somewhat bigoted. MJ pointed out that it would seem strange that this man who at one time made a living as a diplomat working with the United Nations would in fact be so undiplomatic and I agree with his assessment. Roger Kulp, in the above linked post, pointed out some MRI studies that suggest that on a neurophysiologic level that autism and Asperger's may be more dissimilar disorders than people at first thought. So there may be something to the autism is not Asperger's mantra. One wonders if other ND's share Carley's sentiments. They claim to be about dignity and human rights. They claim that autism speaks and the autism genetic resource exchange largely exist to deliberately come up with a prenatal test that would enable autistic fetuses to be aborted. Yet Carley does not seem to care about anyone but Shiny Aspies besides himself. One can only hope that the new changes in the DSM will mean that most neurodiversitites who state they are on the spectrum who have asperger's rather than autism will no longer be able to call themselves autistic and say they are people like me, who had a speech delay as a small child and was probably pretty severely autistic and went to special schools for 8 years etc. I can also hope that perhaps the new DSM might mean the end of the neurodiversity movement.  I wrote about this idea in a previous gadfly post  but I reckon it is really too much to wish for.

\"Sullivan's\" odd views on neurodiversity, respect, human rights and dignity
" "
I see that the well-known pro-neurodiversity blogger, Matt Carey (AKA \"Sullivan\"), is  at it again    trotting out an abstract of a paper which I doubt he's even bothered to read to bolster the strawman argument he repeatedly makes that those of us who oppose neurodiversity are opposed to dignity and human rights for persons with autism. 
 
The paper deals with the views of those with intellectual and developmental disabilities who want dignity and respect in research that involves them.  Though the abstract of the article does not mention either autism nor neurodiversity, Carey vis-a-vis some sort of possibly convoluted logic which I'm not nearly sophisticated enough to understand ties this publication into one of his pet topics, i.e. neurodiversity equals respect and dignity and human rights. 
 
We can see from  wikipedia's definition  that they give a different meaning from Carey: 

 Neurodiversity is a \"controversial concept [that] ... regards atypical neurological development as a normal human difference\" 
 
Carey states:  
 
 Call it “human rights and dignity” and it isn’t a controversial concept.
 It may not be always followed but it isn’t controversial. Call it 
“neurodiversity” and somehow it’s a big deal.    
 
Mr. Carey, I realize a prestigious blogger and public member of the IACC probably won't take the time to read my piddling gadfly blog.  However, I wonder how you can equate claiming that the atypical neurologic development is not an impairment, but rather a human normal difference to dignity and respect? 
 
Also, the on-line behavior of  those involved in neurodiversity seems to involve denying anyone with an autism spectrum disorder or possibly other neurologic or psychiatric impairment a cure if one is available and they so desire one.  The motto of Kevin Leitch who created the autism hub and in fact is Mr. Carey's predecessor as the main author of the blog that Carey now writes for was \"We don't need no stinkin' cure\".  Well, in response, I say, \"We don't need no stinkin' neurodiversity.\"  That is not about human or civil rights.  I want a cure for autism.  I believe that autism is a disability, defect and disease and not a normal human difference or variation.  Does this mean I am opposed to civil rights for others or dignity or respect as both Michelle Dawson and Mr. Carey have stated?  Not at all.  I am all for human rights, dignity and respect.  Can the same thing be said of neurodiversity proponents?  Continue reading this post for the answer to that.     
 
He also states that people are mistaken that neurodiversity is a concept only involving high functioning autism and they are mistaken about his son's functioning level.  I don't know how high-functioning Carey's son is, yet I've never heard any pro-neurodiversity arguments from someone on the spectrum who was not high functioning.  In fact, it would appear the majority of them are far higher functioning than anyone else who has autism.  They can marry, have children, have good jobs, go to graduate school and pursue ph.d's, etc.  I would be curious if Mr. Carey's son/daughter holds the same point of view as he does or if Carey has even inquired.  If his offspring is too low functioning to understand or answer, then I don't understand how Carey can speak for him.   
 
How about dignity and respect?  What of the ND who emailed brain researcher Matthew Belmonte calling him a nazi?  What about those who have called me Goebels, Mitchell-shite, and have written libelous posts about me and spent time harassing me.  What of one ND who stated that parents of children don't give a fuck about their autistic kids and wish they would drop dead.  What of your fellow IACC public member Noah Britton who has equated parents who wish a cure for their autistic children and support autism speaks with members of the Ku Klux Klan?  Do proponents of the neurodiversity movement treat people with dignity and respect?  No, I don't think so. 
 
No, Mr. Carey, human rights and dignity are not controversial topics.  I don't see how you or anyone else can deny whether or not autism is a disability and a disease or whether or not it's a normal human variation isn't a controversial opinion.  I don't comprehend how stating that persons who can't speak, can't dress themselves, let alone work and who engage in self-injurious behavior should not only be denied a cure if one were available, but also be labeled racists if their parents desire a cure for them is not controversial.  Again, Mr. Carey, your convoluted logic is way too sophisticated for me to follow.       
 
The fact this individual is a member of a publicly funded body that gives recommendations to the federal govermnent regarding autism policy concerns me deeply.

an article those who scorn pro-cure autistics should read
" "
Neurodiversity activisit Alex Plank  has stated  that most autistics don't want to be cured.  This is in spite of the fact  he's not above accepting charity  from Autism Speaks, the organization who has stated that their ultimate goal is a cure for autism. 
 
There are apparently at least some other members of the neurodiversity movement who feel this way also. 
One immature teenage girl  said  that I'm like who Jew who helped the nazis during the holocaust.  Two of the most hard core hatemongers in the ND movement, whom I'll decline to name in this post, have stated that my desire for a cure for autism and even my disability comes from a domineering mother who was a witch and a shrew who taught me to hate myself.  These individuals have effectively tried to bring back the Bettelheim era which I lived through as a small child.  Retired neurodiversity blogger, the autistic bitch from hell has stated that all of the multiple persons with autism who receive disability benefits or applied for disability benefits are uncle toms who do so because we don't want to take responsibility for our lives and want to grovel before the feet of bureaucrats who'll pat us on our little incompetent heads.  She states we ought to be lined up against the wall and shot and/or strangled to death and turned into cat food.  ABFH is rumored to be Meg Evans, one of the executives in the autistic self-advocacy network who now have a seat on the IACC and the National Council on Disabilities, even though in the past they've stated they don't believe autism and Asperger's are disabilities.  
 
Here's  an article  I believe the above-named individuals and others who feel as they do should read.

Another article on neurodiversity
" "
I see that  yet another article on the ND movement has been published  in the latest issue of autism asperger's digest. Your humble blogger and Age of autism staffer Jake Crosby are given token mention as anti neurodiversity bloggers. Though the article is entitled Neurodiversity: A Balanced Opinion, author Nick Dubin's opinion is anything but balanced. He most clearly embraces neurodiversity and is opposed to a cure for autism. Interestingly enough Dr. Dubin did not find out he was on the spectrum until age 27 and then five years later obtained a doctoral degree in psychology. Most of the stuff in the article is very old news for anyone who has followed the ND movement for any length of time, but I still linked to it on here as it might make an interesting read for some persons. Of note the article mentions William Stillman, a self-diagnosed autistic with no credentials who apparently can get $100 an hour for a phone consult and when questioning how smart a person on the spectrum is Stillman states, 'presume intelligence'. More interesting is the statement about Michael John Carley. Dubin States: Carley serves as a true role model for people of all ages on the spectrum. His character and actions exude tolerance and respect and his efforts to serve as a bridge of understanding to those who are not on the spectrum are admirable Though it is probable that Dubin wrote the article before Carley made his recent controversial statements regarding his views of Asperger's being taken out of the DSM and not wanting to be associated with autistics who were head bangers or who wore diapers as adults one can laugh at the irony of this. I think some of my ND opponents will agree with me on this point. Again, old stuff for most of us, but something that might be worth a cursory read in any event.

Autism speaks appoints autistic board members, pro-cure autists again scorned. 
" "
Autism Speaks  has announced  the appointment of three new members to their board of directors, two of three being on the autism spectrum.  The neurodiversity movement (and possibly others) had railed against AS for years, claiming they were ogres for not ever having a single board member who had the condition themselves.  Now I hope the neurodiversity movement is satisfied.  We'll see if they call Shore and Paradiz traitors.  So far, they have not used such graphic language, but upon the announcement of Shore's appointment, The Thinking Person's Guide to autism tweeted that they hoped it wasn't tokenism.  The twitter account of boycotting autism speaks stated it was a step in the right direction but they still would not support autism speaks as long as they were pro-cure and used scare tactics to tell people how bad autism is.     
 
Though Autism Speaks has stated that one of their goals is finding a cure for autism, they appointed the anti-cure John Elder Robison to their scientific advisory board in spite of the fact that he was a high school dropout with no knowledge of autism science.  This did not satisfy neurodiversity proponents and Robison ultimately ended up tendering his resignation when autism speaks would not come around to his way of thinking.  
 
Paradiz is a former professor of German literature at Bard College.  She subsequently started a consultancy business for educating autistic children with no formal training or background, except for being the parent of a son diagnosed with Asperger's.  She was apparently diagnosed well into adulthood after her son received his diagnosis.  She was formerly married to Steve Edelson who took over running the autism research institute after Dr. Rimland passed away.  She wrote a book about her son, Elijah's cup.  In this book, she describes attending the Autreat conference, one of the premier neurodiversity conferences which is presented by Jim Sinclair's organization Autism Network International.  I'm not sure where Ms. Paradiz stands on a cure for autism.  
 
More intriguing is the appointment of Stephen Shore, who wrote the autobiographical account of growing up with autism, Beyond The Wall.  He received a doctorate in education and is a professor of special education at Adelphia University.  He also presents at conferences all over the world.  I've known Steve for many years now and he's stated that he opposes a cure for autism because it would interfere with the gene pool.  He also stated that at the time they appointed Robison to their scientific advisory board that he'd also been approached by autism speaks to serve with them in some capacity (though I'm not sure of the specifics) and turned them down because he disagreed with their views on a number of issues.  I'm not sure why he changed his mind. 
 
The biggest disappointment is that they did not appoint my first choice, Roger Kulp.  Roger is someone on the spectrum far more severely afflicted than Shore or Paradiz.  He has looked into treatments for his problems and extensively researched the literature on metabolic causes of autism.  Roger has expressed an interest in either being on the science advisory board or the board of directors. I've written about Roger's background  in a previous post  so I won't repeat the info here. 
 
I guess wanting autism speaks to stop supporting neurodiversity in a backhanded manner and taking such a cavalier attitude toward those of us on the spectrum who want a cure is too much to hope for. 
 
Addendum:  I've just spoken to Steve Shore and he states that he's had a change of heart because Brian Kelly, the new chairman of the AS board is advocating for supports and services over a cure.  Mr. Kelly took over as chairman of the board after Bob Wright resigned in May.  Mr. Kelly   has written  about parents contacting him for the need for supports and services.  Though I am not opposed to supports and services for people on the autism spectrum, I do believe that autism speaks should give more priority to scientific research with the aim of curing autism.  If autism speaks has headed in a new direction, this is certainly a disappointment.

Google's double standard re neurodiversity
" "
That 21st century Bruno Bettelheim, Clay Adams, who claims that autistic persons who don't like their autism and wish to be cured do so, because they were influenced by domineering mothers  is at it again . Apparently not being able to think of anything original to write about me let alone any actual arguments against any of my criticisms of neurodiversity and it's various proponents has taken some old satirical and mocking songs directed towards your humble blogger and reprinted them from various places he has written them before in a blog post. Adams, who claims to have obtained an autism diagnosis in his 50's was able to serve in the navy, get married and hold down jobs where he made enough money to support at least one or two children. He apparently was also able to retire at a somewhat younger age than other social security recipients from having made astute investments. Adams has claimed that the only reason I am too impaired to serve in the military or get married is because of attitudes that my mother foisted upon me it was not due to a neurologic impairment. His pal Harry Williams (AKA Socrates) has agreed to this belief in the comments section claiming none of my disabilities comes from autism. This hits home with me because unlike I suspect the vast majority of persons in the autism blogosphere, particularly members of the infamous autism hub I actually lived through the Bettelheim era, where I underwent psychoanalysis and my mother (and I guess to a lesser extent my dad) were blamed for my problems by my former therapist. I have already had to live through this era in my youth, now Mr. Adams has been attempting to get me to live through it again. Normally I would just ignore Clay Adams' slights as he clearly is out to get attention and I should not be giving him the attention he craves so much. However, some new issues have come up. In his post mocking me Mr. Adams ripped off a photo from my blog which is a violation of the DMCA federal law.  we see that in the past Mr. Adams has had no qualms of ripping off other people's material and infringing on copyrights  I flagged his blog and filed a DMCA complaint with google. It has been more than two days and they still have not acted upon it and have not deleted my photograph from Adams' blog. I also sent email to hub administrator Dave Seidel suggesting that if my photo were not taken down that I might file a complaint with google against him and the hub and I might also contact the hub's ISP. I only received a somewhat sarcastic reply from Mr. Seidel which I won't print here. In the past when John Best of the hating autism blog has engaged in unauthorized use of photos of Phil Gluyas and David Andrews and possibly other individuals these persons filed DMCA complaints with google and the photos were taken down in less than 24 hours. Also, I can just imagine the ire that would be directed at any equivalent autism hub that had a pro biomed chelation philosophy that hosted John Best's blog the way Seidel and the hub have endorsed and linked Clay Adams' blog. They constantly complain of Best's sometimes outrageous behavior, personal attacks and his mocking and ridiculing other persons. Yet it is fine with Seidel and the rest of the hub members that Clay Adams can write posts mocking me and ridiculing me and can infringe upon the copyright of my photo. I did point out that Seidel was only hurting himself by an association with this individual. Even more germane to this whole thing is that now the hating autism blog and it's associated blogs are dead. Google, apparently, without any explanation to Best, deleted all of his blogs. There were likely multiple complaints of John Best's angry and caustic behavior and even possibly the false allegations the ND hub members have made in the past that he threatened Ari Ne'eman with death. For the most part, as I said before, I have chosen to ignore Clay Adam's abusive statements towards my parents, his constantly writing abusive comments to me on this blog which I almost never publish. However, I believe this double standard of Google acting upon DMCA takedowns against John Best, but allowing Clay Adams to slide and use my photograph without my consent on his blog is a double standard. I have no idea why Google does not believe in fair play, why they would act against Best and not act against Adams. If the NDs think they can shut John Best up however, they are sadly mistaken. He has resurrected his blog at  http://www.hatingautism.weebly.com/  for anyone interested. As I don't approve of a lot of Best's behavior and tactics and I have urged him to tone down some of his rhetoric, it is with some reluctance that I plug his new blog. However, one must remember the addage fight fire with fire. If Seidel and the rest of the hub are willing to link to a blog which takes cheap shots at someone's disability by someone whose own autism diagnosis is dubious at best, then by all means I can have no qualms about publicizing Best's new blog. It is strangely hypocritical of neurodiversity in general and the autism hub and Dave Seidel in particular to claim they are about treating persons on the spectrum with dignity and respect when they link to a blog that tries to bring back the Bettelheim era and also someone who writes satirical songs ridiculing and mocking certain aspects of someone's disability. Though I don't condone a lot of John Best's behavior and tactics it does not mean the neurodiversity movement does not generate a lot of problems for at least some of us who are on the spectrum and their families. It is sort of like saying that because Black people sometimes riot in the streets as they did in my home town of Los Angeles in 1965 and 1992 that racism is not a problem. John Best's son is severely afflicted and barring a miracle he will never be able to refute any of the ND propaganda. Neurodiversity does present problems in that they often trivialize autism by claiming Bill Gates and others have autism. They claim autism is not a tragedy so that persons like myself who are trying to obtain disability who need it will have an even harder time and they try to stifle scientific research that could some day put an end to this miserable tragedy. If ND wants to play hardball by endorsing Clay Adams blog by linking to it on the hub then I see no problem of giving the new hating autism blog a shoutout. It is in this spirit that I publicize the new hating autism blog and look forward to reading more of what John Best has to write. If anyone from google happens to read this (assuming they don't delete my blog also) perhaps they can explain to me this double standard which shows such huge bias towards neurodiversity. Addendum: Also for the time being Best's writings can be read on hatingautismtwo.blogspot.com The latest is that for the time being Best's blogs are back up, so I guess neurodiversity has been foiled.  But I am still concerned about Google acting on DMCA takedowns on Best's blog,  but not acting against Clay Adams violations of the blogger terms of service

Sullivan gets it wrong on Ari Ne'eman again
" "
I see the left brain right brain no brain blog is  at it again  with attempts at damage control when autism's gadfly exposed Ari Ne'eman for being appointed to the national council on disabilities when he has stated in the past that he does not believe that autism is a disability. In the original essay from which I quoted Ne'eman stated the words \"difference is not disability\". I won't bother linking to the essay because it has now been changed and I have linked to it and quoted the essay  as it originally stood  in my previous post and the interested reader can see these. In the changed essay Ne'eman wrote that difference is only disability when it is not accommodated for.  Sullivan quoted this changed statement and neglected to acknowledge that the essay was later edited.  He did not bother to quote the original essay.  Even with the changed essay I disagree with Sullivan's statements that this is different from saying that autism is not a disability.  Even in the changed essay Ne'eman is still implying this, though giving himself some leeway.   Though Ne'eman's changed statement really does not change the fact that he is still stating that autism is not a disability, at least given the standard definition of disability, Sullivan is trying to claim that those of us who are unhappy about Ne'eman's appointment to the council are misquoting what he said. I suppose I should have taken a screen shot of Ne'eman's original essay to show that Sullivan and other Ne'eman supporters are really being dishonest in stating that Ne'eman never stated that autism was not a disability. The origin of Ne'eman editing the essay where he originally wrote difference is not disability probably goes back to  another pathetic attempt at damage control on Sullivan's part  where Sullivan made tons of factual errors and neglected to do the necessary research that Ne'eman in fact had said that autism is not a disability. It was autism's gadfly who did the research showing Ne'eman in the past had written in an essay the words \"difference is not disability\" and had in fact stated that autism is not a disability. Ne'eman then stated: As for the comment made about my Jewish Week article, I don’t recall saying at any point there that autism wasn’t a disability – only that it was not a disease, something I think exemplifies the neurodiversity position much better. I did seem to imply it though with the phrase “difference is not disability”. Though the phrase is technically true, I shouldn’t have phrased it that way. I was wrong to do so – and if that is the worst mistake I’ve made or ever will make in print, I’ll count myself lucky. Fortunately, I have years of advocacy work and public statements that show my work in the Disability Rights movement as a person with a disability. So at the very least Ne'eman does admit to having made an error in the original article. He then went back and edited the original article to give himself some wiggle room. Having quoted the pertinent phrases of the article as it originally stood as I have done in my previous post where I talked about my take on Ne'eman's nomination to the council, I stand by my statement that the context in which \"difference isn't disability\" Ne'eman was stating unequivocally that he (at least at the time) did not believe that autism is a disability. His statement that he never said autism was not a disability certainly is not true and there is no doubt of this. Sullivan and the other ND's can put all the spin on it they want but I don't believe there is any other way that Ne'eman's comments can be construed. It is irrelevant that he has lent his time and efforts to legislation and organizations that have used the term 'disability'. The only thing that Sullivan does get right in this piece is that the efforts on my part and others who don't want Ne'eman appointed to the council will most likely be futile. Nominations to the NDC are most likely routinely confirmed as they would not generate enough controversy or have enough people complain. These are probably not like nominations to the supreme court where a controversial candidate gets scrutiny and enough people would complain to their senators and they would be blackballed in the case of Robert Bjork and nearly blackballed in the case of Clarence Thomas. If a nomination to the NDC were in the same league as a nomination to the supreme court, I can't help thinking of the grilling that Ne'eman would be getting in a subcommittee of the senate about his previous statements.

An idea for Autism Speaks and Neurodiversity
" "
Suzanne Wright’s very recent op-ed piece and John Robison’s resultant resignation from the Autism Speaks advisory boards he served on for more than three years have gained a lot of traction on the blogosphere as well as Robison’s FB page as of late.   


 
     Ms. Wright has a very severely autistic grandson for whom she wishes a cure or a treatment which can help mitigate the hardships he and her daughter have to endure.  She wrote a piece on this subject, possibly with the intent of helping to fund raise, which may have had less than tempered rhetoric.   


 
     Predictably, the neurodiversity movement (and possibly other persons with autism and/or their relatives as well) took umbrage to her essay.   


 
     John Robison, as I mentioned before, tendered his resignation and ended his affiliation with the highest profile of autism funding, research and advocacy organization because of this essay.   


 
     The neurodiversity movement, including Robison, has been critical of the advertising techniques that AS has used for years.  They claim that these are intended to evoke pity and show a lack of respect for autistic people.   


 
     Practically since autism speaks’ inception, a variety of persons, mostly affiliated with the neurodiversity movement, has questioned why there are no autistics on the board or in executive positions with autism speaks.  This probably contributed to Robison’s subsequent appointment to the organization.  After this, there was little commentary or criticism of autism speaks exclusion of persons on the spectrum in positions of power or policy making in their organization.   


 
     All bets are on whether or not Robison’s resignation and subsequent vacancy of an autistic representative of AS does not elicit the same criticism and outrage that it did prior to Robison’s affiliation with AS.  Also bets are on as to whether or not the ND’s will neglect to acknowledge or conveniently forget Kerry Magro’s involvement with the organization they find so odious.   


 
     Roger Kulp, one of the frequent commenters on my blog, has expressed a desire to fill the vacancy that Robison created.  It is quite clear from what I have read of his life story, he has been far more impacted by his ASD than Robison has by his.  Though I believe Roger may be a valuable voice, I’m not too keen on non-scientists serving on scientific advisory boards.  Perhaps Roger could be a useful asset to autism speaks without serving in the same capacity as Robison did; I’ll address that issue later in this post.   


 
     John Robison has criticized me for what he believes is my unrelenting criticism of him when he’s expressed positions or done actions which I disagree with.  He has stated that instead of being negative and criticize him (or others) I should offer my own positive or constructive solutions.  This has not been easy for me, as I believe there are no quick answers or easy fixes for the problems autism causes.  However, maybe he has a point.  In this post I’ll suggest what I believe may be something constructive that I think would address the issues that Robison and neurodiversity has brought up as well as the issue from Autism Speaks’ point of view of how they can effectively advertise fund raising without perceived dissing of autistic individuals who may not like having someone state that are like lost children or that they are defective or their lives are abysmal, etc.   


 
     I suggest that autism speaks recruit volunteers from the higher end of the spectrum such as Roger, myself and others who would discuss the problems autism has caused them in their life.  I could talk about my fine motor problems, ornithophobia, getting fired from jobs, lack of social relationships and the inability to concentrate and get things done during the day and my loud voice and the fact my self-esteem was affected by having been in special education for eight years.  Roger could publicly speak about his experiences of seizure disorders, elopement, etc.  This could help with fund raising without causing offense as we would be speaking for ourselves and not for all the autistic people that Suzanne Wright’s detractors have perceived that she has painted with a broad brush.  This would help to generate much needed revenue into the organization to help find the causes of autism and a cure.   


 
     These, of course, would have to be voluntary unpaid spokespersons as it could be construed as a conflict of interest if autism speaks offered any financial incentives for autistics to speak.   


 
     Another less obvious point in favor of this plan would be that AS would be living up to it’s name and it would be actually autistics who are speaking.   


 
     One problem with this approach might be that if people on the severe end of the spectrum who could not communicate effectively were not included this would diminish the credibility of the spokespersons.  Of course, AS could emphasize that if autism impacts people this mildly afflicted think of what it is like for severe persons.  They could then show footage of more severely afflicted persons without any commentary and let the images speak for themselves.  This would address the problems ND has had with commentary like Allison Singer’s about driving herself and her child off a bridge.  Of course, they could also have spokespeople such as Dov Shestack who would not be speaking with vocalizations but using a communicator to get his point across.   


 
     I believe this addresses the problems of autism speaks’ fundraising techniques, their lack of inclusion of actual autistic people in the process, and Robison’s commentary that I don’t offer constructive solutions.   


 
     I myself have so many personal issues with autism speaks, such as their funding of Mottron, Alex Plank and the insurance mandates and their autism in the workplace program which just shows autistics working for other employers and not autism speaks themselves that I would probably have to pass on this even if someone from AS happened to read this blog post and thought this was a good idea.  But I know Roger wants to be involved with autism speaks in some capacity whether or not he’s actually interested in doing what I’ve suggested.  There may be others on the spectrum who might be interested in this.   


 
     One issue, I’ll concede that this does not address is the ND movement’s desire to hijack the capital of AS and use it for their own purposes, such as ASAN complaining that only 4% of funding of autism speaks goes for service-related issues rather than scientific research.  However, I feel if they want funding to serve their needs they should form their own organizations and solicit funding themselves.  They are free not to donate to autism speaks or any other group they don’t believe goes along with their cause.     


 
     If anyone does not approve of my idea and has a better one, then I guess they can pursue it or blog about it.

Joe Buxbaum's and neurodiversity's ten year prediction falls flat 
" "
One of the tenets of the neurodiversity movement and one of the tactics they most frequently use in their fear mongering talking points is the notion of a pre-natal test being available for autism.  They claim that the genetic research funded by autism speaks and other organizations has been done with the intent of inventing a prenatal test for autism so that autistic fetuses can be deliberately aborted. 
 
This allegation predates the days of autism speaks but goes back many years ago when their predecessor Cure Autism Now was still funding researchers.  Amanda Baggs and Laura Tisoncik  on their website autistics.org greeted the reader of their home page with a photo of an aborted autistic fetus in a trashcan with the letters CAN on it, accompanied by the caption \"The real meaning of autism prevention.\" 
 
ND points to the cases of Down's syndrome fetuses that are aborted. 
 
Nearly eleven years ago,  in this article  scientist Joseph Buxbaum stated that there could be a prenatal test developed within ten years.  Given all of the various genetic etiologies in autism, not to mention the california twin study done four years ago which points to the fact that the heritability component of autism is significantly lower than once believed. I don't think we're any closer to developing a prenatal test for autism (or any form of it for that matter) and being able to selectively abort any autistic fetus than we were ten or eleven years ago. 
 
In  this piece , Autistic self advocacy network executive Meg Evans (writing under the pseudonym Bonnie Ventura) ranted about how society was trying to deliberately engage in eugenics of all autistic people.  She put up a clock on this website for the ten year countdown beginning in 2005 for when this eugenic test would be developed.  She apparently deleted the clock when it looked like her prediction based on Buxbaum's statement was not likely to come true.  
 
As we approach the end of the year 2015, it would appear that individuals involved in the neurodiversity movement have failed again to be terribly insightful.

My unprinted letter to the l.a. times regarding Steve Silberman's op-ed piece on autism speaks 
" "
Over a week ago, Steve Silberman, author of \"neurotribes\", wrote   an op-ed piece  which was published by several newspapers including the Los Angeles Times.  I wrote a response that was not printed:  
 
 To the Los Angeles times:    
 As a man on the autism spectrum, I must take issue with Steve 
Silberman’s op-ed piece.  The type of funding that he suggests will do 
nothing to help autistic people.  It is not a disability that can be 
accommodated through education or other means.  There is no way that 
research dollars will be able to help with employment issues.     
 Though science may provide no short-term answers, I believe in the long
 term that funding of scientific research will someday lead to viable 
treatments and possibly a cure, so I hope it can continue.      
Mr. Silberman makes numerous factual errors in his article.  Though he 
stated no autistic persons have served on autism speaks boards, John 
Elder Robison was on the scientific advisory board.  He is a high school
 dropout with no qualifications or knowledge in the field of autism 
science.  His appointment was only to quell all the noisy people who 
insist that autistic people must be on the boards of autism 
organizations in spite of lack of qualifications.      Bob and 
Suzanne Wright never referred to their grandson as being missing.  The 
missing slogan only referred to missing knowledge of the genetic 
etiology of autism.      Silberman has only spoken to autistic 
people on the mildest end of the spectrum and has completely ignored 
people who are nonverbal, wear diapers in adulthood and self-mutilate.  
It’s shameful that the times would print the op-ed piece by this man 
whose forthcoming book will undoubtedly trivialize this horrible 
disability.   
 
 Jonathan Mitchell, Los Angeles, California   
 
 One point of correction, I sent them this email before Silberman's book came out and I read it.  He did spend time with Leo Rosa, Shannon Des Roches Rosa's son, who is at the lower end of the spectrum so I suppose the statement he only spent time with higher functioning autistics might not have been completely accurate.  But most of the people Silberman has spent time with were on the highest end of the spectrum.

Marc Sirkin's lame excuse for Alex Plank
" "
In my previous posts in the last few posts, I have wondered about why in the world an organization that claims they are funding research in the hopes of mitigating or possibly curing the horrible affliction called autism would fund videos done by Alex Plank. In fact, yesterday, I emailed Mr. Marc Sirkin who is apparently in charge of media matters for autism speaks, Peter Bell, vice-president of autism speaks who apparently has developed a friendship between Plank, Robison, Sr. and Robison, jr. and to the contact address for autism speaks itself, asking why they would fund such an endeavor. Though my email still remains unanswered by any of these three entities it seems that Mr. Sirkin  has responded here . He gives what in Gadfly's view is a rather vague statement that somehow these videos are improving the dialogue among various members of the autism community and that a video that he prominently displays on the blog post in which an interview is conducted with a journalist of a major magazine which helps trivialize this disability and which  the journalist for this magazine makes sweeping statements without bothering to do his homework  and implies that the creation of a significant software company and the well-known Craig's list were due to attributes of the autism spectrum. He states that the financing of these videos are somehow helping in this mission to achieve the goal of addressing autism which he (unlike Alex Plank and other ND's) calls an \"urgent health crisis\". How any of these autism talk TV videos, particularly the latest one featuring the previously mentioned journalist are helping in this regard is unclear to gadfly. I am wondering how the headbanging, finger chewing nonverbal autistic children of certain parents who contributed money to autism speaks and participated in their walks are being helped by Plank's videos. Another salient point is that Sirkin makes is the panned (apparently macro) statement of Plank's that autism speaks is in no way influencing the content of the videos as if this has any significance or is relevant to anything. Of course Plank's singing a completely different tune and praising the organization which previously was anathema to him  goes unmentioned in Sirkin's response. John Robison's interesting duties as member of scientific advisory board of AS As most in the autism blogosphere know John Elder Robison has been appointed as a member of the scientific advisory board of autism speaks, his apparent sole qualification for this position being that he wrote a best selling memoir about his life with Asperger's syndrome. In his book Robison claimed that a cure for Asperger's was not needed He went further than saying that he desired no cure for himself but that also no cure was needed for anyone else with condition-the fact they might be too impaired to make $100K a year as an engineer, be successful business people in automechanic enterprises, be able to write memoirs that appeared in the New York Times bestseller lists was beside the point. Robison later claimed that this did not mean he did not care for others on the spectrum who happened to be less fortunate than he was. He claimed he was interested in reviewing scientific research proposals for autism speaks that would help in ameliorating the more disabling aspects of autism. The start of Robison's affiliation with AS was not propitious being he immediately stuck his foot in his mouth  implying that he might know more about what was best for autistic children than their own parents, which naturally Harold Doherty of the autism in New Brunswick blog and MJ of the autismjabberwocky blog took umbrage to. I have yet to see how Robison in his capacity so far with AS has contributed to the betterment of autistic person's lives or made constructive suggestions on which science should be funded or how science should be done by autism speaks which might make it possible to ameliorate some of the more disabling aspects of autism which he stated was his goal in spite of stating that a cure for at least some ASD's was not necessary for anyone at all in his book. It would seem however that based on Sirken's post and lame excuse for Plank and company that Robison has gone out of his scope in concentrating on the science of autism speaks and has instead chosen to spend more time pursuing media endeavors rather than science and in a case when his own son is one of the two principals involved. He apparently urged autism speaks to fund Alex Plank's endeavor which they agreed to do. I have left a comment on autism speaks blog. In case they mod it out and don't approve it. I will reproduce it here: Hello, Mr. Sirkin. The funding of autism speaks of this young man’s media endeavors when he has libeled your organization, implying your main goal is to develop a prenatal test when there are severely autistic persons who bang their heads and can’t speak. Others who are higher functioning such as myself who can’t hold down a job is a slap in the face, to all of the good people who donated money to your organization and participated in your walks as a matter of blind faith, so that this horrible disability could be mitigated or possibly cured. No, Mr. Sirkin, your excuse does not cut it with me. If Peter Bell or anyone else from autism speaks responds to gadfly concerning this outrage, I will keep the readers updated.

Canada's REAL National Autism Strategy - Shawn Murphy's Bill C-304
" "
 
 
 
 
 
There is currently a group receiving money from the Harper government, purportedly to develop a \"National Autism Strategy\". It is an election year handout from a government which has consistently opposed a meaningful role for the federal government in ensuring that autistic children and adults in Canada receive the treatment and services they need to live meaningful, healthy lives.   
 
 
 
Parents in Canada have fought for many years with varying levels of success for government coverage of evidence based ABA treatment for autism disorders.  In 2006 former Charlottetown MP Shawn Murphy articulated a REAL National Autism Strategy when he introduced Bill C-304 which was defeated by a Harper Conservative-Bloc Quebecois coalition vote.

Liberal and NDP Autism Advocates  in Election 2011
" "
 
 Glenn Thibeault            Peter Stoffer           Ruby Dhalla           Brian Murphy 
 Although our federal government has done very little to help autistic Canadians receive effective evidence based early behavioural intervention, autism specific education and accommodation or decent residential care for autistic adults it is not for lack of trying by several members of parliament who are running again in Election 2011.    Peter Stoffer ,  a Nova Scotia (Sackville-Eastern Shore) NDP candidate,  has been involved in national autism advocacy for many years and co-sponsored, with former Fredericton MP Andy Scott, a motion seeking to implement a national autism strategy.   Glenn Thibeault  an NDP candidate from Sudbury Ontario also brought a private members motion in support of autism.  During debates in the House of Commons  both New Brunswick (Moncton)  Liberal candidate  Brian Murphy  and Ontario (Brampton-Springdale) Liberal candidate  Ruby Dhalla  gave strong speeches on behalf of autistic Canadians.  
 This autism dad and advocate hopes that all of these strong autism advocates are re-elected on May 2.

Autism in Election 2011? Vote Liberal ... OR ... Vote NDP
" "
 
 On Monday Canadians will cast their votes in Election 2011.  IF autism is a major concern in your life or the life of a family member I ask you to consider voting for either the Liberal OR the NDP candidate in your riding. 
 
I make this request because the Conservative Party has consistently opposed any substantive role for the federal government in addressing Canada's national autism crisis. Some Liberal and some NDP  party members have made statements in support of either official inclusion of autism in Medicare or programs and legislation aimed at working with the provinces to ensure that autistic Canadians participate fully in our health care system and receive treatment for autism regardless of where they live in Canada. Strong autism motions have been brought forth previously by Liberal MP Shawn Murphy and by NDP MP Glenn Thibeault. Both motions were supported by members of the Liberal and NDP but were defeated by the Conservative-Bloc Quebecois coalition. 
If the Liberal candidate in your riding is the best bet  to defeat the Conservative candidate then please vote Liberal.  If the NDP candidate in your riding is the best bet then please vote NDP.  Vote autism on Monday, vote Liberal or NDP in your riding.

NDP Leader Jack Layton's Response On Autism
" "
 The following document was forwarded by members of Medicare For Autism Now  who received it from the New Democratic Party on behalf of NDP leader Jack Layton:   Jack's Response on Autism First,  both NDP MP Peter Stoffer and myself have challenged the federal government for not providing  funding in its last budget to help families with autistic children. I fully recognize that families with autistic children  are in crying need of support  and they are very disappointed that the Conservative government has ignored their needs in their budget spending.   On the matter of voting, in the April 3, 2006 to September 14 ,2007  session of parliament MP Shawn Murphy introduced his private members legislation Bill C-304, An Act to provide for the development of a national strategy for the treatment of autism and to amend the Canada Health  Act. C-304  received first reading on May 17, 2006 but  unfortunately it did not make it to third   reading or a final vote because it died when the Harper government chose to prorogue that Parliament. I am also aware that on March 29, 2007, the Standing Senate Committee on Social  Affairs  issued a report on the Funding of Treatment for Autism titled:\" Pay Now or Pay Later:   Autism Families in Crisis\" in which they recommended that the federal government demonstrate some leadership in the autism file by collaborating with the provinces to create a  National Autism Strategy and address the funding of treatment.  However, this report was not put before parliament for a vote. New Democrats recognize that providing support for families with Autistic children has to be a bigger priority for the federal government than another corporate tax cut.  That is why Peter Stoffer has introduced Private Members' Bills, C-211, An Act to amend the Canada Health Act (Autism Spectrum Disorder) to \"ensure that the cost of Applied Behavioural Analysis ( ABA) and Intensive Behavioural Intervention (IBI)  for autistic persons is covered by the health care Insurance plan of every province\"  and C -212,  An Act respecting a Canadian Autism Day. ' The federal NDP is proud of Mr Stoffer's efforts to help put the needs of Autistic children on the political map. autism

The Two Autism Faces of Greg Thompson
" "
 When it comes to federal financing of autism treatment for Canadians with autism Conservative MP  Greg Thompson, Southwest, New Brunswick has presented two decidedly different faces. FACE # 1 - Opposition MP Greg Thompson House of Commons, Hansard, Wed. Sept. 28, 2005.  Statement by Members   Autism   Mr. Greg Thompson  (New Brunswick Southwest, CPC): Mr. Speaker, today along with other members of the House and parents of autistic children,  I attended a rally on Parliament Hill urging the federal government to provide financial support to cover the cost of treatment for every child diagnosed with autism.  Autism rates are on the rise in Canada.  This neurological disorder affects 1 in every 195 of our children.  Therapy which has been credited in helping children overcome the effects of autism can cost a family up to $60,000 a year. These families and children need our support and  I urge the federal government to take the steps necessary to address this important issue. FACE # 2 - Government MP & Cabinet Minister Greg Thompson HOUSE OF COMMONS OF CANAD A    39th PARLIAMENT, 1st SESSION No. 115 (Unrevised)      Wednesday, February 21, 2007    1:00 p.m. Private Members' Business Pursuant to Standing Order 93(1), the House proceeded to the taking of the deferred recorded division on the motion of Mr. Murphy (Charlottetown), seconded by Mr. Szabo (Mississauga South), —  That Bill C-304, An Act to provide for the development of a national strategy for the treatment of autism and to amend the Canada Health Act, be now read a second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Health. YEAS: 113, NAYS: 155 NAYS -- CONTRE    Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest)   There it is.  On September 28 2005 Greg Thompson, wearing Autism Face # 1, sitting as an opposition MP, rose in the House of Commons,  not at a local backyard Bar-B-Q  or in a beer drenched tavern, but in the House of Commons, to urge the federal government to address the important issue of financing treatment for autistic children in Canada.   Then 15 months later, on February 21, 2007,  wearing Autism Face # 2, now sitting as a MP and Cabinet  Minister of the governing Conservative Party he voted NAY ,   he voted against, the Private Members' bill of MP Shawn Murphy which, if passed, would have required the federal government to do exactly what Mr. Thompson had previously urged a different federal government to do? How to explain the Two Autism Faces of Conservative MP Southwest, New Brunswick, Greg Thompson?   Was he being shallow  and insincere when he wore Autism Face # 1,  using the plight  of autistic children and their families for political purposes?  Or did he simply lack the courage of his convictions; was he afraid to stand up to  Conservative Prime Minister Harper when he donned Autism Face #2  and voted against  Bill C-304 which would have provided for  federal government funding of autism treatment? Only Greg Thompson knows for sure. autism

Medicare for Autism Now-BC Campaign Rally and Ontario Tour
" "
 Medicare for Autism Now Society   www.medicareforautismnow.org    Medicare for Autism Now-BC Campaign Rally and Ontario Tour   Vancouver, BC:- The Medicare for Autism Now Society today announced it will be holding a campaign rally on Saturday, October 4, 2008 beginning at 2:00 p.m. at the Eaglequest Golf and Country Club, 7778 - 152nd St. in Surrey. This rally is part of the society’s “Two Percent Solution” campaign aimed at influencing the electoral outcome in 14 targeted federal constituencies across the country. “In its Auton decision, the Supreme Court of Canada told parents of autistic children to “get political” if they wanted to see their children no longer be orphans of the Medicare system,” states Jean Lewis, a founding director of the Medicare for Autism Now Society. “We’ve taken the judiciary at their word and have launched a nation-wide campaign to elect MPs, regardless of which political party holds office following this election, who will vote for legislation that enshrines the treatment of autism under Medicare because it is the morally right and economically sensible thing to do.” The rally is intended to attract parents of autistic children and their supporters from across Metro Vancouver. Its aim is to promote a grassroots campaign that will help elect candidates to Parliament who support Medicare for Autism Now! “As a Canadian who does not have an autistic child, but who believes strongly in the fundamental values of this country, I am disgusted by the federal government’s willful indifference to the plight of these children and their families,” says Scott Hean, who will be master of ceremonies at the rally.

The Two Autism Faces of  Randy Kamp
" "
 The following blog comment was initially written to describe  The Two Autism Faces of Conservative MP Greg Thompson , Southwest, New Brunswick but since it also applied equally well to Conservative MP Randy Kamp (Pitt Meadows - Maple Ridge - Mission BC). I am republishing the comment today with slight changes to describe the Two Autism Faces of Randy Kamp. When it comes to federal financing of autism treatment for Canadians with autism Conservative MP Randy Kamp (Pitt Meadows - Maple Ridge - Mission BC)  has presented two decidedly different faces. FACE # 1 - Opposition MP Randy Kamp As reported in the Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows Times, November 23, 2005  \" Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present a petition from the citizens of British Columbia,  who rightly believe that IBI-ABA therapy can dramatically help children with autism.  They are calling upon Parliament to amend the Canada Health Act and corresponding regulations to include therapy for children with autism as medically necessary treatment and require that all provinces provide and fund this essential treatment for autism,\" said Kamp. ... \" The measure of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens. The question is not whether we have a legal obligation, but whether we have a moral obligation to help these children.  We need to do everything we can to ensure that children with autism have the opportunity to become healthy and reach their full potential as participating members of their communities,\" said Kamp  to the crowd, according to a news release . ... \"Minister Dosanjh has been unsupportive of autism groups since his days as Premier of B.C. I understand their frustration with him.  As the federal Health Minister, he now has an opportunity to do the right thing and I call upon him to have compassion for autistic children and move forward with a National Autism Strategy ,\"  said Kamp. FACE # 2 - Government MP & Parliamentary Secretary Randy Kamp HOUSE OF COMMONS OF CANAD A    39th PARLIAMENT, 1st SESSION No. 115 (Unrevised)      Wednesday, February 21, 2007    1:00 p.m. Private Members' Business Pursuant to Standing Order 93(1), the House proceeded to the taking of the deferred recorded division on the motion of Mr. Murphy (Charlottetown), seconded by Mr. Szabo (Mississauga South), —  That Bill C-304, An Act to provide for the development of a national strategy for the treatment of autism and to amend the Canada Health Act, be now read a second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Health. YEAS: 113, NAYS: 155 NAYS -- CONTRE Kamp (Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge—Mission) There it is. In  November 2005 Randy Kamp, wearing Autism Face # 1, while sitting as an opposition MP, spoke to parents of autistic children and then rose in the House of Commons, not at a local backyard Bar-B-Q or in a beer drenched tavern, but in the House of Commons, to urge the federal government to address the important issue of financing treatment for autistic children in Canada. Then 15 months later, on February 21, 2007, wearing Autism Face # 2, now sitting as an MP and Parliamentary Secretary in the governing Conservative Party Mr. Kamp  voted NAY , he voted against, the Private Members' bill of MP Shawn Murphy which, if passed, would have required the federal government to do exactly what Mr. Kamp had previously urged a different federal government to do. How to explain the Two Autism Faces of Conservative MP Randy Kamp (Pitt Meadows - Maple Ridge - Mission BC)? Was he being shallow and insincere when he wore Autism Face # 1, using the plight of autistic children and their families for political purposes? Or did he simply lack the courage of his convictions; was he afraid to stand up to Conservative Prime Minister Harper when he donned Autism Face #2 and voted against Bill C-304 which would have provided for federal government funding of autism treatment? Only Randy Kamp knows for sure.   And maybe Stephen  Harper. autism

USA's 1 in 68 Autism Rates and Canada's Fake National Autism Strategy
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 \"At present there is no government monitoring system in place to provide us with accurate statistics on the prevalence of ASDs in Canada\"   
 
 
 
 Autism Society Canada  
 
 
 
The recent USA CDC reports that US autism rates are now estimated at 1 in 68 highlights, yet again, the lack of a Real National Autism Strategy in Canada. One of the few specific commitments made by the federal government over the years was a commitment to conducting a national surveillance program of Canadians with autism disorders.  As the above quote from the Autism Society Canada web site makes clear that has not happened.  Canadians must simply assume that US autism rates, now 1 in 68, also apply here in Canada.  
 
 
 
Canadian parents fought initially , and ultimately unsuccessfully, through the courts in BC (Auton) and Ontario (Wynberg/Deskin) for autism treatment coverage under medicare and autism services before commencing their more overtly political efforts, including the Medicare for Autism NOW! campaign.  Here in the Maritime provinces we took a political approach to developing a national autism strategy with the NB efforts in  which I was personally involved beginning  in 2001, primarily by many discussions with our Fredericton MP, the late Andy Scott.  In 2003  Andy Scott, made a public commitment in 2003 to work toward a National Autism Strategy at a tribute to his 10 years of service as an MP at the Boyce Famers' Market, an event I attended and reported on to the members of the Family Autism Centre for Education (FACE): 
 
 
 
 \"October 19 2003 
 
 
 
 
 Hello everyone: 
 
 
 
 
 Some good news for those interested in autism issues emerged last night  at the Boyce Farmers' Market in Fredericton New Brunswick as Frederictonian's gathered to pay tribute to MP Andy Scott's  10 years of service as an MP on behalf of Frederictonians and as an advocate for human rights, services for the disabled, and cultural harmony. Andy announced that he would be meeting with Paul Martin in the hopes of pursuing a national Autism strategy. Although health care is primarily within provincial juridiction some health issues, such as breast cancer, HIV, etc. have been approached on a national level because of the magnitude of the issues involved.  While we have all heard political promises in the past,  Andy Scott has a proven track record of commitment to, and follow through on, disabilities and human rights issues.  Great news.

 Family Autism Centre for Education (FACE)\" 
 Andy's comments at the Boyce Farmers' Market were also featured in a 2003 Telegraph Journal article by Tali Folkins: 
 
 
 
 \"Fredericton MP Andy Scott said Saturday he has been lobbying prime- minister-to-be Paul Martin for a federal program to help young children with autism. \"I desperately want a national autism strategy - and let me just assure you that Paul Martin knows it,\" Mr. Scott told supporters at a party celebrating his 10th anniversary as an MP in Fredericton Saturday evening. 
 
 
 
 Early work by therapists with young autistic children, Mr. Scott said, can make a big difference in their capacity to lead fulfilling lives as adults - and can save money in the long run. But the costs of starting such early intervention programs are high and should be borne directly by Ottawa rather than each individual province, he said. \"We have responses and therapies and so on that I genuinely believe can work,\" he said. \"You're going to save millions of dollars over the lifetime of an autistic adult. If you can get in at the front end, you can make enormous progress. 
 
 
 
 \"But it's very expensive, and there's not a lot of stuff being added to Medicare, generally - that's why we have catastrophic drug problems and other things,\" he said. \"In the province of New Brunswick, P.E.I., or even Quebec or Ontario it's very, very expensive. The feds are going to have to step up to the plate.\"  
 
 Andy did answer the call on behalf of autistic Canadians and   actively pushed for a National Autism Strategy which he ultimately realized with the passage of Motion M-172.  However, the motion was essentially a commitment in principle with few obligations being undertaken by our federal government but it did help put autism on our national agenda and it was Andy Scott being Andy ... getting done what could get done ... with a view to moving forward further in future.  One of the specific items that the federal government did commit to in the motion was a national surveillance program, a program that would tell us how many Canadians now suffer from autism disorders.   It is a commitment that has still not been honored 8 years later.  
 
 Andy Scott himself did continue the fight   as demonstrated in his June 5, 2007 statement in the House of Commons: 
 
 
 
 \"Autism   [Table of Contents] Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.): Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that we have seen little action by the government toward implementing a national autism strategy. It has been more than a year since I introduced Motion No. 172. My private member's motion called for evidence based standards, innovative funding arrangements for diagnosis, treatment and research, and a national surveillance program. The motion was adopted in good faith and supported by the government. However, it was very disappointing to see no reference to a national autism strategy in the recent budget or any discussion this spring. Recently, I joined my colleagues from Charlottetown and Sackville—Eastern Shore and Senator Munson at a rally in Halifax that reinforced that there are families with autistic children across Canada who need the government's help. The Conservatives should move off their default position of jurisdictional excuses, show creativity and compassion and start helping these Canadians.\" 
 
 
 
Andy Scott's reference to his colleagues from Charlottetown and Sackville-Eastern Shore were  references to PEI's Shawn Murphy and Nova Scotia's Peter Stoffer both of whom, along with Andy Scott and Senator Jim Munson, also worked tirelessly toward achieving a National Autism Strategy.  The rally of which he spoke was a Halifax rally organized by Jean Lewis and FEAT-BC who had been raising autism awareness, lobbying politically and fighting for national autism coverage in the Courts for several years and continued to do so with its \" Medicare for Autism NOW! \" efforts.  I attended the FEAT autism really in Halifax and had the privilege of meeting Jean Lewis, several of the BC advocates and tireless Nova Scotia autism advocate Jim Young.  Under the BC leadership there have been subsequent national meetings in Oakville and Toronto.

_____________________________________________ 
 
FIRST READING, MAY 17, 2006 
 
_____________________________________________ 
 
 MR. MURPHY (Charlottetown) 
 
1st Session, 39th Parliament, 
55 Elizabeth II, 2006 
 
 HOUSE OF COMMONS OF CANADA 
 
 BILL C-304 
 
An Act to provide for the development of a 
national strategy for the treatment of 
autism and to amend the Canada Health 
Act 
 
Her Majesty, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate and House of Commons 
of Canada, enacts as follows: 
 
SHORT TITLE 
 
1. This Act may be cited as the National 
Strategy for the Treatment of Autism Act. 
 
 
NATIONAL CONFERENCE 
 
2. The Minister of Health shall, before 
December 31, 2006, convene a conference of 
all provincial and territorial ministers responsible 
for health for the purpose of working 
together to develop a national strategy for the 
treatment of autism. The Minister shall, before 
December 31, 2007, table a report in both 
Houses of Parliament specifying a plan of action 
developed in collaboration with the provincial 
and territorial ministers for the purpose of 
implementing that strategy. 
 
AMENDMENTS TO THE CANADA 
HEALTH ACT 
 
3. Section 2 of the Canada Health Act is 
renumbered as subsection 2(1) and is 
amended by adding the following: 
 
(2) For the purposes of this Act, services 
that are medically necessary or required under 
this Act include Applied Behavioural Analysis 
(ABA) and Intensive Behavioural Intervention 
(IBI) for persons suffering from Autism Spectrum 
Disorder. 
 
 
 
 Bill C-304 was defeated soundly by a coalition of Harper Conservatives and separatist Blog Quebecois votes in the House of Commons. During debates in the House of Commons Harper conservative MP Mike Lake from Alberta, the autism face of the Harper government, a father of an autistic son,  fought against  the Murphy bill and helped vote it down to defeat.   
 
 
 
 The hard truth is that there will never be a real National Autism Strategy as long as the Harper government rules in Ottawa.  Nor will a REAL NAS emerge from national autism charities that were never part of the struggle for a national autism strategy to begin with and who do not acknowledge the efforts made by parents across Canada who fought hard and long for a National Autism Strategy. National charities dare not speak contrary to federal government policy for fear of risking their charitable status.  
 
 
 
 A real National Autism Strategy, even a real, current estimate of the number of Canadians who suffer from autism disorders will not come into existence until the Harper government is retired from office and will only come into existence with parent driven initiatives for whom helping their autistic sons and daughters is their most important objective.    Until then we will have to accept US figures for autism prevalence.  Accordingly, let it be known: 
 
 1 in 68 Canadians has an autism spectrum disorder.

Autism Vote Recommendations for New Brunswick
" "
The smart voting campaign of the Vote for  Environment is also helpful for autism voting.  If you want a strong federal government role in funding autism treatment in New Brunswick you will not get that from the Conservative or Green Parties.  The Conservatives oppose any serious federal role in funding autism treatment and the Green Party  is not seriously involved with autism issues. Almost all Liberal and NDP MP's all supported Shawn Murphy's motion to amend the Canada Health Act to include autism treatment in Medicare. To support a federal autism role vote for the Liberal or NDP parties  whichever is stronger in your riding .  Based on data from  Vote for Environment   the autism vote recommendations in New Brunswick are: Vote  Liberal  in  all NB  ridings  .... except Acadie-Bathurst, Fundy Royal  and  New Brunswick Southwest  where the NDP are stronger.  In those 3 ridings vote  NDP autism

Canada Needs A REAL National Autism Strategy: Medicare for Autism NOW! 
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 A Medicare for Autism Now! Rally was organized by FEAT-BC  
 
 and held in Halifax, Nova Scotia on May 26, 2007. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Shawn Murphy,  Jim Munson,  Andy Scott 
 
 
 
 Former PEI MP Shawn Murhpy, New Brunswick Senator Jim Munson and the late Andy Scott a former Fredericton NB MP all advocated actively for a REAL National Autism Strategy with Shawn Murphy presenting an unsuccessful provvate member's Bill C-304,  to include autism treatment in medicare coverage and then Fredericton MP Andy Scott working with Nova Scotia MP Peter Stoffer to intoduce a National Autism Strategy bill which was passed and put the issue on the national agenda although no serious efforts have been made since then. Senator Munson chaired the Senate review of autism services in Canada and issued the Pay Now or Pay Later Report. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nova Scotia MP Peter Stoffer co-sponsored a national autism bill with  NB MP Andy Scott. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fredericton MP Andy Scott with Jean Lewis of FEAT-BC and Medicare for Autism NOW!. 
 
  Jean was and IS a determined advocate for Medicare coverage of Autism treatment. 
 
 
 
The photos above were all taken at the Medicare for Autism Now! rally at Halifax, May 26, 2007 organized by Jean Lewis and her fellow advocates from British Columbia.  Medicare for Autism Now! has remained active since then and remains one of the few legitimate national autism organizations in Canada.  Under the current government charities seeking to maintain their charitable status dare not address the need for a real National Autism Strategy for fear of losing their charity status.  
 
 
 
The fact is that the current government has accomplished nothing of substance in addressing national autism issues. In 2015 Canadians must still rely for information about the prevalence of autism disorders  on US figures.  There is no discussion of taking steps to ensure that children in each Canadian province.  There is very little discussion of media reports of families moving across Canada and to the US seeking autism treatment for their autistic children. 
 
 
 
Autism Canada, the newly formed entity rising from the merger of the Autism Canada Foundation and Autism Society Canada, and Autism Speaks will not advocate for Medicare coverage of autism disorders.  They will not risk their charitable status and funding for their organizations. With a federal election looming it is time for serious national autism advocates to speak up and advocate for autism treatment coverage under Medicare.  
 
 
 
Stephen Harper and Mike Lake, a well known Conservative MP who appears to be a good guy and a great father of an autistic son have done nothing to help autistic children across Canada not one damn thing.  They both say, correctly, that health care is within provincial constitutional jurisdiction and they are right.  What they both ignore is the concept of co-operative federalism a concept which once existed in Canada and can be restored with a new government in place. 
 
 
 
Medicare itself came into existence in this country via federal provincial cooperation and it can be amended to include autism treatment coverage by the same mode.  We need medicare for autism and we need it NOW!.

Wow! Federal NDP Replies to My Inquiry This Morning Re Negotiations to Include ABA for Autism under Medicare
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I confess I was surprised  to get a same day response this evening from the federal NDP to my  question this morning  addressed to party leader Thomas Mulcair.  The federal NDP committed to continuing the efforts which they have in fact made over the years in Parliament towards creation of an EFFECTIVE national autism strategy.    
 
 
 
To Canada's  federal NDP and leader Thomas Mulcair I say thank you. 
 
 
 
 
 8:20 PM (9 minutes ago) 
 
 
 
 to me 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dear Mr. Doherty: 
 
 
 
 Thank you for providing such a helpful summary of your discussions with us on this important issue. 
 
 
 
 New Democrats have a proven record of working with the autism activist community toward increasing awareness and supports for those living with autism spectrum disorders. NDP MPs have, over many years, proposed bills and motions in Parliament toward the creation of an effective national autism strategy. We are committed to continuing that effort as government. 
 
 
 
 The success of any national autism strategy that includes medically recognized treatments such as Applied Behavioural Analysis and Intensive Behavioural Intervention, depends on the commitment and involvement of provincial and territorial, as well as federal governments. At the moment, for lack of federal leadership, the levels of support vary widely across the country. 
 
 
 
 Over the past decade, the Harper government has consciously chosen to abandon its leadership role in Canada’s health system and has turned its back on the federal-provincial-territorial cooperation necessary to maintain and improve our public system – including measures to better address autism needs. Stephen Harper has not only refused to renew the national health accord but has unilaterally cut billions of dollars from future provincial/territorial health transfers. 
 
 
 
 Under Tom Mulcair, an NDP government will live up to its national leadership role and move quickly to re-establish a collaborative working relationship with provincial and territorial governments.  A New Democratic autism strategy would be forged within this renewed negotiation and would establish, with provincial and territorial cooperation, access to treatment across Canada.

Medicare for Autism NOW! in Oakville, Organizing and Sending A Message
" "
 It was a warm sunny day in Oakville yesterday as the Medicare for Autism NOW! team gathered at the Iroquois Ridge Community Centre to meet families in the communities west of Toronto,  to organize and to send a message to ALL federal politicians: Canadians are suffering from a NATIONAL autism crisis. Some  autistic children, depending on where they live,  receive NO  treatment  for  autism.   The lack of treatment prevents some autistic children from living  a full life and imposes emotional and financial hardship on family members. Many of us have talked about a National Autism Strategy to address Canada's national autism crisis for years. Some politicians of character and conscience, people like Senator Jim Munson and MPs Andy Scott, Peter Stoffer and Shawn Murphy have actively campaigned for a National Autism Strategy.   Stephen Harper,  alleged Health Minister Tony Clement and Conservative MP and autism father Mike Lake on the other hand have largely  mocked the efforts for a national autism strategy.   Aided and abetted by Dr. Rémi Quirion and  the CIHR the national autism strategy has been  reduced to a less than mediocre web site and a secretive, politicized and staged National Autism Symposium that resulted in absolutely NO autism information being  disseminated  to Canadians. Yesterday I had the privilege of speaking at the Oakville rally along with Jean Lewis who has led litigation and political autism battles in British Columbia and experienced political organizer David Marley. We were joined by Jennifer O'Brien from Oakville,  autism winter trek hero  Stefan Marinoiu from Toronto,  Barry Hudson from Toronto and constitutional lawyer Deborah Coyne from Toronto.  Medicare for Autism NOW! is national in scope.  We are organizing coast to coast and we have a message for federal politicians of all stripes. Something must be done NOW.  We need Medicare for Autism NOW.  David Marley, show in the bottom picture below has prepared a strategy.  A number of ridings that were decided by 2% or less in the last election will be targeted for election action by the Medicare for Autism NOW team.  We will be making an impact in those ridings on behalf of the candidates, whatever their political stripe,  who support Medicare for Autism NOW.  David Marley is also organizing of team of people with political organizing skills and experience to help get our message across effectively. One of the key ridings will be the Parry Sound Muskoka riding of Alleged Health Minister Tony Clement.   Mr.  Clement  won by  one of the  smallest  margins  of  any MP in Canada in the last election.   Stefan Marinoiu,  David Marley and Jean Lewis toured the riding this week and apparently there is already, for various reasons.  substantial dissatisfaction with Mr Clement amongst his riding constituents who were also very supportive of the Medicare for Autism effort. Medicare for Autism NOW! will be active in the riding of alleged Health Minister Clement to remind constituents of Mr Clements refusal to help autistic Canadians and their families.

Senator Jim Munson Continues National Autism Strategy Efforts
" "
Senator Jim Munson is continuing his campaign for a National Autism Strategy.   Senator Munson has been unrelenting in his efforts to help a constituency that Prime Minister Harper and Alleged Health Minister Tony Clement ignore - Canadians with autism.  Speaking recently on Prince Edward Island Senator Munson stated that he would like to see the federal government take the lead in developing a National Autism Strategy to end the current patchwork of provincial programs\"         “It’s expensive but buying tanks is expensive too.  “What we have now is a          patchwork, scattergun approach to dealing with autism in individual provinces.”         Senator Jim Munson,  The Guardian , February 23, 2008 autism

October 18, 2003: Andy Scott Called for a Strong National Autism Strategy; Will October 19, 2015 Deliver A Government That Will Make It Happen?
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 Andy Scott called for a REAL National Autism Strategy that would ensure treatment for autism 12 years ago,  Munson, Thibeault, and Stoffer have continued the fight tirelessy. Will October 19 bring Canadians a government prepared to make it happen? 
 
 
 
Some good work has been done during this current election campaign in drawing politicians attention to the need for a REAL National Autism Strategy.  The Medicare for Autism Now's 1 in 58 campaign has produced considerable discussion in a number of selected ridings.  In Saskatchewan Shannon Hill and the PAAT group have engaged federal and political politicians.  Hopefully the government elected October 19 will do more than shell out money for a do nothing committee with no serious mandate like the Harper Party did during the past year.  The Green, NDP and Liberal Parties have all expressed some support for a National Autism Strategy that includes efforts to ensure that evidence based ABA treatment for autism will be covered by Medicare across Canada as Andy Scott called for 12 years ago.  
 
 
 
Following is text from a commentary I posted in 2010  which records  Andy Scott's call as reported by Tali Folkins in the Telegraph Journal and also acknowledges the tireless efforts of Senator Jim Munson, Nova Scotia NDP MP Peter Stoffer and former NDP MP Glenn Thibeault as reported by MetroNews.ca.

 Renewed Calls for a Real National Autism Strategy 
 
 
Canada does not have a real national autism strategy but it is not for lack of trying by some dedicated federal politicians  including  Liberal  Senator Jim Munson and  NDP MPs Glenn Thibeault and Peter Stoffer who     have renewed calls for a real National Autism Strategy for Canada. 
 
 
 
The struggle for a National Autism Strategy began many years ago including here in New Brunswick where Andy Scott issued a public call for a National Autism Strategy on October 18 2003: 
 
 
 
\" \"Fredericton MP Andy Scott said Saturday he has been lobbying prime- minister-to-be Paul Martin for a federal program to help young children with autism. \"I desperately want a national autism strategy - and let me just assure you that Paul Martin knows it ,\" Mr. Scott told supporters at a party celebrating his 10th anniversary as an MP in Fredericton Saturday evening. 
 
 
 
Early work by therapists with young autistic children, Mr. Scott said, can make a big difference in their capacity to lead fulfilling lives as adults - and can save money in the long run. But the costs of starting such early intervention programs are high and should be borne directly by Ottawa rather than each individual province, he said. \" We have responses and therapies and so on that I genuinely believe can work, \" he said. \" You're going to save millions of dollars over the lifetime of an autistic adult. If you can get in at the front end, you can make enormous progress . 
 
 
 
\" But it's very expensive, and there's not a lot of stuff being added to Medicare, generally - that's why we have catastrophic drug problems and other things ,\" he said. \" In the province of New Brunswick, P.E.I., or even Quebec or Ontario it's very, very expensive. The feds are going to have to step up to the plate .\" \" 
 
 
 
 Tali Folkins, Telegraph Journal, October 20, 2003 
 
 
 
Mr. Scott was successful in getting a commitment by the federal government to a National Autism Strategy recognized in principle but the strategy at that time did not commit to the hard action necessary to provide assistance to all parts of Canada in providing early autism intervention programs.  Even the National Autism Symposium which came out of that commitment was a sham, pure and simple, a sham.  Public autism advocates, including me were excluded from the Symposium.  Those in attendance were all screened by federal health agency involved with organizing the event to ensure that they would go along with the government's do nothing to help autistic children agenda. 
 
 
 
Senator Munson has been literally crossing the country for several years fighting for a real national autism strategy  and he has not given up on his efforts.  He organized and  spoke in Ottawa yesterday at an event to mark World Autism Awareness Day this Friday, April 2, 2010: 
 
 
 
“ There’s no reason why we cannot treat autism within our own communities equitably across the nation, ” said event organizer Senator Jim Munson. “ There is a crisis and I know that we can come up with a plan to deal with the issue that is so important to all of us .” 
 
 
 
MetroNews.ca, Ottawa, March 31, 2010 
 
 
 
 
 
The event was also co-hosted by  NDP MP's Glenn Thibeault and Peter Stoffer who spoke at the event.  Mr. Thibeault also  introduced a private member's bill, seconded by tireless autism advocate Peter Stoffer,  to create a real national autism strategy, one that would actually help autistic children and their families by having the federal government work with the provinces: 
 
 
 
\"“ Autism doesn’t discriminate based on geography.  It’s time for federal leadership to ensure that no matter where a child is born with autism, they receive equal treatment and services of the highest caliber. ” 
 
 
 
Glenn Thibeault,  March 30 2010 
 
 
 
“ I’m very pleased that my colleague has done this.  We’ve been asking for many years for the federal government to work with the provinces to develop a national autism strategy. I hope this will become a reality in the near future .” 
 
 
 
Peter Stoffer, March 30 2010

Autism Day of Action - September 15
" "
 Saturday, September 15 is the Ontario Autism Coalition  Day of Action  with events across Ontario.  The OAC is doing an outstanding job of bringing autism issues to the attention of politicians during this Ontario election and into the public consciousness.   September 15, 2007 will be marked by events held at MPP riding offices including Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area, Windsor, Essex, and Sarnia.  \"Autism issues fall under the mandate of the UN declaration of the rights of the Disabled, a declaration to which Canada is signatory\", says Laura Kirby-McIntosh, a member of the OAC executive committee.\" In Ontario, the current government has failed children with autism by denying them full and immediate access to ABA/IBI within the school system. This has resulted in a growing waitlist that is now in excess of 1,000 children. Parents have no option but to go into financial hardship in order to provide this necessary therapy for their children.  \"Autism rights are universal and every province and territory in Canada must ensure that these rights are respected and promoted. This day of action is an important opportunity for the citizens of Ontario to remind their political leaders of these rights and press them for their commitment to them.\" says Ms. McIntosh.  The OAC is asking for a commitment from all political parties to the following:  1) Allow Intensive Behavioural Intervention (IBI) instructor therapists currently working within the Autism Intervention Program (AIP) entry into the school system so that scientifically valid, supervised Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) can be implemented. Children receiving intensive ABA through the AIP and students attending school should receive the same quality of ABA services.  2) Eliminate the waitlist in the AIP and fully fund services for all children with Autism-from the mild to severe end of the Autism Spectrum.  3) Develop a formal credentialing system and a proper training and recruitment system for the implementation of ABA to ensure accountability and capacity within the system.                       People interested in Getting Political with the Ontario Autism Coalition on the Autism Day of Action can join the OAC reps at the following locations across Ontario. OAC contact coordinates for each location also follow.

Medicare for Autism Now Rally March  2  - Burnaby
" "
          \"Medicare for Autism Now!\" Rally     Sunday, March 2 nd , 2008   2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.   Shadbolt Centre for the Arts   6450 Deer Lake Avenue   Burnaby     Why should you attend?   Despite a decade of lobbying, collaborating and litigating – autism    treatment is still excluded from our universal health care system. Canadian    families are still bankrupting themselves in order to provide treatment for    their autistic children. The current and limited funding provided through the provincial    government’s social services ministries could evaporate tomorrow with the    stroke of a bureaucrat’s pen. No legislation exists within these ministries to    protect or enshrine our children’s medically necessary treatment. In 30 years of \"advocacy\", the only two initiatives which have achieved    ANY success for our children and families has been litigation, and more    recently, focused political action. Both were brought by the members of    FEAT of BC – a 100% volunteer organization. Autism is an epidemic of staggering proportions, it now afflicts one in    every 150 children in North America, one in every 94 boys.  It is time for the    Federal Government to act! We need to let those who govern and those who wish    to govern that they are going to be held accountable at the ballot box in the    next federal election. Who should attend?   You - and every fair-minded Canadian you  know! Children with autism suffer from political indifference. It will take the  sustained energy and dedication of EVERY CANADIAN who desires a just society  to correct this injustice. For our children’s sakes, and the sake of future  generations, we urge you to attend this rally. Please bring friends, family,  anyone and everyone you know who is appalled by the gross injustice done to our  children every day by the governments of Canada and its provinces. Featured speakers will include: Dr. Sabrina Freeman – Executive Director, FEAT of BC and parent Jean Lewis – Director, FEAT of BC and parent David Chan – Director, Autism Society of BC, FEAT of BC and parent Dubravka Skrijelj – FEAT of BC member and parent Dr. Glen Davies – Clinical Director - ABLE Developmental Clinic Beverley Sharpe – FEAT of BC member and parent Louise Witt – Director, Autism Society of BC, FEAT of BC and parent David Marley – FEAT of BC member and Political Strategist Please RSVP to www. featbc.org and forward this notice to anyone you  think will be interested. FEAT of BC: \" To see justice is done\" autism

Autism Position of the Liberal  Party of Canada
" "
 The Liberal Party of Canada recognizes the challenges that autistic   Canadians face, as well as those affected by autism.      That is why we had invested $16.2 million in autism research grants, which    funded 32 separate projects.      Although the delivery of health care services falls under provincial and   territorial jurisdiction, a Liberal government would be open to discussions   with the provinces, territories and relevant stakeholders about   considerations for those who are living with or affected by autism.    Although the delivery of health care services falls under provincial and territorial jurisdiction, a Liberal government would be open to discussions  with the provinces, territories and relevant stakeholders about considerations for those who are living with or affected by autism. \" The above information follows a backgrounder on autism and autism issues in Canada from the perspective of the Liberal Party of Canada.  This information was provided by a Liberal Party staffer to a representative of an autism organization and appears to be the official Liberal Party position.  It essentially offers dialogue but makes no commitments for federal funding of autism treatment.   It is a very weak and disappointing statement from the party of Charlottetown MP Shawn Murphy, the author of private members Bill C-304, which sought amendment of the Canada Health Act to include ABA treatment for autism.  Most Liberal MPs, including Stephane Dion, voted in support of that motion.  Now they make no commitment except to talk in the future. Meanwhile autistic children across Canada will be going without the effective treatment they need. autism

Bill C-304 to be debate in the House of Commons Wednesday
" "
Charlottetown Liberal MP Shawn Murphy's private member's bill will be debated in the House of Commons tomorrow. The bill calls for development of a national autism strategy for autism treatment and amendment of the Canada Health Act to ensure autism treatment availability across Canada. This motion is different from the Scott-Stoffer motion as amended by the Conservative government in that it calls for amendment of the CHA which will almost assuredly doom it to defeat when it comes to a vote. The Bloc Quebecois members will vote against it unanimously because, in the \"thinking\" of the Bloquistes it is more important to argue about constitutional boundaries then take definitive steps to help children with a debilitating disorder like autism. Most Conservative members will vote the same way for similar reasons. Regardless of the outcome it will be interesting to listen to the debate. The telecast is 5:30 EST and for those of us fortunate enough to live in the Atlantic time zone 6:30. http://www.shawnmurphymp.ca/?page=medianews&action=showInfo&itemID=203 Bill C-304 to be debate in the House of Commons Wednesday OTTAWA – MP Shawn Murphy’s Private Member’s Bill, C-304 An Act to provide for the development of a national strategy for the treatment of autism and to amend the Canada Health Act, will be up for its last hour of debate at second reading in the House of Commons tomorrow at 5:30pm EST (6:30 Atlantic). The debate will be carried live by CPAC. If passed, C-304 would require the Government to table a national strategy to streamline the availability of treatment for autism spectrum disorder across the country. Mr. Murphy is available to speak to the Media about his Private Members Bill upon request. Following the debate, transcripts of his speech will also be available.

 Amid the darkest hours 
 Sweet rays of comfort shine between 
 And thorns are mixed with flowers 
 Lord, teach me to adore Thy hand 
 From whence my comforts flow 
 And let me in this desert land 
 A glimpse of Canaan know 
 Is health and ease my happy share? 
 Oh may I bless my God; 
 Thy kindness let my songs declare 
 And spread Thy praise abroad 
 While such delightful gifts as these 
 Are kindly dealt to me 
 Be all my hours of health and ease 
 Devoted Lord to Thee 
 In griefs and pains Thy sacred Word 
 (Dear solace of my soul!) 
 Celestial comforts can afford 
 And all their power control 
 When present sufferings pain my heart 
 Or future terrors rise 
 And light and hope almost depart 
 From these dejected eyes 
 Thy powerful Word supports my hope 
 Sweet cordial of the mind 
 And bears my fainting spirit up 
 And bids me wait resigned 
 And oh whate’er of earthly bliss 
 Thy sovereign hand denies 
 Accepted at Thy throne of grace 
 Let this petition rise 
 “Give me a calm, a thankful heart 
 From every murmur free 
 The blessings of Thy grace impart 
 And let me live to Thee 
 Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine 
 My path of life attend 
 Thy presence through my journey shine 
 And bless its happy end”

 My friend Lianna introduced me to  Anne Steele , the writer of the hymn above. Anne Steele penned these words in 1738 after her fiancee’s death the day before their wedding. I am challenged and inspired by the fact that in the midst of such grief and loss her petition would be: give me a calm and thankful heart.  " 0.00015580778193682 0.000697582762741508 0.000614760496968162 0.000289925069471165 7.23414969906245e-05 0.000380945520342841 0.0126594781628095 0.0128919586580799 0.000253108988342771 0.000188004134743691 0.000275024078833825 0.000123690653915389 0.000328285806529025 0.000213286407265944 0.00024023324750911 0.000960184554246645 0.000422513272021775 0.000716334194347076 0.00226028454557395 0.000457016831110354 0.000201524419246587 0.000906082507471303 0.000489444053909949 0.000298970489698549 0.000406293367051127 0.000200242486004157 0.0764515004477524 0.00106852943029382 0.000306638027410653 0.000350047342110198 0.000287534651531328 0.000209959865217435 0.000908390279545341 0.000468517916693035 0.0196719701038654 0.000186235988328405 0.000340410222915191 0.000218919484001387 0.049455224673087 0.708473448224483 0.00184327588626258 0.000164715976574994 0.0190766221042478 0.000153913406124669 0.00016060708170478 0.000421963960507524 0.0131782126910578 0.000276131238836492 0.00044451754198478 0.0691793894683027

"32137" "48" "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/psalm-136/" "Psalm 136" "My dear friend Cha has been writing her own Psalm 136. It’s a way of making her thankfulness a bridge to faith. Psalm 136 is a story of mercy and deliverance set to song, with verses of praise and gratitude. The chorus repeats over and over, lest we forget:  For His love endures forever.  The Message (Bible) simply says, His love never quits. Inspired by Cha, I’ve been recording my own Psalm 136 song of deliverance and God’s medley of mercies in my life.  I’ve been asking family and friends what their own verses might say. Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for  He is  good! 
 His love never quits. To Him who alone does great wonders, 
 His love never quits. To the God who has everything 
 His love never quits. And still wants me. 
 He love never quits. Who drew me to His mercy-seat, 
And said, “Thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee: be of good cheer.” 
 His love never quits. Who made me a wife. To teach me about His faithfulness. 
 His love never quits. Who made me a mother. To teach me about Himself. 
 His love never quits. Who filled my broken heart with songs. 
 His love never quits. Who hangs the sun and stars and paints the sky and walks with me. 
 His love never quits. Who created life and within me the miracles of new life. I am still in awe. 
 His love never quits. 
~C.N. Who rescued me out of depression 
 His love never quits. 
And gave me hope for the future. 
 His love never quits. 
 ~C.G. When my father left and my mother died, I was only a boy 
 His love never quits. 
 The Lord has been my Caretaker 
 His love never quits. 
~G.P. Who has given me 36 crazy years with the same best friend every single day 
 His love never quits. 
~My twin Who faithfully protects and provides 
 His love never quits. 
~M.R. Who gives new life to families 
 His love never quits. 
 ~B.R. Who heals my allergies. Jesus loves me. 
 His love never quits. 
 ~Hope When I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 His love never quits. 
 He is always with me. 
 His love never quits. 
~B.P. What would your Psalm 136 say? . Ed note: The book  One Thousand Gifts  inspired Cha to record her blessings like the psalm.

Big Mary Day
" "
 
 
 
 
Today, December 8th, is the Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception, that is to say, Mary, at the moment of  her  conception, was and remained so, free of original sin. Whether or not you believe that to be true, I think we can all believe that Mary was one special mom. Even if you don't believe her son was  the  savior, he was, nonetheless, remarkable. I think we can also all agree that what this world needs most, is the presence and healing of a mother's love. 
 
Hail Mary, 
Full of Grace, 
The Lord is with thee. 
Blessed art thou among women, 
and blessed is the fruit 
of they womb, Jesus. 
Holy Mary, 
Mother of God, 
pray for us sinners now, 
and at the hour of our death. 
 
Amen.

 I share this song every year and this year more than ever, it means so much.  
 
 in the midst of the pain and darkness, love was all around 
 Preparations were made 
For his celebration day 
He said “eat this bread and think of it as me 
Drink this wine and dream it will be 
The blood of our children all around 
The blood of our children all around” 
The blood of our children all around  
 Father up above, why in all this anger have you filled 
Me up with love 
Fill me love love love 
Love love love 
Love love 
And the blood of our children all around 
 So the story goes, so I’m told 
The people he knew were 
Less than golden hearted 
Gamblers and robbers 
Drinkers and jokers, all soul searchers 
Like you and me  
 Rumors insisited he soon would be 
For his deviations 
Taken into custody by the authorities 
Less informed than he. 
Drinkers and jokers. all soul searchers 
Searching for love love love 
Love love love 
Love love is all around

Occupy my lowly heart 
Own it all and reign supreme 
Conquer every rebel power 
Let no vice or sin remain 
That resists Your holy war 
You have loved and purchased me 
Make me Yours forevermore I was blinded by my sin 
Had no ears to hear Your voice 
Did not know Your love within 
Had no taste for heaven’s joys 
Then Your Spirit gave me life 
Opened up Your Word to me 
Through the gospel of Your Son 
Gave me endless hope and peace Help me now to live a life 
That’s dependent on Your grace 
Keep my heart and guard my soul 
From the evils that I face 
You are worthy to be praised

I rest my weary soul in Thee, 
I give thee back the life I owe, 
That in thine ocean depths its flow 
May richer, fuller be. O Light that followest all my way, 
I yield my flickering torch to Thee 
My heart restores its borrowed ray, 
That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day 
May brighter, fairer be. O Joy that seekest me through pain, 
I cannot close my heart to thee; 
I trace the rainbow through the rain, 
And feel the promise is not vain, 
That morn shall tearless be. O Cross that liftest up my head, 
I dare not ask to fly from thee; 
I lay in dust life’s glory dead, 
And from the ground there blossoms red 
Life that shall endless be. ~ George Matheson         *I’m reading a couple good books and devotionals: the classic  Streams In the Desert  edited by Mrs. Charles Cowman and  Brokeness: The Heart God Revives  by Nancy Leigh Demoss.

"31929" "48" "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/11/25/thanksgiving-from-iraq/" "Thanksgiving From Iraq" "We found out today that my husband is receiving orders to deploy to Iraq. For fifteen months. A year and three months. Four hundred and fifty-five days. We knew it was coming, but it really feels real now. At least he’s not scheduled to deploy until May 10. At least that gives us 6 months to prepare. Interestingly enough I remembered a Thanksgiving letter he sent to our family the last time he was deployed to Iraq. Rhema was just about 8 months old.  Brandon was in Iraq when she was born , but got to visit us for 2 weeks when she was 6 months old. Then he returned to the war and sent home a Thanksgiving letter. I was not planning on sharing it, but since we got the news today, I’ve decided to post it. [Neally is my family nickname]. ————- 
 As you hear this you will be in the middle of the Thanksgiving day. I wanted to write while you are all gathered together as a family and be able to express my thankfulness with you all from far away here in Iraq.  This year, I have so much to be thankful for. Neally and I have had a year that has been filled with anxiety, fear, questions. It has been a year of great unknowns. A year of disconnect from each other and family. However, I am thankful to the Lord for His innumerable blessings. I’d like to list a few— First, I am so thankful for God’s gift to us of Rhema. I cannot describe my joy in seeing my daughter for the first time. Thank You, Lord. I am thankful that though away, and as I see many marriages falling apart during this deployment, J and I have grown more passionate about our marriage, more aware of our bond as man and wife. It is truly a supernatural answer to our prayers. I love and appreciate my wife more today than when I left. I am thankful for the Lord’s protection over me and my Soldiers. We had a long combat patrol and almost 10 months on the ground in Iraq and we are all safe and sound today. Forward Operating Base Speicher, where the majority of my guys are located, is surrounded in prayer by many committed Christians and chaplains. We receive very little enemy activity. My Soldiers located in Balad at LSA Anaconda have been hit with nearly 500 rocket attacks, some destroying their bunks while they were not in them…another rocket maiming an airman while my Soldier just 20 feet away was completely unharmed. I am not shy about this fact—it is the Lord who is our Protector. He is our shield and refuge here. I believe with every fiber of my being that we are protected through prayer and because of His mercy to us. The Lord is perfect and sovereign even if we had experienced casualties, but I thank the Lord for His seeing fit to keep us all safe thus far. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful for the Palmers. When I first met Neally, I had my doubts about her authenticity because she was too innocent, too pure, too kind, too patient, too selfless, too caring. I wondered if it were not a dating make-over where she was able to put her best foot forward while around me. I wondered if she had gone off to college and reinvented herself like many do…some for the better, some for the worse. Then I visited her family. I was amazed to see a whole house full of people who God had chosen and set aside, all living lives of innocence before Him, of purity, of kindness, of patience, of selflessness, of caring…of Loving Jesus. I knew then that not only had I found the right woman God had for me, but He had given me the added blessing of the very best family. I am so thankful, and feel undeserving, of the gift of Neally’s family…my family now. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful that I saw the Lord gently and mercifully lift my family out of the pit of hell. I am thankful that I saw firsthand God’s radical deliverance of my family. We were shattered almost beyond repair and God carefully put all of the pieces back together again. I am thankful that the Lord made my parents into Godly examples—with little or no training in how to be a Godly parent, the Lord was faithful to make up the years of destruction in short order so that Lindsay and I were trained in the ways of the Lord. He, HE, is the reason for my thankfulness. I am thankful that the Lord saved me at a young age. Although I wondered what was on the other side of life—the parties, the apparent freedom and pleasure of sin, the culture of “if it feels good, do it…it’s got to be ok if it feels ok…follow your heart”—I am thankful that He kept me from major stumbles along the way. As I left for college, far away with no need of my parents anymore for daily necessities, I was free to choose my path. Although tempted like everyone else, God kept me close and convicted. He saw me through the lonely times when everyone else was out doing their exploring. He was my comfort and my friend. Today I am truly free and at peace because the Lord has kept me from many of the things that I see others still struggling with from their high school and college days. I was reminded in chapel as we studied a portion of Romans 1 that people who do not acknowledge God are missing something on this holiday because they do not have anyone to be thankful to. If one who does not acknowledge God were to be at Thanksgiving dinner today and give thanks for their good things in life—health, family, prosperity, food—and did not acknowledge the God who gave them these things, who are they thanking? It is an empty thanks to no one in particular. I urge us all to be mindful of Who we are thankful to this Thanksgiving Day. I hope you all give a “thankful” Thanksgiving to the One who gives us all good things. Love you all, From Iraq, Brandon ————– Thanks so much to all the US service men and women serving away from home this Thanksgiving!

How vast beyond all measure 
That He should give His only Son 
To make a wretch His treasure How great the pain of searing loss, 
The Father turns His face away 
As wounds which mar the chosen One, 
Bring many sons to glory Behold the Man upon a cross, 
My sin upon His shoulders 
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice, 
Call out among the scoffers It was my sin that held Him there 
Until it was accomplished 
His dying breath has brought me life 
I know that it is finished I will not boast in anything 
No gifts, no power, no wisdom 
But I will boast in Jesus Christ 
His death and resurrection Why should I gain from His reward? 
I cannot give an answer 
But this I know with all my heart 
His wounds have paid my ransom  . ~Stuart Townend . Hope, age 2 Happy Easter!

~Andrew Peterson,  The Good Confession . I was born on a church pew. Not really.

There were many, many times after that day I would pray the prayer repeatedly, just in case. “Jesus, I believe in You! I believe You died on the cross and rose again.

"31877" "48" "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/faithful-god/" "Faithful God" "These days when I look at my wedding picture, there is the wistful desire to return to a simpler place and time. Life had been always so good to us both, that, at the time, I had no reason to think that life would not go on being good. I had my Jesus, my healthy, happy parents and siblings, an Ivy League education, and my own Top-Gun-officer-pilot on my arm. I often wonder why Autism devastated us so much. Perhaps it was the regressive nature of it, and the way it stole into our world and confiscated everything we thought we had. Perhaps it was the “dream deferred” that Langston Hughes wrote about – you may not realize the dreams you’ve dreamed for your children until those dreams are shattered. Perhaps it was the slow and steady realization that the autism was severe and was not going to simply be outgrown or out-drugged (- that fact was more painful than the initial diagnosis). For two and a half years, I felt like I was the aim of Bamm-Bamm Rubble’s club. IEP meetings, special schools, hospital stays, therapy sessions and registration with the Department of Mental Retardation were never in my plans for her life, for our life. I was caught in a cycle of grief, and I was angry, bitter and so very disappointed in God. All throughout, however, I could hear a whisper: God is faithful. Finally one day I whispered back: God is faithful? That used to be my theme song, but now I feel forsaken. “Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.”  Heb 10:23. The Greek word for “faithful” in that verse is  pistos  and it means trustworthy, sure, or true. It resonated with me that God is trustworthy –  worthy of my trust . Surely He had been faithful up until the point that trials came my way, surely He would continue. And even though I felt abandoned by Him, I remembered I could trust Him. So I said,  “O.K., God. I’m giving her up. I’m trusting you even if she does not get better. I’m trusting you with her life.”  As I write this, it seems so simple, but it was oh so hard to do. But since I did it, I have felt an incredible, liberating peace. God is faithful. Faithful to His Word, faithful to the promises in His Word, and ever faithful to us. In Revelation – in the final analysis – His very name is “Faithful and True”. Have we ever had the shadow of a reason to doubt our Father’s goodness? Have not His lovingkindnesses been marvellous? Has He once failed to justify our trust? Ah, no! our God has not left us at any time. We have had dark nights, but the star of love has shone forth amid the blackness; we have been in stern conflicts, but over our head He has held aloft the shield of our defence. We have gone through many trials, but never to our detriment, always to our advantage; and the conclusion from our past experience is, that He who has been with us in six troubles, will not forsake us in the seventh. What we have known of our faithful God, proves that He will keep us to the end. — Charles Spurgeon Back to my wedding picture: Nearly ten years later, we have changed. Wow, how we have changed. But God stays the same. And life is still good, and God is still faithful. Visit Celly from  Busy At Home  for more Thirstin’ For The Word Thursdays.

Severe Autism Parenting Reality: An Old Fear Returns
" "
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Conor walking with Dad this morning. I often let him walk a   
 
 distance ahead of me so he can make decisions and demonstrate his  
 
 knowledge of routes and how to get home on his own if necessary. 
 
Today an old fear returned and grabbed me firmly.  It was the greatest fear I have known in my life.  And it came back with full force.  
 
 
 
I have written a couple of times on this site about the time several years ago, when Conor was much younger, and he left the house unnoticed while he was in my sole  care.  When I realized he was missing I ran around the house, down to the Saint John River which was close to our home, across a nearby busy parking lot and then back home before calling 911. The 911 operator told me he had been taken into a nearby convenience store by a good Frederictonian who had stopped his vehicle to remove Conor from traffic to safety.  The man left as soon as I arrived and identified myself and he new Conor was safe. He left without waiting to be thanked.  
 
 
 
Today, years later, I was again the adult in charge and I was again distracted by a business call.  When the call was ended and I looked for Conor I realized he had again left unnoticed.  I ran outdoors around our house calling his name without spotting him,  then ran back upstairs to speak with his brother who had been busy in his room and hadn't heard him go out. When I ran down the stairs Conor stepped into the house and I was again relieved.  I believe he had just been in the back yard starting to leave via a shortcut to one or our regular walking paths and heard me calling for him.  
 
 
 
Conor is no longer a small child physically but he has serious cognitive challenges and severe autism disorder. When we go on our almost daily walks I will often let him walk ahead of me, within eyesight, to let him make the decisions about the direction to go to find our way home.  I have done so in the hope that if he does leave unnoticed he will know his way back which I believe he does. For that reason I  was not as fearful, or not quite as fearful, when  I couldn't find him quickly today.  I admit it though.  I was scared again.  And thankful when Conor returned to the house. Very thankful.

Took my last walk around the Sisters development. Tried to be mindful, and when I wasn't, I tried to Jack Kornfield my mind, as in bringing the mind gently back to awareness, not yelling at it for wandering off. 
 
Caught movement off to the left and saw a few deer. 1,2,3,4. Four deer. One quickly crossed in front of me to the other side of the street and two more followed soon after. I decided to stop walking and just watch whatever was going on with the deer - see if they had a message for me. 
 
The fourth one followed the first three and stopped mid-track. It turned and looked back in the direction from which it had come. It stared and stared at \"nothing.\" 
 
Finally, I saw that it was waiting for another deer. It was not so much waiting, as waiting for the other deer to see which way the others were headed. When eye contact was made, the mid-track deer leaped off with the first three. 
 
Five deer, then.  hmmmm....   I thought,  five is a weird number... 
 
 
Sure enough, a sixth and seventh deer came into view and stood with #4. They seemed to be taking a long time to decide if they wanted to join the first four, or head off on their own. 
 
It was deer #4 that spoke to me, the one that knew which direction it wanted to go, but was overly concerned about everyone else...

So today I experimented with him.  I decided to treat him like he was Webster while we were leaving for the appointments.  I told him it was time to go and he went to the door, I opened it and he went to the car.  I opened the car door and told him to climb in his seat.  The first time he needed me to get him started climbing into the car, but I think he gets it now.  We will see if this sticks.
 
 He is starting to take verbal direction from me.
 
 Also, we went to the store and he ran across the store to the childrens section, but every few steps he would stop and turn around and make sure that I was behind him.  Usually he looks for me only once every few minutes.

"15740" "25" "http://embracingchaos.stephanieallencrist.com/2013/10/while-i-was-napping/" "While I was napping…" "
 During my last post, I talked about my sleeping challenges.  On Thursday, it became a problem, but only because a much bigger problem occurred while I was napping.  You see, I stayed up until the wee hours of Thursday morning, slept for a while, got up, got the boys off to school, and then went back to bed to catch a quick nap before I started in on my work for the day. 
 While I was napping, Ben’s teacher and/or aide tried to take him to the bathroom.  I don’t know what he was doing before they left or how they transitioned him, but it didn’t work.  He threw a fit on the stairs.  He ran into another room.  He ran outside.  He ran back into another room.  He ended taking off all his clothes and his diaper.  They couldn’t get him back into his clothes.  Eventually, he urinated on the floor.  He definitely walked through his urine.  Someone claimed he rolled around in it, too. 
 I’m not sure when the calls started: when they couldn’t get him dressed or after he’d urinated on the floor.  But they called the house once.  They called my work number once.  They might have called the cell, but it was turned to silent and I don’t have voicemail set up.  Mark and I were both sleeping and we continued to sleep through these calls.  Then, they called my mother at work. 
 By then, Ben had urinated on the floor.  He still wasn’t dressed.  She specifically told them to leave him as he was.  By the time she got there, Ben was dressed and happy to be escorted out to meet her.

Bud brought a children's book with him to the doctor's office last week.  As we sat in the waiting room, I glanced over his shoulder to see what had him so engrossed. 
 
And then I did a double take. 
 
And then I took a picture of it. 
 
Because, really.  WHAT???

He seems almost used to the sessions.  Each time he fusses less and less.  Today he stopped protesting as soon as the table started moving.
 
 So we went shopping and when we got home I pulled an apple out of the bag and said, “Chandler what’s this”?  He immediately gestured toward it and said “apple”.  Usually it would take asking about 5 times and then putting it in front of his face to get him to look at it.  I wanted to make sure I was hearing right, so I asked him again, and he immediately answered.  I did it 5 times total and he answered me every time.  
 
 Still letting me change his diapers with out any protest what so ever.  He is also cooperating better in letting me get him dressed.

Gone
" "
 
 
At the Walk Now for Autism event, I looked away for a  minute while Boy Wonder sat in the double stroller. When I looked back he was gone. Vanished. No where in sight. My friend informed security while Big Daddy and I started to run through the crowd. I went out to the parking lots. Running, looking and praying. There's no way he could have made it out to the road. Someone would have had to notice, especially here, that he's alone and lost and profoundly autistic. 
 
They found him 10 minutes later hiding behind the bounce house.  I will never look away again. I have followed him from room to room in the house since Sunday. All the doors and the windows are locked. And it will be along time before I trust myself again.

		 There is a girl, L, at Sam’s school that he LOVES. He’s always talking about her.  
 The first I heard of her was last week when he got off the bus very carefully holding a scrap of paper with her name and her phone number on it. 
 (Way to go, dude!) 
 The next day he brought home two more scraps of paper with other phone numbers on them. These were the numbers of other friends. I guess this is the new thing the kids are doing&#8212giving their phone numbers to each other.  
 Yesterday the phone rang and a voice said, “Is Sam there?” 
 Oooh, his first phone call. I put the phone on speaker and carried it to Sam. It was M, a friend that sits at Sam’s table at school. They compared types and genders of siblings and then said goodbye. Oh. Cute. 
 At least I know that Sam knows his telephone number. 
 Today, because Jack was sick, my friend and neighbor picked Sam up from the bus stop, kept him for a playdate, and then walked him home.  Thanks for sending him home with the backpack full of rocks, I mean, space boulders, by the way. 
 First thing after walking in, he asked if he could call L. 
 I coached Sam on how to politely ask for his friend and what to do if the answering machine picked up. “Please let them be cool. Please let them be cool,” I thought to myself as I helped Sam dial the number. Then I put it on speaker. 
 The guy who answered sounded as amused as I felt when Sam asked for L. 
 When L got on the phone Sam was a little nonplussed as to what to say. I coached him a little bit and he repeated what I whispered into his ear into the phone. L sounded delighted that Sam had called. Sam broke from script long enough to tell L about his playdate. 
 Then L asked, “Why are you calling?” 
 Sam looked at me and shrugged. 
 I whispered, “Tell her you called to say hi.” 
 Sam said, “I called to say hi” 
 There was a little more stilted conversation and then I told him, “Say goodbye.” 
 He said, “Goodbye. 
 L said, “Goodbye.” 
 And they hung up. 
 I suppose this is only the beginning. What am I going to do  if  when he insists on talking on the phone all day so that I can’t?

		 Quinn and I were happily enjoying a playdate yesterday morning when my phone pinged.  As always, I didn’t leave my cell phone in my purse, but had it in my sweatshirt pocket.  Although the phone hadn’t rung, the message made it through, more than half an hour after the call. 
 I listened to the voice mail, which was from the nurse at the elementary school. Dammit. Jack was sick. I had to go get him. 
 I abandoned  my friend  and stuffed Quinn in the car. As soon as I saw that I had cell service (evidently my friend’s house is somewhat of a cellular black hole), I called the school. 
 I had just been connected to the nurse when my phone went dead. I called back and apologized for my lame cell phone. The nurse laughed and said that she had actually pulled the cord out of the handset. All righty then. 
 Jack had said he was nauseous that morning and had spent some time going back and forth to the bathroom, hugging the toilet bowl. He’s done that before, and it almost always results in his throwing up in the car on the way home. 
 When I showed up at the school, nearly an hour after the nurse had called in the first place, Jack’s face lit up. 
 “Are you sick?” I asked. 
 “I’m not sick!” he chirped. 
 Of course. 
 It was pretty clear that I wasn’t going to leave him at the school. I can only imagine the hubbub that would have ensued. Plus, I still believed that he was going to hurl as soon as he strapped himself into his car seat. 
 So I took him home and tried to get him to lie down. That worked for about four seconds because He. Wasn’t. Sick. 
 He and Quinn spent the day, perky as hell, happily playing together and watching some TV. 
 I think Quinn likes to be without clothes most of the time as a wedgie-prevention measure. They ran an errand with me and were perfectly behaved. They ate an identical lunch and played Legos and Lego Star Wars.
 They were happy as damn clams. Jack to be home during the day. Quinn to have a buddy that wasn’t me. 
 Considering that Jack ignored his baby brother for nearly two years, they sure do get along now. 
 All I know is, I better not get a call from the nurse tomorrow. Because if I do, there will be no Lego Star Wars. Instead, I’ll make him scrub the floor.

So today I said to Chandler, “Let’s go to the car, Chan” and of course knowing that he would not hear me or respond, I turned around to go pick him up to take him to the door, and he was already on his way to the door.  He put his hand on the doorknob and tried to get out.  When I opened the door he walked straight to the car and didn’t try to take off in either direction down the sidewalk.  Nice.

This morning Chandler called me “mommy” for the first time in about two weeks.  This morning he woke me up by sitting next to me on the bed and pushing me.  I started patting him on the back, but he pushed my hand away several times and sounded like he was saying “don’t”.  I remember thinking, “is he saying ‘don’t’?”, but then I think I fell back asleep.  Danielle and I also think that he called me “Ginger” this morning, but it is hard to tell.
 
 Now when I tell him it is time to go to the car, he goes straight to the front door and tries to open it.  When I open it for him, he walks straight to the car and stands by the door waiting for me.  When I open the car door and tell him to climb in, he climbs into the car and into his car seat on his own.  He is also taking direction from me as far as getting out of the car himself and generally going where I ask him too.  He might wander left for a minute when I am telling him to go right, but he eventually turns around and goes the right direction.  
 
 As it has been officially a week now that he has been laying still and letting me change his diapers, I feel that I can say with confidence that he is a new man in the diapering dept.  Matter of fact yesterday I asked him to come up stairs so I could change his diapers, I got everything out and then started to leave the room to go get him (because I was sure he would not have gotten my request and would still be playing at the bottom of the stairs) and as soon as I got to the door, he came over the top step and ran into the bedroom!  I am still a little stunned and would like to see this happen a few more times before I will be convinced that it was not a coincidence. 
 
 When I left last week, Chan’s floortime therapist, Jennifer, had asked that I make sure he sits down at the table or high chair to eat instead of letting him wander around with food.  I told her I would, and boy I sincerely meant it at the time, but I have not had the resolve to be terribly strict with him given all that we are doing this week.  Despite my lazyness, the last two times I have given him a bowl of snacks, I have turned around to find him putting his bowl on the table and climbing into the chair to eat.  And he sat there and ate the whole time.  
 
 Ok…. Very cool thing just happened.  I am sitting here typing and Chandler has been walking all over the house.  No one else is here and I think he is bored.  He came up and pulled on me to get up.  After a minute or so of trying to get him to say “up” or “mommy” I gave in and he led me to the front door.  I told him we were not going anywhere and came back to the kitchen,  he followed me back in, looked at me and said, “car” plain as day.  So we are gonna leave a little early for his afternoon session.

"40250" "57" "http://susansenator.com/blog/2011/02/gift-of-god-2/" "Gift of God" "Nathaniel means “gift of God,” from the Hebrew Natan-El. About 20 minutes ago I got the call that every mother dreads most:  “We can’t find Nat at this moment.”  I was out with my friend Lisa and I didn’t know what to do first.  I called Ned at home.  He hadn’t heard this.  He got into the car immediately to drive to where the social group had been. My friend put me into a cab and I called the social group leader back.  “YOU HAVE TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME”  I screamed.  “Where is he?”  The wine I’d had was going to come right up.  My stomach lurched.  My phone beeped.  My friend was asking what was happening.  I called Ned, and he was on his way. Where was Nat?  They said that they got distracted for a moment when one of the social group kids got picked up by her dad to go home.  They did a head count and it was only three.  Nat was gone. I was sick to my stomach, screaming in the cab.   He’s gone.  He’s gone?  What are the chances you can find a young autistic man in a crowded hockey stadium?  He’s gone.  This is the worst thing that could happen to a person.  If someone tells you that autism is the worst thing that could happen to a child, they don’t know anything.  My darling, my Nat. And the weird thing was, when I dropped him off this evening, the group leader seemed kind of — tentative.  Young.  Nat was doing a wide circuit around him and I yelled out twice, “Nat, stay with the group!”  I looked back to see where Nat was, and he was with the group, so I let him go, but there was a small tiny voice that was wondering… But he’s been doing this for years, don’t be silly, Susan. My phone rings a few seconds later, “We have Nat.  We have him.  He’s okay.” “Where was he?  He’s okay?” “We are not sure where he was but I had checked all the bathrooms and had the entire stadium locked down.  He’s okay.” She put him on the phone.  “Hi,” he said.  It was my darling’s voice.   God has now given me this gift, twice.

This morning I helped Duncan get dressed in his school clothes, fixed him some breakfast and packed his school bag. Then when we’d added coats and shoes, he climbed onto my back, I picked up his bag, and we set off down the road to meet his school bus. I sat on the low wall, he sat on my lap, pulled his hood up and snuggled in to me. Then we waited. I knew we weren’t late; we saw the fast train pass and the boy listening to his I-pod who always gives us a miniscule nod and the man from the house across the road leave for work in his pick-up truck. But we waited and waited until my backside was getting numb and I gave up and went home. Later I phoned the school to let them know Duncan wasn’t coming in as his bus hadn’t arrived. The secretary said that was because the school was closed for half-term.  ...I felt sheepish.

Casper and Jasper
" "
 
 
 
So, when Rojo turned 15 last July, we got him a cell phone. Said cell phone promptly got named, Casper, and became an appendage. Rojo was never without it except to sleep, where it then lay on the kitchen counter charging, so he'd have it bright and EARLY the next morning. We had to set up some rules, \"Don't text ANYONE more than 5 times a day.\" (I believe Nancy holds the record at 62 texts in one day. Most of them the same text sent multiple times, as she had the audacity to be driving when he wanted her Right. That. Minute.) Another rule was, \"No texting before 7:00 AM on the weekdays, and 8:00 AM on the weekends.\" 
 
The point of him having a phone was to be able to reach him when he was over at the dog park, and for him to be able to reach us, should there be a problem. For the most part, he is excellent about responding to our calls and texts, but there have been times when he's had it on silent, \"So nobody would bother him,\" thus, completely making the whole point of having a cell phone, well, pointless. 
 
We were smart and bought the insurance for Casper, knowing that the reality was, the phone was going to get lost, broken, or dropped in a toilet. We had several 24-hour periods where Casper went missing, always to be found by me, of course, in the most unlikely places. 
 
Last Friday I picked Rojo up from school and he had Casper. He told me the weather forecast for the next 5 days. He told me the frozen yogurt flavors they posted on his favorite place's Website. He texted his friends. He had the flippin' phone. Then it disappeared. Completely went missing. We checked the car. Three times each. We moved seats, pulled out all the crap in there and tore the thing apart - no phone. We/I tore the house apart. Under beds, every drawer, closet and cupboard, behind cushions, you name it. No Casper. 
 
I told him it had to be missing three days before ordering him a new phone. On day #4 I called, plunked down the $45 replacement fee, and was instructed it would be at our house between 7 AM and 6 PM the next day - and a signature would be required to receive it. I cleared my calendar. I stayed home all damn day. I didn't even go in the backyard to pull weeds in case the doorbell rang and I didn't hear it. I showered and dried my hair prior to 7 just so that wouldn't interfere with anything. I cancelled my walk with a friend. I arranged someone else to pick up Rojo and his friend from school. Finally, about 3:00 PM UPS came, I ran to meet the driver. He handed me the package and jumped back in his truck. 
 
\"What? No signature? That's it? I can just have it?\" 
 
\"No, you're all good,\" he said. 
 
Grrrrrrr... 
 
I set about activating the new phone, entering in all the contact information I had in my phone, that I knew he'd want in his. When he got home from school it was all ready to go. \"Oh, Jasper, you're here! I love you, Jasper!\" He immediately took Jasper and headed down to see his dogs and their owners. 
 
Yesterday, I had to give STM's parents a ride in my car, and I opened up the back door and moved the towel that is in there for Flicka to lie on, and there was the flippin' phone. I looked under that towel once. Twice. Three times. Possibly four. Or maybe five. That phone was NOT under that towel, then it was. Just like that. 
 
It's silly to get all worked up about a lost cell phone and the better part of a week spent looking for it. Sometimes what we need to do is stop looking for what alludes us, and let it find us.

Bud has always been great about visiting the dentist, because we set the tone early with low stress/low pressure visits that were followed by fabulous prizes.  (What's a little bribery when oral health is at stake, right?) 
 
He does so well, in fact, that I've started taking it for granted, and yesterday I did the unthinkable - I forgot all about the prize.  As we drove toward the dentist's office, Bud casually asked what would be waiting for him when he finished.  After a few seconds of panic, I decided to come clean. I told him I'd forgotten and said that we'd visit Amazon or iTunes when we got home.  He happily agreed. 
 
His appointment was as good as they get.  He sat patiently in the waiting room for 20 minutes as the staff ran late, then went in happily on his own with the hygienist. He got glowing reports when they finally delivered him back to me.  So I was happy to set him up on Amazon when we got home. 
 
Bud spent some time in the afternoon surfing to find the prize that he wanted most and before long, he said he'd found it.  It was this: 
 
 
 
 
Yes.   Sing' Und Tanz' Mit Uns Teletubbies.   Because what's better than Teletubbies?  Teletubbies in other languages.  Natürlich. 
 
I can't say I was thrilled by the selection of this particular disc.  But I really should be more understanding.  When I was Bud's age, I had the same relationship with the Beatles that Bud has with the Teletubbies and I distinctly remember the stretch of time when this was on high rotation at my house: 
 
 
 
 
So, Achtung, baby.  Who am I to say \"nein\"? 
 
Bring on das Tubbies.

"29192" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/first-video/" "Noah’s First Home Video!" "I’ve got to be honest.  I would have never guessed in a million years that when Abbie and I made the trip to the hospital to deliver Noah we’d be brining home a little  boy with Down syndrome . As you can read in Noah’s birth story, we had no idea Noah had Down syndrome until about four hours after he was born.  As  new parents  to a child with Down syndrome we quickly learned all we could about Down syndrome. We Quickly Became “Experts” on Down Syndrome During the first few weeks we learned much about the  physical characteristics of a child born with Down syndrome , the  labs a child born with down syndrome  has to endure, and some of the major  medical concerns for a child born with Down syndrome . We were quickly introduced to the many different  physical ,  occupational , and  feeding therapies  we would soon be spending a lot of time at. But above all of this we fell further in love. Further in love with our new son. Our first son. A son that was born with Down syndrome. Down Syndrome Isn’t As Scary As It Seems At first Down syndrome seems scary. It isn’t.  Seriously. If you are a new parent of a child born with Down syndrome you may think it’s the scariest thing in the world. You may be confused, sad, hurt, disappointed, unhappy, curious, happy, joyful, etc.  You may feel like all of the emotions you are feeling will never go away. They will.  This May Be Our First Video, But It’s Certainly Not Our Last In your head you always wonder what it will be like when you bring your first (or any) child through your front door. You dream about the day that you get to take all of those fun home videos. (Isn’t it odd how in our dreams we never dream about bringing home a child with Down syndrome?) I wonder why… Anyways, our life is great! God is way to good to us. We are so happy to be baby Noah’s parents, and we wouldn’t change one little chromosome about him. Seriously. In fact we love him so much we want to share him with the world! We will be doing a daily one minute video to show the world that Down syndrome is ‘ok.’  Yes, everyday! We hope that you will do us the honor by  subscribing , liking  Noah’s Dad Facebook page , and sharing our site with as many people as you can. We would ask that you would join with us in showing the world that Down syndrome is ok! 🙂 Did you have any surprises as a first time parent? Please feel free to share in the comments. I’d enjoy hearing your story.

"29310" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/down-syndrome/" "What Is Down syndrome? The 21st Chromosome Simply Explained" "[This post is a part of the “ New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome ” blog series. Be sure to check out the  other posts! ] What is Down Syndrome: Genetics If you are a new parent one of your first questions may be “ What is Down syndrome?”  (This by the way, was one of my husbands first questions when Noah was  born .) Down syndrome  (Trisomy 21) is a  chromosomal abnormality  where a child is born with three copies of the  21st chromosome  (Just like in the picture!) Chromosomes hold our genetic information, and there are 23 types of chromosomes. One set of those being your sex chromosomes (X, and Y), and the others labeled 1 through 22. When babies are created, they receive 23 chromosomes from their mom contained in her egg and 23 chromosomes from their dad contained in his sperm, totaling 46 chromosomes. Children with Down syndrome are born with an extra 21st chromosome. Three Types Of Down Syndrome: 1. Nondisjunction:  This is the most common reason. Cells containing 46 chromosomes are split equally to create eggs and sperm, which then contain 23 chromosomes. Nondisjunction means that the cells did not equally divide the genetic information. This creates a sperm or egg that contains 24 chromosomes with two copies of the 21st chromosome. That egg/sperm joins with a typical egg/sperm with 23 chromosomes making a cell that has 47 chromosomes and three copies of the 21st chromosome. This is known as Trisomy 21. This is a  random  occurrence. 
 2. Translocation:  The egg or sperm have 23 chromosomes, however part of the 21st chromosome has attached itself to one of the other chromosomes during the division processes that occur when the egg or sperm were made. Therefore, even though they have the right number of chromosomes there is actually extra 21st chromosome material. This CAN be (not always) an inherited condition, which can increase your risk of having another child with Down syndrome. Your doctor will want both parents to be tested to see if this is a possibility. 
 3. Mosaic:  Not all of the cells are affected, so the baby would have cells with 46 chromosomes and also 47. This can occur in two ways. The baby either started with 46 chromosomes, however nondisjunction occurred with further cell division in only part of the cell lines creating some cells with three copies of the 21st chromosome. The other way is that the baby started out as trisomy 21 and nondisjunction occurred creating cells that now contain 46 chromosomes. This is a  random  occurrence. This is a very basic overview, but hopefully helps you understand that a  child born with down syndrome  isn’t  sick  or  suffering . He or she simply has an extra copy of their  21st chromosome .

"29229" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/world-down-syndrome-day-2012/" "World Down Syndrome Day 2012" "  I have to admit that prior to Noah being  born  I had no idea that March 21st is  World Down Syndrome Day ,  so don’t feel bad if you didn’t know either. But it is. And if you will give me about 3 minutes of your time, I’ll tell you what it’s all about. Noah and I put together a short video to tell you a little bit about World Down Syndrome Day and why the date  3:21  is significant. I hope you find it informative and enjoyable! And hey if not, no worries. You’ll get to see a cute little boy for a few minutes that I’m sure will brighten up your day. So it’s a win either way. 🙂 
(If the video is running slow for you, click the HD button to play at low-res.) By the way the cool shirt Noah is wearing in the video was given to us by our friends at the National Down Syndrome Society when we visited their offices in New York a few months ago. You can pick one up for yourself from  Rhyme Clothing .10% of every shirt purchased goes to the  National Down Syndrome Society  to further Down Syndrome Awareness! Pretty cool, huh? If you are new to the world of Down syndrome, welcome. We started this website to give the world a look into what life is like raising a child born with Down syndrome by posting a daily one minute video about our life. We hope you will  subscribe  to our daily videos and take part in the story we are sharing. We also hope you will visit our  Facebook  page where you can meet thousands of families sharing their stories as well. Feel free to drop by, say hi, and ask questions; we’d love to meet you! If you are raising a child with Down syndrome I hope you will take a minute to share this post with someone in your life who isn’t. Hopefully in doing so they will learn more about Down syndrome, and how this story isn’t a sad one. But a very beautiful one. What are you doing to help raise awareness for World Down Syndrome Day?

"29567" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/sue-sylvester-baby-down-syndrome-glee/" "Glee Fans: Did You Notice Sue Sylvester’s Baby Had A Little Something “Extra?”" "Just look at those adorable almond shaped eyes.  If you were watching the season premiere of  Glee  tonight you saw Sue Sylvester’s adorable new baby girl briefly at the beginning of the show. But….you may have overlooked one  small  detail about her adorable new daughter.  (Warning, spoiler alert ahead. ) Did you notice that Sue Sylveter’s baby has a little something  extra ? As in an extra copy of her 21st Chromosome! Yelp, that’s right, Sue’s baby girl has Down syndrome?! Cool, huh?! Did you notice? 
 
By the way, if you didn’t pick up on it, don’t worry. I wouldn’t have either. Even though there are several  physical characteristics of Down syndrome , I can’t always tell if a child has  Down syndrome  or not. (Does anyone else have that problem?) To be honest if it wasn’t for my wife giving me a heads up I wouldn’t have noticed. She’s a huge Glee fan and keeps up with all of the Glee gossip. After last season, rumors started popping up online that Sue’s daughter was going to be born with Down syndrome, but it wasn’t until recently that it was confirmed. Needless to say, I thought it was super cool! Not only is it awesome that Sue’s daughter is the  3rd character  to appear on Glee with Down syndrome, but I thought Sue’s demeanor was awesome as well! She didn’t seem sad or discouraged about her daughter’s Down syndrome diagnosis. In fact, I loved how Sue introduced her daughter to one of the students for the first time: “This is my daughter Robin…she’s the love of my life, and I’m so, so devoted to her.” I’ve gotta say, I don’t really watch Glee (although I do enjoy some of the music!) but I almost  want to start watching  if nothing more than to support their efforts to help change our cultures view of people with Down syndrome. In case you didn’t know this is the 3rd person with Down syndrome to have an ongoing role on the show. There’s Becky, Sue’s sister, and now Sue’s daughter, Robin. By the way Robin Sylvester is really 7th month old Jordyn Kindle Orr! As a father of a child born with Down syndrome I applaud the producers of Glee for the efforts to promote and encourage inclusion, be it ever so slightly. I kept watching tonight’s episode in hopes of seeing more of Sue’s daughter, Robin, and to see what the writers were going to do with Sue Sylvester’s character and storyline. I’m very curious to see if they explore how Sue feeling about having a child with Down syndrome, if she knew ahead of time through prenatal testing, etc. I really do hope we get to see more of her and her new daughter Robyn this season! Did you watch Glee tonight? If so did you notice that Sue’s daughter was born with Down syndrome? (And if you did, did you already know ahead of time?)

"29338" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/did-i-cause-down-syndrome/" "Did I Cause My Child To Be Born With Down Syndrome?" "[This post is a part of the “ New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome ” blog series. Be sure to check out the  other posts! ] If you ended up on this page because you were searching for  down syndrome causes  or  what causes Down syndrome , let me give you a quick spoiler alert: It isn’t your  fault  that your child was born with  Down Syndrome . You did not  cause  Down syndrome. There’s Nothing You Did To “Cause” Your Child To Be Born With Down Syndrome First let me reassure you, there is nothing you could have done to  cause  your child to be born with Down Syndrome. Nothing you ate, didn’t eat, got exposed to, vitamin you forget to take or activity you did that caused your baby to be born with Down syndrome. If that thought has ever crossed your mind you can take a deep breath, and let go of any guilt or anger you may be feeling, because Down syndrome isn’t your  fault . It is very likely that you were  surprised  by this diagnosis at delivery as I was. You had no idea that your child was carrying that extra chromosome throughout your pregnancy. You are not alone,  85% of children born with Down Syndrome are diagnosed after delivery . Your OB did not miss anything either. You could have had an ultrasound every week (like myself) and there were  no clues  that your child would be born with Down Syndrome. That being said your child has had that extra 21st chromosome since conception. Before you even knew you were pregnant their genes were set in place and there was nothing you, or your Doctor, could have done to prevent that extra chromosome. God knitted your little one together just as He intended. You Don’t Control Your Eggs We had one very pleasant lab technician ask us “Which one of you gave him the  extra chromo ?” (And yes she said  chromo!)   It is most likely that the extra chromosome came from me.  DO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THIS!  You had no control over what happens at conception, and cannot pick and choose which egg will be used. We personally believe that your egg was handpicked by God. 🙂 Is this a topic that crossed your mind when you received a Down syndrome diagnosis? How did you process those emotions / feelings?   [This post is a part of the “ New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome ” blog series.  Be sure to check out the  other posts !] " 0.000148502295190109 0.000664874629908909 0.000585935719366081 0.000276331115907152 6.89495621274702e-05 0.000363083816546736 0.000343948650974784 0.0064265057523765 0.000241241260448658 0.00017918903130262 0.00026212880019003 0.000117891069185806 0.000312893201750763 0.000203285873260737 0.000228969234993298 0.0595249346869027 0.000402702547097161 0.000682746847823265 0.230732411989498 0.000435588309625757 0.000192075379181685 0.000863598276789921 0.0239104035268207 0.000284952416127384 0.000387243158060461 0.000190853552990368 0.00253513118691746 0.0186013597451034 0.000292260439735383 0.000333634386436749 0.000274052779445927 0.000200115305506617 0.0243097062785492 0.000446550134413806 0.00116666304506108 0.000177503789412657 0.000324449130721732 0.000208654827325782 0.000248560283084522 0.00124230738805685 0.0486446655762219 0.539366886833861 0.000599229613424738 0.000146696742524125 0.000153076566269434 0.000402178991600596 0.000838360849657283 0.000263184047877244 0.0297285606299793 0.00146497072436621

When I first learned that Noah was  born with Down syndrome  I worried about how different Noah would be than  typical  kids, and that scared me. It turns out that  raising a child with Down syndrome is much more normal  than I would have ever imagined. Like over  150 million other people , I’ve been sharing images almost daily to our  Instagram account . I’ve been doing this for a few years now in my attempt to show the world than children with Down syndrome are much more “like” other than children than “unlike” them. So I thought I’d take a look through my Instagram archives to see how many pictures I’ve snapped and shared of Noah eating one of his favorite foods,  Eggo Waffles . It turns out there were six, and here they are. Random. But cute. Enjoy. 6 Cute Pictures Of My Child Eating Waffles I could watch this kid eat waffles all day! What’s your kid’s favorite food to eat? Leave a comment below and let us know.

I’ll be sharing some photos just as soon as I can, but I wanted to share this super cute video of baby Noah getting his Macarena on real quick. Just in case you haven’t seen one of Noah’s other dancing videos, this kid  likes to dance ! As you can see in the video he has no fear just jumping right on the stage in front of the American Airline Center and getting his dance on. I love it! 
 
  I also love that I married to such an  awesome wife  (who you also see up their dancing with Noah) who isn’t to cool to have fun. We are so blessed to be this little boy’s parents! Does your child like to dance? Leave a comment below and tell us about it! (Bonus points for sharing a video and/or picture of your little one showing off his or her dance moves!

"29240" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/typical-swing-sets/" "Swing Sets Are So….Typical!" "When Noah was born one of my biggest  fears  was that he would never be able to do normal-kid type stuff.  (Or as we’re supposed to say in the “world of special needs parenting….. typical children.)   I remember sitting in the hospital room wondering if Noah would ever want to play with me, go to the zoo with me, spend afternoon at the playground with me, or do a million other things that  typical kids  do. After all, he was  born with Down syndrome , didn’t that mean he was going to be sick all the time? 😉 Boy was I wrong….. (By the way, before Noah was born everything I knew about Down syndrome I learned from Corky on “ Life Goes On ” and the cheerleader,  Becky , on Glee, so you’ll have to excuse my ignorance.) I say this all the time, but the fact that Noah has  Down syndrome  just fades into the background of our life.  We don’t even really think about it all that much.  Sure, we go to a few more  therapy appointments  than a  typical  family (what is a  typical , or  normal  family anyway?!)  Sure our son gives way better hugs than a  typical  child ( hypotonia !).  Sure, there are some unique challenges that we have (and will deal with as the come up).  But our life is much more  typical  than I would have ever imagined it would be 9 months ago. Noah likes to do the same things as every other child I’ve ever met (regardless of a disability). Noah likes to play. To Laugh. To Hug. To Cuddle. To Cry. To Explore. To Sleep. To Eat. To Poop. To Love. To Smile. To have Fun. And swing sets. Noah likes swing sets.  A lot. I’m having a blast watching this little boy grow up.  Noah’s  disability  is a much less bigger deal than it was  9 months ago .  We have a lot of fun in this house.  And our life is much more  typical  than I would have ever imagined. I love my family, and the story that God is telling through it. By the way..Noah is a HUGE fan of the swing!  It’s so awesome!  I love watching his adorable little face light up as he goes back and forth.  Being this little boy’s daddy is EPIC! Thank you swing set….for being  typical . Does (or did) your little one like the swing set?  How old were they when they had their first ride on a swing set?

"29278" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/down-syndrome-watching-tv/" "Everything I Knew About Down Syndrome I Learned From Watching TV" "One of my biggest fears when I first learned that Noah was  born with Down syndrome  was that I wouldn’t get to do all of the fun things dads got to do with their sons. Did children with  Down syndrome  still like to play? Did they like  toys ? Did they laugh, smile, and have fun? Would Noah want to play on my  iPad  one day? Would he even be able to use an iPad? I had no idea what to expect. As a dad, it was one of the  scariest  moments of my life. (Spoiler alert: it was a very short moment!) Down Syndrome Is More Than A Character On T.V. My only knowledge about what it was like for someone to live with Down syndrome came from Corky on  Life Goes On , and Becky on  Glee . Apart from that I was left with an imagination full of  false assumptions  about what it was going to be like raising a child with Down syndrome. I guess you could say I wondered if Noah having Down syndrome meant I was going to miss out on some of the best things about being a dad. If you are a  new parent  reading this I’ll get straight to the point; boy was I ever wrong!  This kid loves to play! In fact I have a hard time getting anything done because of how much fun this little boy is!  His personality, his smile, his  laugh , the way he likes to roll around on the floor to get my attention; it’s wonderful! I can’t get enough of him! By the way I purposely used past tense verbs on the title of today’s post,  everything I knew about Down syndrome I learned from watching tv,  for a reason….because it’s past tense. I  now  have more experience with Down syndrome than what I learned by watching Glee and Life Goes On (I think those shows are helpful by the way in that they help the world get an inside look at the life of a teenager living with Down syndrome.) So as you read our blog and hear story after story about how great Noah makes our life, please know I speak from experience.  Not only that, I’m also hoping to give the world an inside look at what life is like for a family raising a child born with Down syndrome. My hope is you’ll see our family is much more  normal  then un-normal. (By the way, I’m still trying to figure out what the world normal means as it relates to a family….I think every family has a little weird in them….and that’s ok!) Hindsight’s 20/20 It’s been over a year since we brought Noah home from the hospital; I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to stress out. Not to worry. That I wouldn’t miss out on anything. That I’d be able to do all the things that any dad would hope to do with their son! (Actually a little more considering how often we get to go to  physical therapy !) I wouldn’t change one little chromosome on this boy. As you can in today’s video we’re in the process of moving into our  new house , which means we have a lot of work to do. Tonight I had planned on getting my office unpacked while mom was at work….But Noah had other plans. I’m pretty sure he was thinking, “Let’s play!  Let’s play!  Look at me roll!  Look at me play with this box! Look at me play with the dog! Let’s play! Let’s play!” And so we did. To parents of children born with Down syndrome, what where were some of the misconceptions you had when you first started on this journey?  To everyone else; what are some of your assumptions about people with Down syndrome? Don’t worry, you can be honest. I knew almost nothing about Down syndrome when Noah was born, and I’m thankful there were people in my life who were gracious enough to help me learn (and didn’t make me feel like a jerk when I said something inaccurate, and possibly even hurtful.)  One this I hope this website does is help people become more aware about Down syndrome, and what life is like for families raising children with Down syndrome. Every child is unique, but hopefully between our daily one minute videos, the interaction from people in the comments, and hanging out on our  Facebook page , we (and by we I mean the thousands of families who are on this same journey) can help the world do away with the inaccurate stereotypes, and move forward with a more clear and accurate picture of what raising a child with Down syndrome is like.   " 7.48256531868501e-05 0.000335009491985366 0.000295234648534873 0.000139234590395617 3.47415238029188e-05 0.000182946557828646 0.00017330494750251 0.0209570911319588 0.00012155391178016 9.0287737936797e-05 0.00013207848853915 5.94016156142994e-05 0.062174073988461 0.000102429381518455 0.00011537042270043 0.000461122259481001 0.000202909194689405 0.000344014742561644 0.32002705932489 0.000219479299943332 9.67807648358738e-05 0.00043514011058967 0.000235052258475012 0.000143578593425825 0.000195119692977934 9.61651249043222e-05 0.00423053587600636 0.0182321304267494 0.000147260877523006 0.000168107912802053 0.000138086608045093 0.000100831831777749 0.0506400144717525 0.000225002619962295 0.000587844950705307 8.94385973559534e-05 0.00016347975026972 0.000105134629234208 0.000125241737942825 0.000625959764805001 0.00088522101064949 0.513929415283697 0.000301933025183277 7.39158917759403e-05 7.71304850477046e-05 0.000202645391480438 0.000422423761879115 0.000132610194782267 0.000213476599297919 0.00073815284275563

"29258" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/reeces-rainbow-adoption/" "Reece’s Rainbow And The Cox Family Are My Heroes! Watch The Video To Find Out Why!" "Reece’s Rainbow  and Kecia and Kris Cox are my heroes! Seriously! World News Tonight  With Diane Sawyer featured a touching story tonight about the Cox family’s journey of adopting a child (Kareen)  born with Down syndrome  from the Ukraine. (Kecia and Kris have also documented their story on their blog:  Kareen’s Journey Home .) Words can’t describe the range of emotions I have after watching this video (and reading their  adoption story .) I’m overwhelmed with tears of joy for Kareen and the Cox’s, but at the same time heartbroken for all of the other children forced to live as outcasts, desperately in need of someone to love them.  I’m well aware of the horrible conditions that children born with Down syndrome are forced to endure in the Ukraine and other Eastern European countries which is why I’m so thankful for organizations like  Reece’s Rainbow  who help children like Kareen find a home with loving parents who will care for them.  As I said above, Reece’s Rainbow is a modern-day hero! Reece's Rainbow is a true hero! I’d encourage you to watch the video above, read their  story , and  pray  about how  you  can get involved with  Reece’s Rainbow . On their website you can browse countless stories of families in the progress of adopting a child born with Down syndrome, many of which are in need of financial support to help give these beautiful children their dream of being part of a  forever family. (By the way, the Cox’s raised  30 thousand dollars  in order to bring Kareen home!) Perhaps you could skip a latte (or two) next month and  donate  that money to help rescue a child in desperate need of a family who will love him or her.  Who knows…maybe  you’ll  even be called to adopt a child through Reece’s Rainbow! How awesome would that be! (And if that happens…please let me know!) Please take a second to visit  the Cox’s blog  and leave them an encouraging comment. They are an amazing family, and I really do consider Kecia and Kris heroes of mine. The Cox’s story is a perfect reminder of why I started this site, to give the world an inside look at what life is like rising a child born with Down syndrome. My hope is that we can show the world by our daily videos that people born with Down syndrome are just as equally valued by God as any other person. My heart hurts when I think about those children who desperately want someone to love them. They don’t want an iPad, a new car, or a bunch of stuff…..they just want to be a part of a family who will love them. If you are interested in learning more about Down syndrome my wife (a pediatrician) put together a great  New Parent’s Guide To Down Syndrome .  Don’t worry if you’re not a new parent (or a parent at all) the guide contains lots of useful information for anyone. Where you aware of the conditions that children born with Down syndrome are forced to endure in the Ukraine? What are some ways you and your family could get involved with Reece’s Rainbow?

"29464" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/tom-landry/" "Noah Swimming At Tom Landry Fitness Center" "After last week it was clear that our little guy is a  swimmer ! Dallas Theology Seminary  (where I’m currently finishing up my Masters of Theology Degree) gives students and their families a crazy good deal on a membership to  Baylor Tom Landry Fitness Center .  Tom Landry Fitness Center also has nice, big,  heated  pools;  so we decided to take advantage of our membership today and take Noah for a swim! We had a blast today!  This kid seriously gets cuter every single day.  I can’t believe I helped produce a child this awesome! I’ve said this a million times, but being Noah’s dad is amazing.  I love every bit of it, even the countless  occupational ,  physical , and  speech therapy  appointments!  I seriously count it all  joy!  It’s so much fun watching his unique personality develop.  I love when he catches a glimpse of his mother or I, his little face lights up with this radiant smile, it’s huge! Every time I see him do it I’m reminded of  a cartoon character.  I’m not really sure why – he’s just “fun” to look at I guess.  🙂         I did however get a little sad when we were leaving though.  My wife and I were talking about his six month check up coming up this week this week.  At the six month check up the Doctors order a Complete Blood Count (CBC) on our little guy. Children born with  Down Syndrome  are at a higher risk for leukemia then “typical” children, and the CBC will let us know how is blood count is, and if Noah has leukemia.  I have known this test was coming since  Noah was born , and I’ve been praying about it often, but I still don’t like thinking about it.  I know that no matter what the results of the CBC is, God is in control, but it still scares me.  A lot.  But I also trust God.  A lot.  I’d like to ask you to pray for Noah this week, and that his CBC would come back clear.  Either way, God knows what He is doing, and we trust Him fully with our sweet, little son, but I still am begging God like crazy for this test to come back negative.  Thanks in advance for your prayers. This journey we’ve been on the last six months with our son has been awesome.  My wife and I often wouldn’t change  one thing  about our son.  Seriously, not one thing.  God created this little boy.  He knew all about his extra little chromosome way before we did.  And he created Abbie, and I to be the perfect parents for this little guy.  Our life, and our story is so much better because of Noah in it.  Our prayer is that our family, and Noah’s story, would make much of our Great God. No matter what comes tomorrow, or 100 tomorrows from now – God is in control. He runs the show.  He calls the shots, and we consider ourselves extremely blessed that God considered us faithful enough to tell a story like Noah.  It’s humbling.  Thank you for loving our family, and our son.  It means more then you know. -Rick (You can stay connected with us by visiting our  subscribe  page!)

"29449" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/treadmill-training-progress/" "An Update On Noah’s Treadmill Therapy Progress" "Noah physical therapist has been using treadmill training to help him learn to walk for 3 and a half months now. As you can see in today’s video he’s come a long way since he took his  first “steps”  on the treadmill in a few months ago. However, he still has a lot of work to do before he’ll actually walk on his own; specifically his  core muscles , and balance. But he’ll get there. By the way you can also see in the video how his personality is developing. For instance there are times when he just sort of let’s his feet go  limp  and decides that he doesn’t want to walk. So much for all  kids with Down syndrome being angels . 🙂 It’s a ton of fun seeing him figure out what his feet are for and watching him put one foot in front of the other. It seems like it’ll be forever before Noah takes his first steps (off the treadmill), and I can’t wait! But I also know that our kids grow up fast, so as much as I want him to walk, I also want to enjoy every second of his development, because once a child starts to walk on their own there’s no going back! (Can I get an “amen” parents?) I also want to be sure to never let parenting be a  contest . As my wife and I often remind each other, we should focus on  celebrating, not comparing.  Why is your child on a treadmill anyway? For those of you wondering why our 11 month old is on a treadmill let me explain. One of the  characteristics of Down syndrome   is hypotonia which is basically low muscle tone. This means that children with  Down syndrome  (like our son) generally develop a little slower than a  typical child,  and early intervention developmental therapy is often used to help them in their progress. So one of the tools in Noah’s developmental toolbox is pediatric treadmill therapy since it has been  proven to help  children born with Down syndrome learn to walk. So that’s the long and short of it. 🙂 Want to learn more about treadmill therapy? For those of you interested in learning more about treadmill training for you child be sure to check  how treadmill training can help your child with Down syndrome learn to walk . In addition  Dr. Dale Ulrich  (who is doing cutting edge research on motor behavior and development for infant with Down syndrome) sent us over the  protocol for treadmill training for babies with Down syndrome  which you can download for  free ! Feel free to print this out and share it with your child’s physical therapist if you’d like. What do you think about treadmill therapy? Has your child ever been on a treadmill? What other sorts of therapy has your child used? Tell us about it in the comments.

"29189" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/when-do-children-with-down-syndrome-walk/" "Milestone Alert: Noah’s An Official Walker!" "If I’ve learned anything from being parent these last few years it’s this; you  never know  when your child is going to achieve a  major developmental milestone ! Noah’s been working hard lately trying to learn to walk on his own. He’s been able to  take a few steps  on his own for a while now, and he recently  learned to stand up on his own , but today, at 22 months old…out of the blue…did something  ah-mah-zing ….! Today Noah became an official walker! Yelp, that’s right. Noah is a full fledged walker! I  brought him to a local  library story time  this morning and were plying in the room after everyone left when he decided to stand up on his own and take a step, then another one, and another one, and another one….and you get the point. I couldn’t believe it! Once he figured out what he was doing, he wouldn’t stop. Although it won’t always be awesome to have to chase down a toddler, it was certainly awesome today! What Age Do Children With Down Syndrome Start Walking On Their Own? One of the questions people often ask is “ When do children with Down syndrome walk on their own? ” According to the  major milestone guidelines  children with  Down syndrome  learn to walk  without support 3 steps or more   between the ages of  16 and 42 months  with the average being 24 months. Don’t Let A Milestone Chart Steal Your Joy I know as a parent it’s easy to get caught up on these milestone guidelines, but I  want to encourage you to try hard not to. 16-42 months is a  wide range , and your child will grow, develop and hit their milestones on  their   time, now yours. (Our what some text book says.) If you find yourself  becoming consumed with these milestone charts, and feel discouraged because your child isn’t hitting their milestones as soon as some other child, let me give you two pieces of advise: 
 Don’t compare  your child to any other child, and 
 Celebrate every accomplishment , no matter how  small  it seems. 
 I find that practicing these two things helps me focus on Noah and how God is working in  his life , rather than how God is working in  everyone else’s life . As President Theodore Roosevelt once said; “Comparison is the thief of joy.”   Don’t let someone else’s child (or what your child  can’t  do) rob you of the overwhelming joy that your child brings. Parenting is way to awesome for that! A Few Tips To Help Your Child Learn To Walk We’ve written a lot on our site about Noah learning to walk. For those of you interested in helping your child learn to walk on their own I’ve listed out some of our more popular posts on this topic below. I hope you find them helpful.

So many families are told a lie.  The lie is that you have to be  afraid  of the results of a  Down syndrome screening test .  Some in the medical community even make it seem as if having a child born with Down syndrome is a sad story.  A compromise. A settling of something  less , when what you really desired was something  more . Some women are even afraid to have children out of fear of having a child born with Down syndrome.  I want to let you know that is a lie.  These children are  worth it .  So very worth it. They say a picture is worth a thousand words….well here are 25 beautiful pictures of our son Noah…who just so happened to have been  born with Down syndrome .  I have you find more than 25,000 words of encouragement as you look at this little boy who is full of life, and longs to be loved.

"29230" "43" "http://noahsdad.com/down-syndrome-angels-2/" "All Children Born With Down Syndrome Are Angles? Yah. Right. :-)" "I know what you’re thinking…. “Wow, you guys sure are mean parents!” But before you report us to child protective services I promise you we don’t make a habit out of provoking our child to cry….even if he does look super  cute  in the process! 🙂 Wonder….Curiosity….and an iMac! Our little boy is growing in leaps and bounds. It is so much fun having a front row seat to his daily adventures! (and seeing those  physical therapy goals  pay off!)  It’s amazing watching his sense of wonder and curiosity develop.  Noah is fascinated by anything  and everything he can get his tiny little hands on (especially hair….ouch!) I love being  Noah’s dad ! I love holding Noah on my lap while I work on various tasks (aka – making a mess on our dining room table) while he watches in amazement as if everything his dad is doing is the most interesting thing on the planet! (Even though to him, in that moment, it is.)  He typically just places his tiny little hands on my fingers as I type while he just relaxes and enjoys the  sensory stimulation  of my hands bouncing up and down as I type on the keyboard.  (It’s seriously one of the cutest things ever.) But tonight something happened……. Hey, Where Did My “Little Angel” Go….!? Tonight he did more than just relax.  Tonight our little Noah crossed the line from ‘ cute and innocent Noah’  to  ‘ I’ve got you wrapped around my tiny little fingers Noah!’ It’s true, at only 9 months old our cute, innocent, sweet, little  angel  has mastered the art of manipulating his daddy!  (I’m not sure where manipulation is on the developmental milestone chart…but I’m pretty sure he hit this one right on time!) But wait…How did this happen!  Aren’t all children born with Down syndrome  perfect little angels ?  That’s what everyone always tells me!  Where did he learn to do this!  I never saw Bert teach Ernie how to manipulate on an episode of  Sesame Street .  I checked his bookshelf and didn’t see a copy of “The Berenstain Bears Manipulate Their Neighbors!”  And I’ve never heard  Yo Gabba Gabba  sing “It’s Time To Manipulate Your Daddy!” Hmmmm…maybe it was just something he was born knowing how to do. Maybe the next time someone says to me “Awww…all children born with Down syndrome are just little angels, aren’t they?” I’ll direct them to  this . 🙂 (Quick Note To Parents  Not  Raising Children Born With Down Syndrome:  I was already well aware that Noah wasn’t an  angel  before tonight. Unfortunately, being born with 3 copies of your 21st chromosome doesn’t make a person sin-less. I think some people think that one of the  characteristics of Down syndrome  is perfect. Ha,ha. It’s just not true. Being born with Down syndrome means you’re fully  human …not fully  perfect .  If you’re one of those people who goes around thinking (or saying!) that all children born with down syndrome are  little angels,  I’m giving you permission on behalf of all parents of children with special needs everywhere to say something a little more creative (and true.)  For example feel free to ask any parent this question, “So what’s the last dumb/stupid/ignorant/funny thing someone has said about your child.”   I’m sure you’ll get much more interesting responses….trust me! 🙂 By the way, be sure to follow  Noahs Dad  on twitter. And be sure to say hello. We’d like to “tweet” you! 🙂 How old was your little one when you first realized he wasn’t a  little angel  after all? Do you remember what happened? Take a second to share…this ought to be good!

 Damn It Mali has her third cold/flu. She's 11 weeks today. This seems fucked up to me. I suspect this one came from putting her amongst the obviously snotty-nosed children in the nursery while I worked two Iron Gate shifts this week.

			    So yeah, that widget over there? Is a lying liar. The eggs did not hatch today. Maybe tomorrow? 
    I'm around, I'm just laying low while the steroids do their thing. My lungs are sucking, and I hate them. 
    Also? I still hate my missing tooth. 
    Perhaps the steroids are making me depressed again.

			So yesterday Dell sent me dispatch information, and there was great rejoicing! Then today I received...a battery. By itself. A quick check of our bank account revealed that they did NOT charge me anything (yet?), but why the battery? Are they sending me a laptop without a battery? Are they GOING to charge me for the battery I thought I needed to buy weeks ago, before they gave up on the original laptop? WHAT THE DELL?!? 
 
   I'm so confused. 
 
   And computerless. STILL.

 Just took a tally of confirmed partygoers for tomorrow's hootenanny. That'd be 80.  Eighty . Holy shit on a shingle. Well, we've got a big yard. It'd better not rain, is all I've got to say about that.
 
 Plus, we'll need more beer.

			    The vet said that MFA Puppy would respond to the steroid/antibiotic cocktail in one of three ways: 
    1. Too little, too late, dead dog by the weekend, or else they fry her liver and GI-tract, dead dog soonish.    2. Slow but steady improvement, but possible mange relapse, liver/GI damage from longterm-usage.    3. Miraculous turnaround overnight, whoo tits, fantastic news and we can wean her off early to minimize the chance of a(nother) mange relapse and liver/GI damage (and call him if his happens because he's worried, too and it would drastically improve her prognosis). 
    As of right now?  The giant Lymphnode of DOOM  has shrunken by HALF!!! This morning our poor dog was half-dead and the thing was nearly the size of a golfball, and now it is ping-pong-ball-sized and she is feeling well enough that she knocked the kitchen trash over in a steroid-fueled food-sniffing frenzy! Well okay, this knocking over the trashcan crap is bullshit and needs to stop but YOU GUYS! SHE'S FEELING BETTER AND MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY??? C'mon, Isis, GOOD DOG yaaaaay!

			Shit, y'all, I just can't even right now. We're out of milk, Bumpus-chow, and rabbit feed, the MFA Beater needs sparkplugs (and gas, for that matter) and is running like shit, I've been out of Mirapex, Nexium, and Symbicort for over a week, the account is overdrawn, and I woke up with a great painful lump on my instep that can't be good...I know y'all worry when I don't post but sometimes I don't have anything even remotely nice to say and figure it's better to shut up and keep trudging (or limping, as the case may be) along until things are less Grapes of Wrath. Check back with me Friday, I guess.

			 *   Seventeen-hour day today. 
 *   New Weekend Warrior Job? Is going bust like  Old Weekend Warrior Job did . Eff me in the a. This almost makes me feel like I should quit Fairy Sweatshop Job, just because I really like Fairy Sweatshop Boss and want her business to remain solvent, and apparently I am a curse. 
 *   AND I got paid today, by New Weekend Warrior Job, and you'll never guess what they did. OH YES, THEY FUCKED UP MY PAYCHECK, BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONLY MARDI GRAS WEEK, IT IS \"FUCK WITH MFA MAMA'S MONEY WEEK!\" 
 *   And then I got a(nother) ticket on the way home at a traffic stop/sobriety check, for the expired registration I haven't had the time or money to take care of, which really completed me. 
 *   I have to be up in less than five hours for work, so I'll go to bed, but I don't mind telling you I am scared of what tomorrow will bring. Yesterday took 20% of my weekly paycheck. Today shorted me eight hours and let me know I'm getting laid off from my secondary job soon (plus gave me a ticket). What is tomorrow going to do, come to my house and kick my dog? Sheeeeyit. 
 *   How are all of you doing? Tell me a funny. I could really use a laugh.

			    The turkeys are starting to get ugly: 
   Figure One:  Balding around the eyes and making alien noises. 
   We're holding strong at five laying hens, all of whom are now laying again, and Paul the rooster. Twelve pullets including one suspected cockerel, four ducks, three turkey poults and the now...eleven? (Hotter has broken two but neither was fertile) eggs in the incubator. 
    We've seriously discussed getting a Silky bantam to use as a broody hen if this batch fails, as those are cheaper and cuter than incubators and Hotter would love to have a \"pet\" chicken that was immune from getting et when it's not being useful (hens can brood even if they're no longer laying). I have pointed out that Paul is immune by dint of being a facespace friend's former pet, but Hotter reminded me that he and Paul are sworn enemies (yes, still). Oh well.

 Cute! 
 
 This doesn't look like Mali, that baby who is 9 weeks old as of yesterday. It's still cute, though. And she certainly doesn't look the least bit sick, which she isn't anymore--except a slight snorfly nose and some sneezing.

			    No, not my job prospects, although THOSE are pretty danged depressing as well... Sickly Chick  didn't fare so well while I was working at The Hippie Food Coop today, and had some sort of seizure or attack shortly after I got home, upon which the others promptly started to cannibalize her WHILE SHE WAS STILL ALIVE...so I had to put the poor little thing in a paper lunch bag and stick it over the tailpipe of the MFA Minivan. 
     Sigh. 
  The only real plus-side is that my kids were being positively horrendous and I was like \"SERIOUSLY? You're messing with me when I'VE ALREADY KILLED TWICE THIS WEEK???\"

			 * Major deadline tomorrow. 
 * Also I am working back-to-back full days at PseudoCorp and Weekend Warrior Job tomorrow (the hell, WWJ? On a Tuesday?), which involves things like getting up before five and going to bed after midnight THE NEXT DAY. 
 * Plus I worked a super-long day today at PseudoCorp, because see first bullet. 
 * Then I came home and ate a delicious dinner and fired up the facespace and saw this: 
 Figure One:  I blew it way up and took a screenshot; this was a sidebar ad. I do not understand what is supposed to be going on in this picture. The giant on the far left looks like a white giant wearing black pants and a red...wrap? Is he mocking the Masai tribesman to his left? What is up with the dudes (little people?) in the foreground? The one on the far right...what is a redneck (I'm guessing, since it's a white guy with a mullet) doing in Africa? Do the wee little legs between the two giants belong to children? WHY IS ONE OF THE CHILDREN MISSING A LEG? Also, what does any of this have to do with earning one's MBA on the weekends? I...have lots of questions about this. 
 * I'm tired and confused; I think I'll go to bed. How are all of YOU?

			 *   Duuuudes this weekend SUCKED. My temp crown fell out Friday night, leaving an insanely painful exposed stump of raw nerve, and I had a migraine that was OF THE DEVIL. It was so bad I was almost grateful when my dentist offered to call in some pain medication that the stupid temp crown had fallen out! Fortunately the medication worked like a charm, rendering the tooth a total non-issue and the migraine at least bearable (in conjunction with some forbidden NSAIDs) (my H&H are fabulous, so I was less worried about the potential for unusual bleeding than I was about the agony of the migraine). So that was good but my weekend was still sucktastic. Booo. 
 *   Several of y'all have signed up for eBates--WHOOHOO! That's awesome! If you haven't, but think you might enjoy the program, I've put an eBates button on the left sidebar. Join up through there and you get $5 in bonus cash and SO DO I. Win/win. 
 *   I forgot to mention before, but you can use Swagbucks to search for eBates when you go to buy something online and sometimes you'll win Swagbucks for searching eBates and THEN save a bunch of money with eBates, and that right there is what I call a multiple Jewgasm. Seriously, it pretty much makes my day when that happens. There's also a Swagbucks button on the left sidebar, or you can sign up  here  and we'll both get a 30 SB bonus. 
 *   I FINALLY saw Loud and Crazy the turkey puff up and do the \"strut.\" It was pretty badass! I was impressed! He looks about three times his usual size while doing this.  Here  again is what that looks like (our turkeys are Narragansetts too). Also  here  is a video of baby turkeys strutting, because it's hilarious (we never saw ours do it as a poult). 
 *   I still have a headache (but hopefully just a regular old headache that needs to eff off and die in a tire fire) so Imma go take a nap before the boys get home and hope it goes away. How are all of YOU?

			 *   This morning I woke up, got the boys off to school, checked for eggs in the henhouse (nada), and came inside to check the Twitter. *   Thirty-five years ago today, Tanis Miller (a.k.a.  The Redneck Mommy ) was born somewhere in America's Hat (a.k.a. Canada). *   I went back to bed because it is a dreary, depressing day here in MFAville, only to be awakened by my husband, who was grinning like a little boy on Christmas morning and holding...A LITTLE BROWN EGG! 
     Figure One:  Two of these things belong together, one of these things just isn't the same! 
   Figure Two:  When chickens first start laying, the eggs are often small, 
funny-shaped, or even *gag* shell-less. I am pleased to report that 
while it is small, the first MFA Egg is perfectly shaped and has a nice 
hard shell on it.

			   The MFA Children are visiting The XY this weekend, and Hotter and I are making it a staycation weekend here at Casa MFA. This is the first weekend we've had in ages that he wasn't hospitalized or feeling awful and I wasn't frantically cleaning and puppy-proofing the house. We're mostly just vegging in bed with the dog. It's awesome, and I'll talk to all of you lovely people on Monday :)

Thimerosal Gives Baby Rats Brain Damage

Abstract 
Thimerosal, an organomercurial added as a preservative to some vaccines, is a suspected iatrogenic factor, possibly contributing to paediatric neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. We examined the effects of early postnatal administration of thimerosal (four i.m. injections, 12 or 240 μg THIM-Hg/kg, on postnatal days 7, 9, 11 and 15) on brain pathology in Wistar rats. Numerous neuropathological changes were observed in young adult rats which were treated postnatally with thimerosal. They included: ischaemic degeneration of neurons and \"dark\" neurons in the prefrontal and temporal cortex, the hippocampus and the cerebellum, pathological changes of the blood vessels in the temporal cortex, diminished synaptophysin reaction in the hippocampus, atrophy of astroglia in the hippocampus and cerebellum, and positive caspase-3 reaction in Bergmann astroglia.  These findings document neurotoxic effects of thimerosal, at doses equivalent to those used in infant vaccines or higher, in developing rat brain, suggesting likely involvement of this mercurial in neurodevelopmental disorders.

 Thimerosal  added to some pediatric vaccines is suspected in pathogenesis of  several neurodevelopmental disorders. Our previous study showed that  thimerosal administered to suckling rats causes persistent, endogenous  opioid-mediated hypoalgesia. Here we examined, using immunohistochemical  staining technique, the density of mu-opioid receptors (MORs) in the  brains of rats, which in the second postnatal week received four i.m.  injections of thimerosal at doses 12,  240, 1,440 or 3,000 mug Hg/kg. The periaqueductal gray, caudate putamen  and hippocampus were examined. Thimerosal administration caused  dose-dependent statistically significant increase in MOR densities in  the periaqueductal gray and caudate putamen, but decrease in the dentate  gyrus, where it was accompanied by the presence of degenerating neurons  and loss of synaptic vesicle marker (synaptophysin). These data  document that exposure to thimerosal during early postnatal life  produces lasting alterations in the densities of brain opioid receptors  along with other neuropathological changes, which may disturb brain  development.

Abstract 
Gulf War Syndrome is a multi-system disorder afflicting many veterans of Western armies in the 1990–1991 Gulf War. A number of those afflicted may show neurological deficits including various cognitive dysfunctions and motor neuron disease, the latter expression virtually indistinguishable from classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) except for the age of onset. This ALS “cluster” represents the second such ALS cluster described in the literature to date. Possible causes of GWS include several of the adjuvants in the anthrax vaccine and others. The most likely culprit appears to be aluminum hydroxide. In an initial series of experiments, we examined the potential toxicity of aluminum hydroxide in male, outbred CD-1 mice injected subcutaneously in two equivalent-to human doses. After sacrifice, spinal cord and motor cortex samples were examined by immunohistochemistry. Aluminum-treated mice showed significantly increased apoptosis of motor neurons and increases in reactive astrocytes and microglial proliferation within the spinal cord and cortex. Morin stain detected the presence of aluminum in the cytoplasm of motor neurons with some neurons also testing positive for the presence of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein, a pathological hallmark of various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. A second series of experiments was conducted on mice injected with six doses of aluminum hydroxide. Behavioural analyses in these mice revealed significant impairments in a number of motor functions as well as diminished spatial memory capacity. The demonstrated neurotoxicity of aluminum hydroxide and its relative ubiquity as an adjuvant suggest that greater scrutiny by the scientific community is warranted.

Abstract 
 
Thimerosal, a mercury-containing vaccine preservative, is a suspected factor in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. We previously showed that its administration to infant rats causes behavioral, neurochemical and neuropathological abnormalities similar to those present in autism. Here we examined, using microdialysis, the effect of thimerosal on extracellular levels of neuroactive amino acids in the rat prefrontal cortex (PFC). Thimerosal administration (4 injections, i.m., 240 μg Hg/kg on postnatal days 7, 9, 11, 15) induced lasting changes in amino acid overflow: an increase of glutamate and aspartate accompanied by a decrease of glycine and alanine; measured 10-14 weeks after the injections. Four injections of thimerosal at a dose of 12.5 μg Hg/kg did not alter glutamate and aspartate concentrations at microdialysis time (but based on thimerosal pharmacokinetics, could have been effective soon after its injection). Application of thimerosal to the PFC in perfusion fluid evoked a rapid increase of glutamate overflow. Coadministration of the neurosteroid, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS; 80 mg/kg; i.p.) prevented the thimerosal effect on glutamate and aspartate; the steroid alone had no influence on these amino acids. Coapplication of DHEAS with thimerosal in perfusion fluid also blocked the acute action of thimerosal on glutamate. In contrast, DHEAS alone reduced overflow of glycine and alanine, somewhat potentiating the thimerosal effect on these amino acids. Since excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate is linked with excitotoxicity, our data imply that neonatal exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines might induce excitotoxic brain injuries, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders. DHEAS may partially protect against mercurials-induced neurotoxicity.

Study Watch : IL-6 is increased in the cerebellum of the autistic brain and alters neural cell adhesion, migration and synapse formation
" "
If you ever wondered how a dysregulated immune system could lead to the symptoms of autism, here is one possible answer for you.  A new study has added to the evidence that  interleukin 6 , a chemical messenger produced by and used by the immune system, can be abnormally high in the brains of some people with autism. More importantly, it showed that it is possible that these high levels of IL-6 can modify the physical functioning of the brain.  
 
Or at least it can alter the physical properties of bits of mouse brains in petri dishes.  Replication of this exact study in human brains will have to wait until someone allows some researchers to play mad scientist with their brains... 
 
Sorry, couldn't resist the bad joke.  But seriously, this is an interesting study and if you are interested in the immune system and how it could impact the functioning of the brain, it is worth reading.  The study is open access, so the entire text is freely available  here . 
 
 
 IL-6 is increased in the cerebellum of the autistic brain and alters neural cell adhesion, migration and synapse formation .

 Background : Although the cellular mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of autism are not understood, a growing number of studies have suggested that localized inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) may contribute to the development of autism. Recent evidence shows that IL-6 has a crucial role in the development and plasticity of CNS. 
 
 Methods : Immunohistochemistry studies were employed to detect the IL-6 expression in the cerebellum of study subjects. In vitro adenoviral gene delivery approach was used to over-express IL-6 in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Cell adhesion and migration assays, DiI labeling, TO-PRO-3 staining and Immunofluorescence were used to examine cell adhesion and migration, dendritic spine morphology, cell apoptosis and synaptic protein expression respectively. 
 
 Results : In this study, we found that IL-6 was significantly increased in the cerebellum of autistic subjects. We investigated how IL-6 affects neural cell development and function by transfecting cultured mouse cerebellar granule cells with an IL-6 viral expression vector. We demonstrated that IL-6 over-expression in granule cells caused impairments in granule cell adhesion and migration but had little effect on the formation of dendritic spines or granule cell apoptosis. However, IL-6 over-expression stimulated the formation of granule cell excitatory synapses, without affecting inhibitory synapses. 
 
 Conclusions:  Our   results provide further evidence that aberrant IL-6 may be associated with autism. In addition, our results suggest that the elevated IL-6 in the autistic brain could alter neural cell adhesion, migration and also cause an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory circuits. Thus, increased IL-6 expression may be partially responsible for the pathogenesis of autism.

Low level Hg and Autism: Mercury induces inflammatory mediator release from human mast cells
" "
 Mercury induces inflammatory mediator release from human mast cells Duraisamy Kempuraj, Shahrzad Asadi, Bodi Zhang, Akrivi Manola, Jennifer Hogan,  Erika Peterson, Theoharis C Theoharides Journal of Neuroinflammation 2010, 7:20 doi:10.1186/1742-2094-7-20 Abstract Background: Mercury is known to be neurotoxic, but its effects on the immune system are less well known. Mast cells are involved in allergic reactions, but also in innate and acquired immunity, as well as in inflammation. Many patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have “allergic” symptoms; moreover, the prevalence of ASD in patients with mastocytosis, characterized by numerous hyperactive mast cells in most tissues, is 10-fold higher than the general population suggesting mast cell involvement. We, therefore, investigated the effect of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) on human mast cell activation. Methods: Human leukemic cultured LAD2 mast cells and normal human umbilical cord bloodderived cultured mast cells (hCBMCs) were stimulated by HgCl2 (0.1-10 μM) for either 10 min for beta-hexosaminidase release or 24 hr for measuring vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-6 release by ELISA. Results: HgCl2 induced a 2-fold increase in β-hexosaminidase release, and also significant VEGF release at 0.1 and 1 μM (311±32 pg/106 cells and 443±143 pg/106 cells, respectively) from LAD2 mast cells compared to control cells (227±17 pg/106 cells, n=5, p Conclusions: HgCl2 stimulates VEGF and IL-6 release from human mast cells. This phenomenon could disrupt the blood-brain-barrier and permit brain inflammation. As a result, the findings of the present study provide a biological mechanism for how low levels of mercury may contribute to ASD pathogenesis.

Autism and the Missing Protein
" "
The autism buzz in the news today arises from the publication in  Neuron  of a study led by  Li-Huei Tsai, PhD, and Picower Professor of Neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) which suggests that a missing protein may be the key to autism. The brain protein  helps synapses develop, the synapses  through which neurons convey information,  and which are the basis for memory and learning ability  development. As explained by Debbie Halber, Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, in  Missing protein may be key to autism , the study uncovers an enzyme, called Cdk5,  that is a key to the activity of the missing protein.  Cdk5 is a \"kinase\", an enzyme that changes proteins, and interacts with a protein called CASK, which is itself important for developing synapses.  The absence of Cdk5 can result in the CASK not being present to perform its role: \"\" Without Cdk5, CASK was not in the right place at the right time, and failed to interact with essential presynaptic components. This, in turn, led to problems with calcium influx.\" The flow of calcium in and out of neurons affects processes central to nervous system development and plasticity--its ability to change in response to experience.    Gene mutations and/or deletions in synaptic cell surface proteins and molecules called neurexins and neuroligins have been associated with autism. The problem with CASK recruitment investigated by the Tsai laboratory creates the same result as these genetic changes.\" In comments reported on Reuters, in  Missing protein may underlie autism: U.S. study ,  Tsai was clear about the significance of  Cdk5 failing to facilitate CASK in the development of autism:  \"\"We show that if Cdk5 fails to facilitate CASK, then there is a very profound defect in synapse formation, .... The most accepted hypothesis for autism is that there is a defect in synapse formation,\" Tsai said, adding that mutations of genes directly connected to CASK have already been identified as being associated with autism.         Mutations of CASK and Cdk5 are also identified in certain patients with mental retardation.         \"I think this study strongly suggests this pathway involving Cdk5 ... is intimately involved (in autism),\" she said.

Study : Comparative RNA editing in autistic and neurotypical cerebella.
" "
The topic of this new study is somewhat beyond my level of understanding but it is intriguing.  It seems to suggest that the expression of genes in the brain can be altered by a process that is susceptible to environmental signals and that this process is more active in the brains of some people with autism. 
 
The abstract is below. 
 
 Comparative RNA editing in autistic and neurotypical cerebella. 
 
Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a neurodevelopmentally regulated epigenetic modification shown to modulate complex behavior in animals. Little is known about human A-to-I editing, but it is thought to constitute one of many molecular mechanisms connecting environmental stimuli and behavioral outputs. Thus, comprehensive exploration of A-to-I RNA editing in human brains may shed light on gene-environment interactions underlying complex behavior in health and disease. Synaptic function is a main target of A-to-I editing, which can selectively recode key amino acids in synaptic genes, directly altering synaptic strength and duration in response to environmental signals. Here, we performed a high-resolution survey of synaptic A-to-I RNA editing in a human population, and examined how it varies in autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder in which synaptic abnormalities are a common finding. Using ultra-deep (>1000 × ) sequencing, we quantified the levels of A-to-I editing of 10 synaptic genes in postmortem cerebella from 14 neurotypical and 11 autistic individuals. A high dynamic range of editing levels was detected across individuals and editing sites, from 99.6% to below detection limits. In most sites, the extreme ends of the population editing distributions were individuals with autism. Editing was correlated with isoform usage, clusters of correlated sites were identified, and differential editing patterns examined. Finally, a dysfunctional form of the editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA B1 was found more commonly in postmortem cerebella from individuals with autism. These results provide a population-level, high-resolution view of A-to-I RNA editing in human cerebella and suggest that A-to-I editing of synaptic genes may be informative for assessing the epigenetic risk for autism.

Abstract 
 
Thimerosal (THIM), an organomercury preservative added to many child vaccines is a suspected factor in pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. We examined the pharmacokinetics of Hg in the brain, liver and kidneys after i.m. THIM injection in suckling rats and we tested THIM effect on nociception. THIM solutions were injected to Wistar and Lewis rats in a vaccination-like mode on PN days 7, 9, 11 and 15 in four equal doses. For Wistar rats these were: 12, 48, 240, 720, 1440, 2160, 3000 microg Hg/kg and for Lewis: 54, 216, 540 and 1080 microg Hg/kg. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that Hg from THIM injections accumulates in the rat brain in significant amounts and remains there longer than 30 days after the injection. At the 6th week of age animals were examined for pain sensitivity using the hot plate test. THIM treated rats of both strains and sexes manifested statistically significantly elevated pain threshold (latency for paw licking, jumping) on a hot plate (56 degrees C). Wistar rats were more sensitive to this effect than Lewis rats. Protracted THIM-induced hypoalgesia was reversed by naloxone (5 mg/kg, i.p.) injected before the hot plate test, indicative of involvement of endogenous opioids. This was confirmed by augmented catalepsy after morphine (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) injection. Acute THIM injection to 6-week-old rats also produced hypoalgesia, but this effect was transient and was gone within 14 days. Present findings show that THIM administration to suckling or adult rats impairs sensitivity to pain, apparently due to activation the endogenous opioid system.

Thimerosal, an ethyl mercury compound, is used worldwide as a vaccine preservative. We previously observed that the mercury concentration in mouse brains did not increase with the clinical dose of thimerosal injection, but the concentration increased in the brain after the injection of thimerosal with lipopolysaccharide, even if a low dose of thimerosal was administered. Thimerosal may penetrate the brain, but is undetectable when a clinical dose of thimerosal is injected; therefore, the induction of metallothionein (MT) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was observed in the cerebellum and cerebrum of mice after thimerosal injection, as MT is an inducible protein. MT-1 mRNA was expressed at 6 and 9 h in both the cerebrum and cerebellum, but MT-1 mRNA expression in the cerebellum was three times higher than that in the cerebrum after the injection of 12 microg/kg thimerosal. MT-2 mRNA was not expressed until 24 h in both organs. MT-3 mRNA was expressed in the cerebellum from 6 to 15 h after the injection, but not in the cerebrum until 24 h. MT-1 and MT-3 mRNAs were expressed in the cerebellum in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, MT-1 protein was detected from 6 to 72 h in the cerebellum after 12 microg/kg of thimerosal was injected and peaked at 10 h. MT-2 was detected in the cerebellum only at 10 h. In the cerebrum, little MT-1 protein was detected at 10 and 24 h, and there were no peaks of MT-2 protein in the cerebrum. In conclusion, MT-1 and MT-3 mRNAs but not MT-2 mRNA are easily expressed in the cerebellum rather than in the cerebrum by the injection of low-dose thimerosal. It is thought that the cerebellum is a sensitive organ against thimerosal.  As a result of the present findings, in combination with the brain pathology observed in patients diagnosed with autism, the present study helps to support the possible biological plausibility for how low-dose exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines may be associated with autism.

OK, so the way I understand it,  APC  is a protien which plays an important role in helping synapses grow properly. If synapses – which are the bits that transfer data from neuron to neuron – don’t grow properly then data doesn’t get passed properly. This particular protien – APC – is responsible for the synapse function for learning and memory. In the in vivo study, the team blocked APC function and found that synaptic levels of the cell adhesion proteins neuroligin and neurexin dropped considerably. Without normal levels of these proteins, synapses were less mature both structurally and functionally. Mutations in the genes for neuroligin and neurexin are associated with autism in humans, but until now, little was known about the mechanisms responsible for localizing these proteins at the synapse. “Our laboratory study is the first to show that APC is needed to recruit neuroligin and neurexin to the synapse. This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms required for proper synapse function as well as molecular changes at the synapse that likely contribute to autistic behaviors and learning deficits in people with APC loss of function gene mutations,” said [lead author, Michele H. ]  Jacob . Source . Insert mine. Right, so – again as I understand it – when the authors  blocked APC function , they found that levels of the proteins  neuroligin  and  neurexin  dropped. So what…? Well, without these two proteins at normal levels, synapses grew improperly. So what…? Turns out that scientists already know that mutuations in the genes for neuroligin and neurexin are associated with autism. Aha.

Abstract 
 Vaccines  can have adverse side-effects, and 
these are predominantly associated with the inclusion of chemical additives such 
as aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. The objective of this study was to establish an 
in vitro model system amenable to mechanistic investigations of cytotoxicity 
induced by hepatitis B  vaccine , and to investigate 
the mechanisms of  vaccine -induced cell death. The 
mouse liver hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6 was treated with two doses of adjuvanted 
(aluminium hydroxide) hepatitis B  vaccine  (0.5 and 
1 μg protein per ml) and cell integrity was measured after 24, 48 and 72 h. 
Hepatitis B  vaccine  exposure increased cell 
apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay.  Vaccine  exposure was accompanied by significant increases 
in the levels of activated caspase 3, a key effector caspase in the apoptosis 
cascade. Early transcriptional events were detected by qRT-PCR. We report that 
hepatitis B  vaccine  exposure resulted in 
significant upregulation of the key genes encoding caspase 7, caspase 9, 
Inhibitor caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), Rho-associated coiled-coil containing 
protein kinase 1 (ROCK-1), and Apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1). 
Upregulation of cleaved caspase 3,7 were detected by western blot in addition to 
Apaf-1 and caspase 9 expressions argues that cell death takes place via the 
intrinsic apoptotic pathway in which release of cytochrome c from the 
mitochondria triggers the assembly of a caspase activation complex.  We conclude that exposure of Hepa1-6 cells to 
a low dose of adjuvanted hepatitis B  vaccine  leads 
to loss of mitochondrial integrity, apoptosis induction, and cell death, 
apoptosis effect was observed also in C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line after 
treated with low dose of  vaccine  (0.3, 0.1, 0.05 
μg/ml).  In addition In vivo apoptotic effect of hepatitis B  vaccine  was observed in mouse liver.

Study: Immune System Disruption Implicated in Autism
" "
There have been a couple of good studies published in recent weeks that look at the possible connection between disruptions of the immune system and autism.  But one in particular that was published just last week in PLoS One looks to be the best of the bunch. 
 
I have not read it in depth yet so I might be getting some of the details wrong.  But in general, it looks like these researchers managed to take the many rare genetic mutations that have been seen in autism and demonstrate that many of these mutations converge on biological paths that control immune system signaling.  The researchers suggest that these disruptions have the potential to alter typical brain development and lead to the symptoms of autism. 
 
I would normally include the abstract of the study but I think these paragraphs from the conclusion puts the findings into prospective - 
 
Interestingly, there is also mounting evidence at the cellular and tissue levels that more in depth investigation of an immune component is warranted in ASD. For instance, multiple studies have demonstrated altered cytokine profiles in ASD patients, and altered TGF-B concentration in serum and CSF correlates with disease severity. Others have described various autoimmune phenomena including autoantibodies to neural antigens and maternal-fetal cross-reactive neural antibodies. There is also indication of altered innate cellular immunity in ASD, such as differences in gene expression and altered response to immunostimlulatory ligands in both natural killer and monocytic cells from ASD patients. Post-mortem brain tissue from ASD patients shows increased microglial density in grey matter, an activated morphology, and secretion of a cytokine profile consistent with a pro-inflammatory state, most prominent in the cerebellum. Moreover, microglia from MeCP2- null mice—a model of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Rett Syndrome—produce a conditioned media that damages synaptic connectivity via a glutamate-excitotoxicity mechanism.  While all of this work provides post-hoc evidence for altered immune response in ASD, our results suggest a direct link between implicated genes in ASD and molecular pathways involved in immune signaling . 
 
This considerable attention to the immune response in previous ASD research has resulted in two prevailing theories: one suggests exogenous factor(s) stimulate neuro-inflammation during development, while the other postulates autoimmune activation causes ASD pathology.  However, it is equally possible—as our results support—that the mutations described in ASD result in aberrant signaling regulation of immune cells during neurodevelopment. This could result in cell-autonomous activation and/or improper response to otherwise nominal stimuli, such as occurs in the autoinflammatory syndromes . Alternatively, as glia are increasingly implicated in normal formation of synaptic connectivity —and we have demonstrated a significant proportion of ASD-implicated genes appear to be glial-specific—it is possible that genomic aberrations ultimately funnel through core signaling pathways of glial cells to disrupt formation of neural networks independent of an inflammatory mechanism. In support of this notion, a number of recent reports have demonstrated that these same cytokine signaling pathways are central to proper brain development. Furthermore, signaling through the NFkB pathway has been shown to be important in synaptic plasticity independent of an inflammatory mechanism. 
The study is open access so  go read it  if you are interested in the subject.

Autism Results From Impaired Timing of \"Learning Windows\"; Critical Periods of Brain Plasticity
" "
 Takao Hensch, Ph.D., professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University and professor of neurology at Children's Hospital Boston is the senior investigator of a team of scientists who have identified a protein, Otx2, which is necessary for learning.  Otx2 works with other cells called parvalbumin to permit the brain to learn during important development windows.   The  Ivanhoe Medical Breakthroughs  newswire release states the parvalbumin cells make connections in parts of the brain that process visual information and receive information from the eye. These cells work with the Otx2 protein to encourage brain plasticity, the ability to learn:    After studying the function of parvalbumin cells in mice, Dr. Hensch and his colleagues found the Otx2 proteins are sent to these cells by the retina, triggering critical periods of brain plasticity.   Dr. Hensch said developmental disorders like autism are a result of impaired timing of these learning \"windows,\" like the one during which children learn to read. He said he hopes the discovery of this protein will eventually lead to new treatments for disorders like autism, and brain injuries. The study article,  Experience-Dependent Transfer of Otx2 Homeoprotein into the Visual Cortex Activates Postnatal Plasticity ,  is published in Cell,   Vol 134, 508-520, 08 August 2008. autism

Despite growing evidence suggesting a role of specific receptors and biochemical pathways in FXS pathogenesis, an effective therapeutic method has not been developed. Here, we report that abnormalities in FMR1 knockout (KO) mice, an animal model of FXS, are ameliorated, at least partially, at both cellular and behavioral levels, by an inhibition of the catalytic activity of p21-activated kinase (PAK), a kinase known to play a critical role in actin polymerization and dendritic spine morphogenesis. Greater spine density and elongated spines in the cortex, morphological synaptic abnormalities commonly observed in FXS, are at least partially restored by postnatal expression of a dominant negative (dn) PAK transgene in the forebrain. Likewise, the deficit in cortical long-term potentiation observed in FMR1 KO mice is fully restored by the dnPAK transgene. Several behavioral abnormalities associated with FMR1 KO mice, including those in locomotor activity, stereotypy, anxiety, and trace fear conditioning are also ameliorated, partially or fully, by the dnPAK transgene. Finally, we demonstrate a direct interaction between PAK and fragile X mental retardation protein in vitro. Overall, our results demonstrate the genetic rescue of phenotypes in a FXS mouse model and suggest that the PAK signaling pathway, including the catalytic activity of PAK, is a novel intervention site for development of an FXS and autism therapy.

Wed Jun 27, 9:11 AM ET CHICAGO (AFP) - US researchers have reversed the symptoms of mental retardation and autism in mice by inhibiting an enzyme that affects the connections between brain cells, researchers said Wednesday.  ADVERTISEMENT In a series of experiments on mice, the MIT investigators showed that they could undo the brain damage seen in a condition called Fragile X syndrome by inhibiting a key brain chemical called PAK. In humans, Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of mental retardation and the most common genetic cause of autism -- the complex and devastating developmental disorder that is now being diagnosed in increasing numbers of children. The study raises the intriguing possibility that the brain damage seen in children with the condition can be rolled back and identifies a specific target for potential drug therapies. \"It opens up a new avenue for drug research to treat this condition,\" said Susumu Tonegawa, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and lead author of the paper. MIT researchers began by creating a batch of mice that had been genetically modified to have Fragile X, a condition in which the neurons of the brain are structurally abnormal and functionally impaired compared to regular nerve cells. These transgenic mice had many of the behavioral problems seen in kids with the condition: hyperactivity, attention deficits, repetitive behaviors and poor social skills. The investigators then cross-bred these mice with another batch of mice that had been genetically modified to inhibit the activity of the PAK (p21-activated kinase) enzyme which is instrumental in shaping the formation of neuronal connections in the brain. The researchers knew that when PAK was inactivated, the mice developed neurons that had short, fat dendritic spines, with a higher-than-usual capacity for relaying the electrical impulses that pass between brain cells. In other words, the shape and function of the dendritic spines in the PAK mice was just the reverse of those seen in the brain cells of the mice with Fragile X syndrome. The researchers gambled that the two abnormalities would cancel each other out, and that's exactly what the experiment showed. The cross-bred mice had been genetically engineered so that the inactivation of the PAK enzyme began two weeks into the mouse's life cycle, which in human terms would be several years after birth. Tests and autopsies showed that the PAK-blocking action restored electrical communication between neurons in the brains of the double mutant mice, correcting their behavioral abnormalities in the process. \"This is very exciting because it suggests that PAK inhibitors could be used for therapeutic purposes to reverse already established mental impairments in fragile X children,\" said Eric Klann, a professor at New York University's Center for Neural Science. The study was conducted by Tonegawa and a postdoctoral student at MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and appears in this week's edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  I wonder if this means that a child must have Fragile X before they could be helped? What about the children who have Autism without Fragile X?

Maternal Immune Activation and Autism
" "
Two new studies on the connection between the mother's immune system and autism popped up on Pubmed this morning.  Both studies use mice to demonstrate that a mother's immune being stimulated during pregnancy is capable of producing lasting the changes in her offspring. 
 
The first study goes straight to the heart of the matter and demonstrates that mice born to a mother whose immune system was stimulated during pregnancy have problems in the three core areas of autism.  Or at least the mouse equivalent of the three core ares. 
 
 Maternal immune activation yields offspring displaying mouse versions of the three core symptoms of autism. 
 
 The core symptoms of autism are deficits in social interaction and language, and  the presence of repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. We demonstrate that behaviors related to these symptoms are present in a mouse model of an environmental risk factor for autism, maternal infection. We stimulate the maternal immune system by injecting the viral mimic poly(I:C) during pregnancy, and analyze the social and  communicative behaviors of the offspring. In one test, young pups respond to a brief separation from the mother with ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). We find that, compared to pups born to saline-injected mothers, pups born to maternal immune activation (MIA) mothers produce a lower rate of USVs in the isolation test starting at day 8. The quality of the vocalizations is also different; analysis of sound spectrograms of 10day-old pups shows that male pups from MIA mothers emit significantly fewer harmonic and more complex and short syllables. These communication differences are also apparent in adult offspring. Compared to controls, adult MIA males emit significantly fewer USVs in response to social encounters with females or males, and display reduced scent marking in response to female urine. Regarding a second autism symptom, MIA males display decreased sociability. In a third test of characteristic autism behaviors, MIA offspring exhibit increased repetitive/stereotyped behavior in both marble burying and self-grooming tests. In sum, these results indicate that MIA yields male offspring with deficient social and communicative behavior, as well as high levels of repetitive behaviors, all of which are hallmarks of autism. 
The second study, which is far more interesting to me, looks at what exactly the mother's immune does to her offspring.  The short answer here appears to be that it changes how genes are expressed in her offspring.  It effectively turns down the volume on many of the genes that are needed for proper neural development. 
 
 Maternal immune activation by LPS selectively alters specific gene expression profiles of interneuron migration and oxidative stress in the fetus without triggering a fetal immune response.  
 
Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia and autism. Infections during pregnancy activate the mother's immune system and alter the fetal environment, with consequential effects on CNS  function and behavior in the offspring, but the cellular and molecular links between infection-induced altered fetal development and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders are unknown. We investigated the immunological, molecular, and behavioral effects of MIA in the offspring of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats given  an intraperitoneal (0.25mg/kg) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 15. LPS significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, and fetal brain at 4h, and levels decreased but remained elevated at 24h. Offspring born to LPS-treated dams exhibited reduced social preference and exploration behaviors as juveniles and young adults. Whole genome microarray analysis of the fetal brain at 4h post maternal LPS was performed to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms by which MIA affects the fetal brain. We observed dysregulation of 3285 genes in restricted functional categories, with increased mRNA expression of cellular stress and cell death genes and reduced expression of developmentally-regulated and brain-specific genes, specifically those that regulate neuronal migration of GABAergic interneurons, including the Distal-less (Dlx) family of transcription factors required for tangential migration from progenitor pools within the ganglionic eminences into the cerebral cortex. Our results provide a novel mechanism by which MIA induces the widespread down-regulation of critical neurodevelopmental genes, including those previously associated with autism. 
The bottom line from both studies is that the mother's immune system, if suffficiently stimulated during pregnancy, is more than capable of producing some of the behavioral and biological symptoms of autism.  These results add to the existing literature that has found a relationship between maternal infections and mental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. 
 
So the next questions that needs to be addressed - the crucial ones - are whether the biological changes demonstrated in mice also happen in people and what is the catalyst that changes a routine event - maternal immune system activiation - into something else entirely.

MIT corrects inherited retardation, autism in mice
" "
 Wow!   This could be the best autism news of all in the year of the Autism Knowledge Revolution. MIT corrects inherit ed retardation, autism in mice   Research points to potential drug treatment     CAMBRIDGE, Mass.- Researchers at MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory have corrected key symptoms of mental retardation and autism in mice.    The work, which will be reported in the Dec. 20 issue of Neuron, also indicates that a certain class of drugs could have the same effect. These drugs are not yet approved by the FDA, but will soon be entering into human clinical trials.    Fragile X syndrome (FXS), affecting 100,000 Americans, is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation and autism. The MIT researchers corrected FXS in mice modeling the disease. “These findings have major therapeutic implications for fragile X syndrome and autism,” said study lead author Mark F. Bear, director of the Picower Institute and Picower Professor of Neuroscience at MIT.    The findings support the theory that many of FXS's psychiatric and neurological symptoms-learning disabilities, autistic behavior, childhood epilepsy- stem from too much activation of one of the brain's chief network managers-the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5.     “Fragile X is a disorder of excess-excess synaptic connectivity, protein synthesis, memory extinction, body growth, excitability-and remarkably, all these excesses can be reduced by reducing mGluR5,” said Bear, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.     Individuals with FXS have mutations in the X chromosome's FMR1 gene, which encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP. The MIT study found that FMRP and mGluR5 are at opposite ends of a kind of molecular seesaw. They keep each other in check, and without FMRP, mGluR5 signals run rampant.     Bear and colleagues study how genes and environment interact to refine connections in the brain. Synapses are the brain's connectors and their modifications are the basis for all learning and memory. There's a growing consensus among researchers that developmental brain disorders such as FXS, autism and schizophrenia should be considered “synapsopathies”- diseases of synaptic development and plasticity (the ability to change in response to experience).    Dendritic spines--little nubs on neurons' branchlike projections-receive many of the synaptic inputs from other neurons. Abnormal spines have long been associated with various forms of human mental retardation. In FXS, spines are more numerous, longer and more spindly than they should be. Thin spines tend to form weak connections.    The research team found that a 50 percent reduction in mGluR5 fixed multiple defects in the fragile X mice. In addition to correcting dendritic spines, reduced mGluR5 improved altered brain development and memory, restored normal body growth, and reduced seizures-many of the symptoms experienced by humans with FXS.     The researchers used genetic engineering to reduce mGluR5, but the same thing could be accomplished by a drug. Although not yet approved by the FDA, mGluR5 blockers are entering into human clinical trials. “Insights gained by this study suggest novel therapeutic approaches, not only for fragile X but also for autism and mental retardation of unknown origin,” Bear said.    Earlier this year, MIT Picower Institute researcher Susumu Tonegawa and colleagues reported positive results using a different approach to reversing FXS symptoms. Tonegawa and colleagues identified a key enzyme called p21-activated kinase, or PAK, that affects the number, size and shape of connections between neurons.    ###    In addition to Bear, authors include Brown University graduate student Gul Dolen; Picower Institute postdoctoral fellow Emily Osterweil, B.S.

Heather Doherty  Reviewed on Prairie Fire and AU World
" "
 Conor's mom, Heather Doherty, has now been featured on au.world and her first novel Goody Bledsoe has been reviewed on Prairie Fire Review of Books.  Conor's autism did not prevent her from completing her education with a degree in English literature from Athabasca University or from publishing her first novel \"Goody Bledsoe\" which is NOT about autism. http://au.world.athabascau.ca/200707/htdocs/student_success.php http://www.prairiefire.ca/reviews/doherty_bledsoe.html

"21806" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/01/loving-lampposts-video-clips/" "Loving Lampposts video clips" "Loving Lampposts  is a new documentary film by filmaker and autism parent Todd Drezner.    Here’s a blurb from their website to give you an idea about the film: What would you call a four year old who caresses all the lampposts in the park? Quirky? Unusual? Or sick? 
 Such labels are at the center of the debate about autism: is it a disease or a different way of being—or both? In Loving Lampposts, we witness this debate and meet the parents, doctors, therapists, and autistic people who are redefining autism at a moment when it’s better known than ever before. Motivated by his son’s diagnosis, filmmaker Todd Drezner explores the changing world of autism and learns the truth of the saying, “if you’ve met one autistic person, you’ve met one autistic person.” I put it on my Netflix list (you can too:  link ) right after reading the review on  The Thinking Person’s Guide to Autism  and the interview with the director on  Neurotribes .  Netflix doesn’t carry it yet, but with luck I may have a copy soon.  One can  purchase a copy  as well. If you are interested in what Todd Drezner has to say, he has the first in a series of articles up on the Huffington Post:  Learning to Embrace Autism . For more on what the film is about, here are a series of video clips the produces have made available: Opening sequence with director Todd Drezner introducing autism spectrum disorder through his son, Sam

Well, it’s now available for streaming on Netflix (possibly for DVD delivery too, I can’t tell for sure). I discussed the film a number of times when it was released ( Loving lampposts ,  Loving Lampposts: synopsis and director’s statement ,  Loving Lampposts video clips , and, after I was provided with a review DVD,  Loving Lampposts, a review .) Here are a couple of clips from the film: Loving Lampposts Clip#1  from  Cinema Libre Studio  on  Vimeo . Loving Lampposts Clip #3  from  Cinema Libre Studio  on  Vimeo . In his recent Huffington Post article, Labeling Autism And Creating Community , Mr. Drezner takes on some of the questions posed by the proposed DSMV criteria for autism.  Specifically, will some people lose their autism labels, and what does this mean.

"12927" "19" "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2010/12/04/another-hundred-books/" "Another hundred books" "There’s a list of books going around Facebook.  Purportedly compiled by the BBC, which has supposedly found that most people have read, on average, six of them.  Only according to a friend who went looking, the BBC compiled no such list; the meme seems to be some kind of conflation of the BBC’s “Big Read” list which is the result of a poll of Brits’ favorite books, and some apocryphal statistic about how little the average adult actually reads. So relax everyone, it’s just fun; it’s not actually a judgment of how well-read you are.  Nevertheless, my Facebook friends had some interesting and useful banter about what made the list and important books and authors that didn’t make the list. Here’s my own list of 100 important books that didn’t make the Facebook/BBC list, in no particular order of preference.  It’s a highly idiosyncratic and in no way judgmental list, incredibly biased towards stuff I’ve read and stuff I like, or found particularly formative.  I haven’t read all of these; a few are things I think I should have read and haven’t. If you like, give it the Facebook treatment and see how you do.  (Copy and paste into a comment, star what you’ve read.)  Tell me your own–what are your most important books that haven’t made anyone’s list? 1.

Possible autistic short story collection
" "
I have just received a tip about some people  who are interested in putting together a short story collection by autistic authors . I have written 23 short stories, 14 of them have been published on my stories page. It has been a few years since I have written any stories, though at some point I might write more. I'm more interested in writing novels and technically I have now written two of those. Of course short stories can often be a novelist's baby steps. I have submitted my story,  Guess who isn't coming to lunch  to these people. I may submit one or two more to them. They have a 3,000 word limit so this would preclude a good number of my stories that are substantially longer than this but I have a number of others that do fall within this range. At one time I believed that I was one of the few persons on the spectrum to have written fiction. After I wrote this on my home page of my stories website, various people countered this claim and I must concede that there are apparently more fiction authors on the spectrum than I previously had believed. This seems like an exciting project, the fact that there could be a collection of short stories by autistic authors and that it could be published.  One of the problems with this project however is that these people are planning to submit the collection to Jessica Kingsley, probably the premiere publisher of autism-related books. I met Ms. Kingsley at an autism conference a few years ago or so, and she told me that as a general rule, she will not publish fiction books because they did publish one children's book that was fiction and it sold poorly. Though, I think such a project would be worthwhile, I understand that Ms. Kingsley is concerned with her company's bottom line. So, I am guessing the chances that this story collection would be published by JKP is certainly a longshot. If JKP declined to publish it, the chances of anyone else doing so are miniscule, as short story collections are only published by mainstream publishers when the author is an established writer who has had stories published in various magazines, anthologies etc. If any other autistic authors who have written short stories are interested in this I guess they can follow the link to the wrong planet post and contact the parties concerned.

 Autism Success Stories -  Axel Brauns 
 
 
 

 
 Each week in conjunction with Autism Care UK, who
specialise in autism support services and  autism treatment , we have been
celebrating some of the most high profile people along the autism spectrum. This
week’s autism success story profiles German author and filmmaker Axel Brauns.  
 
 
 
 Who
is Axel Brauns?  
 
 
 
 Born in Hamburg, Germany, Axel Brauns is a writer
and filmmaker who is highly respected within his own country. After school
Brauns began studying law, however he stopped his studies in 1984 to
concentrate on his writing.  
 
 He has published numerous novels and created the
popular German literal character  Adina
Adelung , and been
nominated for the German Book Prize. As well as this, in 1992 he penned his
bestselling autobiography  Shadows and
Coloured Bats – Living in another world  where he describes his autism,
which he says affected him from the age of one. Braun’s first feature film was  Tsunami and Stone Piles  and was
critically acclaimed.  
 
 Braun is also the subject of the full length
documentary  The Red Carpet  which
focuses on his autism as well as his creative process and his life in general,
a clip of which can be seen here -  http://tinyurl.com/redcarpetclip .  
 
 Axel’s Experience of Autism 
 
 Like
many on the autistic spectrum, Braun is fascinated in studying a particular
topic. In Braun’s case, it is a reference book about German racing horse statistics
and genetic information:  German Harness
Racing Studs.    It was as a result of
the joy that reading this book that inspired Brauns to write books of his own.
He states in the film “My dream was to write a book that pleased other people as
much as this book pleased me”. Axel realised that unlike him most people are
interested in stories as opposed to race horse statistics, so decided to start
writing fiction.  
 
 In
his younger days Braun was unable to speak. As he grew older Axel painstakingly
taught himself facial expressions, speech patterns, and even comic timing by
watching films and reading books. His persistence paid off. Axel admits he

Except for the wifes crappy John Grisham novels of course! Several times! Last book purchased In The Night Room . Peter Straub. Not his best but still pretty damn good. Book reading right now Koko .

Whatcha readin'?

The clock is ticking and the creative juices aren't flowing, so my thanks go out tonight to Island Mom, who  suggested  that I solicit book suggestions, as I did with  tv series  last week.  I think it's a terrific idea.  I've done it a couple of times before, actually, and I read some fantastic books as a result. I don't have a lot of \"must reads\" to pass on to you right now, but I do have a sizable stack of books in my \"to be read\" pile.   I'm currently reading Lev Grossman's  The Magicians , but on deck, in no particular order, are: Dave Eggers'  Zeitoun Nick Hornby's  Juliet, Naked Katherine Neville's  The Fire Jonathan Franzen's  The Corrections Paul Collins'   The Book of William: How Shakespeare's First Folio Conquered the World , and Neil Gaiman's  The Graveyard Book I've also got a couple of special needs parenting books on the stack: Dawn Heubner's  What to Do When Your Brain Gets Stuck: A Kid's Guide to Overcoming OCD , and Linda Woodcock and Andrea Page's  Managing Family Meltdown: The Low Arousal Approach and Autism So, how about you?  Read any good books lately?

That's not the issue for me, I wrote, to reassure her. No, I don't have Writer's Block...just Writer's Children. 
 
Onward!

 I may regret saying this as there's been many a false start, draft of a proposal, drafts and drafts and drafts, meditations on titles and the order of things: I'm at work on a book. My book,  that  book,  the  book, the Charlie one I hoped would be the natural result of blogging  when I started over nine years  ago. 
 And also, a piece on the  mute son of Croesus King of Lydia  in the first book of Herodotus'  Histories .

 Willy loves stories.  He tells himself stories almost constantly.  He watches movies, YouTube and television shows, and he acts out stories he’s really enjoyed or he makes up his own.  Yet, Willy doesn’t really like reading.  It’s a struggle for him to follow along.  This is frustrating—for both of us. 
 Right now we’re reading A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L’Engle.  This is a story with a history in our family.  This is the first book my mother ever remembers reading, and it’s a book I read and loved when I was Willy’s age.  These facts helped me to develop a pre-reading interest for Willy.  But the reading part—and the comprehension part—are still a struggle for him. 
 We’re keeping our reading periods brief, and that helps.  We’re also going over what we read quite thoroughly after we’ve read it.  That helps, too.  But, it’s still a struggle. 
 On the upside, both Alex and Ben have been bringing Daddy (a.k.a. Mark) books for him to read to them.  And they actually sit and listen to him read!

 See Steve Silberman's interview with director Todd Drezner:  http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2011/03/29/loving-lampposts-a-groundbreaking-documentary-about-autism-love-and-acceptance/   
 You can now put Loving Lampposts into your Netflix queue for when it is available on Netflix:  http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Loving-Lampposts/70166285?strkid=305844720_0_0&lnkctr=srchrd-sr&strackid=3d6e63f3b256867a_0_srl&trkid=222336 
 
   
 My colleague Shannon Rosa has an  extended review  of the just-released documentary Loving Lampposts (website:  http://www.lovinglamppostsmovie.com/  ) at  The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism .  I recommend you read the whole review. 
 The director, Todd Drezner, showcases the varied faces of our community: the advocates, the adults, the loving parents, the beloved children -- plus the professionals, the doctors, the researchers, and the gadflies.  Loving Lampposts takes the oft-repeated phrase \"if you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person\" and gives it life. You need to see this film. And if you want to help others better understand autism, you need to recommend Loving Lampposts to them. 
 The segment I found most moving was the interviews (in the film itself, and the extended interview in the Extras) with Lila Howard, whose son Lyndon was born in the same year I was.  It was all so different then -- Lila had to contend with the \"refrigerator mother theory\", the lack of supports, the lack of educational opportunities... She made it all happen.  Indomidable is the word. 
 Lyndon is living in his own apartment, with support from visiting staff. Yes he has challenges, but he is also living a life of dignity and satisfaction. 
 You can buy the DVD through Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H4XDI6/ ) or download it from iTunes ( http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMovie?id=421776921&s=143441  link opens iTunes Store). 
 Eventually it will be available on Netflix, too,just not today.

Lifesaving giveaway (almost as good as cupcakes)
" "
We have a certain method in our house for replacing batteries in our smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detectors. It goes something like this: 
 
1. Smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector starts beeping. 
2. We ignore it. Perhaps just a temporary glitch? Perhaps batteries will miraculously recharge themselves? Perhaps beeping not so annoying? 
3. Smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector keeps beeping. 
4. Me: \"Honey, can you please change the battery on that thing?\" Honey: \"Yes!\" 
5. Smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector continues to beep. 
6. Max starts to stare at the beeping smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector. Sabrina: \"What's that sound?\" Me: \"DADDY needs to change the battery on the smoke alarm/carbon monoxide detector. RIGHT, DADDY?!\" Daddy: \"Yes!\" 
7. Smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector keeps right on beeping until I grab the stepladder, change the damn battery myself and grumble about it to Honey Daddy for the next day or so. 
 
That long-running campaign, Change Your Clock Change Your Battery, is a whole lot better than our method: It encourages people to change the batteries on their smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors every fall, when daylight savings time ends (that's tomorrow, in case you've been living in a cave and/or are a mom with way too much info cluttering up your brain). 
 
 
Want a sexy replacement for your dowdy smoke alarm, one that will give it a shot at making People magazine's annual list of Best Dressed Smoke Alarms? The Energizer people gave me two of these extremely glam First Alert ones (plus a two-pack of 9-volt batteries) to give away. 
 
To enter, leave a comment about what you're going to do with the extra hour of time you'll be getting. I'm thinking sit on the couch and stare vacantly into space. 
 
Word, Energizer donates 200,000 batteries to local fire departments nationwide. They'll donate up to 400,000 if you visit the  Energizer Bunny Facebook page,  click on the CYCCYB tab and pledge to change your smoke alarm batteries. Sadly, there is no pledge that might encourage husbands to change batteries. 
 
This giveaway ends Saturday 10/13 at 11:59 EST, and is for U.S. and Canadian residents who don't live in caves, where it would be very tricky to install a smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector. I'll randomly choose two winners, announce them here, email you and alert People magazine. 
 
Oh, and you can still  enter to win those cupcakes  until Nov 10. 
 
 Oh, and be sure to leave your email if it's not visible on your blog. 
 
Coming up next: I'll be giving away a husband who replaces smoke alarm and carbon detector batteries without pestering. First, though, I need to fine one. 
 
 And the winners are...  The Henrys and Homemaker. As my mom likes to say, use the alarm in good health.

When I  say I have done nothing all day I do not mean this 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
But this 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This morning I have done the following 
 
 Showered and dressed and fed Missy 
 Washed and dressed and fed myself 
 Picked up and cleared away all the rubbish, dirty dishes and dirty clothes 
 Washed a load of clothes 
 Washed a load of dishes 
 Cleared and cleaned the kitchen sink and table 
 
 
And yet if asked, I would say  I had done nothing. 
 
My house still looks like a pinata filled with books and toys and clothes to be ironed and  DUST has exploded in every room of my house ! 
I truly believe that a new view on reality hits you when you have a child with autism and even if Anthea or Kim & Aggie wouldn't set foot in your house, 
you don't really care :)

 Sleep and Medication Leelo is no longer on Fukalin. We took him off five days ago, once Supervisor M confirmed that she had all required data for his functional assessment/behavioral plan. We'll start Stratifera next week, probably. Since then he had a few extra-tired days of going to sleep earlier than usual, but also a couple of mornings of waking up unfairly early. Last night, though, he went to bed on time and didn't wake up until 6:00 this morning. He is also waking up with big poops, and sometimes having them in the night -- probably because he is eating so much at the moment. This may not be related to medication; he has always had phases where he can't get enough to eat. Currently he is snarfing up to five PB & J sandwiches per day, plus croissants, bananas, cheerios, etc. It is a good thing Spring has arrived, because we can resume neighborhood walks and hikes. I'd like him to burn up some of that food energy rather than getting chubbier or shunting it all straight into mutiple dirty daily pullups. We are also working on Mali's sleep schedule. Two nights ago she missed her nap and so fell asleep at 7:00 in the middle of her dinner. She slept up until I woke her at 7:00 the next morning, which I took as an opportunity to readjust her daily clock. Last night I took her to bed with me at 9:00. She went to sleep, finally, at 9:45--which is greatly preferable to 11 PM or 12:30 PM, even though I missed out on evening free time. (I figure Seymour and I can alternate evenings until we get her trained to go down at this much more humane hour.) So, Mali slept in my bed, Leelo slept in his old bed in Iz's room, and Iz happily slept in Leelo's new bed in his new room. Right now getting them to sleep is more important than where they sleep.

			 Oh crap. It's croup. Poor guy was coughing so hard he threw up. He's sleeping quietly now, with the vaporizer on full blast. We may be in for a long night...

 This is what my bedroom looks like. Right. Sad but true: I consider sleeping late a major accomplishment. Dave let me sleep in this morning, and I woke up at 11. The kitchen was a holy mess from breakfast, but OK, I couldn't be an ingrate. I got a whole 11 hours of sleep, and felt amazing all day. Ever get to sleep late?

 It was Thursday morning, a good seven minutes before Ben’s bus is supposed to arrive.  He was still in the tub.  It was time to rush… 
 I don’t have a good relationship with time.  You know how there’s those people who always seem to know what time it is, who can even wake themselves up exactly when they need to.  I’m like the exact opposite.  I can lose track of time easier than I can lose my car keys.  And, unlike my car keys, I cannot designate a place to keep time so I always know where it is. 
 Using Sunday as a guidepost, I managed to make sure I was awake during the day on Monday and again on Tuesday.  Tuesday I got flipped and it wasn’t even my fault.  Ben refused to go to sleep.  Even though he was content to play (almost) quietly in his room, I couldn’t let myself fall asleep.  I lay in bed, resting, but the mother in me just couldn’t sleep and leave Ben unsupervised. 
 In the morning, he was chipper as could be, revving up for his day.  I was dead on my feet, canceled my morning appointment, and crashed for a good long while—seven whole hours.  By the time I woke up, I’d completely forgotten that it was Wednesday.  So, that night, as I pushed to get the boys into bed so I could get some work done, I forgot all about their baths.  I didn’t even dawn on me after the boys grew rather grumbly about going to bed.  It’s not like either Alex or Ben would come out and say, “Hey, Mom!  We can’t go to bed yet, because it’s Wednesday and we want our baths!  We love our baths!”  Nope, they were simply uncooperative and resistant, because I was doing it wrong. 
 It wasn’t until about two o’clock in the morning that I figured it out.  So, I planned to do their baths first thing in the morning.  I’d be awake, and they usually woke up early enough that we could do baths as long as I didn’t let them linger. 
 Alex’s bath went off without a hitch.  He wasn’t nearly so grumbly about  this  change in routine.  After all, he loves the water.  Ben’s bath seemed to go fine…until the bus showed up seven minutes early.  I really need to get me one of those internal clock thingamajees.

Mop kitchen floor to remove sticky residue from 2 quarts of spilled lemonade. 2. clean kitchen, refrigerator and bathrooms 3. finish laundry 4. find luggage 5. find list of things to pack 6. pack 7. figure out the online check-in thingy. 8. sleep? Nik is at work finishing a few things. I have 6 work-related e-mails to send. And we haven't even begun preparing for our trip tomorrow.

 Mali slept from 12:30 A.M. to 7 A.M. this morning. Aaaaigh, something must be wrong! Or perhaps it's just the warm cozy benefits of co-sleeping? She'd also gotten herself from her back to her tummy sometime during the evening.

 Bad Timing, Leelo Things are getting really nutty around here what with cleaning and purging and repairing and prepping our house to be not our house anymore. And Leelo is picking up on it. And has refused to go to sleep before 10:30 for the past five nights. He is awake right now, cackling in his bed like a lunatic. At this very moment I am supposed to be getting the house ready so that realtors can come by in the morning and help our own realtor figure out what this place is actually worth (which, for many reasons, I hope is close to what our realtor originally estimated). I have been working very very hard over the past week or so to be methodical in my pre-moving preparations so as to avoid the ol' \"Sweep everything into a box to be sorted out later,\" but given how tired I am and how not-tired Leelo is and the lack of free time I had during the day, I might just have to wake up early and start piling crap in boxes to hide in my closet. Damn it all. Technorati Tags:  autism ,  autistic

 Sleep is a peculiar thing.  You’d think it would come naturally.  I’m sure, for some people, it does.  But not for me and not for many of the people I know. 
 A  circadian rhythm  refers to a natural, biological process attuned to the 24-hour day/night cycle of the earth.  In theory, human beings sleep according to a circadian rhythm that attunes them to the day/night cycle.  We sleep best at night and are most alert during the day.  The night shift, of course, changed that for some.  Others, myself included, faced life challenges that disrupted their circadian rhythms. 
 Though the boys have gotten much better at sleeping at night, not to mention sleeping long enough to get a good rest, I have found restoring my circadian rhythms much more difficult.  My body tends to slide through the week. 
 For example, last week I was so far behind on my work and coursework, I shorted myself on sleep and tried to be awake during the nights so I could have a longer period of uninterrupted work.  I was firmly entrenched in this cycle by the end of Wednesday, which had repercussions I’ll discuss in my next post.  I spent the week working at odd hours, sleeping at odd hours, and my sleep was definitely not cyclic in nature. 
 This week I’ve committed myself to a day schedule.  I spent my day of rest (Sunday), resting up from my wee-hour work day on Saturday, eschewing caffeine, and going to bed early (for me) on Sunday night.  I woke refreshed this morning and ready for a full day—at least, I hope so!  Yet, despite the best of intentions, I suspect I’ll slide back into an irregular schedule by the end of the week. 
 What’s decidedly worse is that I tend to rely on external chemicals in order to get to sleep regardless of when I do it.  I take between 6 – 10 mg. of melatonin and a full-strength OTC sleeping pill (the equivalent of two Tylenol PM pills, without the acetaminophen).  And that’s when I’m already quite tired and feeling “ready to sleep.”  When that is insufficient, I usually add a third melatonin to push me over the edge of consciousness into sleep.  Most of the time, it works.  But sometimes it doesn’t.   Usually, I’m up and alert after 5 – 7 hours of sleep.  Only when I am unwell can I get the 8 or 9 hours people tend to claim we need. 
 Mark, on the other hand, will take a full-strength OTC sleeping pill on the nights he can’t sleep and sleep for 12 hours straight—and he’ll sleep hard!  I find myself facilitating from envy to resentment, wondering how he can manage to stay asleep so long.  Seeing that neither envy nor resentment are good qualities/emotions, I try to put off such feelings and instead embrace with gratitude his willingness to cope with my sleeping peculiarities, so that (most of the time) I can sleep when I need to regardless of the time of day.

A Case of the Shreds
" "
Joy loves her pillow, the one she sleeps with in her tented crib. As in, I mean she luuuuuvs her pillow.  I think the word I'm looking for is... well, humping.  Although her senior  barista  tactfully refers to it as \"making friends with her pillow.\" This pillow-relationship seems to have entered a new phase this week, however.  As the week progressed, I started to notice that her threadbare old pillowcase was starting to collect little rips.  I threw it out, only to have the phenomenon happen a second time with another old pillowcase.  So I tossed that one too, and this morning pulled out one from the JoyParents' regular pillowcase rotation. Here's what she did to her parents' pillowcase during naptime today: Sometimes love really hurts! We're going to try a flannel pillowcase tonight. Wish us luck.

 Oh, Poop 
 
 Seymour and I were having a quiet moment together before the house awoke. I heard, and Seymour saw, the pants- and diaper-free Leelo as he trotted past our door and up the stairs, but as we were disinclined to get out of bed we figured he'd be fine for two minutes. 
 
 Oh no. Seymour went up to get him after those two minutes had elapsed, and there was shit everywhere--on the couch and the carpet. Thankfully the floor was relatively clear of the usual piles of books and toys, so the mess could be handled with sponges and our much-abused steam cleaner.
 
 Since we try very hard to be optimists, I am pleased that he's showing awareness of his bodily functions. I believe he took off his drawers because he needed to do his business, and didn't want it in his diaper where he'd have to sit on it. So, yay. But double yay when he figures out that it's best placed in the potty, not on the floor and his legs.

Not What I Had In Mind
" "
So this has been a sleep-deprived week at the Joy household.  I wrote about the ridiculous lack of sleep over the church retreat weekend, starting with Rose waking me at 4am Saturday with a tooth that had fallen out, then 20 straight hours awake partying at the retreat, then 2 1/2 hours of sleep and not much more than dozing the rest of Saturday night... Catching up from that big deprivation wasn't going well.  Joy did a lot of night wakings this past week, of the kind in which she wakes at 2:30 or 3am and starts enjoying herself in the crib, with loud comments.  Sometimes she'll snooze again at 5am, sometimes she just stays awake.  And then she doesn't nap!  As you can imagine, the big people have a hard time sleeping through this too. Finally on Friday night I had a good solid 8-hour night.  It would have been longer (Joy slept till we woke her at 7am, eleven hours!) but I had bell practice all morning and we needed to get a week's worth of groceries before I left. Oh, how I was hoping for a solid night last night, to consolidate my rest and make the world right! But Rose came to my bedside at 2:30.  \"My tummy doesn't feel good.\"  I staggered out of bed, gave her some simethicone, and sent her back to her room.  Ten minutes later, she was back.  \"I threw up all over my bed,\" she reported. Aughh.  Got her moved onto the couch with a barf bucket, stripped her bed, started the laundry... and woke up Joy.  Who didn't go back to sleep.  But that was the least of the worries. Rose, wide awake, wanted a video.  So we curled up on the couch to watch, and she then started heaving at intervals of 10 or 15 minutes.  I lost count of how many trips I made to dump the bucket. Eventually she was tired enough to sleep, thought the barfing was done, go to bed Mommy, I'll stay on the couch.  So I gratefully hauled back to bed, about 4am this was.  Ten minutes later, she's at my side.  She'd whoopsed again, and without my help she didn't get the bucket in time.  So now I have another load of laundry to do, and I'm back out to the living room.  To lie down on the floor, since Rose is now using the whole couch.  She was so tired she actually did nap, but the ten-minute intervals continued, with me on duty listening for the gagging since she couldn't position the bucket in her sleep. Finally JoyDad got up after 5 sometime.  I put him on bucket duty and wearily crawled away to bed.  I did get to \"sleep in\" at that point.  And the last bucket, that I dumped just as he was getting up, was (wonder of wonders!) the last retch.  He didn't have to oversee a single one.  Lucky, lucky dude. Despite a few hours of morning sleep, I don't feel much rested. This was not what I had in mind. UPDATE:  Well, just when I get a good self-indulgent whine on, I read something that makes me count my blessings.  Prayers for Nik and his mama over at  Maternal Instincts .  They're having a rough time right now, and sleep deprivation is just part of it.

Top 10 Things to Do Rather Than Finish Your Manuscript
" "
 
 
 
 
10. Clean the garage that hasn't been cleaned in almost 8 years. 
 
9. While you're in there, sweep. 
 
8. Once you've swept, time to hose everything down. 
 
7. Don't actually remove anything, just hose it all - it'll eventually dry. 
 
6. Take all the things that are now wet, that you've decided you don't need, and immediately load them into your car to go to Goodwill. 
 
5. Ditto with the recycling. 
 
4. Stop what you're doing and drive to both Goodwill and the recycling center. 
 
3. Come home and not really be in the mood to finish anymore. 
 
2. Finish anyway. 
 
1. Start in on the outdoor toy box.

Autism Can End Lives: Wandering and Drowning
" "
 Those  who don't believe that autism can be a deadly disorder, who believe that wandering from home and drowning  is not a problem that should be associated with autism, will want to skip reports of yet another death by drowning of an autistic child that wandered from the safety of his home.  This time the drowning occurred in Cushing, Oklahoma. As reported on  Oklahoma's Own,  NewsOn6 .com the child's death has been ruled accidental after investigation by the Department of Human Services and the State Medical Examiner's Office: 
 \" Death Of Autistic Boy In Cushing Ruled Accidental ... criminal charges will not be filed as a result of the death of 4-year-old Blake Murrell.  Murrell drowned in a pond within Memorial Park in Cushing on April 19. His body was found hours after he was reported missing from the family's home nearby. The D.A.'s office says a thorough investigation was conducted by the Cushing Police Department, the Department of Human Services and the State Medical Examiner's Office.   A statement released by Lee's office states \"the evidence gathered does not justify the filing of criminal charges.

"A petition is hosted on Change.org:  The MA State Senate: Please Stop Painful Electric Shocks on Students at JRC in Massachusetts!   The Judge Rotenberg Center uses electric shocks as part of their program for some of the students in their care.  The JRC is not allowed to use these aversives on new students, but still continues with students whose programs included them before the order (see Left Brain/Right Brain story:  Judge Rotenberg Center banned from shocking new admissions ) The Change.org petition was created by a former JRC employee.   Hi, my name is Gregory Miller. I used to work at a school in Massachusetts named The Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) where we used powerfully painful electric shock devices (45 – 91 milliamps, at 66 volts) on students to control their behaviors. These devices are much stronger than police stun guns (1-4 milliamps). Unlike stun guns, the electrodes most commonly used at school are spaced 3 – 4 inches apart so that the electrical volts passing through the flesh create the maximum amount of pain with those amps and volts. The United Nations is aware of JRC, has called these shocks at JRC “torture”, and says that “The prohibition of torture is absolute.” Please see the attached video of a student named Andre getting shocked at JRC, covered by Fox News. Historically, the JRC has been very careful about what information is allowed to be seen by outsiders.  Case in point, the video included in the court case which is reported in the video Mr. Miller references (and embedded below).  The JRC fought to keep that video from being used in court (see Left Brain/Right Brain story  Judge Rotenberg Center: Teen tied and shocked for hours; mom calls it “torture” ). Here is the news video mentioned above.  Be forwarned: it is painful to watch.  Nothing like what Andre McCollins had to go through. Mr. McCollins was strapped down, face down, and repeatedly shocked while screaming repeatedly “no” and “help me”.   You can hear the attorney say,  “that was shock number 16 or 17, out of 31 that day”. You can see the JRC attorney explaining that “the treatment plan was followed”.   Is that really justification for what went on? Not for me. At about 2:10 into the video, you can see him shocked again while at a workstation.  The shocks have been called equivalent to a bee sting by JRC personnel.  That doesn’t seem like an accurate description to what happened to Mr. mcCollins.

In  Autism Rights Group: Asperger’s Does Not Explain Newtown School Massacre  CBS cites the  ARW press release . Including this paragraph: “The search for answers should not be a search for a scapegoat. Autism is no excuse or explanation to evil. Being ‘autistic,’ ‘odd,’ ‘awkward,’ ‘camera shy,’ a ‘nerd’ and ‘uncomfortable with others’ does not cause a person to become a mass murderer,” the organization said in the release. “Autistic persons are more likely to be victims, rather than perpetrators of violence. Autism Rights Watch urges the public and the media outlets not to stigmatize the autistic persons and their families. They already are facing segregation and prejudices on a daily basis.”

Amnesty International:  Police Use of Taser Convenes International Standards
" "
 Amnesty International has criticized the use by police forces of TASER weapons as contraventions  of international standards  prohibiting torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as well as standards set out under the United Nations (UN) Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by law Enforcement Officials.  Amnesty has also asked that force should be used as a last resort and that officers must apply only the minimum amount of force necessary to obtain a lawful objective. They also provide that all use of force must be proportionate to the threat posed as well as designed to avoid unwarranted pain or injury.   Amnesty International has  called on law enforcement agencies to suspend all use of electro-shock weapons, pending an urgent rigorous independent and impartial inquiry into their use and effects. Other recommendations  include recommendations for the immediate control and limitation on the use of the taser by forces who continue to deploy such weapons.

Ken brought the story here to LeftBrainRightBrain in  Videos show rape of disabled women, police seek help to ID attackers .  CNN is now reporting that one of the victims has been identified and one suspect is in custody:  L.A. authorities find first victim in videotaped sexual assaults . Investigators have found the first victim in the videotaped sexual assaults of severely disabled women, and the woman alleges a suspect already in custody had raped her in a Los Angeles care home, authorities said. 
 The woman, 25, now resides in another Los Angeles County residential care facility. Her medical condition causes her to be physically defenseless, Los Angeles County sheriff’s investigators said. Having found one of the victims, they were able to obtain information on an alleged attacker: The woman, found by state investigators Monday, made the sexual assault allegation against Ernie Lloyd, 27, who had turned himself in Saturday following widespread media coverage of the videotaped sexual assaults and a manhunt for four suspects depicted in police sketches. Lloyd was charged with rape of a person with disabilities Saturday after he “implicated himself,” authorities said.

Knipstrom Death - POSSIBILITY That Police Use of Force Could Have Been A Factor
" "
When did Canada become a country in which police forces killed so many of its citizens and visitors?  And when did the police in this country depart from the common sense and plain language which forms the currency of every day life in this country? Canada.com reports in  RCMP to probe death of B.C. man days after Taser arrest    that RCMP in British Columbia will probe the death this morning of Robert Thurston Knipstrom, 36, four days after he was  pepper-sprayed ,  Tasered  and  hit with a baton  i n an altercation with police . A police release announcing the probe stated that \"\" Because of the  possibility  that the police use of force could have been a factor in the individual's medical injuries, the RCMP began the in-custody-related investigative protocols from the very beginning, \" A 36 year old man dies 4 days after being pepper-sprayed, Tasered and hit with a baton in an altercation with police and the official police statement talks about the  possibility  that police use of force  could  have been  a factor  in his injuries?   No kidding.

 This story of abuse and betrayal as reported in the Toronto Star is disgusting and horrifying beyond belief.  These are acts of evil, pure evil. The only bright light in this dark and true story? The child is reported to have recovered significantly since being placed with Children's Aid. Mother, 6 men accused in abuse of girl   Molesters gave crack cocaine to 12-year-old, police allege May 04, 2007 04:30 AM Henry Stancu Staff Reporter Six men and the mother of a 12-year-old developmentally challenged girl have been charged in what police call a \"horrendous\" case of child sexual abuse. Investigators allege the victim was given crack cocaine for various sex acts at her Rexdale home by numerous men over the course of a year. \"It's something I don't think many of us in policing have seen and many in the community are quite frankly going to be outraged,\" said Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner. Youth bureau officers from 23 division station in Etobicoke began probing the case on Jan. 2, focusing on a unit in a housing complex near Rexdale Blvd. and Hwy. 27. Police learned a developmentally delayed girl living with her mother was being routinely molested in the home that served as a safe haven, or crack house, for users and dealers of cocaine and other drugs. \"It was some very horrendous acts that were taking place on this poor victim. My information is that it was going on quite frequently,\" Taverner said. A medical examination of the child revealed cocaine in her system. \"I think we're all outraged that these sort of things are taking place. This shouldn't be happening in our society,\" added Taverner. On Tuesday, police arrested the girl's 42-year-old mother, who cannot be identified to protect the child's privacy. Investigators had to get the provincial attorney general's consent to charge the woman with the rare infraction of corrupting children. \"It took several months to get that permission,\" Taverner said. Because police had only street names when they began tracking down suspects, and because it took time to apply for the child corruption charge, investigators were unable to move more swiftly on the allegations. The young victim is in the care of the Toronto Children's Aid Society and has \"has improved immensely\" already, said Taverner. More suspects are being sought in the attacks on the girl, police said. Those currently charged are: Harold Cover, 55, of Mississauga; sexual assault, sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching and trafficking cocaine. Radcliffe Parchment, 19, of Toronto; sexual assault, sexual interference, and invitation to sexual touching. Muralee Balasubramaniam, 50, no fixed address; sexual assault, sexual interference, weapons dangerous, an assault with intent to resist arrest. Neil Rose, 44, of Brampton; sexual assault and sexual interference. Dennis Guthrie, 52, of Whitby; sexual assault and sexual interference. Linton Lewis, 47, of Brampton; sexual assault and sexual interference.

 “This is worse than a nightmare,” Cheryl McCollins said about her disabled son, Andre. “It is horrific. And poor Andre, who had to suffer through this, and not know why.”  
 The ordeal began after Andre hit a staff member. Inside a classroom, as a camera was recording, he was tied to a restraint board, face down, a helmet over his head.  
 He stayed like that for seven hours without a break, no food, no water, or trips to the bathroom. Each time he screamed or tensed up, he was shocked, 31 times in all. His mother called the next day to check on him.  
 “I said, ‘Andre.’ I said, ‘Hello.’ And so he said, ‘Help me,'” McCollins said. “help me” Andre spent 7 hours strapped to a board, shocked 31 times.  As a result he ended up hospitalized.   The mother wants the video of the incident made public.  JRC wants to keep the video sealed.

She says that she feared the child “would emotionally and financially ‘ruin’ her life”.  She has been declared insane and will not be prosecuted. A mother who allegedly smothered her six month old son because she feared he had autism will not face a murder charge.                  
 Prosecutors said they doubt if they could prove Stephanie Rochester was sane at the time of the killing. and An arrest warrant for the 2010 killing revealed that Rochester feared her son had autism and tried to suffocate him with a plastic bag at their home in Superior, Colorado. 
 When that failed she used blankets to end his life. 
 The arrest warrant revealed Rochester had wanted to kill herself but did not want to ‘burden’ her husband with an autistic child. 
 Rochester told detectives that she thought having an autistic child would emotionally and financially ‘ruin’ her life.

"21141" "35" "https://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/10/reading-while-black-and-autistic-leads-to-arrest/" "Reading while black and autistic leads to arrest" "Reginald Latson, an 18-year-old Virginia man with Asperger’s syndrome, faces one count of malicious wounding of a law enforcement officer, one  count of assault and battery of a law enforcement officer, and one count  of knowingly disarming a police officer in performance of his official  duties, following an incident in a high school  parking lot. Stafford County deputies received a report of an armed person outside of a library, which prompted a  lock down of six schools in Stafford County, including a high school. From WJLA in Washington, DC : Stafford County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Bill Kennedy says it all  began at 8:38 a.m. with the report of an armed person in the parking lot  of a library across from Park Ridge Elementary. The threat prompted a  lockdown of six schools in Stafford County, including the high school,  which is separated from the library and elementary school area by a  wooded area. 
 Kennedy says deputies saturated the area after the call. About 20  minutes later, a Stafford High School resource officer spotted a man  matching the description of the lookout. While the man was being  questioned, he became irate and attacked the school resource officer,  who is also a sheriff’s deputy, investigators said. 
 The man repeatedly struck the deputy, who pepper-sprayed the man,  according to the Sheriff’s office. During the struggle, the assailant  was able to wrest the pepper spray for the deputy and sprayed him,  investigators said. 
 The man then fled. The deputy, Thomas Calverley, suffered head  laceration, cuts, abrasions and a broken ankle. He was scheduled for  surgery on the ankle this afternoon. 
 Latson was located in the woods about 45 minutes later by a canine  officer and his dog, Vader. Investigators never found a gun, and now say  the initial caller never actually saw a weapon. 
 Latson is currently being held at the Rappahannock Regional Jail  under no bond. You can read more about the case at  this website  started by Neli’s family. “The actions that were taken by the police that day were excessive in the least and grossly mishandled,” writes Neli’s mother. “Someone says I see a suspicious black male and he “could” have a gun, while all my son was doing was sitting in the grass at the library.  And you shut down six schools and go out on a manhunt for this dangerous black man who was sitting in the grass.  Anyone reading this story can read between the lines and see that this just doesn’t add up.” You can read the Stafford County Sheriff Dept. news release  here .

Horrific Abuse of California Man With Severe Autism

  CBSLA photo as Shown on the NY Daily News  
 
 Shows Horrifying Abuse of Man with Severe Autism 
 
 
 KCBS-TV  Los Angeles  \"Mom Sickened\" and the  New York Daily News  \"Tantamount to Torture\" report a story of horrific, torturous abuse by professional caregivers of a 31 year old autistic man with the reported mental age of a 3 year old.  The incredible abuse was discovered after the man's mother noted bruising on his body and installed cameras which recorded the abuse.  The CBS video report follows but as CBS cautions this is disturbing especially if you are the parent, as I am, of a son or daughter with severe autism:

 
 
 
 
 
 
 



While the depravity of this abuse may be unprecedented similar abuse has been reported in the past.  Security cameras unknown to the abusers have been the most reliable way of bringing such abuse into the light of day.  In 2007 in a New York group home  a severely autistic woman was beaten by attendants , abuse which was only discovered by cameras. 


These are incidents where cameras caught the abuse of persons with severe autism and intellectual challenges, persons who could not speak up for themselves.  The odds are good that where those cameras are not present similar abuses will occur and will go unreported.  
 
 
Cameras are the only protection many severely challenged persons with autism will have and should be mandatory in all facilities and homes where care is provided for those who can not speak for themselves.

Severe autism realities must not be ignored, can not be ignored.  If we ignore these realities, if we fail to protect our loved ones who can not protect or speak up for themselves we are abandoning them to cruel fates.  Steps must be taken to ensure they live in decent, safe conditions.

In it, a former resident of the Judge Rotenberg Center is interviewed Jennifer Msumba is on the autism spectrum. For seven years, she was treated at the Judge Rotenberg Center in Canton, Massachusetts, where she received painful electric shocks aimed at modifying her behavior. She describes being strapped, spread-eagle to a restraint board and shocked multiple times before she left the center in 2009. 
 “It’s so scary. I would ask God to make my heart stop because I didn’t want to live when that was happening to me. I just wanted to die and make it stop,” she told CBS News correspondent Anna Werner in an interview at her mother’s home outside Boston. “I thought, they won’t be able to hurt me anymore.” There is  video of an extended interview with Ms. Msumba .  Unfortunately, the embed code doesn’t work on this blog, but that video is  here . The FDA is considering whether the electric shocks should continue.  CBS reports that decision is due shortly. —

Fredericton  Police,  Tasers And Autistic  Persons
" "
 Fredericton police will now be armed with TASERS.  Fredericton City Council has voted to authorize the purchase of the stun guns with the \"  high-voltage charge that temporarily shocks unruly individuals and allows police to disable them. \" (Daily Gleaner, December 23, 2006).  Unfortunately for autistic persons, including some autistic persons with low IQ's,  they can sometimes be perceived as unruly and dangerous by police authorities.   And TASERS  are dangerous weapons.   As the Gleaner stated: \" \" Taser use remains controversial.   The Canada Safety Council in 2005 said that 50 people in the United States died between 2002 and 2005 after receiving Taser shocks.   In Canada in 2005, there were five deaths after police used stun guns, including one in Moncton, although the Canada Safety Council hastened to add that the Taser was not named as the cause of death in those cases.\" [Not named as the cause of death following TASER Fire? - If a heart stops beating after being fired upon by a TASER ; heart failure might be the medical cause but surely the TASER fire should be a suspect in bringing about the cause of death? - HLD] http://www.canadaeast.com/ce2/docroot/article.php?articleID=83625 Rendering a person unable to use their muscle systems to prevent falling or to allow falling in a protective manner victims of TASER  attacks are vulnerable to injuries such as head injuries when falling on a  hard surface such as a curb or road.  Concerns have been expressed around the world about the indiscriminate use of these high voltage weapons and about their use on persons with autism and other mental disabilities.  Hopefully the Fredericton City Police training will include training to recognize behavior characteristic of such persons and how to deal with them - short of firing upon them with TASERS.\" From New Zealand: \"  Injuries to officers highlight taser dangers Keith Locke MP , Green Party Police Spokespon 13th September 2006 Green Party Police Spokesperson Keith Locke has written to the Police Minister asking her to reconsider her support for the taser trial following a disclosure that three New Zealand police officers had been injured during tests.  Two officers had received minor flesh injuries, and one was dazed after falling badly.  “Taser victims often ‘fall badly’ because they have no muscular control to cushion the impact,” Mr Locke says.  “Presumably the dazed officer was tasered on a soft surface, unlike many taser victims, who will knock their head on a hard road, a curb, or a protruding object.  “Overseas, such falls have caused death or serious injury. On June 4, 2004 Jerry Pickens was tasered in Bridge City, Louisiana. He fell backward, hit his head on his driveway, went into a coma and died.  “The taser is also dangerous to people with heart conditions, or those whose cardio-vascular system is affected by drugs. The police ‘guinea pigs’ would have been fit and healthy, unlike many of the people they will be tasering on the street.  “I have written to Police Minister Annette King to ask her to reconsider whether the trial should go ahead in the light of this new evidence,” Mr Locke says.  “The risk to the public is too great to justify the continued use of this weapon.”     http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/PR10152.html From Illinois: Ill. teen shot by police stun gun dies The Associated Press          JERSEYVILLE, Ill.- A teenager carrying a Bible and shouting \"I want Jesus\" was shot twice with a police stun gun and later died at a St. Louis hospital, authorities said.   In a statement obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press, police in Jerseyville, about 40 miles north of St. Louis, said 17-year-old Roger Holyfield would not acknowledge officers who approached him and he continued yelling, \"I want Jesus.\"   Police tried to calm the teen, but Holyfield became combative, according to the statement. Officers fired the stun gun at him after he ignored their warnings, then fired again when he continued struggling, police said.   Holyfield was flown to St. Louis' Cardinal Glennon Hospital after the confrontation Saturday; he died there Sunday, police said. http://www.policeone.com/less-lethal/articles/1188114 From Oregon: 12/21/2006 By Maxine Bernstein, The Oregonian The Oregonian    When Portland police encountered Sir J. Millage walking barefoot and shirtless in the chill December dawn, carrying what appeared to be a stick or metal rod, they thought he \"might be unstable and possibly violent.\"          Witnesses who had spotted Millage walking amid traffic across the Broadway Bridge told police they thought the 5-foot-10 inch, 260-pound person was around 25. An officer later was struck by his \"fixed gaze,\" as if he was looking \"right through\" him. He did not respond to shouted orders to drop his stick, and, according to the officer, waved it in a threatening manner.  One officer fired four Taser shots at Millage, and then another struck him six times with his baton because he wouldn't stay on the ground. They thought Millage was high on drugs.   Millage's great-grandmother and legal guardian, Pastor Mary Overstreet Smith, said Millage didn't respond to police because he's autistic.   He's also 15 years old and can hardly talk. She said she can't understand what led to the use of physical force that Dec. 5 morning and is sickened by what occurred.   \"He can't speak for himself. It tears me up when I read this,\" she said, flipping through the police report. \"I just feel like what they did was unwarranted.\" http://www.policeone.com/investigations/articles/1198516/ As the father of a 10 year old autistic boy with limited verbal skills this story from Oregon is particularly disturbing to me as I contemplate Fredericton City police officers patrolling city streets armed with TASERS.  I hope that our good officers are receiving training not just in firing TASERS but in recognizing characteristics of persons with autism and other mental disorders so that they do not mistake them for \"unruly\" criminals.  And I hope that their excitement  expressed by Police union represenetative Cst. Currie does not become an excitability and eagerness to use these new and dangerous weapons: \"Const. Ralph Currie, president of Fredericton Police UBC Local 911, said the union supports Taser use.   \"The feeling is it's an absolutely necessary tool in our business ... We're excited about the fact that we're moving forward,\" Currie said.\"

"31252" "46" "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/19/things-that-make-you-say-hmn/" "Things that make you say, “Hmn…”" "Fresh news story  about the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center from the Associated Press: The security camera videotapes of recent incidents at the JRC were destroyed, despite direct orders for them to be saved.  The incidents involved two students who were wrongly given numerous electrical shocks by staff members, as a result of prank phone calls. One student was shocked 77 times and the other 29 times after a prank caller posing as a supervisor ordered the treatments at a Judge Rotenberg Educational Center group home in August. The boys are 16 and 19 years old and one was treated for first-degree burns. 
 The Disabled Persons Protection Commission planned to release the report Tuesday concluding that one of the teenagers was severely physically and emotionally abused by the treatments. The commission has referred the case to the Norfolk district attorney’s office. One of the Commission’s investigators had requested  copies of the tapes because they were needed to complete a report. But school officials declined, saying they “did not want any possibility of the images getting into the media.” The investigator told the school to preserve a copy so state police could use it in their criminal investigation. A trooper later told the investigator the tapes had been destroyed. Amazing how often tapes of alarming or incriminating events get erased ( Watergate ) or destroyed ( waterboarding ). State Sen. Brian Joyce, who has long sought to ban shock therapy from the school, said Israel and his staff should be investigated for obstruction of justice. 
 “I believe the tape was intentionally destroyed because it was incriminating,” said Joyce, a Democrat. “I intend to ask the attorney general to investigate.” " 0.000168221094921945 0.0140316074491989 0.000663738887937434 0.0335091430705999 7.81049937351017e-05 0.086721206338088 0.000389619693014399 0.000640622068994824 0.000273274355262128 0.000202982553267211 0.000296935436062401 0.000133545173255181 0.000354440562179622 0.000230279081803461 0.000259372795314063 0.00103668311707311 0.000456175194557212 0.00741262892588906 0.00244036296752997 0.000493427675893082 0.000217580008121267 0.00097827072307756 0.000528438397801939 0.00032278967392549 0.000438663038618822 0.113083002146303 0.0958208917788278 0.00115365990379887 0.000331068089632662 0.000377935854244893 0.000310442734678128 0.000226687511865505 0.000980762356937558 0.0005058450608623 0.00132157778836954 0.000201073537412775 0.000367530939145499 0.000236360949630833 0.0600345802796348 0.00140726652595511 0.0086293548363066 0.000177839011544486 0.000678798004777754 0.000166175792887911 0.000173402758198251 0.00045558211901739 0.000949682157359904 0.557992937929546 0.000479932559819209 0.00165949609712088

Conor Is Safe Now But We Almost Lost Our Buddy: THANK YOU To ALL Who Saved Him!

In mid-April, pursuant to a neurologist's advice, we started Conor on Lamotrogine, an anti-eleptic drug which is reputed to have benefited many people suffering from seizure activity.  Hours after receiving his third dosage Conor suffered his second Grand Mal seizure, that we know of, since his first in November 2012.  Last week he became extremely drowsy and last Friday April 26, 2013, our family doctor recommended we reduce the dosage (the neurologist is out of town until May 13, 2013). Later, early Friday evening Conor's condition worsened noticeably and a rash had developed.  Rash development is a known warning sign of a negative Lamotrogine reaction and Conor was taken to the DECH (Doctor Everett Chalmers Hospital) emergency where he received immediate attention and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, the ICU.  Conor's reactions have been very serious with risks in several key categories including risk to his kidneys and liver. Thanks to our family doctor and the excellent care and attention of the Emergency and ICU personnel our Buddy is still with us. Without their help he probably would not be.  Conor is still in the ICU but is expected to transfer to pediatrics in the next day or two. He has improved dramatically.   
 
 
 
To everyone involved with protecting and saving our buddy Conor his Mom and Dad say THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU! 
 
 
 
PS. We can hardly wait for the phsyio and other necessary recovery interventions to give us back our Run, Jump, Fly Boy:

		 Many of you know WhyMommy. If you don’t, go ahead and click on the “Team WhyMommy” button over there on the right. She is a very cool chick; is a lot of fun to hang out with; has two small children, a husband, and a dog; and was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. As if she weren’t doing enough already, she has embarked on a public awareness campaign about her particular type of cancer: inflammatory breast cancer. She has written the post below and invited us all to steal and re-post it. Done and done. (Feel free to do the same from here.) 
 We hear a lot about breast cancer these days. One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetimes, and there are millions living with it in the U.S. today alone. But did you know that there is more than one type of breast cancer? 
 I didn’t. I thought that breast cancer was all the same. I figured that if I did my  monthly breast self-exams , and found no lump, I’d be fine. 
 Oops. It turns out that you don’t have to have a lump to have breast cancer. Six weeks ago, I went to my OB/GYN because my breast felt funny. It was red, hot, inflamed, and the skin looked…funny. But there was no lump, so I wasn’t worried. I should have been. After a round of antibiotics didn’t clear up the inflammation, my doctor sent me to a breast specialist and did a skin punch biopsy. That test showed that I have inflammatory breast cancer, a very aggressive cancer that can be deadly. 
 Inflammatory breast cancer  is often misdiagnosed as mastitis because many doctors have never seen it before and consider it rare. “Rare” or not, there are over 100,000 women in the U.S. with this cancer right now; only half will survive five years. Please call your OB/GYN if you experience several of the following symptoms in your breast, or any unusual changes: redness, rapid increase in size of one breast, persistent itching of breast or nipple, thickening of breast tissue, stabbing pain, soreness, swelling under the arm, dimpling or ridging (for example, when you take your bra off, the bra marks stay – for a while), flattening or retracting of the nipple, or a texture that looks or feels like an orange (called peau d’orange). Ask if your GYN is familiar with inflammatory breast cancer, and tell her that you’re concerned and want to come in to rule it out. 
 There is more than one kind of breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is the  most aggressive form of breast cancer  out there, and early detection is critical. It’s not usually detected by mammogram. It does not usually present with a lump. It may be overlooked with all of the changes that our breasts undergo during the years when we’re pregnant and/or nursing our little ones. It’s important not to miss this one. 
 Inflammatory breast cancer is detected by women and their doctors who notice a change in one of their breasts. If you notice a change, call your doctor today. Tell her about it. Tell her that you have a friend with this disease, and it’s trying to kill her. Now you know what I wish I had known before six weeks ago. 
 You don’t have to have a lump to have breast cancer.

 Awww, Baby's First Ear Infection Brought Mali to Dr. G because she still hasn't shaken lingering nasal congestion from that cold of 3+ weeks back. He says she's fine, but that she has an infection in her left ear. Since it is red but not bulging or oozing pus, he was amenable to calling in an antibiotic prescription, on the understanding that she doesn't need it now, but that I am to go get it if she becomes noticeably fussy or spikes a fever. *Sigh* I am having nightmarish flashback visions of Leelo and those 20+ ear infections before he was two. And I don't remember him getting sick until he was 6 months old. Anyone have ideas about natural ways to stop ear infections from progressing? Or things I can eat/do to help Mali's immune system go into overdrive?

 Two and a half hours ago Conor suffered his 3rd Tonic Clonic or Grand Mal seizure.  (A Year ago he also suffered an episode of rhabdomyolisis, a serious adverse reaction to his previous seizure medication).  On the previous 2 seizures Conor was in a room by himself when they started, this time he was with me in the living room after we had returned, together with his mother, from a trip to the Superstore.  I sat down in a chair in the living room and Conor came in and fell backwards like a tree falling in the woods.  Fortunately he fell into a soft, well cushioned chair and did not hit his head on anything hard or sharp. I thought at first he was joking but then I saw that the cheese which he had sought out at the Superstore had been flung across the room. I noticed then things were not right.   
 
 
 
His mom was home and together we moved him to the floor on his side with a soft pillow under his head.  When he spewed up fluid it went on to the pillow and a rolled up blanket we had also put under his head.  His body went into convulsions and he was unconscious for a period of 3-4 minutes.  We called 911 and they sent the emergency response team (thank you again 911 and EMT responders) and they measured his body temperature, took his blood pressure and heart beat and observed him for a period of time before agreeing that he could stay home wihout an emergency room visit this time.  They gave us signs of things to look for and be concerned about.  Conor has recovered more quickly this time than on previous occasions and he has been bouncing off the floor as always (and playing on Dad's computer).  
 
 
 
Seizures are more common in persons with autism than in the general population and even more common if the autistic person, like my son, also suffers from an intellectual disability.  This is stuff you don't hear often from those persons, high functioning autistics or their family members, who fight against the rights of people like my son to have a cure, who fight to prevent research into causes and treatments of autism and other neurological disorders including seizure disorders. 
 
 
 
To those people I say  you have no right to fight against cure oriented research .  If you are fortunate enough that your alleged autism is not a disorder from which you suffer, enjoy your business successes and your literary and lecturing careers and stop oppressing my son and others like him who actually suffer from autism disorders and the other cognitive, neurological and other disorders that so often accompany them.  
 
 
 
I am tired of listening to your complaining while my son suffers.

 Generalized tonic-clonic seizure is one type of seizure that involves the entire body. It is also called grand mal seizure. The terms  seizure , convulsion, or  epilepsy  are most often associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. 
 
 
 Causes 
 
 Generalized tonic-clonic seizures may occur in people of any age. They can occur once (single episode). Or they can occur as part of a repeated, chronic illness (epilepsy). Some seizures are due to psychological problems (psychogenic). 
 
 Symptoms 
 
 Many persons with generalized tonic-clonic seizures have vision, taste, smell, or sensory changes, hallucinations, or  dizziness  before the seizure. This is called an aura. 
 
 The seizures usually result in  rigid muscles . This is followed by violent  muscle contractions  and loss of alertness (consciousness ). Other symptoms that occur during the seizure may include: 
 
 Biting the cheek or tongue 
 Clenched teeth or jaw 
 Loss of urine or stool control (incontinence) 
 Stopped breathing  or  difficulty breathing 
 Blue skin color 
 
 
 After the seizure, the person may have: 
 
 Confusion 
 Drowsiness  or sleepiness that lasts for 1 hour or longer 
 Loss of memory (amnesia) about the seizure episode 
 Headache 
 Weakness of one side of the body for a few minutes to a few hours following seizure (called Todd paralysis) 
 
 
 Exams and Tests 
 
 The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. 
 
 An  EEG (electroencephalogram)  will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. 
 
 Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. 
 
 Head CT  or  MRI  scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. 
 
 Treatment 
 
 Treatment  for tonic-clonic seizures includes medications, changes in lifestyle for  adults  and children , such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options. 
 
 Alternative Names 
 
 Seizure - tonic-clonic; Seizure - grand mal; Grand mal seizure; Seizure - generalized

On Friday a parent posted this question on the BLOOM blog: 
 
 \"Is it routine to withdraw fluids and nutrition from infants in the NICU? That is what we were offered for our son in hospital after we removed the ventilator and put a DNR on his chart and waited for him to die. He didn't die. He didn't need a g-tube, he was able to breastfeed and get enough nutrition for himself yet it was offered to us to just stop feeding him orally, give him morphine for the pain and let him go. Is this sort of thing common?\" 
 
I contacted Dr. Jonathan Hellmann, who is clinical director of the neonatology unit at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto for clarity on how to answer this question. 
 
Dr. Hellmann authored a paper earlier this year about parent perspectives on withdrawing intravenous fluids in newborns with severe neurological injury or disease where the decision to stop life-sustaining medical treatment such as ventilation is made ( Withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: parental perspectives ). None of the newborns in the study could safely be fed orally.  
 
According to the study, in addition to requiring the full support of the parents and the senior medical staff and team, the practice of withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration requires \"the clear demonstration of the inability of an infant to safely tolerate oral feeds (oral feeding was regarded as routine care even in those in whom it took many hours to achieve a satisfactory intake.)\" 
 
Given this criteria, I asked Dr. Hellmann whether withholding milk from a baby who is able to breastfeed -- as reported above by the parent on BLOOM -- fell outside the practice of withdrawal of artificial fluids and nutrition.  
 
 Dr. Jonathan Hellmann:  Your interpretation is correct. Only if the feeding is regarded as medical treatment i.e. requiring tubes, IVs, lines etc. is it ever our practice to  possibly  raise the issue with parents of a profoundly affected infant. If the child is able to tolerate feeding it is absolutely not acceptable to consider withdrawal of hydration and nutrition. I am extremely concerned that individuals might interpret our findings without every effort being made to feed even small sips, and only when it is unsafe to potentially raise the issue. It is certainly not common practice here and requires very careful consideration in every case. 
 
I hope the parent who posed the question above sees this blog and lets us know if she has more questions.

 My ex-ER nurse mother just informed me, after a discreet but panicked blog-reading friend called to ask about \"what major surgery Squid had,\" that--unless they gave me a bowel resection as well--a tubal ligation is not  major  surgery. 
 
 \"Still,\" my mom said, thoughtfully, \"You  are  basically recovering from two stab wounds to your gut.\"

 When my son Nicholas was about fourteen, he had a major hip surgery.  Because of his severe cerebral palsy, the doctors decided it would be best to send Nicholas straight to the ICU rather than the recovery room after the surgery.  Of course my husband Jim and I were waiting anxiously for our boy to be wheeled, still asleep, into his bay in the bright and beeping environment of intensive care.  Nick began to spike a temperature soon after his arrival - a urinary tract infection was diagnosed.  Then the diarrhea started.   Wikipedia describes the 'hospital superbug' C-Difficile this way:  Clostridium difficile   ( pronunciation below ) (from the   Greek   kloster   (κλωστήρ), spindle, and   Latin difficile , [1]   difficult), also known as \"CDF/cdf\", or \" C. diff \", is a   species   of   Gram-positive   bacteria of the genus   Clostridium   that causes severe   diarrhea   and other intestinal disease when competing bacteria in the   gut flora   have been wiped out by antibiotics. 
 
 
 
 Patients undergoing major surgery very often have an in-dwelling catheter and these are notorious for causing urinary tract infections, as it did in Nick's case.  But the anti-biotics automatically prescribed to prevent blood and bone infections in orthopaedic surgery candidates were the culprit in Nick's C-Difficile.  So, another antibiotic was prescribed to knock out both the UTI and the C-Diff and this time, the strongest one on the market -  Vancomycin .  It eventually worked, but not before interacting with Nick's anti-seizure medication.... but that's a story for another day.  Nicholas did, eventually, recover from his surgery and from his urinary tract infection and C-Difficile.  At the time, I thought, \"Boy, I hope I never see  that  condition in anyone I love again\".   
 
 
 
 Fast forward to last March.  My Mum, who is a decade short of being a centenarian, contracted the dreaded C-Diff infection - not once, but twice.  The second time was in the hospital while she was waiting for a nursing home bed, arranged on a short term basis just to get her strength back. One of the hospital staff was guilty of infecting her again.  After an arduous course of vancomycin, my Mum got better - until three days ago. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mum has gastro problems at the best of times and when a gastro bug hit her residence and spreading like wildfire, of course she got it.  She's back in hospital and we just found out that she's positive for C-Diff again ..... or is she,  really ?   A little further reading into C-Diff yielded this surprising nugget:  Latent symptoms of  C. difficile  infection often mimic some  flu-like symptoms  and can mimic disease flare in patients with  inflammatory bowel disease -associated colitis.    So.  My mother's symptoms may be C-Diff and we'll know that if she's worse.  If she continues to recover without medication or intravenous fluids, then we'll  
 
 know that she had a nasty case of the flu, but that the bacteria C-Difficil happens to still reside in her gut 'harmlessly'.  Another key fact I learned about about this superbug:  In a very small percentage of the adult population,  C. difficile  bacteria naturally reside in the gut. Other people accidentally ingest spores of the bacteria while they are patients in a hospital, nursing home, or similar facility. 
 
 So, how can the frail, elderly and vulnerable avoid getting C-Difficile? Good hand washing, including the use of anti-bacterial gels and the avoidance of anti-biotic treatments for routine infections (unless absolutely necessary).  That's what my mother's doctor said and it's what we practice the best we can in our family.  Sometimes, though, superbugs live up to their name.

A few months ago, Conor was lying unconscious  in a bed at the Intensive Care Unit of the Chalmers' Hospital (the DECH) with tubes running out of his body and hooked up to 10+ year old monitoring equipment.  Notwithstanding the age of the monitoring equipment the fantastic DECH ICU team brought Conor back to us without any restrictions or impairments.  Conor's recovery has been constant since his release and we are happy. Today on the trail Conor hit the final recovery benchmark with the return of our Run, Jump, Fly boy!

The article below describes children who, like Leelo, have seizure or \"blanking out\" spells that were considered too mild for treatment. These children improved dramatically and phenomenally upon being treated with seizure meds: http://snurl.com/29t0e Leelo had an EEG done when he was three. The neurologist (not our current one) said that \"the seizure activity is significant enough that if your son was not autistic, we'd put him on seizure meds.\"  Well, why fucking not?  I have always had a bad feeling about the possibility of constant seizures scrambling my son's brain. Given Leelo's tendency to space and blank and his atypical autism traits, I have always wondered if it was constant seizure brain fog preventing him from learning and responding to stimuli as he otherwise might. Leelo is scheduled for another EEG on 6/2, as ordered by his current neurologist. Then five days ago we received a letter informing us that the medical director had reviewed our request and denied it because the EEG was not \"medically necessary to manage our son's symptoms.\"  I talked to the neurologist yesterday, and she told me to absolutely not cancel the EEG. But now I'm wondering if, since we already have the initial EEG, perhaps we should just go ahead and try seizure meds anyhow? The EEG is going to be a complete fucking ordeal for us, the technician, and especially for Leelo, and perhaps we should just skip it and go to the next steps. Don't give me any crap about magical \"cures\" or wishing on stars. I know seizure treatment might not have any effect. But I sure as fuck am going to investigate the possiblities as fully as I can.

This morning Seymour, Leelo, and I visited Dr. Sheyenne, Leelo's pediatric neurologist. The goal was to discuss Leelo's recent absence episode and his abnormal EEG from four years ago and the possibility of  physically imperceptible seizure activity fogging up our boy's brain . And also the migraine-like episodes he's been having for the past few months. This what I took away from our discussion; my notes should neither be construed as medical advice, nor as a verbatim transcription. She does not think Leelo has  Landau-Kleffner  (nor do we), as it is usually detected late -- around age three -- and by Leelo's age we'd generally be seeing significant seizure activity. But it is also not something that can be ruled out by the comprehensive genetics panel we had done on Leelo four years ago, as part of his Stanford Neurology Grand Autism Diagnosis Tour. And a definitive diagnosis requires a 24-hour EEG session. Not happening any time soon. An abnormal EEG doesn't necessarily mean seizures are happening. The \"spikes\" in Leelo's EEG means that he is at risk for seizure activity, not actively seizing. Even if he was having seizures, there is no guarantee that a seizure will actually happen during an EEG. EEGs are done using surface electrodes, and as such cannot really pinpoint any specific area of the brain. She said EEGs are like trying to determine the activity of fish in the sea via buoys on the surface. Sometimes a whale surfaces and you see specific, measurable activity; otherwise it's hard to really know what is going on below the waves. Most doctors will not use EEG abnormalities as a basis for treatment unless they are accompanied by documented seizure activity. So, unless we are seeing regular seizures, it is in her opinion risky to start trying seizure medications, as the goal in medicating seizures is to strike a balance between the gnarliness of the seizures and the gnarliness of the meds. Medications might even put him into the brain fog we were worried about and for which we currently have no evidence. Evidence is important, because no one really understands how or why seizure drugs like  Depakote  or  Lamictal  work. And their side effects are can be horrible (liver damage, unusual bleeding, hallucinations, life-threatening skin reactions). Leelo's absence episodes are infrequent enough that she does not recommend experimenting with potentially detrimental 2x/day medications on our non-compliant boy. And absence episodes are usually not indicative that other types of seizure activity is happening. However, if they do start to happen more frequently, then they should be treated with medication to prevent  kindling , i.e., a seizure frequency snowball effect. As for his migraines, we should first try a Tylenol/Ibuprofen cocktail taken as soon as we see any symptoms. We need to be vigilant; fast and early treatment is critical. However, the Tylenol and Ibuprofen will not be as effective if he has been using them a lot recently (he is currently getting Tylenol 1x/day for a back-gum-perforating new tooth). Overuse of them is similar to coffee abuse; they are not as effective day-to-day, and going off them can cause a rebound effect. Conclusions: We don't need to do anything except be aware of possible future seizures and migraines, document both, and treat migraine symptoms as quickly as possible. The best part of the appointment was at the end, when Leelo refused to leave the office without getting an exam on Dr. Sheyenne's exam table. Because that is what you DO when you see a doctor. Then Seymour took Leelo to school. And I went home, feeling satisfied that we had investigated the seizure avenue, disappointed that our boy and his brain mystify so many people, and relieved to not have to wrestle with that boy so as to introduce a new medication.

 After a scary trip to the emergency room, numerous tests and doctor appointments, and many prayers, we finally have an answer for  what’s been going on  with Aidan’s insides. Last week’s  hour-long scan , the “it’s-probably-not-this-but-let’s-just-rule-it-out” actually turned out positive: a condition called  Meckel’s diverticulosis . It occurs in about 2% of the population. Of that 2%, only 5% have symptoms requiring surgery. Of the 5% with symptoms, the vast majority show symptoms by age 2. It is extremely rare for symptoms to be apparent after age 10, which is why they didn’t think it was what Aidan had. In all cases, the diverticulum forms in utero, so Aidan’s has been affecting him for close to thirteen years. 
 So yes – that part about surgery. Aidan will need to have surgery to remove the diverticulum from his intestines. They also want to schedule a  sigmoidoscopy  before the surgery to check for polyps or any other problems since we have a family history of colon cancer. So  my little guy  will go through two invasive procedures in the space of two weeks. I am still trying to wrap my mind around all of this, and Aidan is scared. So scared that he actually  told  me that he’s scared. He was scared before we found out about the Meckel’s, wondering what was happening with him, and now he’s scared about the surgery. I tried to assuage his fear by mentioning several family members who’ve come through surgery just fine, but the fact is that I’m scared too. I don’t like this one bit. I just keep telling myself that at least it’s fixable. The “good” news is that once the diverticulum is removed and the intestines repaired properly, there are usually no long-term problems. There is some remote risk of post-op complications involving infection, but  that’s not going to happen , I tell myself. He will be fine. He’ll be dragging logs at the beach again in no time. 
 Prayers, please.

Yesterday, I brought my son Nicholas to the National Neurology Hospital in London. I requested (rather energetically) an emergency appointment because Nick's left leg was stiff, painful and periodically in spasm.  I had a feeling that perhaps his spinal cord pain pump wasn't functioning properly.  We arrived at noon and waited in the lounge area of the neuro-rehab inpatient unit.  We had suitcases with us, because the doctor told us that Nick would be admitted.  A special x-ray of his pump using radio-active dye was planned for the afternoon.  An electric air mattress was located and placed on Nick's bed  after a member of staff had cleaned and disinfected his room.  Finally, we left the lounge to get settled.  At 3pm, we were brought to the x-ray area where Nick was to have his procedure.  We got him transferred to the narrow table under the cameras and I went outside to await the results.  After twenty minutes or so, the doors opened and our doctor came out, still drying her disinfected hands.  \"Nothing?\" I asked, thinking the test was normal and we would have to look for other reasons that Nick's leg was so stiff and painful.  \"Oh, no\", she exclaimed, \"there was something\".  Apparently the catheter leading from the pump to the spinal cord was completely blocked.  We had no way of knowing if any medicine at all was reaching its destination of the spinal cord.  A course of oral baclofen (the muscle relaxant in the pump) was ordered and we were told to monitor the pain and wait for surgery to replace the pump.  This week, Nicholas will have emergency surgery to replace and reposition his pain pump (in a new location in order to prevent a possible repeat failure if the problem related to its position).  It's a big surgery and we are all worried.  Every time that Nicholas has a big surgery like this, we worry that he will not survive.  This is real life.

The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Fredericton's Chalmers hospital saves lives even with vitally important monitoring equipment that is more than 10 years old.  We found out first hand how important the ICU is when our son Conor spent 6 days at the ICU with a life threatening adverse medication reaction:

A friend of our family passed away from meningioma, so I was pleased to host a guest post about caring for a loved one with this type of brain tumour.  
 This is a Post by Jan Vespremi 
 
 Treatment Options For Meningioma 
 
 
 
First, let’s talk about the science. As a caregiver, understanding the
science of meningiomas—while it doesn’t negate the stress that comes with what
we do--can help alleviate some of the emotional issues that come up, especially
with meningioma patients. 
 The Science 
Meningiomas are intracranial tumors that originate from arachnoid cap cells
in the thin, spider web-shaped membrane surrounding the spinal cord and brain.
Although the majority of these tumors are non-cancerous, untreated and
undiscovered, they can slowly grow and, in some locations of the body, can be
disabling or even life threatening.  According
to  the National Cancer Institute, meningioma accounts for 27
percent of all brain tumors; and 30.1 percent of all CNS (central nervous
system) and primary brain tumors. 
Genetic factors are the biggest cause for meningiomas, with radiation
exposure following not far behind.  Some
research  says that changes to hormones (estrogen and androgen) during
pregnancy could accelerate the development of meningiomas. It is also thought
that previous head traumas could lead to the condition at the injury site; and
viruses could encourage the development and growth of the tumor. They can also
be found in places with skull fractures, and those where the surrounding
membrane is scarred due to an injury. 
 Symptoms 
Most of the time, the symptoms brought on by meningioma are a direct result
of the location of the tumor. For example, someone who has  optic nerve meningioma 
will have to deal with vision loss (most commonly in his or her peripheral
vision), while someone with an olfactory groove tumor will have issues with his
or her sense of smell and, potentially, vision problems. 
As a caregiver, it is the parasagittal and falx tumors’ symptoms that will
most likely impact how you care for and relate to your patient. This is
because, depending on which part of the brain these tumors set up shop, your loved one could experience seizures, numbness or weakness and problems with cognitive
ability like memory and reasoning. 
 Caring for Someone with Meningioma 
One of the hardest things for someone who is diagnosed with this type of
tumor is that, often, it is inoperable. Radiation therapy can help shrink the
tumor and slow down its growth but, ultimately, it will keep coming back,
symptoms will recur and there isn’t anything that the patient can do about it.
That can cause many patients to become very depressed, which is understandable.
After all—would you want to have to go through radiation therapy over and over
again for the rest of your life?  
It’s also likely that your patient will be very angry. These tumors, because
of how they are formed and where they like to set up shop, are often
misdiagnosed when symptoms first appear. Your patient may have spent years
dealing with misdiagnoses and failed treatments and they may be looking to lash
out at someone. Caregivers are often seen as the safest people to lash out (as
you already know!). 
 Tips for Coping 
Try to remember that, in some cases—as much as this is cribbed from Grey’s
Anatomy—it really will be “the tumor talking.” If you are new to caregiving,
this can take some getting used to. It is hard not to take the lashings out of
someone personally.  
Be proactive. The biggest issue with meningioma patients, as already
discussed, is that their symptoms reoccur and are often misdiagnosed. Work with
the patient’s doctor and family to figure out what is “normal” behavior and
what might be a sign that the patient needs to be seen earlier than his or her
next follow up.  
Don’t forget to take care of yourself! Caregivers—whether professional or
family or friends who are taking this on for the first time—often put their own
needs absolutely last. But, just like with child care, you cannot offer the kind
of care you need to offer if you are operating at a deficit. Use the  Cancer.org
Distress Assessment  to help keep track of your own self-care.

"31732" "48" "https://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/a-good-bad-result/" "A Good Bad Result" "I’ve tried in vain to organize my thoughts over Rhema’s test results from her hospital stay earlier this week. The good news is that her EEG came back clean. The not-so-good news is that the only medication that seems to stop Rhema’s seizure-like activity is high-dose diazepam/valium. There is a risk that Rhema will become addicted to this drug with long term use. A little less than a year ago, a  very  high-dose diazepam protocol was given to Rhema in order to “rescue” her from a pattern a continuous mini-seizures. The results were astounding – she went from a spike index of 85-100% to less than 2%. We were thrilled! Rhema during an EEG last September Because of its addictive properties, our neurologist did not want her to stay on the med long-term. We immediately began weaning her over several months. The hope was that the first bolus had shocked her brain out of the seizure pattern and that another anti-seizure med, Lamictal, (non-addicting) would maintain the seizure-free state. An EEG in June confirmed our fears that the seizure activity had indeed returned with a vengeance. She was put back on the diazepam, and now, several weeks later, her EEG is clean again. Over the past 3 years, we have tried many anti-epileptic meds to no effect. Her options: 
1) Diazepam long term 
2) Intensive steroid therapy – her dr. is very much against this 
3) A brain surgery called  MST  –  definitely  a last resort Our “choice” for now is clear: uncontrolled seizures or unknown reactions to the drug in the future. But the last thing we need is a child with symptoms of drug dependence, and my biggest fear is putting a 5-year old with autism through some horrible drug withdrawal down the road. (Not to mention, the diazepam makes her very h-y-p-e-r-a-c-t-i-v-e  – as if we needed more of  that . Ugh!) How long term is long term? Nine months? A year? We don’t know. But for now, her brain is quiet and she has a chance to really  learn  and perhaps even gain language. And for that I am grateful. But no matter how I spin this, I just can’t seem to get settled on it. Maybe I’m numb. Truly, I don’t know what to think, how to feel. There is fear, worry, and hope… always hope. There is information overload from googling Landau Kleffner syndrome and diazepam dependence all night long. There is the constant wondering if we’re doing the right thing for her. An autism mom who reached out to me years ago recently told me something so simple yet so profound that I’m clinging to it now. She said, “I will pray the Lord will give you peace today as you learn to lay tomorrow at His feet.” So here we go.

SUDEP Awareness Day and Autism Disorders
" "
 
 
 
 
 
A much higher percentage of people with autism spectrum disorders suffer from epileptic seizures than among persons in the general population.   At the severe end of the autism \"spectrum\" it has been estimated that as many as 39% also suffer from seizures.   My severely autistic, intellectually challenged son Conor suffers from seizures including tonic clonic known as Gran(d)  Mal seizures and almost lost his life last year to an adverse reaction to his seizure med at that time.  Among persons with epilepsy there are many risks surrounding loss of consciousness and breathing during seizures.  Approximately 1% off persons with epilepsy die as a result of SUDEP, Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy.  In the UK the  SUDEP Action   organization has started a SUDEP Awareness Day, October 23.  It has received the support of  a UK MP Ed Vaizey. 
 
The  Epilepsy Foundation  has a page on SUDEP which sets some important information: 
 
 What is SUDEP? 
 
 SUDEP is the sudden, unexpected death of someone with epilepsy, who was otherwise healthy. No other cause of death is found when an autopsy is done. Each year, more than 1 out of 1,000 people with epilepsy die from SUDEP. If seizures are uncontrolled the risk of SUDEP increases to more than 1 out of 150. These sudden deaths are rare in children, but are the leading cause of death in young adults with uncontrolled seizures.  
 
 What happens? 
 
 The person with epilepsy is often found dead in bed and doesn't appear to have had a convulsive seizure. About a third of them do show evidence of a seizure close to the time of death. They are often found lying face down. No one is sure about the cause of death in SUDEP. Some researchers think that a seizure causes an irregular heart rhythm. More recent studies have suggested that the person may suffocate from impaired breathing, fluid in the lungs, and being face down on the bedding. 
 
 Can SUDEP be prevented? 
 
 Until further answers are available, the best way to prevent SUDEP is to lower your risk by controlling seizures.  Paying attention to managing your seizure medications as best as possible, taking them regularly, and preventing seizures emergencies is all part of this. 
October is autism awareness month in Canada.  With the very large percentage of persons with autism disorders who also suffer from epilepsy it would be helpful if autism awareness organizations provided information about epilepsy and SUDEP.

 So, I went to see the rheumatologist.  On the one hand, she could confirm that all of my symptoms are consistent with fibromyalgia.  On the other hand, she told me that fibromyalgia is only diagnosed when all other alternatives are exhausted.  Now, I’d thought I’d been through that already.  When I first went in to see my regular doctor with my symptoms – before they’d gotten worse – he had the lab draw a lot of blood and run a lot of tests.  Apparently, the rheumatologist knew more tests that should be run before a diagnosis of fibromyalgia could be confirmed. 
 I did quite a lot of research, so I was rather surprised when she started listing off possibilities that I’d never heard of or never considered.  Ironically, while some of these possibilities seem a lot scarier than fibromyalgia, she was adamant that all of them are considerably more treatable than fibromyalgia and any one of them would be a better alternative that settling for an inaccurate fibromyalgia diagnosis.  She reinforced this idea by telling me that she wouldn’t be upping my dosage for the drug my regular doctor had prescribed, because the improvement I was seeing was “as good as it gets.”  She did, however, prescribe an additional medication to help my muscles relax enough so I could sleep better.  Perhaps the fact that this new medication has only had marginal results is indicative that she might be onto something.  I also learned that I already have some arthritis, which may be why rheumatoid arthritis came up as a possibility. 
 So, not only did she have the lab draw even more blood for even more tests, she also had me go in for an X-ray.  To top it off, I’ll be having a sleep study done in the middle of June.  (I wonder what will happen if I can’t sleep for them during the study.) 
 It will be another month before I see her again and see what all of this means.  Will it be fibromyalgia or will I be researching something new?  Will I get a treatment plan or is this really “as good as it gets?”  Personally, I’m inclined to hold out for something better, particularly when it comes to the concentration factor.

The baby was 9 months old, his birth weight was 8 lbs 5 ounces. At six months he weighed just shy of 20 pounds. Today he weighed 15 pounds – he was a skeleton and he was dying. 
 Mom had brought him in after treatment by his naturopath had failed. Constant coughing had made it impossible for him to take in adequate nutrition and starvation, coupled with a raging bacterial pneumonia were conspiring to shortly end his very short life. 
 We worked feverishly. Intubation, IV boluses, major antibiotics, vasopressors. All futile. 
 At 9:03 pm, after 30 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation we pronounced him dead. 
 This boy had pertussis. His mother choose not to vaccinate him. I won’t enter that debate. Anyone who has ever watched a child die or become permanently disabled from a preventable illness supports vaccination.
 A naturopath a mother who elected not to vaccinate and decreasing herd immunity – what could go wrong there? Lets hope there’s no other people as *fucking stupid* as to go around blathering about not vaccinating, using naturopaths instead of doctors and insinuating that vaccine preventable diseases are nothing and vastly preferable to something like…oh I dunno….autism for example.

What does pain look like in a person who cannot speak?  Most often with Nicholas, it looks like this: 
 
 
 
When his smile suddenly turns to a 'stricken' look, we know that Nick is in pain.  There are other signs too - sweaty palms and feet, high heart rate, staring, not responding in his usual way, and whispering \"ow\".  We know the signs of Nicholas' pain and we know how to soothe him. 
 
But what about pain in those we love who have severe communication and cognitive impairments - loved ones with Alzheimer's, severe dementia, and certainly severe cognitive disabilities?  They may feel pain, but sometimes cannot express it in ways that family members and medical professionals can understand.  
 
Yesterday, I listened in to a  webinar about pain  in children with severe developmental disabilities.  It was presented by the Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres, but there was plenty of information and practical advice about loved ones of any age who are unable express the pain they feel. 
 
73.5% more children with severe disabilities experience pain compared to their able-bodied peers, according to reporting by their parents.  Pain can arise as a result of simple activities of daily living, assistive devices (such as seating), acute pain from conditions such as dislocated hips or bony contractures as well as chronic pain resulting from immobility.  Gastric pain is another significant culprit in the discomfort experienced by children with severe disabilities. 
 
Pain specialists and webinar presenters  Dr. Frank Symons and Dr. Frank Oberlander  described three types of pain:  physiological pain, inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain.  Each type requires different management, and when the type of pain is difficult to discern, often the treatment is wrong. 
 
Dr. Symons and Dr. Oberlander discussed their research interest in finding objective measures for pain that could be useful when simple observation does not give the family or treatment team good information about the source of patient distress.  Small changes in saliva, blood, cerebrospinal fluid or hormones are all under investigation as potential markers for the type and level of pain.  
 
Nicholas has had chronic pain for much of his life and at times, his pain has been uncontrolled. Screaming was an indicator that we all understood, but very often we had great difficulty in locating the source of his distress.  He has always been on oral opioids to alleviate pain from hip dislocations and nerve pain.  But I recall on one occasion, Nick was screaming in agony night after night.  I changed his feeding schedule, adjusted medications, cuddled him, fed him, massaged him... nothing worked.  Finally, in desperation, I arranged an admission to the hospital for observation.  I recall the treating physician suggesting that in the absence of any other ideas, we would treat constipation aggressively while we waited for other tests to be completed.  After three days, Nick's screaming suddenly stopped.  X-rays of his abdomen showed that Nick was impacted high in his intestine and the bowel regimen had worked.  Treating pain in non-speaking loved ones can be a crap shoot (forgive the pun!) and that time, we simply got lucky. 
 
 
 
 
 The International Institute for the Study of Pain uses a scale of 1-10  with corresponding facial expressions.  But everyone is different and although the facial pain scale is a helpful tool for some, it didn't apply to Nicholas.  His facial expression for extreme pain is most often a look of extreme surprise or 'frozen fear'.  When we observe sweaty palms and feet together with a high heart rate, we look for a source of pain and if we can't find one, we treat it anyway.  The lesson here is to find a pain scale that is individual and fairly reliable for that person.  
 
Doctors Symons and Oberlander candidly discussed the challenges facing the pain specialist when treating patients who cannot communicate their experience in ways that are easily understood.  This state of affairs can easily lead to the team doubting their diagnosis.  In that case, Dr. Oberlander asks, \"Do we even need a diagnosis?  When should we stop the unending search for a diagnosis?  Is the symptom itself a diagnosis?\"  Clearly, treating patients with severe disabilities poses difficult challenges for the team and also for the family caregivers who don't know how or what to report to doctors, other than symptoms that may or may not be significant.   Dr. Oberlander suggests that it's better to resist seeking a single diagnosis.  For example, he says, not all irritability is derived from physical pain.  Some non-pain events such as seizures can cause distress.  Or, in the case of cerebral palsy, seizures can trigger increased spasticity which in turn can trigger increased pain due to dislocated joints or other orthopaedic problems.  
 
There are many reasons that pain management can fail a person who has severe disabilities and communication difficulties.  We are fortunate that Nicholas can say a clear 'Yes' and 'No'.   So, Nick can tell us if he has 'no pain', 'some pain' or 'a lot of pain'.  But because he very afraid of going to the hospital if he reports a lot of pain, often he will simply fib and under-report his discomfort.  We need to watch carefully for subtle signs and we give extra pain meds based on what we observe. 
 
When we watch our loved ones who cannot speak, we realise that what they experience and what they express are not the same thing.  We must watch carefully, identify indicators and develop our own custom pain scales the best we can.  Caregivers have many roles and being the voice of pain for someone you love is one of the most vital.

His sobbing begins immediately as he buries his face into my shoulder as if my body can block the devastating sensations which took him by complete surprise.  Knowing full well that it cannot, I shift his little boy form in my lap and rest his head against my sternum.  I am nonplussed at his new found awareness of my ability —and desire— to soothe him. His slender frame shudders with sobs as he tries to connect his tightly clenched fist with the side of his head; I press my hand against his ear as a buffer.  The blows from his deceptively small hands reign down hard upon my knuckles; I press my hand harder against his skull hoping the pressure might ease the lancing pain.  It seems to help some as he slumps against me, whimpering. He presses his body tightly to mine; his lithe legs dangle over my thigh.  I look at him and marvel at the strength in his slender frame.  With a shuddering breath, he begins weakly to hum our current  sing-me-a-song-because-you-love-me  tune  —“You are my sunshine, my only sunshine…”   I begin to sing softly as I rock him back and forth in my arms. We sit in the middle of the floor, fused together like Siamese twins.  We are joined —at the heart, the belly, the chest —by our mutual need; his to be comforted and mine to wash away his pain with the flow of my tears against the top of his downy head.  He presses his face deeper against my bosom and slumps forward over my arm —spent and content to be my baby once again. Making up new verses as I go along  —“You are my angel, my precious angel.  When you’re unhappy I feel blue.  When you are crying, my heart is breaking.  Mommy will take care of you”  —I sing until I am nearly hoarse.  I have held him and rocked him until my arms are leaden.  He is so still against me that I wonder if the motion of rocking has put him to sleep.  I pause in my singing to tip him back a bit so I can see his face. His eyes flutter open as he lets out a deep sigh.  He lifts his face to mine with a smile and begins to hum the tune I have just finished.  I gently press a kiss to his clammy forehead and tighten my embrace momentarily.  He squirms a bit and slips out of my lap to pick up his toy as if the last twenty minutes hadn’t happened. His pain is erased —transferred, actually.  I feel a dull ache as my heart constricts momentarily.  I swallow hard and fight the tears.  Who will soothe  my  pain away?  Whose lap can  I  climb into for solace?  There is no one and so I write.

This Verbatim is in two parts, from the same paper (Koegel et al., 1974). Here is the first part, which is Table 1 from this paper. \"Subject 1\" is an 8-year-old autistic boy. \"Subject 2\" is a 6-year-old autistic girl. Table 1 lists the behaviours the experimenters identified as self-stimulatory and requiring suppression for each child.

To ensure that all self-stimulatory responses were punished on a continuous schedule, one experimenter suppressed self-stimulation from the waist up and the other from the waist down.

Four Responses
" "
Joy has developed four different positive responses for one particular request. She tucks her chin down and presents the top of her head. She leans in and presents one side of her face. She doesn't incline her head at all, but makes a puckery motion and sound with her mouth. Or - rare but lovely - she leans in and turns up her mouth with a puckery smile. Kiss for mommy?  Kiss for daddy?  Kiss your big sister? We don't know why she chooses any given response at any given time.  But it's almost always one of these, especially at bedtime when it's part of the routine.  Melts us into our shoetops.  What a sweetheart.

"26700" "39" "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/spin-cycle/" "Spin cycle" "He presses his tear-stained cheek against my chest, wedging the top of his head with its slightly damp hair under my chin.  His delicate fingers toy gently with the drawstring on my sweat jacket; the repetitive motion gives him a focus for his restless energy. Drawing his legs up tightly, he takes my arm and wraps it around them.  The pressure of being hugged so firmly provides him with the input he needs to be able to calm himself again. With my left hand resting on his cheek, I begin to stroke behind his ear.  I can feel his body gently easing out of fight-mode as his breathing becomes more even.  I look down at his sweet face in the dim glow of the night-light; his eyes look up into mine, pleading.  Begging me to make the pattern cease once and for all. Thus, does my heart break each night at seven-thirty. It is so difficult for me to reconcile this frantic, frightened child with my sweet boy who once slept like a rock each night.  He would practically dive into his crib, pushing me away as I leaned over to stroke his cheek or to sneak in an extra kiss goodnight.  Now, it is I who sometimes withdraws as he begins to wail and moan, clutching and clawing at my hands.  Begging me not to leave him in the semi-darkness with whatever demons —physical or emotional, real or imagined— he battles but has not the words to tell me about.  What damage is not inflicted by his grasping hands is more than made up for by the guilt in my heart as I close the door on his cries. Thus, does my heart break each night at seven-thirty. I feel his body become limp and heavy in my embrace.  And I wait for what seems like an eternity until I am sure he’s sleeping soundly enough that I can put him in his crib.  While I wait, I look at the slender fist curled around the drawstring.  As I gently disentangle his fingers, I cannot reconcile the soft hand in mine with the fists which strike out at his face in the middle of the night. And yet, the evidence is writ upon his face in a tapestry of scratches and bruises in varying hues of purple, black, blue, green and yellow.  Bruises on top of bruises. Scabs on top of scars from the breakdown of his skin each time he jams his face hard into the corner of the crib, the fabric of the protective tent leaving burn marks on his forehead from the pressure. Thus, does my heart break each night at seven-thirty. Most nights I am not successful at transferring his ever-lengthening body into bed without waking him.  The clutching and clawing begins anew, accompanied by a plaintive, exhausted wail.  I reach into the crib and place one hand on his head, gently stroking near his ear as I firmly place the other one on his bottom and gently rock him side to side.  Sometimes, I merely hold him and whisper a soft, repetitive shushing sound.  If I’m lucky, I can get him to sleep again in a matter of minutes. The pattern is nearly always the same no matter how many times he wakes in the middle of the night.  The moans and wails turn into shrieks of terror or pain.  I know not which.  The fists begin to fly and his legs kick against the side of the crib with enough force that I fear he will, eventually, break the slats.  By the time I am able to reach his side, he is in full-blown panic.  Adrenaline pumping, spittle flying as he pummels his face and pokes at his eyes and forehead.  Even the sound of my shushing voice and my hands, desperately trying to contain the damage he’s inflicting, are not enough to calm his frenzy. If I can sit him up and put the side of the crib down, I can wrap my arms around him, gently trapping his flailing limbs as I croon soothing sounds into his ear.  Eventually, the sobs subside and he simply sits and holds my hands in the darkness as his body shudders with each ragged breath. Thus, does my heart break each night in the middle of the night. He lets me lay him down and put my hands on his head and bottom.  The familiar pressure and warmth of my hands seem to soothe him a bit.  The familiarity of the hold unnerves me slightly; it transports me back to our days in the NICU.  Nik was so fragile that, for months of our two hundred nine-day sojourn, all I could do was gently touch the top of his head and the soles of his feet; anything else was too stimulating, too much for his delicate, underdeveloped body to tolerate. The memories unleash a torrent of grief —like a flash flood moving swiftly and then gone again.  I am able to keep the grief at bay most days; there is so much more which demands my attention during waking hours.  Here, in the darkness, there is nothing else to occupy my mind and the tears run freely, falling in scalding drops on my arms and hands.  Drawing in a shaky breath, I stem the flow and resume my gentle shushing. Often, he will not go back to sleep but is content to sing and coo to himself for a bit until he eventually succumbs to the exhaustion and falls into fitful sleep.  I stumble to my bed and sink into sleep until the next wave washes over us and the ritual begins again. Thus, does my heart break each night in cycles.

My head floats near my neck. Legs orbit endlessly around their pedal planets. Highest gear feels like lowest. The world turns upside down. The best of childhood, like jumping off a swing at the scary point. The hill. It varies me daily though always the same. Yesterday: burning lungs, smooth muscles.  Today: short gulps of breath, burning pull of thigh. Why? Still, if I stare only at the ground, submitting to my tire’s steady insistent seduction, if I remain mesmerized by my struggle, I don’t see what’s left ahead. The summit. Now, I am there, searing pain that I have anticipated in almost sexual certainty; it explodes in my throat, a supernova of satisfying pain, glorious but now dying down so quickly. I listen for it to give way to vast open air. The harshness softens and I breathe. Soon, soon, the heart wakes up after its brief post coital sleep and relinquishes my blood. The red blanket covers me, calms my lungs with a mother’s hands and I am warm. At last, in balance.

							the hardest thing					" "  Restraint is not me. It sits like an anvil on my chest, squeezing the air out of my lungs. It reminds me, admonishes me. Tsk tsk. Approach slowly, gingerly – lest she run. Every day, I fight to neutralize every molecule of my being, wrestling with my very nature. Restraint is not me. It runs contrary to everything I am.  * My love for my girls is a vast, wild, physical force. It is not quiet or calm or tame. It can be soft and gentle, but at its core it is fierce and messy and loud. * I hate being away from my girls. I miss them every day. The separation from them burns. I feel it on my skin, in the dull ache in my gut. * As I pull into the garage every night, the anticipation begins to build. My heart beats faster as I reach the basement steps. They’re closer. I can feel them. I’m home. * I can’t wait to squeeze them, to kiss them, to inhale them. I live for their sweet smell, their soft skin, their laughter. Oh, the laughter! I want to bound up the stairs in a cloud of electric energy, scream their names, scoop them up in my arms. * I don’t.  * Katie Katie waits for me at the top of the stairs. We drink each other in. Strong, potent, unfiltered. I breathe. * Brooke Brooke is nowhere to be seen. I stealthily, carefully hunt her down. I quietly sing-song, ‘Where’s my baby girl?” A tiny voice repeats a long-practiced “Here I am.” * I reach her. She doesn’t move. I move closer, crouch in front of her, consciously smiling. Fighting the overwhelming, visceral urge to grab her. “Hi, Baby.” “Hi, Mama.” “I missed you today, little love.” “You did?” “I did. May I have a hug, sweet girl?” “You may.” I work my way in. Finally I squeeze her. We laugh. * I brush away a tear as I head upstairs to shed my work clothes. The fight is exhausting. I just want to love her.

 His cries echo in the darkness; the witching hour has begun again. Each night it’s the same routine; he beckons with his plaintive cries as he bangs his head on the side of the crib. Some nights it’s as simple as soothing him with a touch —a gentle rub on his back, a firm pressure over the right side of his head.  
 
 Usually, he will settle fairly quickly and hover at the edge of sleep, held there by the warmth of my hand. If I move too soon, the spell is broken and he startles, frantically clutching at my arm, imploring me to stay. Knowing how little he asks of me, I settle in like the sentinel I am, keeping the discomfort at bay with the only weapon I have —my unflinching, consuming love for him.
 I enter the room to find Nik sitting, propped up by the side of the crib. His cries sound the same but his rocking —his punching himself as he seesaws back and forth alternately slamming first his forehead then the back of his head against the crib —is different. In the dim glow of the nightlight, I can see the splash of tears on his cheeks, the dark splotches on the sheet where fat, hot, frantic tears have cascaded down in the darkness. 
 “Mama’s here, baby. Mama’s here. Shhh, it’s ok, lovey. Mommy’s going to make it better.”  My throat constricts as I choke back my own hot tears. He needs my strength right now; there will be time for me to cry later. I quickly unzip the crib tent and lower the side, reaching in to pull his little boy form into my arms. He sits with his back against my chest, the lowered wall of the crib between us. I wrap my arms around him and press my head against his. 
 His head continues to rock forward and back as if he’s seeking some sort of release or some sensory input that will change whatever uncomfortable sensations he is having. I feel the heaviness of his skull as it thumps against my chest. I whisper soft words to him, hoping they bring him ease. The rocking begins to slow as I gently start to sway side to side with him. He squeezes his delicate hands together — “Help me, Mama,”  they say to me. It’s a gesture we’ve recently begun to use when he asks for help during play as well. I am momentarily stunned at his presence of mind and ability to retrieve this particular gesture just now. 
 “Show Mama what hurts, baby. Let me help you,”  I croon softly against his hair. My own fat, hot, anxious tears flow now; I cannot hold them in. He puts my hand on his forehead and presses. Instinctively, I begin to rub back and forth in the same gentle motion I used when he was just a slip of a scrap of a baby in the hospital. I would sit for hours, gently stroking across his forehead — willing  him to feel the love and strength in my fingertips. Nik sighs and settles against me, his wiry form relaxing in my embrace, head nodding forward —toward the precipice of sleep. 
 These are the moments I wish he were a tiny baby again so I could scoop him into my arms and shelter him against my bosom. I’d breathe in the softness of his skin and the gold in his hair. My whole body would drink him in and fill him with healing light and strength. I would rock him into restful ease. Instead, I can only will all those things to flow through my arms and my fingertips, hoping he feels it just the same. 
 Nik slumps against my arm. As I gently lay him down, he startles; reflexively, he reaches for my hand.  “Shh, I’m right here, angel. Mama’s right here. I won’t leave yet, I promise.”  He curls his long limbs into a tight little ball —one hand tucked between his knees and the other laying upturned next to his cheek. He accepts my hand into his soft, spindly grasp. My thumb rests against his cheek as he snuffles and begins to settle. I can feel the moment when he slips gently over the edge of consciousness. 
 His deep, even breaths tell me he is at peace —for now. I gently lift the side of the crib and secure the tent before returning to the warmth of my bed. Settling in next to my slumbering husband, I am unable to go back to sleep right away. One thought keeps echoing in my brain:  “He asks so little.”   
 
 All he wants is the simple, soothing touch of my hand in the fitful, frightful darkness. I want to give him  more ; I want to make the need go away. I  need  to make the need go away. 
 
 I cannot rest until I do.

 Scene:  Isaac is on the floor of the bedroom. Mommy's lying on her stomach on the bed. Isaac grins and climbs on top of her back so his head is resting on her neck. Daddy is nearby and turns down the covers, motioning Isaac to get underneath. DADDY: Isaac, c'mon, get in bed. ISAAC (grinning): I'm already IN the bed! Huh.  Good point.

 There is a tall, gangly teen on the basketball court outside my window. He carries his right forearm up, his arm bent at a 90-degree angle against his body, his hand partially fisted. Sometimes that hand flaps. His whole right side is stiff, it doesn’t move the way his left side does. He bounces the ball with his left hand, shoots with the strength of his left arm and hand alone. Sometimes after sinking a hoop he claps jubilantly. He keeps shooting. Over and over and over again. From close up and far away. He lopes exuberantly around the court, unbothered by the unevenness of his gait. He doesn’t give up. When he leaves he walks past my window. I wave and he waves back.

The DIVA asks............ 
 
 
Mommy, why does he yell AAAHHHHHHHHHHHH? 
 
Mommy, why won't he use his words? 
 
Mommy, why does he bite his hand? 
 
Mommy, why does he cry so hard? 
 
Mommy, why does he rip up your books? 
 
Mommy, why does he run in circles? 
 
Mommy, why won't he play with me? 
 
Mommy, why is he scared of the worm on the Wonder Pets?

Boy Wonder has Autism, DIVA. He can't help it. He's trying really hard. 
 
Mommy, why does he have that? 
 
I don't know, DIVA. He just does.   
 
Mommy, why don't you make him better? 
 
I'm trying, DIVA.

 I stand watch over my fitfully sleeping son; he writhes and cries out in anguished tones though his body is not consciously awake. His eyes flit open for a moment, resting upon my hands perched on the crib rail. With a wail, he reaches out to hold my hands, pulling them to his head. He sandwiches his head between my palms, wordlessly asking me to apply pressure to make his pain go away, to make it all better.
 I stand thus for nearly thirty minutes — shushing  and stroking his head gently with my thumbs. The height of the crib and his position —farthest away from where I am standing —make the effort excruciating for me. My arms begin to ache and my lower back throbs in protest of this ergonomic torture.  
 The feel of Nik’s delicate, long fingers clasped around mine reminds me of how lucky I am to feel this physical pain. I am here to ward off the bogey men which plague his sleep; he is here, clinging fiercely to his mama —his need and his trust writ large in his now open eyes which meet mine in the dim light from the streetlamp outside.
 He is here. I weep with gratitude and guilt.

Nutcracker, sweet
" "
Bud has added a new skill to his ever-expanding repertoire: cracking walnuts. He has developed his very own unique approach to the task. He goes to the top of our  wooden stairs  and balances a walnut somewhat precariously on the railing. Then he smashes the walnut with the  soft mallet from his tom drum . The force of this action sends the walnut bouncing down the stairs, where it slips through a space between the steps and crashes onto the tile floor, breaking open and sending up a spray of shell and nut fragments. Once the pieces have settled Bud scrambles down the stairs to gather his bounty and share it with anyone who is willing to partake. My little nutcracker. Isn't he sweet?

"26431" "39" "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/awakenings/" "Awakenings" "His indignant cries rouse me from my state of half-sleep. I sit up and groggily reach for the monitor, turning it up so I can hear a bit better. Through his sleepy sobs I hear him singing the tune of  “You Are My Sunshine”  —his  “comfort me, Mommy”  song.  Like one of Pavlov’s dogs, I am trained well; I slither out of bed and stumble across the hall. He closes his eyes and whines a moment as he moves my hand into just the right position to press over his right ear. Something still causes him discomfort but he cannot tell me what it is; it has been thus his entire life. I rest my hand on the side of his head; my palm covers his ear and I gently stroke his cheek with my thumb. He turns his face slightly into my arm and sighs. He snuffles and wiggles to settle in again. In the dim light I watch him tuck one hand between the mattress and the side of the crib as if anchoring himself in place. Within minutes he is fast asleep again; I extract my tingling hand and stumble back to bed to wait for the next summons. It is the same each night; like clockwork, he stirs and comes to half-consciousness several times. Each time I stop what I am doing and go to him. Unlike those endless and horrible nights of mere months ago, he no longer requires pain relievers, homeopathic remedies, or extra padding in the crib to protect his head from the force of his thrashing about. Now, he settles almost instantly when my hand touches his face. Like before, though, he is unable to tell me what troubles him so. As I watch his cheeks go slack and his chest begins to rise and fall with the steadiness of slumber, I ponder whether the touch of my hand actually eases a physical pain or if it simply comforts him. Does he remember all that time spent together in the NICU? Two hundred nine days — five thousand-sixteen hours  —of which roughly half was spent with me by his side nearly always touching some part of him. Does he remember the feel of my hands cradling his tiny head and impossibly slender bottom when he was mere days old and so incredibly fragile? Does his body remember, even now, the outpouring of love and strength which flowed through my trembling fingers —willing him to live, to fight? Is this then what pulls me to him even now in those quiet hours in the middle of the night? ***************************************************** His quiet singing and laughter rouse me from my state of half-sleep; I roll over and look at the lights on the monitor. With a smile, I sit up and rub the sleep from my tired eyes. Each morning is the same; in spite of a night of disturbed sleep and whimpering cries, he awakes as if sunshine runs through his veins. He happily entertains himself while I drag myself to nearly full consciousness. I cross the hallway and pause outside his door; breathy strains of  “Old MacDonald”  or  “Signing Time”  gently tease my ears. With a smile, I open the door. The sound of the opening door interrupts his musical reverie; he sits up with a sly smile and begins his nonsensical but deliriously happy babbles. I understand he is happy to see me again so soon. He stands and leans on the side of the crib, his face tilted up and lips pursed to deliver an unasked-for kiss. I steal two quickly before he begins to pull on my shirt in an effort to climb out of the crib. Bracing his hand on something more stable than knit cotton, I help him down. He continues to chatter and sing as we make our way down the stairs. He squeals and scampers over to his toy bucket and begins to systematically empty it as quickly as he can. He finds his chosen toy for the morning and carries it to the sofa. He climbs up to await our routine of medicine through his tube, followed by clean pants and clothing. He proudly pulls his shirt on by his self and then lies down to await his clean pull-up and shorts. Supine, he reaches to pull up his shorts. Once they are settled just so, I help him with the zipper. He sits up and snuggles against my side, glancing up at me with his most engaging smile. “Aahh aahhh aahh ahhh ahhhhh!” I intone my best Tarzan yell as I gently beat my fists on my chest. He collapses against me in a fit of the giggles. I do it again just to hear his laughter and see the sparkle in his eyes. “Your turn; you do it!” I tell him as he reaches to pull my hands against his chest. He pats his chest with two open palms and tries to mimic the sound; it comes out as more of a satisfied sigh than a throaty warble. My heart turns to goo as he collapses against me in another fit of the giggles. I warble and beat my chest as his body shakes with mirth again and again and again. Life is good. Sleep is overrated.

"26691" "39" "https://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/ill-wind-blowing/" "ill wind blowing" "the change comes 
fierce and sudden 
a raging tornado 
in the midst of a placid night 
we are sucked into its vortex the unholy violence of 
the blows he rains upon his body 
head 
face 
eyes 
shake me to my core barely small enough 
for me to contain 
to minimize the damage 
what will I do 
when he is older 
bigger 
and I cannot keep him safe minutes pass 
i sense rather than see 
the softening of his cheek 
the easing of his brow 
as suddenly as it came 
the storm has passed 
for now he settles 
passes out 
not so much asleep 
as utterly spent 
arms flexed 
and slightly aloft 
as if to grasp 
or fend off 
an unseen 
or unwanted 
touch i weep 
shaking silently at his bedside 
trying to pick up the pieces 
of my battered 
shattered spirit 
piecing myself together 
so the seams don’t show 
a quiet prayer 
“I love you, bear” 
whispered in the shadows my hand trembles on the doorknob 
as I slip out 
into the brightly lit hallway 
i make my way 
reluctantly 
downstairs to eat dinner 
knowing 
I will taste 
only bile 
and ash 
as i wait 
for the storm’s return

The other night, right after I brushed Sam's teeth, Sam leaned over and let go a glob of spit onto my slipper. THen he gave a little jump, flapped his hands, and said, \"bad, bad, bad!\" (which from Sam sounds like \"ba, ba, ba\"). Naughty boy.
