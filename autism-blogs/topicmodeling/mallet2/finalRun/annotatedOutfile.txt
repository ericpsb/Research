vaccine vaccines thimerosal children health mercury vaccination public safety cdc flu medical parents cause disease vaccinated research years link government study studies program cases year immunization against vaccinations information issue

Documents are about whether or not thiomersal has in fact been removed from vaccines and if vaccination, particularly of pregnant women, is safe.

"Yes Some of the H1N1 Vaccines/Swine Flu Shots Have Thimerosal/Mercury In Them. Remember all those talking heads on TV that keep saying that mercury is gone from vaccines and won't be in the H1N1 flu shot?  They are misinforming you. Does the Swine Flu shot have mercury in it?  The answer is yes... some of them.If you decide to get the shot, INSIST on seeing the vaccine package insert.  If you are offered a shot that is drawn from a vial, that will be a mercury containing vaccine."

"Other credible sources also lead me to the same concern about whether thimerosal has, or has not, been removed from vaccines as claimed in the public health authorities' refutations of vaccine-autism connections."

"I haven't broken out the Advent calendar yet, but Bud's official countdown to Christmas has begun. Each evening, Bud wants to talk through the flow of the days ahead. Though he knows the days of the week, he is less interested in discussing that tomorrow will be Thursday, and then will come Friday, and is much more interested in talking about the  meaning  of each day in his life. He has just recently started identifying which activities at school go with which days of the week: Mondays are gym days; Tuesdays, music; Wednesdays, art; Thursdays, library; Fridays, gym again. Saturdays and Sundays are Mom and Bud Days. Tonight, Bud reminded me that Wednesdays are not just art days; they are also pizza days - the one day each week when Bud buys his lunch at school. Every other day, he brings his lunch from home and just buys milk in the cafeteria. So at dinner this evening, when Bud wanted to talk through the days to come, I had some trouble keeping up. \"Mama, what tomorrow is?\" \"Tomorrow is Thursday.\" \"No, Mama.\" \"Library day?\" \"No. Milk day.\" \"Oh, of course. Milk day.\" \"Then another milk day, then Mom and Bud day, then Mom and Bud day, then milk day, then milk day, then pizza day.\" So, for the record, and for those keeping score at home, that means we have 14 milk days, 3 pizza days, and 8 Mom and Bud days until Christmas. But who's counting?"

"One of the worst pieces written claiming that mercury caused an autism epidemic was the piece “Deadly Immunity” by Robert Kennedy Jr.  Salon.com and Rolling Stone co-published the piece.  It was immediately met with criticism and corrections: multiple correction pieces were published. Salon has decided to review the piece and decided that corrections were not enough.  They’ve pulled the piece from their site.   Here’s the statement . 
Correcting our record 
We’ve removed an explosive 2005 report by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about autism and vaccines. Here’s why  
In 2005, Salon published online an exclusive story by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that offered an explosive premise: that the mercury-based thimerosal compound present in vaccines until 2001 was dangerous, and that he was “convinced that the link between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurological disorders is real.” 
The piece was co-published with Rolling Stone magazine — they fact-checked it and published it in print; we posted it online. In the days after running “Deadly Immunity,” we amended the story with five corrections (which can still be found  logged here ) that went far in undermining Kennedy’s exposé. At the time, we felt that correcting the piece — and keeping it on the site, in the spirit of transparency — was the best way to operate. But subsequent critics, including most recently, Seth Mnookin in his book “ The Panic Virus ,” further eroded any faith we had in the story’s value. We’ve grown to believe the best reader service is to delete the piece entirely."

"Unsubstantiated statements include: Offit’s claim that Attkisson “lied”; and Offit’s claim that CBS News sent a “mean spirited and vituperative” email “over the signature of Sharyl Attkisson” stating “You’re clearly hiding something.” In fact, the OC Register has no evidence to support those claims. Further, Offit told the OC Register that he provided CBS News “the details of his relationship, and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s relationship, with pharmaceutical company Merck.” However, documents provided by CBS News indicate Offit did not disclose his financial relationships with Merck, including a $1.5 million Hilleman chair he sits in that is co-sponsored by Merck. According to the CBS News’ documentation recently reviewed by the OC Register, the network requested (but Offit did not disclose) the entire profile of his professional financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies including: The amount of compensation he’d received from which companies in speaking fees; and pharmaceutical consulting relationships and fees. The CBS News documentation indicates Offit also did not disclose his share of past and future royalties for the Merck vaccine he co-invented. To the extent that unsubstantiated and/or false claims appeared in the OC Register and have been repeated by other organizations and individuals, the OC Register wishes to express this clarification for their reference and for the record.\"

"Following the  retraction  by  The Lancet  of Mr. Wakefield’s “landmark” 1998 paper, many speculated as to if and when other retractions would follow.   The patient pool Mr. Wakefield relied upon for his study was very biased by the referral process.  Also, Mr. Wakefield’s team was working without ethical approval for many of the children studied.

"I have commented many times expressing my personal opposition to the inflexible full inclusion beliefs which have caused harm to my severely autistic son and others for whom the mainstream classroom is not an appropriate educational environment.  This is not just an issue though between some parents of autistic children and the NBACL/Porter Full Inclusion true believers. The Learning Disabilities Associations of Canada and Ontario have also opposed the full inclusion model which limits placement options, causes physical harm to some, and deprives some of a real education:  
LEARNING DISABILITIES ASSOCIATION OF ONTARIO POLICY STATEMENT ON EDUCATIONAL INCLUSION FOR STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES 
The following policy statement of the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada  (LDAC) was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Learning Disabilities Association of Ontario (LDAO), as recommended by the LDAO Legislation and Policy Committee, on November 17, 2008. Learning Disabilities Association of Canada (LDAC) Policy Statement on 
Educational Inclusion for Students with Learning Disabilities (presented to the  
LDAC Executive Committee in February 2005, the LDAC Board of Directors in June 2005 and ratified on November 26, 2005). STATEMENT The Learning Disabilities Association of Canada (LDAC) does not support full educational inclusion or any policies that mandate the same placement, instruction,  or treatment of all students with learning disabilities or the idea that all students with learning disabilities must be served only in regular education classrooms at the exclusion of all other special education placement options. LDAC believes that full inclusion, when defined this way, violates the rights of parents and students with disabilities guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedom and Human Rights Codes which guarantee education equality and freedom from discrimination and rejects the arbitrary placement of all students in any one setting."

"I am reading the Ontario Ministry of Education guidelines for developing and implementing individual education plans (IEPs). I read similar legal documents when Ben was much younger, but over time it seemed that what was written in his IEP wasn't necessarily followed, often because of a lack of resources. 
Here are the most salient points I've learned, some of which I had no understanding of and which were never explained to me. This information is taken from  Individual Education Plans: Standards for Development, Program Planning and Implementation, 2000 , and  The IEP, A Resource Guide, 2004 . 
The IEP is supposed to set specific, observable, measurable annual goals and learning expectations against which the student's progress is  continually  assessed. 
The IEP is based on individual student strengths and needs that are specific, consistent with the IPRC and supported by assessments. In the information-gathering stage, students share their perceptions of their strengths and needs,  talents and interests . Information about the student's personal characteristics, hobbies or interests and non-academic accomplishments can be included. Students assist in setting goals and understand the IEP so they can actively work to achieve it. 
The IEP lists the teaching strategies, accommodations, staff and equipment needed to support the student's learning."

"This essay  is interesting because it tries to explain what it is like to not have the ability to get your thoughts out at will. The assumption is nearly always that having a hard time expressing your thoughts means that your thoughts are jumbled. It is a silly theory, in my opinion. All you need to do is see how a person travelling in a foreign country seems to lose their ability to make jokes or express complex ideas in another language if they are not completely fluent, but it is clear they express ideas, joke, and think OK in their own language. Autism is different, of course, because the language in which I struggle to express my thoughts verbally is my native language. But that doesn’t mean I’m not thinking my thoughts clearly. Like the author says, my output really isn’t mine to control."

HIs favorite sign is  \"fox.\"  Today, he and Nikki were doing some other things, including looking at some Richard Scary books. He turned to her and signed about what he saw on the page: \"The fox ate and ate until he was full!\" When Nikki said these words he said, \"Yes! That's right!\" and laughed, and then repeated them.    I still think most of Joey's speech is scripted or echoed. I usually use \"scripted\" to mean that he knows what the words mean, and is trying to use previously-heard strings of words to convey meaning, sometimes quite successfully."

"In the past we have had the sad spectacle of individuals with autism being sent off to institutional settings such as the Campbellton psychiatric hospital, hospital wards, prisons, and even out of the country at enormous expense and without any gains to the individual, the family or the community 
Among the reforms that the UNB professor is calling for is an enhanced group home system where homes would be connected to a major centre that would develop ongoing training and leadership. 
The larger centre could also offer services for people who have mild conditions. But, he said, it could also be used to offer permanent residential care for individuals with more severe diagnoses. 
\"Such a secure centre would not be based on a traditional 'hospital' model but should, itself, be integrated into the community in a dynamic manner, possibly as part of a private residential development,\" he writes. 
\"The focus must be on education, positive living experiences and individualized curricula. The key to success is properly trained professionals and staff."

"ThreeLac is an alternative treatment for candida/yeast/fungal infections which seems to be receiving considerable attention as a biomed autism treatment thanks to Jenny McCarthy. I wouldn't be surprised if it soon overshadows other treatments currently in vogue, such as Chelation Therapy or Me-B12 injections. ThreeLac is unproven, of course. There are no published studies on its effectiveness as it relates to any condition, never mind autism. However, there is one \"study\" underway which purports to demonstrate its effectiveness as an autism treatment. I'm not going to link to its web page but it's easy to find if you're interested. It is not a controlled study, as you can imagine. It's reminiscent of the uncontrolled work  Amy Holmes  did in the early days of Chelation Therapy for autism.""

"Chelation is a process whereby metals are removed from the body using a drug, a chemical which binds to the metals and allows them to be excreted.  Because of the incorrect notion that autism is caused by mercury or is a “novel” form of mercury poisoning, chelation is one of the more common alternative medical therapies applied to autistics. The FDA has recently issued a warning to many of those who market unapproved chelators.  Two articles appear on the FDA website today: FDA Tightens Reins on Unapproved ‘Chelation’ Drugs and a press release FDA issues warnings to marketers of unapproved ‘chelation’ products . They have also issued a printer-friendly pdf:  FDA chelation warning pdf From that pdf: Federal regulators are warning eight companies to stop selling so called ‘chelation’ products that claim to treat a range of disorders from autism to Alzheimer’s disease by removing toxic metals from the body."

AutismOne promoted a woman who is profiting by giving this dangerous product to autistic children, especially via given enemas 2 to 3 times a week for several weeks, if not indefinitely. 
Jennifer Byde Myers and Emily Willingham  have created a petition to:

function get_extension($Filename) {
$Extension = explode (\".\", $Filename);
$Extension_i = (count($Extension) - 1);
return $Extension[$Extension_i];
}
And neither is reversing the path: 
function reverse_strrchr($haystack, $needle){
$pos = strrpos($haystack, $needle);
if($pos === false) {
   return $haystack;
}
return substr($haystack, 0, $pos);
}
I also had to split the  foreach  blocks in two as I wanted to rpesent the directories first, then the files – directories have a set style whereas files have a style dependant on their file extension"

"A Danish man was indicted Wednesday on charges of wire fraud and money laundering for allegedly concocting a scheme to steal more than $1 million in autism research money from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The indictment charges Poul Thorsen, 49, with 13 counts of wire fraud and nine counts of money laundering. The wire fraud counts each carry a maximum of 20 years in prison and the money laundering counts each carry a maximum of 10 years in prison, with a fine of up to $250,000 for each count. 
The federal government also seeks forfeiture of all property derived from the alleged offenses, including an Atlanta residence, two cars and a Harley-Davidson motorcycle."

"As late as 2004, former Food and Drug Administration head Lester Crawford or his wife owned stock in companies that make or distribute products regulated by the agency, a factor that may have led to his abrupt departure last month. For most of 2004, Dr. Crawford was the FDA's acting commissioner, and prior to that he had been a deputy commissioner at the agency. Financial disclosure forms released under the Freedom of Information Act show that during at least part of that time, he or his wife held stock in companies that have some of their business regulated by FDA, including Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Teleflex Inc., which make medical devices, food distributor Sysco Corp. and Embrex Inc., an agricultural biotechnology company on whose board Dr. Crawford once sat"

"In the last month, he has been demoted and the clinic's image has been tarnished in what has become an unusually public dispute pitting him against the clinic's chief executive, Dr. Delos Cosgrove. Dr. Topol, who retains the position of chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the clinic, suggested in a Webcast on Thursday (http://www.theheart.org) that his unabashed willingness to take on Merck was a principal reason for his removal this month as head of the clinic's medical college. In what Merck lawyers have suggested is a vendetta, he described the company's behavior as \"appalling\" in recent testimony in a Vioxx lawsuit. But his demotion has drawn attention to the mounting tensions between the clinic's research mission and its deep ties to the businesses that finance that research."

Just like the Charlie blog, this one makes a large part of the corpus and therefore has a topic created for it.

My daughter has autism, Mr. President. And you’re right; I love her fiercely. I love her with a ferocity and a tenderness that can only co-exist within a mother’s heart. I love her so much that there is nothing on God’s green Earth that I wouldn’t do to help mitigate her challenges. There is nothing that I wouldn’t do to make the world less foreign to her, less hostile. There is nothing that I wouldn’t do to ensure that every day when she steps outside our door, she is met with tolerance and understanding and compassion. That she is seen by the world as a full and complete human being and not as a set of challenges encompassed by a single word. There is nothing that I wouldn’t do to ensure that her talents and unique gifts are recognized, fostered and celebrated throughout her lifetime

"It’s unseasonably warm – a balmy sixty degrees in New England at the end of November. Brooke and I are crossing the street, headed for the ice cream shop. I watch the door to the shop open and close as we walk toward it. I fear we’re not the only ones with this idea. The shop is small and the acoustics are awful. It’s a combustible mix that  we know all too well . “Brooke,” I say, “the ice cream shop might be crowded. You going to be OK?” “Just a little sinus trouble,” she answers. My fault. She always invokes Burt in  Elmo’s World Happy Holidays  when I ask if she’s OK. I take a different tack. “OK, baby. What should we do if it gets too loud while we’re waiting on the line?” “Cover my ears,” she says. “That’s a GREAT idea,” I tell her. “That’s perfect.” “And what will you do if you feel overwhelmed?” It’s a big question. She takes it in, processes it, then buys time by asking, “What’d ya say?” I repeat the question. “What will you do if you feel overwhelmed?” She thinks. We walk. I wait. After a moment, she speaks."

"Our guest speaker for Senior Week in high school actually, in fact, told us that “It’s all downhill from here.” I was badly bullied at school and at home and no one did anything.  I hated that other people controlled my life.  I didn’t know I was queer yet, but in so many other ways, a lot of people were making sure I knew that the way I was was Not Okay. I was supposed to believe that that was as good as it was ever going to get for me.  That was the best I should expect.  It would not get better. And those were vicious, ugly lies. No, it isn’t enough just to say it and not  do  anything to make it better now, but when the alternative to not even saying it is that a lot of kids are actively being told that it does  not  get better and no one is contradicting that message in  any  way? If you have a choice between telling a kid who’s unhappy or having a hard time that it will get better, or that it won’t?  Tell them that it will. Like, dear lord. "

"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not. "

"You have such a bright future waiting for you and an adult life where you will not be stuck all day with people who treat you badly. You will have a life where you can make choices for yourself and the more you are able to get help right now with the things that are hard for you, the brighter your future is going to be. Stay strong. Remember your secret shields. Get trusted adults to help you with the things that are hard. Love, Sparrow There are things I would like to say to myself at fifteen-years-old, but it starts getting too intense and too personal at that point for me to feel ready to share with others. If I were to give enough advice and encouragement to myself before that point, maybe my teen years wouldn’t be so hard anyway. Who knows what my adult years would look like? At 48 years old, I’ve finally managed to carve out a life that makes me happy. It doesn’t look very much like the American Dream. But it suits me well. If I could send these letters, and so many more, back in time to my younger self, maybe I wouldn’t have had to wait this long to figure out where I fit in this world. But there is no time machine hidden inside a mailbox. This is my life and I am happy with where I’ve ended up. Would I have wished for other things? Yes. Yes, the life I wanted is so different from the life I have. But I’ve found a happy place in this life and I’m grateful."

Topic: Parenting with an autistic child in the famil
child children parents son kids needs family parent help families special support age parenting adults information child’s mother daughter diagnosis young challenges future diagnosed adult child's raising spectrum difficult hope

"Whenever I went out with my autistic son, I frequently felt like I wasn’t wanted and didn’t belong. This was particularly true of playgroups and playgrounds.  Other adults and children would steer clear of us, despite my best efforts to make us appear welcoming and non-threatening. But that’s hard when your child hums and rocks and doesn’t play, act or talk like the other kids. I did though feel welcome and understood, when I started being in situations with special needs children and their parents. Even when our children didn’t have the same condition and challenges, we had all been through similar trials. We’re all extra patient, we know we don’t have to constantly apologise and explain to each other our children’s unusual language and behaviours. Now that my eldest is attending school, I spend more time alone with my youngest (who doesn’t have any special needs). Today I took him on two outings, to two local playgrounds. He did what normal children did, and so did all the other children at these playgrounds. I spoke to the other parents, and we talked about normal things, “what’s your daughter’s name, how old is she, oh she has lovely hair…”. At first I felt like an imposter, pretending I wasn’t a mother of a special needs child. But gradually I slipped into the role and got the hang of it, and even started to quite enjoy it. I felt like shouting, “hey look at us, we’re normal!” No one was avoiding me or my son, if anything they were actively engaging with us, in a way I’d never really experienced with my eldest because his behaviour scares people off. Whereas I once felt like I belonged nowhere, I now oddly feel like I belong everywhere. I am a mother of a special needs child. I am a mother of a child without special needs. I’ve had the usual concerns for a normally developing child, and the usual concerns for a seriously developmentally delayed child. I am usual! I haven’t yet felt like these two mothering worlds are integrated; when I’m out with both children I have to of necessity, resort to a mother of a special needs child because the eldest requires so much extra attention and care to avoid outing-ending meltdowns. I suspect as my mothering life progresses, that I won’t notice the differences so much, but for now I am keenly aware of it and of how people treat me differently depending on which child is with me."
https://autismandoughtisms.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/mothering-and-belonging/

"These brothers and sisters will be in the lives of family members with special needs longer than  anyone .  Brothers and sisters will be there after parents are      gone and special education services are a distant memory.  If they are provided with support and information, they can help their sibs live dignified lives from      childhood to their senior years. 
Throughout their lives,  brothers and sisters share many of the concerns that parents of children   with special needs experience, including isolation, a need for  information, guilt, concerns about the future, and caregiving demands."

"Chicken Crack Salad 
One of the Iron Gate moms made this salad for us last week. It was so fricking good that I harbored many evil thoughts about hiding the leftovers from my mom and Seymour--and I don't even  like  chicken! I did resort to eating straight from the open leftovers container when I knew they were watching, but since the salad is so obscenely delicious they were not dissuaded, and laid claim to their portions. Sigh. Guess I'll just have to make more. For now I'll just share it with the world!
Curried Chicken Salad 

3 whole (6 split) chicken breasts, bone in, skin on
Olive oil
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups good mayo
1/3 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup Major Grey's chutney
3 Tbs. Curry powder
1 cup medium diced celery ( 2 large stalks)
1/4 cup diced scallions, white and green parts (2 scallions)
1/4 cup raisins
1 cup whole roasted, salted cashews

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub the skin with olive oil. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the meat from the bones, discard skin, and dice the chicken in large bite-size pieces.
For the dressing, combine the mayo, wine, chutney, curry powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a food processor. Process until smooth.
Combine chicken with enough dressing to moisten well. Add the celery, scallions, and raisins, and mix well. Refrigerate for a few hours to allow flavors to blend. Add the cashews and serve at room temperature."

"Conor would always react negatively when he heard the Hershey's Kisses Christmas bells  commercial. The sound of the bells, even the sight of the bells, almost invariably agitated him. Recently I recorded a couple of Frosty the Snowman shows for Conor using our television DVR system. The Hershey's Kisses Christmas bells commercial was included as one of the commercials during the broadcast of the Frosty episodes.  Today I grabbed a coffee from the kitchen to go back upstairs to do some work on my laptop and realized Conor was playing, and replaying several times, the Hershey's Kisses Christmas bells commercial using the television remote control. He actually seemed to be enjoying the sound of the bell music. Sure he was desensitizing but more than that, he seem to actually enjoy the bell music.  He appeared to have learned to enjoy the commercial's bell sounds because he exercised control, literally, over the playing of the commercial, its sounds and images."

case court law legal decision cases geier expert letter rights act hearing evidence information against special claims testimony complaint supreme justice kathleen federal petitioners documents trial omnibus attorney appeal question

Some of the documents deal with the Omnibus Autism Proceeding also known as Michelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The case involved the Cedillo family suing because they believed the MMR vaccine caused Michelle Cedillo's autism.

"A new document  has been uploaded to the Autism Omnibus hearing section by the Special Masters. It regards the Poling case. I want to pick out a couple of sections (thanks to M and MS for this tip): We do note, however, that under the statutory provision in question,information from a Vaccine-Act proceeding may be disclosed if the person who supplied such information provides “express written consent” for such disclosure. 42 U.S.C. 5 300aa-12(d)(4)(A). Thus, for example, in the six autism “test cases” discussed above, we are able to disclose the names of the cases in this pdate, because the families in question have provided such “express written consent.” Therefore, in the case that is the subject of the media reports, if the parties who supplied documents and information in the case provide their written consent, we may then be able to appropriately disclose documents in the case. Until such consent is provided, however, we cannot disclose any information.  We reiterate that this court has issued no decision on the issue of vaccine causation of autism And: In recent weeks, there have been a number of reports in the media concerning a certain Vaccine Act case, currently pending before the court"

"This doesn’t involve the autism cases.  Instead it is about the Hepatitis B omnibus proceeding which is also ongoing.  It does involve some familiar names: Clifford Shoemaker (attorney), Dr. Mark Geier and his son David Geier.   It does give us some insight into the billing practices of these gentlemen. As background I’ll note that Clifford Shoemaker  subpoenaed  blogger Kathleen Seidel of Neurodiversity.com.  He ended up being  sanctioned  for that action. Dr. Mark Geier has been a frequent consultant to Mr. Shoemaker’s cases in the vaccine court."

"This is Leelo's twice-yearly report. Written by the wondeful Supervisor M, posted with her permission. Her detailed notes should give you an idea of where Leelo is, what he is doing, what we are working on, and what his main challenges are. Hopefully there will be some helpful information for families facing similar scenarios. Note: I observed Leelo in the classroom yesterday, and was impressed by how nicely he was thriving and learning in his well-run environment. Particularly amazing was his tolerance of multiple children screaming in his vicinity, as long as he was engaged and on-task. He was still stimming and taking off shoes whenever possible, plus acting out whenever he didn't like what was going on. Though because of his extremely well-structured and 1:1 supervised environment, he did not act out very often. As mentioned below, we need to replicate as much of the class structure and visual supports as we can, in our home. Introduction An important goal for Leelo for the past 2 years has been to increase his ability to access instruction in a classroom environment, and to reduce his need for highly individualized, home-based instruction.  Since  April 2008,  Leelo has been attending Playa Azul School for a full day every day, and his home program has been reduced to 2 afternoons per week (total 4-6 hours).  He adapted quickly to the longer school day, and the increased learning opportunities occurring at school."

"When I was a small boy I went to occupational therapy. They had me go on swings, hammer pegs, climb on ladders, and jump on trampolines. I remember one occupational therapist telling my mom that I had low muscle tone. In this case wouldn’t exercise, including weights, improve my muscle tone? We worked on my vestibular processing so I went from one swing to another instead of stretching, becoming more fit, or becoming more muscular. The result is that I was not fit enough, which is a problem in a mind/body communication deficit. Being fit enables me to tell my responsive body what to do. I work out with a trainer now because I need to have my body learn to be responsive. Now I see where my problems lie.  My soft muscle tone needs to get stronger. My cardio endurance needs to improve and I need more core strength, so I work on everything. Stretching is my most necessary thing and I detest it because it is painful. I will do it because I need to and it is worth the hurt. A lot of my current problems could have been prevented if people had worked on this when I was small. I think it is essential to work on fitness and flexibility for autistic people in a regular program."

"Youth with disabilities tend to have fewer friends and smaller social networks than their peers. And studies find that typical youth are more open to having a friend who has a physical disability than one with an intellectual disability.  
Most of the research about friendship for people with intellectual disabilities is based on the perspectives of caregivers and support workers. 
That’s why a three-year University of Toronto study called  Voices of Youth  is so innovative. 
The project asks youth with intellectual disabilities aged 13 to 24 what friendship and community means to them. 
“Friendship is very important for a happy life,” says David Conforti, a 25-year-old with an intellectual disability who’s a project consultant on the study. “I find it difficult to find new friends my age. We all need to feel connected to other people, that way we feel more safe and comfortable in our communities and lives.” T
he Voices of Youth research involves three in-person interviews, including one in the community and one where participants are asked to invite a friend who will join them in an activity. A videographer is part of the research team."

"We at  The Autism Acceptance Project  will be addressing the following: We need to discuss problems with autism programs, our communities (including schools) and inclusion. There is continued segregation and fissure within the autism community over the notion of recovery and independence. Our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 15, states: Equality Rights 
Marginal note:Equality before and under law and equal protection and benefit of law 
15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. 
Marginal note:Affirmative action programs"

"Sarah Keenan, life skills coach, noted that research has shown that friendship is associated with life satisfaction and good mental health in the general population, while loneliness has negative impacts on our immune system and heart health. Yet children with disabilities tend to have fewer friends and smaller social networks than their peers. Sarah referenced an American study of 11,000 teens that found that “over 50 per cent of students with autism had no contact with friends outside school and were never invited to spend time with friends.” Studies find that typical youth are more open to having a friend who has a physical disability than one with an intellectual disability, she said. However, interactions with youth with disabilities in general are often superficial on the part of typical youth. There is no one definition of friendship and clinicians and researchers want to know more about how youth with disabilities define a good friend"

"It’s been a while since I’ve posted any insect photos.  But it’s autumn, which means that the Monarchs Are On The Move.  A couple of weeks ago I came home and was walking up to the front door when I passed the pair of butterfly bushes ( Buddleia davidii ) and noticed a rather runty-looking Monarch nectaring. Then I did a double-take, and thought to myself, “That’s not a Monarch — THAT’S A VICEROY!”  (This was one of those odd times when I mentally caption dialog, even the all-caps.)  I dashed back to my car to grab my camera, as I didn’t have a photograph of this particular butterfly yet. The Viceroy (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae  Basilarchia archippus ) looks very similar to the Monarch:  it’s an orange butterfly with a black body, black margins the wings, and a few white spots in the margins.  However, its wingspan is smaller (about 3 inches / 80 mm), and the hindwings have a thin stripe running parallel to the outer margin."

Topic: ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) Treatment

"Conclusions   There is a wealth of validated and peer-reviewed studies supporting the efficacy of ABA    methods to improve and sustain socially significant behaviors in every domain, in individuals    with  autism . Importantly, results reported include “meaningful” outcomes such as increased    social skills, communication skills academic performance, and overall cognitive functioning.    These reflect clinically-significant quality of life improvements. While studies varied as to the    magnitude of gains, all have demonstrated long term retention of gains made.   Other major contributions of ABA to the education and treatment of individuals with  autism     include:       •   a large number of empirically-based systematic instruction methods that lead to the        acquisition of skills, and to the decrease/elimination of aberrant behaviors;         •   a technology for systematically evaluating the efficacy of interventions intended to affect       individual learning and behavior; and        •   substantial cost/benefit.       Over 30 years of rigorous research and peer review of applied behavior analysis’ effectiveness    for individuals with  autism  demonstrate ABA has been objectively substantiated as effective    based upon the scope and quality of science."
http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2007/10/autism-quote-of-decade-2nd-place-madsec.html

ABA methods are used to increase and maintain desirable adaptive behaviors, reduce interfering maladaptive behaviors or narrow the conditions under which they occur, teach new skills, and generalize behaviors to new environments or situations. ABA focuses on the reliable measurement and objective evaluation of observable behavior within relevant settings including the home, school, and community. The effectiveness of ABA-based intervention in ASDs has been well documented through 5 decades of research by using single-subject methodology21,25,27,28 and in controlled studies of comprehensive early intensive behavioral intervention programs in university and community settings.
http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/05/misleading-autism-treatment-statements.html

"Verbatim: Three conclusions about autism interventions" "
Five papers published or epublished so far in 2008, along with a sixth which has sat in press all year, have in one way or another reviewed the ABA group designs, sometimes alongside other approaches to autism.  The solitary RCT (where the intended comparison between randomized groups was actually carried out) in the 47-year history of ABA-based autism interventions--a small, largely failed study--is now drowned in an enormous murk of systematic, quasi-systematic, and not-systematic-at-all reviews. At this point in autism and autism advocacy history, no one should be surprised that this phenomenon encompasses dueling meta-analyses."

"So, the use of  privilege  to describe the discrepancy between the majority and the minority is linguistically and rhetorically incorrect.  Perhaps more importantly, it’s also politically damaging.  When you  accuse  someone of being privileged, you are saying they have a benefit they are not entitled to.  This puts that person on the defensive.  Unless they are highly sympathetic to your cause, they are going to resist your  false   accusation  and miss your valid claim of discrepancy of treatment.  You are discredited for making a false accusation; the real meat of your message isn’t even heard.  On the other hand, if the person is highly sympathetic to your cause, they are going to feel  guilty , because they’ve internalized your  false   accusation  and will feel responsible for having a benefit they shouldn’t or, more accurately, for having the benefit you were denied through no fault of their own. 
Whether the individual you accuse of being privileged is sympathetic or not, a statement regarding privilege implies that individual has done something wrong by being “privileged.”  They’ve done nothing wrong (at least, not by  accepting  their “privilege”), because they are being treated fairly.  The wrong is not in the majority having privileges (3 rd  definition again), but in the minority being denied these same privileges.  Thus, the majority isn’t  privileged  (1 st  or 2 nd  definition), the minority is  disadvantaged."

"The purpose of cultural constructionism is to understand the usefulness of cultural constructs. It means that people cannot identify as autistic. That's not correct. See the Example section below. It means there are no differences between autistics and non-autistics. The fact that differences between autistics and non-autistics can be found is not surprising. Differences can probably be found across any behavioral spectrum, regardless of where the spectrum is divided. Differences can be found between men and women; between races; between any two groups of people, in fact. These differences are often found to occur 'in average' (i.e. they can't be generalized), but this is not a requirement of cultural construct theory. It means autism does not have a cause or a treatment. Again, this is not correct. Cultural constructs may have underlying mechanisms which are not only cultural, including but not limited to genetic mechanisms. See the Example section below. Cultural construct theory only applies to 'mild' cases of autism. There is no such limit imposed by cultural construct theory, and there is no non-cultural way to define such a boundary."
http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/05/cultural-construct-misconceptions.html


"Many people want to be perceived as one thing and they work hard to accomplish this goal by wearing certain clothes, affecting certain manners, sharing certain opinions, and creating a façade which they expect others to see and appreciate.  Yet, when their manners and opinions are tested, when they must act, it is often the influence of their personal history and their worldviews that shape their choices, either in defiance of who they were raised to be or in submission to it.  This may or may not resemble how they wish to be perceived. 
When we choose to reach across our differences to find similarities—or when we fail to do so—we show who we are regardless of the first-dimensional affectations we assume.  The community in which we interact is not strictly the autism or autistic community, nor is it strictly the greater autism community.  We interact in a community of peoples with and without disabilities, peoples with many kinds of differences and many kinds of similarities.  Our ability to reach across definitions, labels, and differences defines a meaningful aspect of who we are.  Words are not enough.  We must show ourselves based on our actions."

"I'd like to bring three papers to your attention, all united by their discussion of  coeliac (celiac) disease , that most classic of autoimmune conditions  in the most part  managed by the use of a lifelong gluten-free diet. 
First up are  the papers by Elena Lionetti and colleagues  [1] and  Sabine Vriezinga and colleagues  [2] which unfortunately pour cold water on the notion that the risk of developing coeliac disease (CD) can be somehow mitigated via the use of either the early or delayed introduction of gluten nor seemingly affected by breastfeeding habits. Indeed, as science has known about for sometime, genes and specifically the  HLA genotype  linked to CD, seem to be the important predictors of disease outside of gluten consumption itself."

"I was intrigued to read  the paper by Khandaker and colleagues  [1] (open-access  here ) reporting results based on a longitudinal study that suggested: \" Childhood atopic disorders increase the risk of  psychotic experiences  in adolescence \". 
Bish, bash, Bosch @ Wikipedia  
I've talked about the issue of  atopic disease  and it's potential overlap with something like neurodevelopment before on this blog ( see here ) based on the possibility of a neuro-immune interaction ( i.e.  that our immune system might be involved in many more processes than just fighting infection  as per the microglia work ) as  suggested by Meldrum and colleagues  [2]. The recent paper  from Chang and colleagues  [3] reporting a possible connection between allergic disease and behavioural issues in preschoolers adds to that debate. I very much consider the Khandaker findings to be of a similar ilk in terms of potential mechanisms of effect (accepting though that correlation does not necessarily mean causation). 
In brief, Khandaker  et al  followed several thousand children over the course of their trial (data from  the ALSPAC  cohort which  has just received some good news ), detailing the presence of atopic diseases such as  asthma  and  eczema  of participants at age 10 and any subsequent psychotic experiences at age 13. Various markers linked to inflammation ( C-reactive protein  and  IL-6 ) were also assessed at age 9. It was then a case of comparing those with atopic disease, whether present singularly or combinatorially, with those without atopic disease on whether the risk of a psychotic episode (PE) was more or less likely. And it was more likely in the atopic group; although strangely enough those markers of inflammatory processes did not seem to \" mediate association between atopy and PEs \" bearing in mind that inflammatory markers were not seemingly assessed at the time of the PE.""

"Yes, it was my first official practice as one of the assistant coaches of T-Ball. Here is what I learned:  1. Even if one of the other coaches says they have coached multiple levels of t-ball and baseball before, that doesn't mean they have done it in the last 20 years, or remembered what kids know. Or don't know.  2. Six-year-olds who have never played baseball or T-Ball before have no idea what the field positions are. Or what a base is.  3. 11 out of 12 six-year-olds have never played baseball or T-Ball. At least, on our team that is true.  4. The 1 child who has played before still doesn't know the field positions, or what a base is.  5. 11 out of 12 six-year-olds don't own a baseball glove or hat, and therefore must borrow the coach's.  6. Even if you have no idea what a base is, or where to stand, or how to catch, or even to run around the bases, hitting the ball is fun. So as long as everyone gets to hit the ball, we're all good.""

About 2 minutes and 30 seconds or so into the video what this individual says is rather shocking. He states that the parents of low functioning autistic children wish their kids would 'drop dead'. I wonder why Ari Ne'eman has not complained to youtube or has not gone out of his way to disavow this video that his supporter made. Or does Ne'eman himself believe this? We have seen in the past that  some supporters of neurodiversity  whose blog was linked on the autism hub stated that parents of autistic children who support a cure for their children are like members of the ku klux klan who are forced to raise black children."

"Autism is a spectrum and some like the ASAN supporters who stepped away from their keyboards to try and disrupt a benefit to help autistic children, have  abilities lacking in many severely autistic children and adults. Bob Wright said, much more politely than I would have done, that he wished his more severely impaired grandson had their abilities.  That is all he said. The protesters subscribe to an ideology promoted by a few high functioning adults with autism and Aspergers who oppose the idea of curing autism.  They are not content to oppose cures for themselves.  They oppose cures for other people's children and for other adults more severely impaired then them.  Mr. Leitch also subscribes to this ideology and is opposed to Autism Speaks and Bob Wright.  Kevin Leitch is so tied to this anti-cure ideology that he is willing to  shred whatever remains of his credibility and accuse Bob Wright of being opposed to autistic adults."

It is an election year handout from a government which has consistently opposed a meaningful role for the federal government in ensuring that autistic children and adults in Canada receive the treatment and services they need to live meaningful, healthy lives.   
Parents in Canada have fought for many years with varying levels of success for government coverage of evidence based ABA treatment for autism disorders.  In 2006 former Charlottetown MP Shawn Murphy articulated a REAL National Autism Strategy when he introduced Bill C-304 which was defeated by a Harper Conservative-Bloc Quebecois coalition vote."

"I’ve got to be honest.  I would have never guessed in a million years that when Abbie and I made the trip to the hospital to deliver Noah we’d be brining home a little  boy with Down syndrome . As you can read in Noah’s birth story, we had no idea Noah had Down syndrome until about four hours after he was born.  As  new parents  to a child with Down syndrome we quickly learned all we could about Down syndrome. We Quickly Became “Experts” on Down Syndrome During the first few weeks we learned much about the  physical characteristics of a child born with Down syndrome , the  labs a child born with down syndrome  has to endure, and some of the major  medical concerns for a child born with Down syndrome . We were quickly introduced to the many different  physical ,  occupational , and  feeding therapies  we would soon be spending a lot of time at. But above all of this we fell further in love. Further in love with our new son. Our first son."
http://noahsdad.com/first-video/


"What is Down Syndrome: Genetics If you are a new parent one of your first questions may be “ What is Down syndrome?”  (This by the way, was one of my husbands first questions when Noah was  born .) Down syndrome  (Trisomy 21) is a  chromosomal abnormality  where a child is born with three copies of the  21st chromosome  (Just like in the picture!) Chromosomes hold our genetic information, and there are 23 types of chromosomes. One set of those being your sex chromosomes (X, and Y), and the others labeled 1 through 22. When babies are created, they receive 23 chromosomes from their mom contained in her egg and 23 chromosomes from their dad contained in his sperm, totaling 46 chromosomes. Children with Down syndrome are born with an extra 21st chromosome. Three Types Of Down Syndrome: 1. Nondisjunction:  This is the most common reason. Cells containing 46 chromosomes are split equally to create eggs and sperm, which then contain 23 chromosomes. Nondisjunction means that the cells did not equally divide the genetic information. This creates a sperm or egg that contains 24 chromosomes with two copies of the 21st chromosome. That egg/sperm joins with a typical egg/sperm with 23 chromosomes making a cell that has 47 chromosomes and three copies of the 21st chromosome. This is known as Trisomy 21. This is a  random  occurrence."

"Lasting neuropathological changes in rat brain after intermittent neonatal administration of thimerosal. 
Folia Neuropathol. 2010;48(4):258-69.  Olczak M, Duszczyk M, Mierzejewski P, Wierzba-Bobrowicz T, Majewska MD. 
Department of Pharmacology and Physiology of the Nervous System, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, ul. Sobieskiego 9, Warsaw, Poland. 
Abstract 
Thimerosal, an organomercurial added as a preservative to some vaccines, is a suspected iatrogenic factor, possibly contributing to paediatric neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. We examined the effects of early postnatal administration of thimerosal (four i.m. injections, 12 or 240 μg THIM-Hg/kg, on postnatal days 7, 9, 11 and 15) on brain pathology in Wistar rats. Numerous neuropathological changes were observed in young adult rats which were treated postnatally with thimerosal. They included: ischaemic degeneration of neurons and \"dark\" neurons in the prefrontal and temporal cortex, the hippocampus and the cerebellum, pathological changes of the blood vessels in the temporal cortex, diminished synaptophysin reaction in the hippocampus, atrophy of astroglia in the hippocampus and cerebellum, and positive caspase-3 reaction in Bergmann astroglia.  These findings document neurotoxic effects of thimerosal, at doses equivalent to those used in infant vaccines or higher, in developing rat brain, suggesting likely involvement of this mercurial in neurodevelopmental disorders."

"Background : Although the cellular mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of autism are not understood, a growing number of studies have suggested that localized inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) may contribute to the development of autism. Recent evidence shows that IL-6 has a crucial role in the development and plasticity of CNS. 
Methods : Immunohistochemistry studies were employed to detect the IL-6 expression in the cerebellum of study subjects. In vitro adenoviral gene delivery approach was used to over-express IL-6 in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Cell adhesion and migration assays, DiI labeling, TO-PRO-3 staining and Immunofluorescence were used to examine cell adhesion and migration, dendritic spine morphology, cell apoptosis and synaptic protein expression respectively. 
Results : In this study, we found that IL-6 was significantly increased in the cerebellum of autistic subjects. We investigated how IL-6 affects neural cell development and function by transfecting cultured mouse cerebellar granule cells with an IL-6 viral expression vector. We demonstrated that IL-6 over-expression in granule cells caused impairments in granule cell adhesion and migration but had little effect on the formation of dendritic spines or granule cell apoptosis. However, IL-6 over-expression stimulated the formation of granule cell excitatory synapses, without affecting inhibitory synapses. 
Conclusions:  Our   results provide further evidence that aberrant IL-6 may be associated with autism. In addition, our results suggest that the elevated IL-6 in the autistic brain could alter neural cell adhesion, migration and also cause an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory circuits. Thus, increased IL-6 expression may be partially responsible for the pathogenesis of autism."

"Loving Lampposts  is a new documentary film by filmaker and autism parent Todd Drezner.Here’s a blurb from their website to give you an idea about the film: What would you call a four year old who caresses all the lampposts in the park? Quirky? Unusual? Or sick? 
Such labels are at the center of the debate about autism: is it a disease or a different way of being—or both? In Loving Lampposts, we witness this debate and meet the parents, doctors, therapists, and autistic people who are redefining autism at a moment when it’s better known than ever before. Motivated by his son’s diagnosis, filmmaker Todd Drezner explores the changing world of autism and learns the truth of the saying, “if you’ve met one autistic person, you’ve met one autistic person.” I put it on my Netflix list (you can too:  link ) right after reading the review on  The Thinking Person’s Guide to Autism  and the interview with the director on  Neurotribes .  Netflix doesn’t carry it yet, but with luck I may have a copy soon.  One can  purchase a copy  as well. If you are interested in what Todd Drezner has to say, he has the first in a series of articles up on the Huffington Post:  Learning to Embrace Autism . For more on what the film is about, here are a series of video clips the produces have made available: Opening sequence with director Todd Drezner introducing autism spectrum disorder through his son, Sam"

"There’s a list of books going around Facebook.  Purportedly compiled by the BBC, which has supposedly found that most people have read, on average, six of them.  Only according to a friend who went looking, the BBC compiled no such list; the meme seems to be some kind of conflation of the BBC’s “Big Read” list which is the result of a poll of Brits’ favorite books, and some apocryphal statistic about how little the average adult actually reads. So relax everyone, it’s just fun; it’s not actually a judgment of how well-read you are.  Nevertheless, my Facebook friends had some interesting and useful banter about what made the list and important books and authors that didn’t make the list. Here’s my own list of 100 important books that didn’t make the Facebook/BBC list, in no particular order of preference.  It’s a highly idiosyncratic and in no way judgmental list, incredibly biased towards stuff I’ve read and stuff I like, or found particularly formative.  I haven’t read all of these; a few are things I think I should have read and haven’t. If you like, give it the Facebook treatment and see how you do.  (Copy and paste into a comment, star what you’ve read.)  Tell me your own–what are your most important books that haven’t made anyone’s list? 1. The Hunchback of Notre Dame–Victor Hugo"

"This morning I have done the following 
 Showered and dressed and fed Missy 
 Washed and dressed and fed myself 
 Picked up and cleared away all the rubbish, dirty dishes and dirty clothes 
 Washed a load of clothes 
 Washed a load of dishes 
 Cleared and cleaned the kitchen sink and table 
And yet if asked, I would say  I had done nothing. 
My house still looks like a pinata filled with books and toys and clothes to be ironed and  DUST has exploded in every room of my house ! 
I truly believe that a new view on reality hits you when you have a child with autism and even if Anthea or Kim & Aggie wouldn't set foot in your house, 
you don't really care :)"

"Two nights ago she missed her nap and so fell asleep at 7:00 in the middle of her dinner. She slept up until I woke her at 7:00 the next morning, which I took as an opportunity to readjust her daily clock. Last night I took her to bed with me at 9:00. She went to sleep, finally, at 9:45--which is greatly preferable to 11 PM or 12:30 PM, even though I missed out on evening free time. (I figure Seymour and I can alternate evenings until we get her trained to go down at this much more humane hour.) So, Mali slept in my bed, Leelo slept in his old bed in Iz's room, and Iz happily slept in Leelo's new bed in his new room. Right now getting them to sleep is more important than where they sleep."

The kitchen was a holy mess from breakfast, but OK, I couldn't be an ingrate. I got a whole 11 hours of sleep, and felt amazing all day. Ever get to sleep late?"

OregonLive.com  reports that an 18 year old man in Oregon described as severely autistic and non verbal will be charged with murder in the death of  a woman who lived with his father.  The district attorney processing the charge has indicated that there will likely be issues concerning  the young man's competency to stand trial.

"Those  who don't believe that autism can be a deadly disorder, who believe that wandering from home and drowning  is not a problem that should be associated with autism, will want to skip reports of yet another death by drowning of an autistic child that wandered from the safety of his home.  This time the drowning occurred in Cushing, Oklahoma. As reported on  Oklahoma's Own,  NewsOn6 .com the child's death has been ruled accidental after investigation by the Department of Human Services and the State Medical Examiner's Office: 
\" Death Of Autistic Boy In Cushing Ruled Accidental ... criminal charges will not be filed as a result of the death of 4-year-old Blake Murrell.  Murrell drowned in a pond within Memorial Park in Cushing on April 19. His body was found hours after he was reported missing from the family's home nearby. The D.A.'s office says a thorough investigation was conducted by the Cushing Police Department, the Department of Human Services and the State Medical Examiner's Office.   A statement released by Lee's office states \"the evidence gathered does not justify the filing of criminal charges. The evidence indicates this was an unfortunate, tragic accident. \"

"In mid-April, pursuant to a neurologist's advice, we started Conor on Lamotrogine, an anti-eleptic drug which is reputed to have benefited many people suffering from seizure activity.  Hours after receiving his third dosage Conor suffered his second Grand Mal seizure, that we know of, since his first in November 2012.  Last week he became extremely drowsy and last Friday April 26, 2013, our family doctor recommended we reduce the dosage (the neurologist is out of town until May 13, 2013). Later, early Friday evening Conor's condition worsened noticeably and a rash had developed.  Rash development is a known warning sign of a negative Lamotrogine reaction and Conor was taken to the DECH (Doctor Everett Chalmers Hospital) emergency where he received immediate attention and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, the ICU.  Conor's reactions have been very serious with risks in several key categories including risk to his kidneys and liver. Thanks to our family doctor and the excellent care and attention of the Emergency and ICU personnel our Buddy is still with us. Without their help he probably would not be.  Conor is still in the ICU but is expected to transfer to pediatrics in the next day or two. He has improved dramatically."

"Awww, Baby's First Ear Infection Brought Mali to Dr. G because she still hasn't shaken lingering nasal congestion from that cold of 3+ weeks back. He says she's fine, but that she has an infection in her left ear. Since it is red but not bulging or oozing pus, he was amenable to calling in an antibiotic prescription, on the understanding that she doesn't need it now, but that I am to go get it if she becomes noticeably fussy or spikes a fever."

"He throws his toy to the floor with a piercing shriek and launches himself into my arms.  His sobbing begins immediately as he buries his face into my shoulder as if my body can block the devastating sensations which took him by complete surprise.  Knowing full well that it cannot, I shift his little boy form in my lap and rest his head against my sternum.  I am nonplussed at his new found awareness of my ability —and desire— to soothe him. His slender frame shudders with sobs as he tries to connect his tightly clenched fist with the side of his head; I press my hand against his ear as a buffer.  The blows from his deceptively small hands reign down hard upon my knuckles; I press my hand harder against his skull hoping the pressure might ease the lancing pain."

"Joy has developed four different positive responses for one particular request. She tucks her chin down and presents the top of her head. She leans in and presents one side of her face. She doesn't incline her head at all, but makes a puckery motion and sound with her mouth. Or - rare but lovely - she leans in and turns up her mouth with a puckery smile. Kiss for mommy?  Kiss for daddy?  Kiss your big sister? We don't know why she chooses any given response at any given time.  But it's almost always one of these, especially at bedtime when it's part of the routine.  Melts us into our shoetops. What a sweetheart."
