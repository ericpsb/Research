This folder contains code to scrape blogs, analyze
them using topic modeling, and display the results in
various ways. The code is split up into three parts, with
two additional folders for information and resources.

"blogscrapers" - a folder containing the python scripts
used to scrape each blog, the various JSON files generated
by these scrapers, the python script used to combine
JSON files from different blogs into one file, and this
comprehensive file

"topicmodeling" - a folder containing the R Scripts used to
perform the topic modeling in addition to python scripts
that convert CSV files into JavaScript files when necessary;
the CSV files themselves are housed in this folder, but the
JavaScript files get transferred to the "visualization"
folder

"visualization" - a folder containing d3 and HTML files that
use the JavaScript files generated by the topic modeling
(housed in this folder) to present the results of this
analysis

"generalinfo" - a folder containing both information about
the blogs being used and a comprehensive flowchart that
describes how files in different folders interact to
produce the Cosine Visualization

"reading" - a folder containing a list of papers and some
papers themselves that are pertinent to the project
