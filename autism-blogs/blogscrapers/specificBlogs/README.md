This folder contains the Scrapers and Python scripts currently
used to create the necessary JSON files in addition to a
multitude of different JSON files generated along the way

that are no longer working properly and old JSON files for the
corresponding blogs

"Done" - a folder containing Scrapers that are functioning
properly and several JSON files for the corresponding blogs

"merge.py" - a Python script that extracts the current JSON
files from the blog folders and combines them into one file

data from each blog (missing from the Git repository)
