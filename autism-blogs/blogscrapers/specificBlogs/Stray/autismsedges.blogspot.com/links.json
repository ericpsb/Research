She (or rather, her doctors) outfoxed lung cancer in 1983. Last month mom and the medical folks cheated death again when the hospital where she'd been admitted found a way to treat her antibiotic-resistant pneumonia. She's back home, on oxygen, continuing her long trajectory toward the inevitable transition to death.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, our girl is blossoming into young adulthood \u2013 young womanhood \u2013 of the non-neurotypical persuasion.\n\nOn spring break she went shopping for a prom dress. She's determined to go and has been practicing her dance moves. She's been accepted to four of the six colleges she applied for, and offered scholarhips at each of them. It's easy to think of this as success \u2014 it sure looks like it.\n\nLike so many high school seniors, NT and not, she is in the throes of trying to divine which offer to take, or whether to take a gap/bridge year to grow a bit more in her social and emotional dimensions, to breathe a little after the long uphill march that was K-12, to relax into the fullness of life before taking on the next challenge of navigating college.\n\nAnd yet she is still autistic \u2014 or rather she has a great many of the characteristics that our culture associates with a label we call autism. We believe that she will always be, by our culture's practices of naming, autistic. \u00a0She still has all of the challenges that made K-12 so difficult, and that will most likely continue to affect her in her post-secondary life, be it a gap year, or college, or work beyond these. \n\nSo I am also establishing her now, unequivocally, as a person with a disability. That means applying, at last, for SSI. Establishing Medicaid for her. And inviting a whole new array of acronyms into our vocabulary. Where once there was the alphabet soup of PDD-NOS, ASD, OCD, ODD, ABA, and RDI, now there is OPWDD and ACCES-VR, and certainly more to come. \n\nAnd where we had always looked almost exclusively at her potential and workarounds and accommodations, now we are conceding that there are undeniable and persistent limitations for our girl.\n\nHer affect is flat. It is hard for her to do the smiling required by neurotypicals, and that is especially expected of females. She is often, quite frankly, what most observers would call rude. She longs to be fashionable, but wears a self-selected, sensory-friendly uniform of stretchy yoga pants and ultra-soft t-shirts. Hearing in any setting remains challenging, and in noisy settings it is deeply frustrating. Sudden loud noises still evoke a startle response. Her amygdala still works overtime despite the psycho-pharmology Western medicine has to offer.\n\nSo while we are celebrating her enormous accomplishments we are ready to concede that there are many things that are not likely to change, that are not likely to get easier for her, and that are, in all probability, not going away. \n\nWhen I wrote here about the challenges of applying for SSI awhile back, I heard from some of my most beloved readers dismay that I would be doing this when she was such a success story. \u00a0And when I posted on my Facebook account about our girl's college acceptances, I had hundreds of messages of congratulations. \u00a0It may be the most popular FB post I'd ever written. \n\nAnd so the question emerged: Why would anyone need SSI when they're a \"success\" story?\n\nAnd that's the problem with narratives: most language pushes us out of the messy ambiguity that is life among the living into tidy categories of the fixed, of the orderly, of the conclusion. Our stories can push us to make ourselves and others into tales of this or that: of \u00a0success/failure, of neurodiversity advocate or curebie, of autistic or NT, and so on. \u00a0If we are this (succeeding in school with substantial supports) how can we possibly be that (in need of SSI and of other accommodations)?\n\nSo I find myself advocating for \"and\" \u2014 that single conjunction in English that makes space for it all \u2014 for this and for that. For the fullness of being rather than the sharp relief of this or that. \n\nParadoxically this praise of \"and\" also requires an embrace of this or that. Otherwise we'd be leaving out one of the most important tools we have: differentiation. Like most people I know, I relish categories and certainty. I sometimes like labels and the shorthand of diagnoses. They can be useful in so many ways.\n\nBut my girl's trajectory has taught me one thing for sure: one can never really know what something is, only how something looks and feels right now, in its own singular context, in this own particular moment which slips away into another moment faster than you can blink. The comfort of this or that, for all its usefulness, can be a trap that forestalls possibility. This and that has been the gateway to our girl's successes and to her failures, to her possibilities and to her limitations.\n\n\n\nBut it doesn't look like \nshe's dying, does it?\n\nAnd on the other side of the continent, back out in California, my mother is dying the slow death of dementia. And I guess you know what I'm going to say now: that's she's also living the slow death of dementia.\n\nThis version of living is not the life of independence and freedom and privacy that we so love in North American culture. It's not our culture's vision of the good life (or even of the good death). It's a life that has pronounced and visible limits: the tether of the tube to the oxygen tank, the presence of caregivers in what was once her own private domain of home, a routine of medications to slow the progression of brain degeneration and calm her anxiety about the rapid diminution of her functioning.\n\nThe trouble for me, and for my family \u2014 and especially for my mother and my daughter as they are leaving and blossoming, each in their own ways \u2014 is this peculiar North American idea of success. Fantasies of independence, capacity, and individual freedom as these very measures of success damn our lived and shared experience; devalue our communities, connections, and interdependence; and thus displace so much of our full, robust, challenging, and rewarding lives.\n\nThe spaces of \"and\" are not easy to find and occupy, but I look for them wherever and whenever I can. I hope you'll continue to join me there, and here, at Autism's Edges as we move along through time and the stories we tell about theses times.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2016/04/in-praise-of-and.html", "title": "\nIn Praise of \"And\"\n"},

Halloween is not my favorite holiday either. At her school they have a Halloween Carnival for half the day today, so I'm not quite sure how this is going to play out.  I sent an email and asked them to treat her as though she were a Seventh Day Adventist \u2014 one of many groups who don't celebrate the holiday.Actually I think Sweet M is becoming a Seventh Day Adventist.A few weeks back she told me that she was a vegetarian.  And I said yes, you are.  Except that since you don't eat any vegetables, maybe you aren't.  Do you want to eat vegetables?  Eew no, vegetables are gross and despicable, she said. Well, I said, then maybe you're a pastaterian.So if school goes okay, then we only have tonight's Greenwich Village Halloween Parade to get through.  The parade starts just under our windows, so it's a night of thunderous drumming, chanting, and spooky puppets.The trick will be to find a treat in all of this \u2014 other than Sweet M's intrinsic sweetness.\u2022   \u2022   \u2022Later the same day . . .I was wrong \u2014 the Halloween Festivities planned for school were all day long.  And it wasn't even 10 a.m. before they'd sent Sweet M home because she didn't want to go into the auditorium with the costumed kids.She didn't flip out, she didn't scream, she just wanted to do something else.What is going on here?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.1010wins.com/pages/117430.php?contentType=4&contentId=232306"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/10/trick-or-treat.html", "title": "\nTrick or Treat\n"},

Personally, I'm Field- Day-impaired because we didn't have this sort of outing at the schools I went to. I think it must be an East Coast thing, or private school thing, because we didn't do this in Southern California public schools.But Sweet M will not go to Field Day.  She has, in fact, been asked to stay home.After the episode at the Central Park Zoo, the school is a little wary of taking her out in public. I can understand that, though I'm not sure that leaving her out is a long-term solution.But since Sweet M has never been much for gym class, or competitive sports, her exile from Field Day is certainly not a tragedy. Not even a bad thing. She's thrilled about not going. And I'm delighted to have a weekday with her. I can take the day off, so I suggested we go to the Natural History Museum for the day.  There's the Darwin show, which has tortoises, and the butterfly conservatory with all the live butterflies.Her response: So lay-aim! So lay-aim! I am NOT going to the Natural History Museum!Okay, so what do you want to do?I want to go to the zoo.Which zoo?The zoo with the seals and the rain forest.She wants to go back to the Central Park Zoo.

{"date": "Saturday, May 06, 2006", "body": "\nAt every edge that autism touches, it transforms our social institutions.Take the case, noted in the New York Times this morning, where the Cleveland Bar Association has sued Brian Woods, an autism father who represented his son in court to fight for a free and appropriate public education.After Woods prevailed on behalf of his son, the local bar association sued him for the \"unauthorized practice of law.\"What's an autism parent supposed to do?We know that the resources for our kids are few, and that what little there is goes to those with the means to afford it \u2014 either by purchasing the services outright, or suing to have them provided.The Times article also mentions that Brian Woods, the non-lawyer father who sued also happens to be an adjunct professor at a community college. Adjunct professors are academe's version of migrant labor \u2014 underpaid, uninsured, and without job security. Adjunct faculty members typically teach five times as many courses per year as regular fulltime faculty do, and even then they seldom make even the median income in the country, let alone the sort of income one ought to be able to expect after having five to ten years of graduate education.Since 1975 instiutions of higher education have been eliminating full time tenure-track faculty positions at the rate of 1% a year. It doesn't sound like much, but when you do the math it adds up. Over the past thirty years, that's a 30 percent decline in fulltime faculty lines. In higher education, we call this \"adjunctification.\"Instead of hiring fulltime faculty members, colleges and universities have been cutting costs in the classroom and hiring expensive administrators and presidents with a mandate to keep the cost of teaching labor low. If things continue in this direction, chances are that if you're saving money for your child to go to a top university, that your tuition dollars won't even buy them access to the fulltime faculty members, the very faculty whose prestige helps ensure the university's ranking and appeal.In the case of Brian Woods there is an interesting convergence of autism and adjunctification: a highly educated, probably grossly underpaid individual acted on behalf of his family through the legal system \u2014 and won. He skipped the middlemen and women of the legal profession and advocated for his son. Now they want to shut him up \u2014 him and other autism parents \u2014 so this can't happen again.Next month the Supreme Court may hear a case in which another autism family \u2014 the Winkelman's \u2014 had been representing their son in court. A federal appeals court ordered the Winkelmans to hire an attorney, or have their case dismissed. Justice John Paul Stevens issued a stay in the matter, preventing the court from dismissing the family's case.With legal estimates starting at $60,000, the Winkelmans, like the Woods family, did not have the means to hire legal representation for their son. If they couldn't represent him, then he would be denied due process under the IDEA.This is something to keep an eye on.Autism's edges \u2014 where the activism never ends.     \u2022     \u2022     \u2022For more information on the labor issues in higher education, visit Workplace, A Journal for Academic Labor.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022   special education  \u2022   IDEA - Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  \u2022  academic labor     \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/06/us/06parents.html", "http://www.cust.educ.ubc.ca/workplace/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/05/autism-meets-adjunctification.html", "title": "\nAutism Meets Adjunctification\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 11, 2006", "body": "\nNear the end of a spectacular school year in which she moved from reading not at all to reading at a first grade level; from having no friends, to being among the most popular girls in her class; from simple arithmetic to two column subtraction with regrouping, Sweet M is having a series of setbacks.It started a couple of weeks ago, when she had a meltdown at school during the diversity day assembly and her father had to go and pick her up. There have been intermittent meltdowns two and three times each week since.After the first couple of meltdowns, her psychiatrist and I hypothesized that her Paxil dose might be too high. We reasoned that since I have a strong response to the increased sunlight in the spring, that she might be having a similar problem. So we decided to try to take her dose down just a little -- reducing it by 5 mg.It seems that this wasn't the right move. My intuition was wrong.On Wednesday her class went on a field trip to the Central Park Zoo. When the zoo's childhood educator was asking her group questions, she had to be the one to answer. When she was required to let other children answer, she flipped out.Since I wasn't there I don't know exactly what happened, but it took three adults to restrain her and she was kicking and screaming at the top of her lungs, \"Help me help me they're hurting me, please get the police, someone please get the police.\"When a child is screaming \"help me, they're hurting me, get the police\" in the middle of Central Park, that's what people do: they get the police. Or in this case, they got park security. The teachers found themselves in the horrible situation of having to explain that they weren't abusing Sweet M.Of course her teachers had already called us to come and get her, interrupting me during a conference call about the contract that seems to never quite come through, but that is another story. Sweet M's father raced by cab to pick her up, but there was incredible traffic in midtown, so it took nearly 45 minutes for him to get there. Meanwhile they had to call me back several times and I could hear Sweet M screaming and wailing and screaming, \"I wanna answer the question, I wanna answer the question.\"By phone her teacher and I strategized about how to get her in the cab when her father finally made it through the traffic. While one doesn't want to reward meltdowns, there had to be something at the end of the cab ride to make it worth coming home.I decided to promise that we'd go to the pet store and find her a pet. She's been wanting a pet. Her teacher said, \"Wow, that would work. You're pulling out the stops.\" We thought this was a great idea, so she put Sweet M on the phone.I told her that when her father brought her home that she and I would go to the pet store and pick out a pet.She started screaming at the top of her lungs, even louder than before, \"No no no \u2014 no pet \u2014 I wanna answer the question.\"And what was the question?The question was \"What can you get in a rain forest?\"Sweet M's answer \u2014 the answer that she was desperate to share \u2014 was \"chocolate.\"She knows that chocolate comes from the rain forest because of our field trip to Hershey, where we'd seen a film about cacao harvesting, and bought a book for her class about what comes from the rainforest. Chocolate and cacao is her special area of expertise, and someone else answered with her answer: chocolate.Her father arrived, and she was still hysterical, desperate to get back into the group, back into her partner, back into the rain forest exhibition.So he took her in. Apparently once she was inside, she was crying, and then she screamed out the word \"chocolate\" \u2014 answered the question \u2014 and then said she wanted to go home.My question:  What hurts?Not knowing what to do for your child hurts.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022   special education   \u2022   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   family life  \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/05/what-hurts.html", "title": "\nWhat Hurts?\n"},

He retrieved it so we could think about it, and ask her about it. Our conversation went like this . . .Me: These people look sad.  Why are they sad?Her: Because they are waiting for a contract.Me: What will happen when the contract comes?Her: The building will blow down.Me: Why do you think the building will blow down?Her: I don't want to talk about it.Obviously I'm not an art therapist or we would have gotten farther.The sunshine is happy enough, but check out the ferocious cloud, blowing on the flames coming out of the chimney. The contract is the rectangle between the weathervane and the chimney. And look at all of those sad people. And the sad dog. The only happy creature in this picture is the smiling cat in the bottom right hand window \u2014 famous, as cats are, for their ability to thrive on their own. And while all the other figures are sad, only the little girl on the left is crying. (If you click on the image, it will pop-up as a bigger picture that's easier to see.)The background to her drawing is that I have been in negotiations on a consulting contract for almost 3 months, and it has created some financial tensions that we have been waiting for this to come in. I've turned down all kinds of other projects as I'd agreed to take on this consulting project, we've been just hanging on by a thread as the negotiations drag on.One of the institutions involved in the negotiations is a major cultural institution in the city, and they have all the time in the world. They have third century BCE cuneiform tablets in their collections, and it sometimes seems that they'd be willing to wait several millennia to close a deal and cut a deposit check.I don't know what Sweet M thinks about the contract \u2014 I was stunned that she was even aware that there is a contract in negotiation \u2014 but she seems to think that it will rock her world in all of the wrong ways, when in fact it should make all of our lives much easier.She could also be picking up on the anxieties of our neighbor, who very anxiously shared the information that a giant apartment tower may be under consideration for the two lots next to where we live, so our apartment may lose all of its light and its one Manhattan canyon view. Apparently an international real estate development corporation, owned by the privately held Carlyle Group, has their eye on the properties adjacent to where we live.And then there is the fact that the playground across the street from our home is now torn up, under renovation in a long overdue process that won't be completed until September 2007.Finally, of course, there is the fact that we often lose sight of \u2014 that Sweet M saw the twin towers collapse twelve blocks from here.In her world, buildings do get blown down.The more colorful marker pen drawing was made on the day of her school music and art show. Normally she is very much a ham . . . belting out the musical numbers with her class. But this year she stood behind her teacher and refused to sing. Then she didn't want to show off her art. And her father did not show up at the performance or art show.She did not want to be in the noisy, bustling crowd of parents and kids, so we went up to the quiet of her classroom and made drawings while we waited for the art show to end and for the teachers to come back. She drew the house first, then the clouds, then the sunshine, then the family on the right. In the middle of drawing the family on the right, she said, \"Nope, wrong.\" and crossed it out. Then she drew the idealized family on the left. Then she drew the spiral, and crossed it out.The next day, a family friend who is a therapist asked Sweet M to tell her about the spiral in the drawing. M said, \"It's a wormhole.\" My friend asked, \"Wow, it's a great wormhole. Can you tell me about wormholes?\" And Sweet M said, \"They suck up everything.\"What else hurts?It hurts when you can't seem to make your family, your neighborhood \u2014 your world \u2014 work well enough to make your child feel safe, secure, protected.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022   special education   \u2022   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   family life  \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/05/what-else-hurts.html", "title": "\nWhat Else Hurts?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 14, 2006", "body": "\nAfter a fairly challenging couple of weeks over here at Autism's Edges, we've arrived to a quiet Mother's Day, with the traditions of school-made presents, and Mom sleeping in, and breakfast in bed (sort of).Sweet M made me a pink, pink card where her spirals don't seem to be gaping wormholes, and her heart is filled with a smiling face. And she and her father made Pillsbury pop-up biscuits (in our household these biscuits are a gourmet, cholesterol-filled treat saved for special occasions) and coffee and ricotta cheese and strawberry jam for breakfast.On Friday we met with Sweet M's psychiatrist, Dr. B, to talk about all that has been going on for Sweet M. I'd invited her classroom teachers, the two heroic women who adore her as much as I do and lived through the episode in Central Park with only a few bruises. I had the intuition that Sweet M's teachers would have more information, and that all of their insights would be helpful. I wasn't sure they'd be able to make it, but both of them did.I'd emailed Dr. B in advance to let him know that I'd invited them and that we might, depending on their availability, be meeting him en masse. Even so, Dr. B was a bit taken aback when he sized up the size of our group \u2014 M's teacher, her assistant teacher, her father, me and Sweet M.Apparently he'd been planning on meeting with Sweet M alone, though I had no way of knowing that, as he's never done that before. Although he's not someone who annoys easily, or shows annoyance easily, I'd say he was annoyed. As we all headed up the stairs to his office, he commented about me being the leader of the pack. Ouch.I don't like be characterized, even accurately, as an overbearing, controlling mother. But sometimes I am. When I'm desperate to know what to do for my child, I rally all the resources I can find.Taking the approach of playing it as it lays, he met with all of us. M's teachers did most of the talking \u2014 telling us in detail about the last three weeks at school: M's increased concern about odors, her aversion to seeing things out of place (food on the floor in one classroom), her need to answer questions, her need to have things her way.It was oddly reassuring to hear these two amazing women \u2014 who spend as much time with Sweet M as I do \u2014 share the stories of the difficulties of the past three weeks as Dr. B listened intently, intermittently asking for clarifications and details. There are people in the world who are as concerned about \u2014 and committed to \u2014 Sweet M as I am. They reminded me of how important it is to remember that, as other writers have point out, \"mother is a verb.\"Dr. B's assessment was that what we've all be seeing is a recurrence of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms that we originally sought his help with, and that we'd need to adjust Sweet M's medication. The Focalin, which helps her attention, can increase anxiety. And she's grown in height and weight, so the Paxil dose might have become too low \u2014 even before we'd tested taking it lower. So we're adjusting upward on the Paxil, at least for the moment.At the end of the meeting he said he was glad to have heard from the teachers. And I was glad that I can be, from time to time, a controlling, overbearing mom.In the end, mother can be a verb, and all of them \u2014 her teachers, doctors, and therapists \u2014 are involved in nurturing activities that are forms of mothering.

{"date": "Saturday, May 20, 2006", "body": "\nThe thirteen-minute documentary Autism Every Day that premiered at an Autism Speaks fundraising event has stirred up considerable controversy in the autism community, highlighting the fragility of some of the alliances that we have built to sustain ourselves and our families.As I've read some of the commentaries, I've been doing what I frequently coach Sweet M on:Breathe in . . . 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . . Breathe out . . . 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . .  4 . . .I liked the film. Yes, as has been pointed out, it probably ought to be called Autism Moms Speak. And yes, it's a portrayal of the challenges that face autism families with little if anything describing the unique satisfactions that come from parenting a child in the spectrum, no doubt with the goal of evoking pity and donor dollars. And yes, it is heartbreaking \u2014 and not a little disturbing \u2014 to hear a mother describe her suicidal-homicidal ideation within earshot of the autistic child whom she identifies as the source of her despair.And still, I liked the film.Some people have described Autism Every Day as a pity party, where the mothers who are profiled (and by extension, their families) are set up as objects of pity in an attempt to drum up donor dollars, much the way that maudlin Save the Children commercials on late night television attempt to tug at our heart and purse strings. And that's probably true, too.And still, I like the film.I liked hearing about the challenges that other autism moms face. And while I've never contemplated driving off the George Washington Bridge \u2014 as one of the moms in Autism Every Day reveals \u2014 that is probably only because I don't have a car. I have felt that despair \u2014 especially, but not only \u2014 in the days before I knew there was something called an autism community.During the Chinese cultural revolution such revelations were called \"speaking bitterness.\" And in the women's movement, it was called consciousness raising. The goal is to build awareness, understanding, and solidarity. Autism parents, and autistic people, and autistic parents each have their anguish \u2014 and triumphs \u2014 to share.At one point I was interested in thinking about autism parenting as an extreme sport \u2014 extreme parenting. When I heard Susan Senator read from her book Making Peace with Autism, she mentioned that the earlier title of the book included something about Extreme Parenting. But her publisher wanted a more upbeat title, and Susan described how she and her husband joked about acquiescing to the publisher's request, and then making peace with the title Making Peace with Autism.  Publishers, like Hollywood film studios, are often in the business of manufacturing happy endings.We live in a culture that requires a kind of instantaneous transformation: lemons are to be churned into lemonade even before we taste the sourness that life can sometimes provide. The writer Michael Ventura suggests that this is part and parcel of a consumer culture that needs to render everything appealing and uniform. I'm as guilty as the next, dubbing my own little autist Sweet M, when she is, often as not, sweet and sour.Do we want to have our representations of ourselves, and our lives, and our children be subjected to some representational straitjacket issued by the Department of Silver Linings, where every image is tested for its sunny-ness factor?Of course this is not a new debate. It goes on in nearly all struggles for social and economic justice \u2014 the debate over positive images. Do we want to insist on positive images \u2014 role models \u2014 in the interest of counteracting the stereotypical representations of oppressed groups? Or do we want to encourage complex, multidimensional depictions of our experiences, and of the experiences of our children? I guess you know where I'd stand on that.Parenting kids on or near the spectrum requires walking a fine line between pity and piety, two words with the same root. With pity, one looks down. And with piety, one looks up. No one likes to be the object of pity \u2014 those who are pitied are looked down upon; they are render pathetic. And yet to avoid this, sometimes I feel that some of our representations of ourselves and our children risk running toward the pious, marked by a sense of duty and self-sacrifice that is, for me, equally discomforting.I long for an intersubjectivity that relies on equity and equality, where I'm neither pitiful nor noble in my parenting, but a person breathing in and breathing out, and sometimes reminding my own Sweet and Sour M to do the same.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022   special education   \u2022   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   family life \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/sponsoredevents/autism_every_day.php", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://www.autismvox.com/its-just-not-autism-speaking/", "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/05/more-about-autism-every-day.html", "http://www.susansenator.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/05/between-pity-and-piety.html", "title": "\nBetween Pity and Piety\n"},

We were thrilled when she was offered a spot, but last year was really tough for her there (more on that in a future post) and when we had her triennial neuro-psych evaluation done this past summer it was clear that she has been losing ground academically, and in other ways as well.The most difficult thing is that despite the fact that she has an astonishing visual memory\u2014and almost no verbal memory unless the words are learned as rote phrases\u2014her school was using the Wilson Fundamentals reading program with her for two years. I think Wilson was simply too auditory-acoustic-phonetic based for her. She was really struggling every single night doing her homework. But like the trooper she is, she'd do it, no matter how hard it was for her.After I read the neuropsych, I consulted with educational specialist Susan S. to get her advice on how I could help sweet M. learn how to read.Susan told me to start a sight word program immediately (that was mid-October), so that's what we've been doing. I downloaded a set of Dolch cards. I got mine from Mrs. Perkins classroom, a retired first grade teacher's website, but these lists and cards are easy to find with a Google search.We've been working through the Dolch list of sight words. We're almost done with pre-primer and primer. Now, just six weeks later, M. is reading the old Dick and Jane books from my childhood. And also, some Dr. Seuss books, such as The Foot Book.  And, amazingly, she's now asking me to read aloud to her!! This would never have happened two months ago.Thank you, Susan S.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.Her teachers have also shifted their approach this year.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 12, 2007", "body": "\nAbout four weeks ago we started something new with Sweet M \u2014 we started something called Brain Engineering. Brain Engineering was developed by Dr. Cheri Florance, a speech-language pathologist and psychologist whose son Whitney was diagnosed with classic Kanner autism, and is now functioning well in as a chemistry major in a New York college.  Florance writes about her son and his evolution in a book called Maverick Minds, which I read about two year ago.The program involves building on the strengths of high-visual learners and borrowing from that strength to develop the auditory channel.  The sessions, which Fathersvox and I do at home under Dr. Florance's instruction, are almost disarmingly simple.  And for the first three weeks we didn't notice much, if any changes, in Sweet M's behavior, though we did notice that her mood was improved.  We were cautiously optimistic since we've tried so many things to help Sweet M develop greater flexibility in her thinking, from vitamins to PCIT, from pharmacotherapy to probiotics.  With the exception of pharmacotherapy, nothing seemed to help her much, so we were wary, but also willing to give it our all.Then last week, all sorts of things started to happen.\u2022 When Sweet M comes home from school lately she chooses to look at her books instead of playing with her Gameboy. In fact, I don't think she's taken the Gameboy out of its recharge cradle for at least two weeks, maybe longer. She is very very interested in her books, which is radically new.\u2022 On Friday she came home from school and was making up a song about how \"I love [name of the boy she has a crush on] and [name of the boy she has a crush on] loves me, I can read and do math too because I'm so smart all the kids love me.\" I didn't quite get the words . . . it wasn't rhyming . . . but she was making up a song about how great she is. That is a change.\u2022 Tuesday she came home and said \"Mom, what's a benefactor?\" I wanted to say that's what we need for your school tuition for next year, but I skipped that.  When I told her that a benefactor is someone who helps you achieve your potential and ambitions by supporting you with money and guidance, she said, with obvious comprehension and satisfaction \u2014 \"Oh, so that's what a benefactor is.\"  I asked where she'd heard the word and she said she heard it on a cartoon \u2013 Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends \u2013 and had been wondering about it for weeks.\u2022 A little later in the same conversation she asked me why there are toys for girls and toys for boys, and I said because people have strange ideas about what boys and girls should do, but that if there are boys' toys she wants, she can have them because they're really all just kids' toys. She said, \"Oh no, I can't have boys toys, I'm a girl.\" I guess I'll have to do a little more work on that!\u2022 On Wednesday she asked me why the city of New York can't be painted pink and purple (her favorite colors). I said I didn't know, maybe we should write a letter to Mayor Bloomberg to ask him why. She said that's a good idea but I don't know him, does he know anybody? I said he probably knows the Governor. She said, Great, I've got it, we can write a letter to the mayor from the governor, and then he'll answer. I said I think he'd answer if you wrote him and she said, \"Of course he wouldn't . . .  I have to pretend I'm the governor.\" She's probably right about that. But she said, \"If I wrote a letter and pretended I was the governor that would be sneaky.\" Yes, I said, that would be sneaky.\u2022 On the weekend she said, \"Hey Mom, Can I ask you a question?\" I said sure, and she asked, \"How do people get rich and have private jets and big cars?\" My answer to this was a bit too long, but I didn't give her the entire first five chapters of Capital or The Wealth of Nations.\u2022 Her school insisted that she go on Field Day last Tuesday. In the past two years we've kept her home because she tends to meltdown when she's outside on a hot day and asked to participate in competitive sports. (Exactly like both of her parents, no fans of ESPN in this household.) Anyway, we were reluctant to let her go because we didn't want to risk a meltdown when her spot at school is so precarious, but it seems to have gone okay. The teacher made her photography assistant for the day, so she got to be doing something special and didn't have to do boring sports. And she had fun in her special job!Also, two weeks ago she asked if she could have ballet, ice skating and piano lessons, so this past weekend she started ice skating lessons. She was on the ice for 30 minutes with two instructors helping her get her skating legs. We're trying something new, and she's eager to try all sort of new things now.Fellow autism-mom Kyra of This Mom wrote a moving post about Remediating the Autism . . . struggling with the idea that even as she adores her son Fluffy just as he is, she works long and hard to help him have every chance for the fullest, richest life.With kids on the spectrum, this means taking chances on various therapies and diet regimes (for Kyra and Fluffy) and other sorts of interventions among so many of us . . . psychotropic medications, special schools, intensive behavioral or communicative interventions.  And for parents who believe their kids have mercury poisoning, biomedical interventions.Parents struggling to make the right decisions for their kids, whether neurotypical or not, is an old story.  We all do it.  We all make decisions on behalf of our children with the very best information we have on hand, sometimes with a bit of speculation and faith.  We try to find them the best possible school setting.  We take them to best doctors we can find.  We do whatever we can do to help them have the richest, most delicious lives they can have.Sweet M is out on the ice, getting her ice skating legs, and we're getting our Brain Engineering legs . . . we'll keep you posted on how it goes as we glide towards something new.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.drflorance.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Maverick-Mind-Mothers-Unreachable-Unteachable/dp/0399530673/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182091915&sr=8-1", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/remediating_the.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/06/trying-something-new.html", "title": "\nTrying Something New\n"},

I am grateful for my little gall stones, which are an order of magnitude of concern about 100 million times less than hers.Now she is the in an ER in Montreal waiting for her surgery.

Blue.  A-duh.Eureka!Tomorrow I'll try to do the experiment that Kristina suggested, and see how it works if she can read silently.   I actually don't know if she knows how to read silently yet, so that will be interesting.  Apparently silent reading is a relatively recent inventions among we humans . . . Greek scribes and such used to read everything aloud and libraries were very noisy places because everyone was talking to themselves.

She seems to just get Sweet M \u2014 she understands her and seems devoted to helping M move forward.In the first two weeks of school she'd already gotten Sweet M to join the other children at lunch \u2014 something that has been a struggle over the past four years since M is averse to the smell and look of other kids' lunches.  Instead of sitting by passively and letting M join the crafts club \u2014 an object-oriented choice M would typically make \u2014 she listened carefully to what M was saying to other adults and kids and realized that M wants to be in the musical theater club.  Yes, musical theater.  Can you believe that?  Sweet M wanted to be \"the announcer\", aka the narrator.  And to help her diversify her eating without getting into power struggles, she's tapped into Sweet M's love of science and launched a \"food science\" initiative that has M \"experiment\" with alternate sources of protein.The entire narrative trajectory over here at Autism's Edge \u2014 the narrative in which a small family in a big, big city struggles to hang on and dukes it out with unthinking educators and Dementor psy-professionals has to be revisited and revised.The change has been so abrupt that I almost feel as though I have conceptual whiplash.  Not that I'm complaining \u2014 it's just that the double miracle of the school deciding to get an aide and the aide being brilliant is such a stark contrast to the past two years that I've been dumb struck and blog silent.I guess the takeaway here is that you never know, you really just never know, when your whole world can shift for the better.Mirabile dictu.  Miraculous to say . . .To cheerful blogging, brilliant educators  . . .. . . and to these psychedelic purple and yellow cauliflowers at the Union Square Green Market that seem, in their wonderful strangeness, to fit in this moment of magic. . .\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/09/back-to-school-or-happy-case-of.html", "title": "\nBack to School, or the Happy Case of Narrative Whiplash\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 30, 2006", "body": "\nDuring the great cleanup of 2006, aka my slightly manic period of spring cleaning, I came across the documents regarding Sweet M's experience with the Paxil liquid suspension, which I wrote about last year.Finding the paperwork reminded me that I hadn't ever really followed up with GlaxoSmithKline to find out what, if anything, they'd done about the fact that people using the liquid formula of Paxil were getting erratic dosing (because the suspension, as packaged and labelled, did not resuspend evenly.)So I called GSK.And what had they done?According to the person who took my call, they're doing exactly nothing. Nada. Zip.But she took great pains to reassure me that they are concerned, saying over and over and over again, \"We so appreciate your feedback. We are, like you, very concerned about the safety of our products.\"As you may recall, when I called GSK about the problem with the suspension, the person I spoke with told me that Sweet M was not the first patient who'd had this problem. He said, \"We are aware of this problem.\" And I said, \"Does that mean it has happened to other people?\" And he said, \"Yes.\"So when I got off the phone with the GSK rep, even after listening to the consumer placation mantra, I was deeply unsatisfied.It seems that someone will have to sue GSK to get them to do something about this problem with the Paxil.When people complain about ours being a litigation-happy country, they forget that corporations like GSK don't seem to do anything to ensure consumer safety unless they are faced with litigation. And since the misery that Sweet M went through the year that her medication dose was varying from week to week does not create visible permanent damage or death, this would not be a very appealing case to litigators. Beyond that I'm not exactly litigious, or in a position to sue.So I took the citizen route, and called the FDA to make a complaint. But the way the FDA works, the investigation is handled by inspectors in the town where the medication is manufactured, i.e. it's handled by people who probably socialize with folks who are, for the most part, employeed by the manufacturer. Does it seem as though there is something wrong with this picture?In spite of a huge sense of futility, I'm filling out the FDA MedWatch forms, sending them along, and hoping that they'll have an interest in ensuring that drugs sold in the U.S. are safe. After the Vioxx debacle that probably makes me a dreamer, but dream on I do.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  parenting  \u2022  Paxil  \u2022  FDA\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["sedges.blogspot.com/2006/04/missing-in-action.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/04/paxil-update.html", "title": "\nPaxil Update\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 23, 2006", "body": "\nOn Tuesday evening I heard Susan Senator read from her book Making Peace with Autism at Barnes and Noble. The event was moving and powerful in all sorts of ways that I will be writing about over the next several days, but one story in particular seemed to pull back the floodgates on the grief that autism families can experience around finding a place in the world for their child, and for themselves as a family.Susan described how she and her family had gone to Disney World during a period when they were learning how to be together as a family in the world with Nat, their autistic son, a full and able member of the family. Standing in or near Ariel the Mermaid's grotto, Susan tells of tearing up, and then pulling it together, when she heard the Disney mermaid's song:I wanna be where the people areI wanna see, wanna see them dancin'Walking around on those - what do you call 'em?Oh - feet![ . . .]When's it my turn?Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?Out of the seaWish I could bePart of that worldIf Susan had teared up at Disney World, I can assure you that a room full of folks sitting around on folding chairs in a Fifth Avenue bookstore were dabbing away tears just hearing her story.One woman, sitting a chair or two away from me, wept quiet tears almost throughout the evening, telling us, during the question and answer, of how her now-grown son had screamed and screamed whenever he was placed on grass. Years later, when he was very verbal, he'd ask his mom if she could remember when he used to scream when he was on the lawn. He explained that he'd been terrified that he would fall through the grass because he couldn't see the bottom of it. He'd wondered, she reported, how people managed to stay on top of the grass instead of sinking into the seeming abyss at the base of the blades of grass.Susan's story of Disney World, and this woman's story of her son's fear of lawns, helped me understand something from my own experiences with Sweet M. I remember the wacky enthusiasm that I had for making sure that we took Sweet M to Disney World, just as she had entered her new school that, while for LD children, has all the appearances and key features of a \"normal\" school \u2014 a red brick building, a playground, a cafeteria and auditorium, yellow school buses, a library, annual talent shows, yearbooks, and field trips.While I have almost zero tolerance for amusement parks, and fairly strong objections to the entire Disney empire, I found myself almost maniacal in ensuring that we took a trip to Disney World, like a normal family, like an NT family. While so many families I know eschew Disney and other purveyor's of commercialized kid-culture, I was embracing it with a vengeance, to the puzzlement of not only my friends, but also myself.We planned our trip for November, around Sweet M's birthday, when the crowds would be thinner. We've become connoisseurs of the off-season vacation \u2014 not only because we can save money \u2014 but also because we're likely to have an easier time with Sweet M if a place isn't bustling with people.Like Susan's son Nat, Sweet M opened up at Disney World, and reveled in her ability to shake hands with Minnie Mouse and pose with Ariel in her mermaid's grotto. Going to places like Disney World, or Chocolate World, and Lego Land, just like NT families, is one of the ways that we find a way to stay on top of the grass.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  family vacations  \u2022   Susan Senator\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.susansenator.com", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590302443/sr=8-1/qid=1143248436/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/03/staying-on-top-of-grass.html", "title": "\nStaying on Top of the Grass\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 27, 2005", "body": "\nSanta descended upon us and much to M's delight, left only presents, and no lumps of coal.But before we sprinkled the St. Nicholas dust and set out cookies and milk for the man in red, we went to a Christmas Eve celebration at the loft of some dear friends, Claire and Jerri. As the grown-ups gathered in the living room to talk and sing and nosh and drink and dance, Jerri set-up a DVD of Frosty the Snowman in their bedroom for M. and another little girl to watch. The other little girl soon joined the grown-ups to be with her mummy, but M. was happy amusing herself in their bedroom.I wandered into the kitchen with Jerri to get some snacks, and peeked in on M., who was, to my amazement sitting in the center of the bed, cross-legged, and hands in a prayer position, obviously meditating. She'd placed a large quartz crystal that Claire and Jerri had on their dresser onto of a small pillow in the middle of the bed. As we watched from the kitchen, she began doing prostrations in front of this quartz crystal.We were stunned. Where did she learn this? What is this about? I'd be just about the last person on the planet to buy into the indigo children hypothesis, but I have to say, I couldn't believe my eyes. We don't do yoga meditation at home with M. around. We don't have any crystals and candles set on altars at home. And yet here she was, deeply engaged in some kind of sacred practice.I've asked her about it twice since then and she says, with great resolve, \"Mama, I don't want to talk about it.\"When M. was about four years old we were at the local supermarket check out paying for our groceries, and she suddenly got all panicked, as though she'd forgotten something.\"Fwow-wer,\" she'd said, \"Fwow-wer.\"She was agitated, so I let her take the lead.  \"Fowwer fowwer,\" she said with great urgency.She led me back to the entrance of the store, and plucked a daisy from a mixed bouquet.\"Fowwer for ston addy.  Fowwer for ston addy.\"We hurried back to the cashier, and I thought she was going to give the flower to the cashier.I said, \"Did you want to give that to the lady?\"\"NOOOOOOO . . . For ston addy ston addy ston addy,\" she started to lose it.\"Okay, okay, for ston addy,\" I said, not having the slightest idea what she or I were saying.When we walked back home with our bag of groceries, I wanted to turn onto Thompson Street and take the shortcut across the playground, but she was adamant that we continue along Houston Street.\"No no no.\"  She was tugging at my arm, dragging me along Houston toward Sullivan.We rounded the corner, and she insisted on crossing the street.\"Ston addy ston addy,\" she said.And there was the stone lady, a stone statue of the Virgin Mary outside the rectory of the Church of St. Anthony that marks the top of the block.\"Ston addy ston addy,\" she said, as she presented her purloined daisy to the ston addy.I was dazzled.  I don't know what to do with this sort of reverence\u2014how to honor her spirituality and foster her spirit?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/12/seeing-indigo-seeing-red.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2005/12/ston-addy.html", "title": "\nSton Addy\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 19, 2006", "body": "\nYesterday M brought home some reading homework that required her to figure out when a compound subject such as \"Tim and Jane\" is converted into a first-person plural indirect object pronoun.Confused?  Well, I was too.It went something like this:Tim and Jane asked Mary and Joe to come with them.  \"Come with us,\" Tim said.Circle the names that can be substituted for \"us.\"a. Tim and Jan    b. Mary and Joe      c. TimM found it difficult, and we worked on the idea of \"us\" for quite some time. By the last question on the worksheet, she seemed to understand it. Sort of.It reminded me of our earliest ventures in personal pronouns, and what I learned then about how professionals in the autism and special education world may understand us and our children.As you probably know, one of the language \"defects\" observed in children in the spectrum is difficulty understanding personal pronouns. This difficulty is attributed by autism experts such as Simon Baron-Cohen to the autistic individual's supposed defects in theory of mind, or their \"mindblindness.\"And, when you think about it, personal pronouns are fairly complex.Let's say that I say: \"It's a picture of me.\" If you respond by saying \"It's a picture of me,\" you'd be wrong, unless of course you and I were both in the picture. Getting your child to learn that \"you\" and \"I\" and \"me\" are relative words is one of the early speech-language challenges.One day, not long after M was first evaluated for her speech and language deficits, I brought home a package of snapshots. M was about three years old at the time and she was thrilled by snapshots. Still is, though we're mostly digital in our photos these days. Anyway, as we were going through them, I was talking to her about each of them. We came to a snapshot of me, sitting at my desk in my office.I said, \"Look M., it's me at my office.\"\"Me at office,\" she said.\"No honey, it's me\u2014Mama\u2014at the office,\" I said, pointing at myself.\"No no,\" she said, \"Me at office.\"\"Honey, look, it's Mama, me, at office,\" I tried to persuade her.\"Me-me at office!\" she said.I was about to give up and move onto the next picture, when she took the picture from me, and pointed to a tiny, tiny image inside the image. On the shelf in my office there was a framed snapshot of her. \"Me in office,\" she said. She had zoomed in on the photo of herself on the shelf in my office.I was amazed. That's some visual acuity that she's got there . . . to pick out an image of herself that was no more than 1 or 2 millimeters wide, inside a 4x6 snapshot.When M was evaluated by the in-network speech language pathologists, they generated a report that labeled her play \"perseverative\" and her speech \"echolalic,\" and that commented on her inability to use personal pronouns accurately.At that time I was still in the autism mom stage that I call \"refusal.\" Some people call it \"denial\"\u2014suggesting that one just can't wrap one's brain around the truth about your child . . . that one is just incapable of grasping the horrible reality. But I call it refusal, because I think it has more to do with refusing to accept professional authority and pronouncements.Anyway, I was on the phone with the SLP who had written the report, and I told her about M's amazing recognition of herself in this photograph . . . About how I had at first thought that M was having a problem with pronoun confusion, but that actually I just wasn't seeing what she was seeing, and therefore wasn't understanding that she was right, that she was in the picture. I was very excited and effusive telling the SLP about my discovery.\"Yes,\" she said, her voice flat and deflating, \"M. has splinter skills.\"\"Splinter skills?\"\"Yes, splinter skills.  She has some specific strengths. That's typical of kids like M.\"Apparently, autistic kids have a remarkable capacity to see the parts of an image, even in the absence of the whole, making them particularly skillful at putting together jigsaw puzzles.  A splinter skill.O-kaaaaay, I thought. So now I'm starting to understand this:Autism Axiom #1: What's good about my kid is bad, and what's bad about my kid is also bad.Most people get to understand that their personal characteristics may be viewed as assets or liabilities, depending on the context. The ability to focus and persevere is tenacity in one setting, obsessiveness or perseveration in another.But in the land of developmental diagnostics\u2014at least among the clinicians we first encountered\u2014there were only liabilities. Everything was to be converted into evidence of the four D's: damaged, defective, diseased, disabled.This approach might work for a professional building a case for the child's pathology, but it sure wasn't working for me.Writing in 1943, psychiatrist Leo Kanner called the skills of autistic kids \"islets of ability.\" I'm not sure who came up with the even more dismissive term \"splinter skills.\" Sounds as though we ought to be looking for a pair of tweezers to yank those skills right out of them.The earliest example of this language of \"splinter skills\" that I've come across is in a 1971 article by DeMyer, et al, in the first issue of the Journal of Autism and Childhood Schizophrenia. But that was the first issue of this publication, so who knows\u2014clinicians might have been using the splinter skill language for much longer.  I'll have to look into that.Personally, I prefer islets of ability. Sounds rather nice . . . though I can't figure out if I should be imagining small, lush, tropical islands of skill in a great sea of plentitude, or great craggy stones jutting up from an ocean of ineptitude.Whichever it is, I'm quite certain that the best course of action is to remember that even when I can't quite see it, that Sweet M is in the picture.

{"date": "Friday, January 20, 2006", "body": "\nIt's been five months since Sweet M had a meltdown\u2014a full-blown, no-holds-barred, flip-out sort of meltdown\u2014the sort of episode that the family featured on Dr. Phil was dealing with on a regular basis.Our lives had become so mellow that we'd actually stopped expecting the phone to ring with calls from her school asking one of us to come and get her. We'd even gotten to the point where we'd occasionally go out without our cell phones turned on.So I guess you could say that she was overdue.Her teacher called on Thursday afternoon around noon. M had lost it on the playground, during the lunchtime recess. M's father took the call, and as often happens in these games of telephone, there was, at first, some confusion about what had happened. At first we understood\u2014mistakenly\u2014that M had hit another child.After M and her father were in-route, on the way home,  M's teacher Helen called back to tell me what had happened .  .  .M was on one of those playground jungle gyms that has a chain bridge that wiggles when you walk across it. She was on the bridge with some other girls, and she said she wanted to be on it by herself. But they wanted to be on it, too.I'm not certain, but I think the wobbliness of these chain bridges is very relaxing for her . . . these chain bridges have been the site of other episodes, to be discussed in some future post, but in any case . . .Alan, M's teacher from last year, who was operating under the assumption that M should get her way (so as to avoid meltdown episodes), told the other girls to let M have the swinging bridge to herself.But then Helen, M's teacher from this year, operating under the principles they've been using this year\u2014namely that M can't act like she's the only kid on the playground\u2014told M that she needed to share.Meltdown. In M's world, when two contradictory rules collide and she doesn't get her way, there is some sort of internal chain reaction. Or perhaps it's like in the fictional construct on the old episodes of Star Trek\u2014when matter and anti-matter meet, the universe explodes from the force of the contradiction.This contradiction of the rules was a particularly troubling case for M because it was not her less-favorite teacher from last year who had issued the \"you must share\" edict, but her beloved teacher Helen\u2014the teacher who is, in M's mind, the source of all that is good, and beautiful, and just. That sort of splitting (good mommy-bad mommy, madonna-whore, and so on) that young minds of all ages engage in\u2014of dividing the world into good and bad\u2014had just been challenged. Beloved became despised and M was doing what the psychologists would call decompensating and what the nuclear physicist might call fission chain reaction.And so Sweet M became less sweet and much much much more sour, complete with the screaming and histrionics that we prefer to avoid. She began crying and screaming at Helen\u2014\"It's all your fault, it's all your fault.\" And, in a way, she was right. Because when splitting happens, the bad other is the source of all trouble.According to what we were told by Helen, M kept pulling herself back together and then losing it, then pulling herself back together, then losing it again. This is a great development, because it suggests that this is not a completely unmitigated, uncontrollable meltdown. The molten nuclear core of the reactor keeps bumping up against enough in her life that is calming and cooling that she can momentarily regain her equilibrium, until it melts through again.When they got back to school she flung her locker door open, accidentally hitting another child with the locker door, and pitched her stuff into the locker in a fit of rage and indignation. So she had not, fortunately, hit another child with ill will. But still . . . even accidentally hitting another child bodes ill.She calmed herself again, but she had to come home because we have a rule this year that if she screams at school that her father has to come and get her. Once home, she was fine . . . did her homework . . . played on the computer . . . watched a little TV, ate supper, and went to bed.In other posts I've taken issue with the metaphors that medical, media, and educational professionals use when describing our kids. I've railed against language like \"splinter skills,\" and criticized Dr. Phil and his producers for casting an Aspie teenager as \"a ticking time bomb.\" Yet here I am, speaking of M's behavior as a \"meltdown.\" Hmmmmh.This would be the time that a former colleague would quip: \"Pot, meet Kettle: Kettle, meet Pot.\"But seriously, what is going on here? Why would I, and so many other autism parents, describe their children's episodes of dysregulation with a metaphor that summons the image of widespread catastrophe, of the need for containment, and the danger of fallout?M's father doesn't use this language of meltdown. He calls her episodes her \"crises.\" I guess that's because this is close to the French crises des nerfs\u2014the crisis of nerves. But I've been using the language of nuclear catastrophe for quite some time. I don't even remember when I first starting using the talk of the meltdown. My best guess is that I was probably talking with a doctor or another parent and trying to distinguish M's episodes from a garden-variety tantrum.I was probably trying to explain that these episodes differ from a tantrum in their intensity, duration, and level of destructiveness. Once started, they are often difficult to interrupt. Hence they're not simply explosive, they're a chain reaction\u2014a meltdown. Also, unlike a tantrum, these episodes, are initially, for the new autism parent, difficult to predict. After enough of them, you have finely tuned antenna and can sense the impending meltdown almost by smell. But at first they seem to come out of the blue. In fact I have found myself describing them like thunderstorms blowing through, and have read other autism parents who used the language of the storm to describe autistic dysregulation.But the metaphor of the explosive temper runs deep through our language.  He's a pressure cooker, we might say. She's a hot-head.  Or he's letting off steam. Or he exploded.  Or she blew up at me.Or, alternately, he's cool, she keeps her cool, she's got a cool head.Anger is associated heat\u2014often the actual physical heat\u2014complete with red faces and elevated body temperature. And cool is associated with reason.Even when we speak of losing our tempers, we are still invoking a metaphor of heat. Tempering a metal involves heating it to a very high point, then plunging it into cool water. The result\u2014for example, tempered steel\u2014is less brittle, both stronger and more pliable, more resilient.In the Western world, at least since the Enlightment, we have privileged reason\u2014cool heads\u2014and well-tempered selves. Our complicated social hierarchies leave little room for \"losing it\" or \"blowing up.\" Whereas scuffles and drunken brawling were not uncommon among the Irish working class stock from which I hail, in the middle class, homogenized world in which we are now expected to circulate, where we are expected to pass as \"white\" (as in Anglo-Saxon, rather than Celt)\u2014losing it, losing your cool, blowing up\u2014these \"ugly feelings\" and outbursts\u2014are not acceptable.One of the books I found most helpful in shaping my understand of M has been Ross Greene's The Explosive Child.  Greene describes kids like M who have a difficult time transitioning, and who lose it (temper, equilibrium) when they're asked to go from one activity to the next. He describes this is a lack of \"executive function\" in the brain. This metaphor is fairly telling in that it suggests a kind of internal class-structure for the brain itself . . . that the reasonable executive will manage the hot-headed working class. But be that as it may, Greene's book is helpful in that he describes this lack of \"self-control\" as a feature of brain maturation, or the lack of it.He suggests that our kids simply can't hold two different ideas in their heads at the same time. So let's say that M is watching TV. And I say, \"Time to take your bath.\" For M, TV is being annihilated. Gone forever. Gone for good. Basta. Finished.Or let's say that one teacher says you can have the bridge to yourself, and the other teacher, the goddess of all that is good, says you can't. Urnt urnt urnt. You can almost hear the sirens in her head: does not compute, does not compute, system overload, all systems overload.But if I can find a way to help her know that she's not losing the possibility of that pleasure forever, then the transition can be easier.Tricks include consistency\u2014though not necessarily rigidity\u2014but also early warnings, and reminders that TV (or the bridge all to yourself) will be possible again, TV later, TV tomorrow.Aggressive language, a combative attitude, and demands for obedience\u2014\"TV off now, take YOUR bath now!\" would be completely counterproductive, because then her fear of losing the TV or the wobbly bridge for all time and eternity, would escalate. Parental, and pedagogical, cool heads matter so much.What is hopeful in Greene's work is that he argues that for our \"explosive\" kids that this sort of self-reflexive maturation may eventually happen, but in very late adolescence and early adulthood.

{"date": "Saturday, February 25, 2006", "body": "\n       On the heels of my thinking about \"oughtism,\" I'm drawn to thinking about its inverse:  repressive tolerance.The idea of repressive tolerance, developed by twentieth century political philosopher Herbert Marcuse, is that sometimes actions that appear to be about freedom and human liberty are actually repressive. Some behaviors that we tolerate in ourselves, and in others, in the name of freedom, may actually be detrimental to us individually and collectively. Or, put differently, what looks like freedom may be a pleasant, pleasurable prison.Marcuse's examples, from 1965, included allowing advertising and publicity to dumb-down our thinking, or allowing automobiles to transform the landscape of our cities, making pedestrians an endangered species. In the name of freedom, and especially in the name of free markets, we've come to allow all kinds of ills, from environmental havoc to electoral travesties. In the name of sexual freedom we have, perhaps, created vacuous forms of sexual expression that lack any sense of human connection. For Marcuse, while these \"freedoms\" look like some sort of liberation, they're actually repressive in that they limit the sort of genuine human flourishing that he envisioned.Consumer culture is particularly prone to encouraging repressive tolerance. For example, that \"one more donut\" might feel like it was your choice, but it might also have just been because a marketing genius at Dunkin' Donuts figured out that they should pipe the smell of donuts out of their shops to snag us all by the primal sense of smell.So what does this have to do with oughtism, autism, and raising Sweet M?While I hope for liberation from oughtism, I sometimes wonder if my willingness to go with the flow with Sweet M constitutes a kind of repressive tolerance born of parenting fatigue. It's often so hard to know when to push and when to back off.Even for parents of typically developing children there are questions of when to discipline and when to leave well enough alone, but for autism and ADHD parents, the stakes are arguably higher, and the possibilities for parental fatigue that much greater. After one gets done slaying the dragons around the IEP conference, or the Board of Education's bus schedules, or the school placement \u2014 not to mention earning a living adequate enough to support the services our kids need \u2014 how much energy remains for reigning in our kids?While there are many non-negotiables in Sweet M's world: no hitting, no screaming, must do homework, and so on, she also has a huge amount of freedom in, for example what she eats. She really doesn't like much of anything that isn't pasta, sweets, or milk products. She may very well have a gluten-casein sensitivity, but I haven't had the heart to go through a rotation diet with her. Controlling her food reminded me much too much of battles over food, eating, and body image with my own mother. So she eats pretty much what she wants \u2014 a hi-carb, hi-sugar diet very similar to that of high-functioning autistic genius Andy Warhol \u2014 and she takes a megavitamin (non-negotiable).We have allowed many of our parenting decisions to be governed by her preferences, and I sometimes wonder how wise that is. What are real preferences \u2014 that ought to be honored \u2014 and what are the passing whims of an eight year old?I think about one of the hot-button issues among autism parents and autism activists\u2014how to handle our kids' stims. If we believe what autistic authors such as Donna Williams and Temple Grandin say about stimming, then letting our kids remain transfixed by rituals or other stereotypies, would be repressive, in that it would not be allowing them access to their human freedom. But, on the other hand, having some sort of self-soothing behavior, which they also describe stimming as being, can aid in regulating internal states.How do we balance between oughtism \u2014 shoehorning them into shapes that are too far from their natural inclinations \u2014 and letting them run too wild, too far a field, too uncultivated?I wish I knew.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  parenting  \u2022   repressive tolerance  \u2022   Herbert Marcuse\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse", "http://www.spidernet.nl/%7Emartijn_dekker/internaut/news/9903/15.warhol.spml", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/01/215.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/cultivation.html", "title": "\nCultivation\n"},

As part of our evening ritual, she'll holler, \"M____, come here, I wanna get out of the bath.\" And then I'll holler back, \"Gimme a second.\"  Or \"I'm coming in a minute.\"  Or sometimes, \"Okay, okay, I'm on my way.\"And then I'll go into the bathroom and I'll take a paper towel and fold it over once so that she can put it over her forehead and eyes, but so it will stop short of her nose. We do this so that water from the shower spray doesn't splash in her eyes while I rinse out all the shampoo from her so-very-thick hair.  With so much hair she needs a little help getting all the shampoo out.  We call this folded paper towel \"the eye protector.\"  The eye protector always gets soaking wet, but it succeeds in keeping water from splashing into her eyes.Last night as I was rinsing out her hair, looking at this drenched paper towel draped over her precious forehead, the image of someone being waterboarded flashed through my mind.  In that case a wet towel would be draped over someone's face with a very different set of intentions.  The image of someone being forced into feelings of drowning by having a wet towel held over their face as water is poured over them again and again just wouldn't leave me.  Perhaps this bleakest of images had something to do with the decision of President George W. Bush to veto the bill banning waterboarding and other forms of detainee abuse.  In fact I'm sure that is why I thought of it.I have been so underwater myself with my workload that only the most egregious of news headlines make it into my consciousness. Waterboarding veto. Thickest, oldest Arctic ice is melting. 14,000 employees of Bear Stearns lose their life savings as the Feds subsidize JPMorgan to bail out a company with assets valued at many billions of dollars for the bargain basement price of $236 million dollars, or $2 per share. These days it seems that everywhere people are underwater, and there is nothing so sweet and simple as a paper towel folded over our eyes that can spare us from the backwash of this regime.I find it hard to think about this. Hard to think about living in a world where some of us are fashioning eye protectors to shield our loved ones from the smallest discomfort of shampoo and water spray while others among us are devising techniques with the same simple household elements for quite the opposite purpose.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2008/03/water-everywhere.html", "title": "\nWater Everywhere\n"},

So I didn't tell Sweet M she was going to camp.  I told her she was going to the horseback riding place to do riding and other stuff.

{"date": "Monday, May 26, 2008", "body": "\nLast week I was in California to visit my father in his new home, an assisted living residence for people with Alzheimer's and other sorts of memory disorders.  I was apprehensive about his move to this facility \u2014 a place that I hadn't seen and had heard only a little about, so I just had to see it.My mother had been caring for him for seven years \u2014 since he first went missing after dropping Sweet M, Fathersvox, and I off at LAX when we were returning to New York City in late August 2001.  Recently she'd gotten a homecare aide two days a week, and that person was helpful, taking him for walks and helping around the house.Unfortunately the walks seem to have given him the idea of starting to go on his own walks and three weeks ago he got up very early in the morning and went down the long steep road that leads to my parents' home.  Apparently he was walking back up the hill when he fell down and cut his arm.  He couldn't get back up, so a neighbor helped him into her home, and called the sheriff, who took him to the ER.  The fire department came to my parents house to make sure my mom was okay and all the doors were wide open.Then the hospital wouldn't release him back to my mom's care.  They said it wasn't safe for him.  They said it wasn't safe for her.  So after seven years of home care, my mom agreed that he could go into an assisted living facility.The assisted living place is beautiful: a putting green for anyone who still has a golf swing, swimming pool for those who still have a stroke, a playground for visiting children, a gardening area for residents who want to puttering and plant, a billiards table for the pool sharks among them, and pets of all kinds, including parrots, parakeets, and cockatiels, a terrier, a poodle, a shepherd and a hutch of bunnies.  There were music performances and music therapists.  Probably a 3:1 overall patient to caregiver ratio.  All the caregivers seem to know all the residents names.And my father seems content.  Almost happy.  More engaged than I've seen him in since four years.Of course he doesn't really recognize me anymore.  Or if he does, it's probably some sort of vague sense of connection rather than any knowledge of relationship.  He smiles when he sees me.  He doesn't know my name. Somehow my father is gone, and this new person has arrived in his place: a fragile, sweet, gentle old man who is so different than the father I grew up with.I started to call him by his name rather than Dad, much as Sweet M calls me by name rather than calling me mom because it's easier for her that way.  At first I thought I'd started calling him by his name because it was less confusing to him, and easier for the care providers around him.  Now I think I was fooling myself.  I've made the change because it's less confusing for me. It's goodbye to Dad and hello to Dan.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2008/05/from-autism-to-alzheimers.html", "title": "\nFrom Autism to Alzheimer's\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, December 11, 2007", "body": "\nSince September I've been involved in an unintended experiment \u2014 life without blogging.Circumstances \u2014 new job on top of old job, complicated commute related to the aforementioned new job, great new situation at Sweet M's school and the accompanying narrative whiplash \u2014 conspired to pull me away from blogging about our lives with Sweet M in the city and about autism issues more broadly.Often in the past two months I've found myself trolling about at my blogging friends' sites, smiling at their children's progress, worrying about their challenges, but staying silent, like a traveler without a visa or a worker without papers.  If I wasn't blogging about my life, what right had I to weigh in on others?  This wasn't a conscious decision, it was just the way my life went over these past months.More times that I can count I'd find myself composing a post in my mind \u2014 while riding the train, or cleaning our apartment, or reading about something in the news that seemed to warrant comment.  But those posts went unwritten . . . I didn't weigh-in on the attention-grabbing, misleading \"Ransom Notes\" advertising campaign launched by the NYU Child Study Center where Sweet M has been in treatment for five years. (Though I did write a letter to Dr. Koplewicz, the Center's director.)  I didn't shout out a cheer when Amanda Baggs' appearance on CNN was rebroadcast, even though I was thrilled to see her there.  I didn't trounce the rescue narrative that played out when Jenny McCarthy and Holly Robinson Peete appeared on Oprah.  I knew others would do that well, so what, really, would be the point?  And I didn't cheer, as I would have, when Phil Schwartz and his family appeared in a New York Times piece about how a child's diagnosis of ASD caused them to reflect on the undiagnosed adults in the family, a story that resounds through our household. Though I guess this is recent enough that I could cheer about it right now!  Three cheers Phil and family!And then there were the posts about Sweet M that went unwritten . . .  The one that would have been written to go with this photograph above would have been called \"The More Things Change.\"  Sweet M helped to make a carrot cake, but before doing so, insisted on this configuration for the measuring cups.  Only my autism blogging friends would get this . . .There would have been the post about the stim-y new habit that Sweet M has developed of taking the corner of a throw pillow from the sofa, holding it between her big toe and second toe by corner fabric, and twirling it around.  (I'd have to videotape it to show you, because it's a feat that few neurotypicals could do with their feet.) She can do this for hours, while watching TV or reading.  She says that it relaxes her brain; it drives her father crazy.There would have been the post about her double-digit big-10 birthday party.  As usual it was rockclimbing at Chelsea Piers, but this year, a girls-only party where I got to see the profound level of disconnection that Sweet M has from girls of her own age.  There is a photograph (that won't be posted here, alas, for privacy reasons) of all the girls seated on a gym mat. Sweet M has positioned herself turned away from the group and stares into space and at her hands.  At one point she took the video camera from me and decided to make a movie . . . At least as the outsider, she made good use of her vantage point.The preliminary results of my accidental experiment are in.  Life without blogging is bad for one's (at least this one's) health.  I've gained weight, had multiple colds, and developed unexplained pain in joints and muscles. I've become what Sweet M calls \"a grouch.\"Becoming an outsider \u2014 however inadvertently \u2014 among a community where I have actually felt as though I fit, has been a micro-disaster.  I'd almost go so far as paraphrasing an old Greek philosopher and saying the unblogged (autism parenting) life can feel as though it's not worth living.

{"date": "Thursday, December 13, 2007", "body": "\nMuch has been written about NYU Child Study Center's \"Ransom Notes\" child mental health/mental illness advertising campaign.  Kristina at AutismVox is keeping a running list of posts about the campaign,  so I won't list them all here. The New York Times ran a story about the campaign this morning. But for my part, I hadn't posted about the ad campaign, or about anything else for that matter.I first spotted an ad from the campaign last week, the one about childhood depression, in the back of New York Magazine.  My response was visceral \u2014 something between nausea and the sensation that you've just been kicked in the stomach. But I wasn't in my autism-mom-advocate blogging mode. I was in my keeping-my-family-together, working-two-jobs mode.  So I just made a mental note of the disturbing ad and continued on my way.  The closest I came to a complete thought about it was \"oh, ick, oh ick, oh awful, not NOT good.\"But when I got an email from GRASP about the campaign, I felt as though I had to dash off an email to Dr. Koplewicz about my reaction.  Sweet M has been in treatment at the Child Study Center for five years, and some of the practitioners there have been spectacularly good.  One of them taught me how to teach Sweet M to read \u2014 back in the very earliest days of this blog.  (And now she's twirling pillows with her toes while reading her many and beloved Berenstain Bear books.) Another has been the world-class psychiatrist who has helped us through many a rough patch in the past five years.Possibly because I also have \u2014 full disclosure \u2014 a professional affiliation with NYU, Dr. Koplewicz phoned me earlier this week and we spoke yesterday.  Based on that conversation, I would say that he has heard the concerns of the autism community loud and clear and is contemplating what to do about the campaign, though admittedly the public rhetoric would not suggest that.  I believe that the Child Study Center's interest in raising the awareness of childhood mental health issues is genuine.  I also believe that the Ransom Notes campaign is a disaster, from nearly every point of view.Why?  Because the metaphor of hostage taking is a metaphor of trauma, evoking and provoking trauma.  Hostage taking is an act of desperation, one of the primary powers of the weak, where those with the least to lose try to make others feel how very much they can lose.  Desperation is its raisonne d\u2019etre.  For those of us who are old enough to remember the genesis of Ted Koppel's career-making television news program Nightline, the show began in 1979 as a nightly report on the state of the Iranian hostage crisis where Americans were held hostage for 444 days in 1979-1981.  The late night news program started out as a prime time report on the status of the hostage situation.  After the trademark music \u2014 DA DUN DUH DUN -- the voice over would announce \"DAY 22 (or whatever the day was) \u2014 AMERICA held HOSTAGE.\"Koppel's late night program, which commanded high ratings and kept the crisis in the minds of Americans all through the night, contributed to President Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan.  Later everyone learned that Reagan staged a behind the scenes arms-for-hostages deal, organizing for the hostages to be released  just minutes after his inauguration. The rest, as they say, is history.Americans feelings of powerlessness in the face of the Iranian hostage situation led to the desire for \"morning in America\" and a campaign of chest-thumping free-marketeering. (Anyone remember the American invasion of Grenada?  Yes, that's Grenada \u2014 the tiny Caribbean island that had a socialist leadership. Yep, we invaded 'em. Recently we haven't been picking such easy targets.)What's this got to do with the NYU-CSC's Ransom Notes campaign?Powerlessness is (paradoxically) a powerful feeling. It sways elections.  It changes history.  It mobilizes people, as fascists of every stripe know well.The idea that one's child is held hostage is so provocative \u2014 it taps so deeply into the feelings of powerlessness that I'd venture each of us has felt from time to time \u2014 as to evoke profound feelings of rage.  Now, I'd venture, our rage is directed, not surprisingly, at the NYU-Child Study Center which deployed the dubious and dangerous hostage-rescue-kidnapped-child metaphor.But at the end of the day, my rage continues to be directed at the lack of resources, supports and services, for our children.Misguided and ill-conceived as the Ransom Notes campaign is, I believe that the NYU Child Study Center shares my concern over the lack of resources available for our children, and the lack of public awareness of the challenges our children and families face.  I think they have been attempting, with limited success, to raise awareness of challenges that neurologically different children face, albeit within the psychiatric framework that by definition understands difference as disease or disorder.The Ransom Notes has campaign (along with the debacle around the Autism Speaks autism awareness campaign) has left me wondering whether the rhetorics used in advertising campaigns are simply too one-dimensional to work as advocacy tools.If we, in the autism parenting and autism advocacy community, were to launch an ad campaign to raise awareness of childhood neurological differences and social integration issues, what would it look like?  How would it play?  Where could it take us?That's a conversation I'd like to have.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/rescue-me-the-nyu-child-study-centers-ransom-notes-ad-campaign/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/business/media/14adco.html", "http://www.aboutourkids.org/about_us/public_awareness", "http://www.aboutourkids.org/%3C/files/pages/depression_large_0.jpg%3E", "http://www.grasp.org/", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/2007/12/09/more-on-nyu-and-ransom-notes/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/12/hostage-negotiations.html", "title": "\nHostage Negotiations\n"},

The other epidemic that we hear a a lot about is rising childhood obesity.  If one believes that fatness is a disease, and not just another difference, then Sweet M is among the obese.Of course there are a lot of smart people out there who think fat is just fat, not a disease.  But most of them are not tween-age girls.As for me,  I'm not sure what I think, but I know it's hard to be fat.I've been fat. I've been thin. I've been fat again, and thin again, and fat again.What has never stopped amazing me is the unadulterated prejudice against fat people that abounds.  When I'm fat people make all kinds of assumptions (need I say \"none positive\"?) about me: about my intelligence, my fitness, my energy level, my work habits, my education level, my sexuality, and my socioeconomic status.  It's simply amazing.So I wish Sweet M weren't fat.It is hard to be fat.  And it's hard to be autie.  And it's hard to be a fat autie tween.  Awfully hard.Sweet M didn't used to be fat.  She used to be a beanpole like her slender father.One of my undergraduate students last semester told me that he'd worked the previous summer at a weight reduction camp for kids.  Many of the kids who were struggling with their weight, he told me, were taking psychotropic meds: antidepressants or atypical neuroleptics.  Paxil, Prozax, Risperdal, Abilify, Effexor, etc.That makes sense to me.  Ever since Sweet M started taking Paxil five years ago, she's been piling on the pounds.  I think of MOM-NOS's descriptions of Bud ravenously hungry after starting a particular medication, and I think, wow, these medications do change the way they perceive and metabolize food.Of course Sweet M's carb-centric diet and aversion to running around haven't helped.  She prefers television, the computer, videogames, and drawing to almost any other activities. Except --  get this -- horseback riding.  Horseback riding!  Not exactly the ideal sport selection for a girl living in lower Manhattan.  Wish she'd picked something a little more convenient and less extravagant, like shooting hoops or riding a bike.  But she picked.So in July, we started hippotherapy, horseback riding for kids with developmental differences.  It's awesome.  Sweet M is loving it, and she's learning to sit tall, to post and trot, with 1,800 pounds of horse underneath her.Sweet M meets Thunder.And now we're going all out: we're taking her off of Paxil.  To tell you the truth, I'm scared.  It's a medication that has saved our lives.  It almost completely eliminated Sweet M's obsessive-compulsive symptoms within two weeks of starting.  But that was nearly six years ago, and now we're trying for something new.Slowly, surely, carefully, we're taking her off; making tiny incremental drops while substituting another medication that her doctor says is weight neutral in children.  Apparently coming off of Paxil can cause excruciating withdrawal symptoms, so we're taking it very, very slowly, and introducing a different SSRI.So far, so good.

We've been letting our autism parenting slip . . .So last night when I was stricken with a stunning migraine, I reverted to a parody of American parenting.Sweet M and Fathersvox were quarreling about her bath time.  I was curled up in a fetal position on the bed, hoping that the migraine dry heaves would not resume and praying that  someone would just come in and shoot me in the head with a 44 caliber pistol to put me out of my misery.It was time for her bath, but he'd insisted that she go to her bath in the middle of a TV program she was watching, rather than waiting for the end of it and then sending her off to the tub.So she came in whining to me.  M_____, M______, F______ turned off my show.  Help me.  It's not fair.Grunt from me.M_____, M_____, come on and talk to him, you have to talk to him.I'm sick, you guys figure it out.But\u2014 but \u2014but \u2014it's my show . . .  louder and more excruciating.I marshaled my last ounce of coherence and energy, lugged myself into the living room, restored her show, and said in my most deranged parent voice:\"There.  Your show is on.  Watch it.  When it's over take your bath.  And I don't want to hear another word from you, young lady.\"She nodded solemnly and said, \"O-key-doe-key.\"And then I realized what I'd said.  Something I've never said in all the time I've been parenting her.  I told her to stop talking.  And I can.  Because she talks now. Hallelujah \u2014 I can be just as bad a parent as the next parent and she'll survive. I never thought I'd be proud of my worst moment. Therein lies the secret power of autism \u2014 what's good is bad, what's bad is bad, and now, farther into the journey, even what's bad can be good.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2008/04/bad-parenting-as-great-progress.html", "title": "\nBad Parenting as Great Progress\n"},

On an overnight field trip.Yes.  On her own.  Well, sort of on her own.  With her aide.  Without us.She was terribly excited about the field trip. When we first talked about it she said, \"So I'll stay in a hotel?\"  \"Yes,\" I said.  \"And there will be a swimming pool?\"  \"Yes,\" I said.  And then she paused and asked, \"M____, do you think I could ask my teachers to help me with an embarrassing problem I have?\" \"You mean your nighttime diaper?\"  \"U-huh.\"  \"I'm sure you can. We both will ask them.\"And so she went on a sleepover field trip.  She put on makeup with her suite mates before they went to dinner.  She ate food she won't eat at home.  In a restaurant.  At a table.  With other kids eating other \"stinky\" food.  She swam in the pool.  She went to the colonial village and visited the blacksmith.  She rode on the bus.Her aide told me that she sniffled and whimpered a little bit, in the middle of the night, probably homesick, but that she got through it without waking up the other girls in her room.Changes at Autism's Edges don't really happen overnight, but sometimes it seems like they do.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2008/04/overnight.html", "title": "\nOvernight\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 06, 2006", "body": "\nThis past Sunday was a glorious spring day, and after doing some essential errands I headed back home to take Sweet M out for a walk.She'd been spending too many days at home during the Spring Break from school last week . . . we'd only had two adventures -- one to see the Rauschenberg show at the Met before it closed and the other to see Ice Age II \u2013 The Meltdown the weekend it opened. As it turns out, not only did we see Ice Age II \u2013 The Meltdown, but we had our very own little meltdown times 2, Sweet M and her mom together.Sweet M wanted to head out to Wendy's, but the one on Broadway is so vile, so filthy, that when confronted with the demand for Wendy's I try, at a minimum, to get her to head over to the cleaner one on Sixth Avenue.No, she said.  Can't go there.  Changed that.Changed what? What do you mean? I asked.Joannie, Raven went, and they changed it.  I'll show you, she said, with a surprising confidence.So off we went to Wendy's. We walked the 6 or 7 blocks and there it was. An empty store front. No more Wendy's on Sixth Avenue. Another victim of the skyrocketing commercial rents in our neighborhood. Gone, along with the corner deli, the restaurant where we had our wedding party, the two neighborhood book stores, the art supply shop. All replaced with flagship stores from national and international brands.Sweet M wasn't really phased by the closed Wendy's \u2014 she knew it was closed. But she was hungry, and now we were destinationless.So we wandered around in the late afternoon looking for a place to sit down and have a bite to eat. The streets were crowded with tourists. The pizza place was too stinky for Sweet M's acutely sensitive nose. And Snack was too dark. And eventually we were giving up and Sweet M wanted to take a taxi. I could see that she was losing her cheerful disposition, as was I, but we soon spotted a cab coming down Barrow Street.Just then a woman walked out of an apartment building hauling a suitcase behind her, and nabbed the cab. M started to lose it.  Myyyyy cab. I want a cab. I want a cab.I know you do.  We'll get a cab, don't worry. That lady got that cab but there are other cabs.I want that cab.We'll get another cab. Look over there. I pointed to Seventh Avenue that was at standstill with Holland Tunnel traffic backed up all the way through the West Village. Look, I said, there are lots of cars. We'll find a cab.We walked toward Seventh. When we got to the corner we had a red light and so couldn't hail the cab that was all the way across five lanes of traffic.I wanna a cab she started to whine and wail as the cab moved away from us.M, M, take a deep breath I said.  Just take a deep breath.  We'll get a cab.  I promise.As I turned to hail a cab in the middle lane I noticed a woman sitting in the passenger seat of a luxury sports car, window rolled down, staring at Sweet M and I with palpable contempt.Don't stare.  It doesn't help, I said.She turned away, embarassed, I wrongly imagined.But then she turned back and started staring at M and I with a look of such contempt that I do wish there had been someone standing next to me telling me to take a deep breath.As we stepped out into the cross walk, nearly intersecting the car, I walked over to her car, and growled: My child has an autism spectrum disorder and your contemptuous staring doesn't help. If she were missing a limb you wouldn't look at her this way, so stop it, just stop it. Shame on you.She said nothing, and continued in her contemptuous staring.  We got into a cab that pulled in ahead of the car she was in.At the moment when I approached her car I was so angry that I could imagine opening her car door, dragging her out and pummelling her. Fortunately, I didn't. That's the miracle of executive brain function, however minimally mine was working at that point. I'm thankful you're reading this instead of a headline for NY1 that says \"Irate autism mom pulls sneering passenger from luxury coupe and pummels her.\" It could have happened.So, this April \u2014 which is Autism Awareness month \u2014 I hope I have not done our cause a disservice by failing to be my usual gracious self. I am so tired of people who, knowing nothing about what Sweet M's life is like, feel completely comfortable standing in judgment of her and of me, and of our family. I am running out of patience.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022 parenting\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId=%7B6E31DECE-D293-4EB0-BBB8-3A78F4EA2EC1%7D", "http://www.iceagemovie.com/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/autism_awareness_month.php"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/04/losing-it-or-meltdown-ii.html", "title": "\nLosing It or Meltdown II\n"},

So my apologies to all autism blog cadres members and readers who may have stopped by and found no one at home.So what's up and where have I been?It might be nice to say that I'd headed off to the Caribbean for some much needed R & R, but that wasn't it.Longtime visitors here at Autism's Edges will remember way-back-when when I'd come home from a interview for a new project and Sweet M made a rather lusty assessment of my interview getup.Well, the folks who were recruiting me for that project came back with an offer in late February \u2014 just about the time we set out for our adventure in Chocolate World. But due to a whole array of complexities the contract negotiations have been ongoing for two months! In the last two weeks we've finally been close to a real deal, so I will soon be back wearing that primary breadwinner hat that Sweet M's dad and I had been tossing back and forth to each other like some sort of hot potato over the last several years.Sweet M's dollhouse is the one place that theclosets are clean and the people get to sleepfor eight hours every night.And then there was a bit of spring cleaning mania that I embarked upon. There were places in our lower Manhattan apartment that were still sporting dust from before the events of September 11th. In the last four years I'd been so busy with everything that I'd started operating by the motto that a clean home is a sign of a uninteresting life. But actually it was driving me crazy to know that at the top of the book cases there was a dust layer as thick as felt. So I've taken that edgy slightly manic springtime energy that could turn to irritation and channeled it into a household cleanup. Although our apartment would still cause Martha Stewart to grimace, there's been a little progress.So I've been missing in action, but hardly inactive.As Kyra aka This Mom wondered a while back, I'm wondering how I'm going to maintain my autism blog, and handle the time pressures that this new project will entail. I wonder how other autism mom and dad bloggers do it all: their jobs, their parenting responsibilities, their blogs. Kristina at Autismland has not one, but two blogs that she posts on regularly. Kevin maintains Autism Hub and another site. How do you do it? What gives? Can you maintain anything like a career, something that approaches a social life, perhaps a love life, a home that isn't a breeding ground for the next generation of super bacteria?Over here at Autism's Edges one autism mom is wondering . . .\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/03/goodbye_for_now.html", "http://www.kristinachew.com/", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/04/missing-in-action.html", "title": "\nMissing in Action\n"},

Protect Educational Rights Under IDEA Multi-Year IEP and Paperwork Waiver  Programs Pose DangersACTION ALERTFrom the National Down Syndrome SocietyFebruary 27, 2006   Your help is urgently needed.On December 19, the U.S. Department of Education published the proposed requirements and selection criteria for two pilot projects, the Multi-Year IEP and Paperwork Waiver programs.These are the rules that States must follow in implementing these pilot programs and the criteria that the Department will use to decide which States will participate in each pilot.The proposed requirements and selection criteria for both pilots expand the scope of the pilots beyond what Congress intended and do not adequately protect the educational rights of childrenThe public has until March 6th to comment on the proposed requirements and criteria. After that date, the Department will publish the final requirements and criteria.    The National Down Syndrome Congress (NDSC) and the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) submitted joint comments and recommendations on the Multi-Year IEP and Paperwork Waiver programs. They need your help and support now.  What? Please send an email to the U. S. Department of Education and Congress. Urge the Department of Education not to erode IDEA civil rights and the IEP.   How? Visit http://capwiz.com/ndss/issues/alert/?alertid=8519506 and type your zip code in the box at the top of the page to send a prepared email along with your comments to the Department of Education and Congress.When? The deadline to submit comments is March 6, 2006.  BackgroundIDEA 2004 permits two demonstration programs, also known as \u201cpilots.\u201dThe Multi-Year IEP pilot allows up to 15 states to seek approval for proposals to offer parents the option of a multi-year IEP. IDEA states that this pilot was developed to offer the opportunity for long-term planning.  The Paperwork Waiver Pilot allows up to 15 states to seek waivers of certain IDEA statutory and regulatory requirements for a period that is not to exceed 4 years.IDEA states that the purpose of this pilot is to reduce excessive paperwork and non-instructional time burdens that do not assist in improving educational and functional results for students with disabilities. The statute also mandates that procedural safeguards, civil rights requirements, and the right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE) may not be waived or affected.  The U. S. Department of Education appears to have exceeded its authority by expanding the scope of these pilots beyond the requirements of the statute.   ConcernsOn December 19th, the U.S. Department of Education published notices of proposed requirements and selection criteria for both of these pilots. These are the rules that States must follow in implementing the pilots and the criteria that will be used by the Department to decide which States will be permitted to participate in each pilot.The public has until March 6th to comment on the proposed requirements and criteria. At some point after that date the Department will publish the final versions.The problem with the proposed requirements and selection criteria for both pilots is that they expand the statutory scope of the pilots and do not adequately protect the educational rights that IDEA was enacted to uphold.  Proposed Requirements Threaten FAPE, Change IEPs, IEP ProcessThe proposed requirements for the pilot programs threaten FAPE and could change the IEP and the IEP process forever.These pilots are of immediate concern for children with disabilities in up to 30 States. 15 States will be awarded the Multi-Year IEP Pilot and 15 States will be awarded the Paperwork Waiver Pilot. Some States may apply for and be awarded both pilots.One long-term concern is that these pilots may become the basis for changes to IDEA that will affect children with disabilities in all States. For example, during the next reauthorization of IDEA, the multi-year IEP might become a requirement, not just an option for parents to choose. The civil rights protections in IDEA could be permanently eroded.  The proposed requirements for BOTH pilots would allow up to 30 States to create IEPs that differ in their content, development, review and revision from the annual IEPs you have been using.NDSS believes that this is a violation of FAPE, which requires a free appropriate education with special education and related services that are provided in conformity with the IEP requirements under IDEA.   Proposed Requirements Not Consistent with Congressional IntentThe proposed pilot requirements appear to go beyond what Congress intended when these pilots were added to IDEA. The report from the House of Representatives on IDEA 2004 clearly states that the usual IDEA rules for IEP development are intended to apply to multi-year IEPs.If Congress did not intend to waive the usual IEP rules for multi-year IEPs, why would it be acceptable to change these statutory requirements for any other purpose?  Proposed Requirements Are Vague About Parental InputAnother problem with the proposed requirements for both pilots is the vague language regarding the opportunity that parents will have to provide input into the their State\u2019s pilot proposal and into the implementation and evaluation of the pilots.Parental input is critically important to ensure that long-term planning and paperwork reduction are not achieved at the expense of student outcomes and the informed involvement of parents in their child\u2019s education.In the Paperwork Waiver Pilot, who decides which tasks constitute a \u201cnon-instructional time burden that does not assist in improving educational and functional results for students with disabilities\u201d? This phrase needs to be defined with parental input.Negative Consequences of New Rules Relating to \"Paperwork Reduction\"It is important to remember that the requirements for short-term objectives in IEPs for certain students with disabilities was eliminated in IDEA 2004 in the name of paperwork reduction. This decision raises concerns about where paperwork reduction might lead, despite the fact that procedural safeguards, civil rights requirements, and the right to FAPE are supposed to be kept in place.  The proposed requirements for the Paperwork Waiver Pilot raise the same issues as the Multi-Year IEP Pilot, and some additional concerns.Proposed Requirements Permit IEP Requirements, Parental Consent to be WaivedAccording to the proposed requirements for the Paperwork Waiver Pilot, IEP requirements AND other statutory, regulatory and State requirements may be waived.The standards for selecting these waivers are dangerously vague. Parental consent, which is required for a multi-year IEP, is not required for these other waivers.In addition to these flaws in the proposed requirements, there are also significant problems with the limited scrutiny provided by the selection criteria which the Department proposes to use in deciding which States will participate in each pilot.The proposed criteria must be amended to include more details and additional criteria must be included to address the many important considerations and protections that have been omitted.  Call to Action Parents, friends, family members of children with disabilities, and organizations that represent their interests need to send emails to the U.S. Department of Education and Congress. We need to show these decision makers that there is extensive grassroots support for the recommendations to improve the proposed requirements and selection criteria for the Multi-Year IEP and Paperwork Waiver pilots.NDSS and NCSC prepared an email that will take only a few minutes for you to complete and send.We ask you to take one more short step. Your email will be far more effective and powerful if you personalize it by including a story about your child and why the annual IEP and the IEP process is important to your child's education and educational outcomes.

Her annual IEP for this year \u2014 written last May \u2014 called for her to be reading at a K.5 level at the end of this year. But as you know, because of interventions we've made, she is now already reading at an early 1st grade level. She made a full years worth of reading progress in four months. So even an annual IEP doesn't keep up with her development when appropriate adjustments are made to her reading program. A biennial IEP would be a disaster.In the interest of cutting down on their workloads, educators and the Department of Education are risking our kids' programs and progress.With multi-year IEPs, more children will slip through the cracks, and those who need critical interventions simply won't get the adjustments that they need.And, as we know, in autism, as in other developmental differences, every day counts.Don't let the Department of Education leave our kids behind.Please take a minute out of your busy day to let your congress people know what you think about this move to pilot multi-year IEPS.Thank you.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022   special education  \u2022   IDEA - Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  \u2022   Leave No Child Behind \u2014 Really!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://capwiz.com/ndss/issues/alert/?alertid=8519506", "http://capwiz.com/ndss/issues/alert/?alertid=8519506", "http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20051800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/E5-7506.htm", "http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20051800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/E5-7507.htm", "http://capwiz.com/ndss/issues/alert/?alertid=8519366", "http://capwiz.com/ndss/issues/alert/?alertid=8519391", "mailto:rsabia@ndss.org", "mailto:info@ndss.org", "mailto:info@ndss.org", "http://www.ndss.org/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/03/iep-idea-emergency-action-alert-time.html", "title": "\nIEP \u2013 IDEA Emergency \u2014 Action Alert \u2014 Time Sensitive!\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 29, 2006", "body": "\nLast week the school psychologist phoned me to tell me that Sweet M wouldn't go to the girls' play therapy group because the room stank. The school psychologist already makes sure that the garbage cans in her office are emptied before the group starts, so that Sweet M won't be disturbed by stinky leftovers from other children's lunches. But on this particular day there was nothing in the garbage can, and no sandwiches had recently been consumed in the room. No one but Sweet M could smell the offending smell. And she wouldn't go into the room.Fortunately, the school psychologist didn't try to force her to go into the room. Sweet M played right outside the door. But it's hard to be part of the group \u2014 and she loves this group \u2014 when you're sitting outside the door because the room stinks.What doesn't stink is that the school psychologist got it right: she accepted Sweet M's perceptual challenge and accommodated it, and then called to brainstorm with me about solutions. So we're sending some Febreze and some perfumes into school for Sweet M \u2014 an olfactory first aid kit for those days when odors overwhelm. That is what I would call sweet progress.As far as her olfactory sensitivities go, I'm wondering it they're like those I had when pregnant with her. Evolutionary biologists suppose that morning sickness and the heightened sense of smell that comes with it has the function of protecting the first trimester fetus from potential toxins by making the pregnant mother averse to all but the blandest of foods. Some autism parents \u2014 I'll have to dig up where I read this \u2014 theorize that our kids' olfactory sensitivities are designed to protect them from eating foods that their digestive systems' can't handle well. Or perhaps is simply that the olfactory area of the brain is more developed in our kids than in neurotypical children.And I'm seeing career opportunities: I wonder if Sweet M might have a future as a perfumer . . . as a \"nose.\"Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022 parenting\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/04/what-stinks.html", "title": "\nWhat Stinks?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 03, 2006", "body": "\nI have no idea what Sweet M will do during the summer.Last year she was part of an inclusion program at a local YMCA, and she has begged me not to have her return there.The program took place mostly in a local public school that does not conduct classes in the summer for a good reason \u2014 there's no air conditioning and the rooms are oven-like. They take breaks to go to the Y's swimming pool, but the camp counselors were too young and untrained to really work well with Sweet M. (Though I will say that some of them really tried.) She wound up refusing to swim, even though she usually loves swimming, because the counselors weren't permitted (or thought they weren't permitted) to help her get in and out of her swimsuit.The summer before last she was taking a bus to Dobb's Ferry to attend a camp for kids with special needs. She was ambivalent about that, as was I. That involved a 6:30 a.m. bus pick-up about two miles from where we live so that she could be in Dobb's Ferry by 8.I just have no idea what we'll do with her this summer. For those of us with kids in nine-month school programs, summer plans, programs, and placements are a challenge that we start thinking about in January. So I'm already late.Trying to catch up, I went today to listen to a talk about summer programs for ADHD kids. Well, at least that's what I thought it was. In point of fact it was a presentation about a single program, the NYU Summer Program for Kids.I'd been warned by someone at Sweet M's school that this program has not worked well for kids from Sweet M's school. But I wasn't prepared for what I saw. I couldn't even stay through the Q & A because I thought I would probably start ranting. While I am often a fan of treatment, services. and clinicians at the NYU Child Study Center, I have to say that this presentation left me appalled.Essentially the summer ADHD program consists of unremitting supervision and point calculation. The kids are tracked on 16 negative behaviors and 9 positive behaviors and scored continuously on detailed ledger sheets, which are later tabulated so that rewards or punishments can be handed down.The gender breakdown was something like 48 boys and 4 girls.  That would so not work for Sweet M.But the most telling moment was when the person presenting, Dr. Karen Fleiss, shared video clips of these supposedly wonderful programs.In one clip, the children and counselors are sitting in an echoy gymnasium doing a debriefing about some competitive sport. The counselor is talking so loudly and so quickly, and the room was so hollow and echoing, that there is little chance that M would even be able to understand any of the language. Lots of ADHD kids have auditory discrimination and language processing problems. How could this possibly be appropriate?Dr. Fleiss introduced the second video clip as an example of an amazing art teacher at work, but what was actually included in that clip show no evidence of art making at all. Instead the teacher was barking out point counts \u2014 merits and demerits \u2014 to a group of squirming kids. Where was the art?At another point Dr. Fleiss pointed out \u2014 with what I understood as professional pride \u2014 that sometimes the 7 minute time-out periods are too long for the little ones, but that the counselors don't make any adjustments to the time until there is a full clinical review. Gosh, I wonder how long that takes. And does anyone remember how long 7 minutes feels when you're 7 years old, sensory processing and attentional issues notwithstanding?Beyond that, I wondered how any of the psychiatric professionals who were part of this audience at the NYU Child Study Center's Grand Rounds would feel if they were closely scrutinized from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. on every single behavior they engage in, and then had their pay docked for failing to cooperate as \"team players\" or were required to sit outside their offices any time they spoke out of turn or behaved in an arrogant and self-important manner.Even the website promoting this program notes that:\" . . . there is no research to date that has systematically studied the generalization of the improved skills once the eight week program has ended.\" That does not surprise.  Who could live like this?While I'm interested in finding ways of cultivating M's strengths and increasing her social skills and frustration tolerance, this is certainly not the right place for her.All of this left me so very sad. Sad, of course, that I haven't yet found a good place for Sweet M for the summer.But even sadder for the kids who are put through regimens that are not far from military boot camps in their content, but which use the cool calculus of continuous point systems \u2014 instead of the physical abuse of a military school \u2014 to extract compliance.I wept in the cab that I took home.

{"date": "Thursday, March 09, 2006", "body": "\nYesterday afternoon I spent an extended period of time flat on my back on East 16th Street near Fifth Avenue in New York City, staring up at the bluest of blue late winter skies. The view of the sky \u2014 the tops of the buildings as they cut a swath across the sky on each side of the street \u2014 was exquisitely beautiful.  I've never seen the city from this particular angle.How I came to this delirious, if most unexpected perspective, remains something of a mystery to me.  I had been crossing the street with a young woman who is interested in what I'm writing about autism.  We were planning on having lunch, and set out between two parked cars, to cross the street.  I looked left \u2014 the direction of the oncoming traffic \u2014 and assessed that we had plenty of time to cross before a taxi van coming off of Fifth would be near. Then I heard the sound of myself making a small shrieking noise.  I don't recall making the sound; I only remember hearing it and thinking, oh, an awful sound. A shriek, but incomplete.  Interrupted.  Abrupt.  Is that me making that sound? I wondered.  This acoustic information was followed by the sensation of my back slamming against the street.  An instant later, I felt the back of my head slam hard against the asphalt, bounce once, and then slam again.  I think I was conscious through this, but I don't really know for sure.  The good news was that nothing seemed to hurt.The woman whom I was meeting, whom we'll call Sharon, came to my side, holding my glasses, and asking if I was okay.I said I didn't know, but I that I thought I was, other than the fact that I had the impression that the back of my head was rather squishy.  My arms and legs were happily doing well, so I tried to feel the back of my head, but gave up my efforts when I realized that I would have to move my head to check it out. Having absolutely no idea what happened to me, I thought it unwise to try to move. Many solicitous strangers, some of them physicians, stood nearby discussing whether to move me, and deciding against.  Some asked me how I was, and I said I think I'm okay, but the back of my head feels squishy. It could just be some swelling, I said, but I think I'll just stay here and use the asphalt as a cold compress until someone can assess me.Sharon asked if there was someone she could call and I offered our home phone number. She told me \u2014 and my answering machine at home \u2014 that I was struck by a bicycle messenger.  I couldn't tell if she got through to my husband. The sky was so blue, so beautiful.  People came and went. Someone leaned over me and said he was a doctor, and asked if I was okay.  He was, I must admit, rather lovely.  I said I thought so, but that I wasn't sure, and that I thought I would just keep my head still until I felt more certain about it.  He agreed that this was a good idea.A few minutes later, a woman leaned over me and said she was a nurse, and asked if I was okay. I said I think so, but I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure it's a good idea to try to get up, but I know there is traffic on this street.  Let them wait, she said.  Don't move.  An ambulance is coming.  We called, but we called from the clinic and since we are a clinic they sometimes don't come as quickly.  A clinic, I thought.  What clinic is on this block?  How can she also be so lovely, I thought.  There has been a sudden outbreak of exquisite beauty on 16th Street, looking upward from the asphalt.Someone told someone else to keep cars from coming onto 16th Street and I could hear the sound of a person running down the block, a receding thud thud thud through the asphalt. Very far away I could hear the sound of an ambulance.I was getting cold because my coat had fallen open during this unexpected turn of events.  Sharon put her coat on top of me and stood shivering. She looked so much colder than I felt. I felt badly because she was actually shivering and I was only cold.Soon after, perhaps fifteen minutes later \u2014 though I had no real attachment to time \u2014 an ambulance arrived and some EMTs put me on a backboard and hoisted me into an ambulance and took me off to the ER.  Sharon offered to come with me, and I was happy to accept her offer.  She had my glasses, my bag, and the only story about what had happened other than the fragments that I have shared here.  We went to the ER, and after a brief interval I was assessed.  The Dx: head trauma without neurological symptoms.  After some confusion about what they wanted to do with me, I was told not to sleep for more than two hours at a stretch and released.I have spent a considerable amount of time in the last twenty-four hours to try to understand why I didn't just get up off the asphalt on 16th Street.  After all, my arms and legs were working.  I was blocking the street, blocking traffic.  I probably could have just gotten up.  I tried to move but it made my back hurt, so I stopped and waited for help to come. As soon as I had been checked out by a doctor in the ER, I was happy, even eager to sit up, and walk around.  Everything was still working, more or less. Despite all of my ambivalence about medical authority \u2014 so often discussed in this blog \u2014 I had waited to hear from a doctor that it was okay to move before I got myself up.  I wondered, all day today, what has happened to the cavalier young woman who had once been me.  Where was the woman who would have just gotten up and brushed herself off? The answer unfolded over the course of day, but in the end it was a very simple answer.Autism and motherhood has changed me.  We don't need a paraplegic parent and a child with a developmental issue all in the same household. Sweet M relies on me, and so I rely on a whole world of others all of the time, but most clearly in moments like this, when a chance collision derails my own trajectory, my own foolhardy sense of autonomy.My thanks to all of the people who came to my aid: To Sharon, who set out for a lunch meeting and wound up in the ER.  And to the lovely doctor and nurse who have left me wondering if people actually look more beautiful when they are looking after you.  To the EMTs who hoisted and the ER doctors and nurses who palpated and pronounced. To the person who ran down the street to send the midday traffic another way. And to my sweet husband who collected me at the ER and took me home. Many many people stopped to help.  It is impossible to thank them all \u2014 particularly as I could only see those who leaned right over me.Today I feel fragile, as well as fortunate. I have been spared the headache that many had foretold. I hope that the bicycle messenger has fared at least as well. He left the scene quickly, though I am told that he apologized to Sharon over and over and over again. Apparently he was covered in blood, but I imagine that he could not afford to wait for medical attention \u2014 and the possible blame that any attendant authority might assign to him, riding, as he'd been, the wrong way down a one-way street. I never saw him. Not even for a second. But he's left his inadvertent mark.Tonight, out of the blue, maroon bruises are blossoming in unexpected places all over my body. I discover a tire tread on a thigh, and an enormous red patch spreads out from just above my cesarean incision. Strange aches and pains come with these marks. I am changed \u2014 I can feel that \u2014 in ways that are more hidden than strained muscles and burst capillaries.  There is something to knowing that even if it takes only one person (and a speeding bicycle) to level you, that there are dozens who are willing to help you get back up again. This is a new perspective for me \u2014 as strange and perhaps even more beautiful than the view of the late winter skyline from the asphalt on 16th Street.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/03/out-of-blue-maroon.html", "title": "\nOut of the Blue, Maroon\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, March 11, 2006", "body": "\nLast week Charlie from Autismland had some difficult days. Bud was having trouble sleeping in spite of the fact that Mom-NOS was giving him some additional melatonin. Kev noted in a comment in Autismland that his little Meg, in the UK, was having a hard time as well. And Sweet M had an outburst at school that, while milder than her meltdown a few months ago, was nonetheless discouraging.Unlike coeur-ageous autismland fellow traveler Kristina Chew, I did not have the heart to write at length about Sweet M's late winter meltdown. Instead I slept more, and trying to forget about all this, dove under the covers with an intensity that surprised even me \u2014 dreaming of . . . dreaming of . . . what, exactly?One day I dreamt that there had been a terrible mistake and that there was nothing wrong with Sweet M, that she was perfectly fine. Later in the week, as I was avoiding all sorts of writing, I dreamt that I was being tested for dyslexia. I have never actually been tested for dyslexia, but in my dream the exam involved viewing a diamond-shaped pattern on a piece of paper that had two diagonal folds. If you could see the fold line continuously, you were typical, but if the fold line appeared to have any breaks in it, then you were dyslexic.When I tried to make a drawing of it, it looked strangely like an argyle pattern.In this dream I was diagnosed as dyslexic because I was seeing a broken line in the lower right-hand quadrant. But then the person administering the test moved the test sheet and I could see that it was only the glare from the light that had made the fold line look broken or intermittent. The glare had changed my vision. At one moment I was diagnosed dyslexic, and in the next, with barely an adjustment of the test paper, I was \"normal\" again.The glare of the light off the surface of the paper had made the difference.Temple Grandin advises educators to use a low contrast paper when asking some children in the spectrum to work with text. Donna Williams writes of wearing special Irlen tinted lenses to soften the effect of light on her disposition.For we human creatures, autistic and NT alike, light matters. Although I'm no endocrinologist, I know that light levels affect our hormones, our neurotransmitters, even our vitamin levels.When night falls, melatonin levels rise and, if we are not too sensitive to artificial light or subjected to jet travel across time zones, we grow drowsy and sleep. For those of us who sleep through the night without wetting ourselves, we can thank an anti-diuretic hormone that kicks in when the sun goes down.Our cycles of fertility are said to have been tied to the changing light of moon, with ovulation triggered by the brightness night of the full moon and menstruation falling in the dark of the moon. Some authors speculate that as we've disenchanted the night, first lighting caves with torches, and then whole cities with gas lights and electricity, we've unmoored that lunar cycle.Bright light boosts levels of serotonin, and exposure to bright lights can be used to treat seasonal affective disorder \u2014 the winter blues. And we have known for a very long time that sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin. We know how much light matters, yet we still believe that we control ourselves and our affect. And these are just a few of the most commonly observed light-induced physiological effects.So you can see, I have been thinking a great deal about light in the past week, as the days have grown so much longer and the mid-day sun is so bright that it hurts my eyes. After years of difficulties that appeared in the late winter and early spring time \u2014 depression, anxiety, loss of focus, emotional fragility and irritability \u2014 I was finally diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder, or seasonal cyclothymia. Sudden changes in the amount of daylight change me in palpable ways. Often, at this time of year, I have the urge to close the shades and plunge under the dark and cozy comforter even when I'm not coping with changes in Sweet M's behavior.When required by the demands of life to emerge into the bright daylight, I used to be unaccountably irritable or surly. Like bears who are most dangerous when first awakened from hibernation, my affect can be dysregulated as I adjust to the new brightness of the spring. Now that I am more aware of these cycles, I am more prepared for the arrival of spring fever and more able to breath in, and breath out, and avoid regretable interpersonal snarls and snags.If the segue from winter to spring can still challenge me, an adult with many years of experience navigating the transition from winter to spring and with a more or less typical neurological makeup, how much more difficult must it be for kids in the spectrum, who are so sensitive to light, to sound, to changes of temperature, to nuances of mood and affect?We speak of our children having difficulty with transitions, but we typically think of those transitions as changes in our daily routines or our holiday and school calendars. Removed, as we are, from our agricultural origins, and discounting the importance of our mammalian heritage, we are likely to overlook the impact of the natural transitions that come with the changes of the seasons. I would have, had it not been for the daily posts from Autismland \u2014 and dispatches from all over the spectrum \u2014 which helped to shed new light on the week's dysregulations.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  parenting  \u2022   seasonal affective disorder\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/03/keeping_the_fai.html#comment-14734975", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/to-sleep-perchance-to-dream.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/home.php", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/03/keeping_the_fai.html#comment-14734975", "http://www.kristinachew.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/03/late-winter-light.html", "title": "\nLate Winter Light\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 14, 2006", "body": "\nBack in December 2005 \u2014 three months ago \u2014 Sweet M started taking Focalin, a stimulant medication for the attentional deficits that figure in her neurological makeup. We started her on the medication over the Christmas school break so we could monitor the effects of the stimulant closely. We had tried one of the ADHD medications before, and it had increased her anxiety \u2014 and therefore her episodes of dysregulation, aka meltdowns \u2014 so we had previously discontinued use of a stimulant medication. In other words, we were proceeding with caution.Her attention and focus improved immediately, and we enjoyed a remarkably easy Christmas holiday. When she returned to school, the positive reports came in almost immediately. Her speech language therapist reported that she'd had her best day ever \u2014 and had actually been chatting, that is, making conversation rather than using speech for purely pragmatic purposes.Her teachers commented that she was starting to follow along in group discussions during class. And the formal assessment of the effectiveness of the medication \u2014 something called a SNAP-IV survey \u2014 showed remarkable gains in her behavior.These two charts show the changes in her various symptoms when treated with Paxil alone, versus when treated with a combination of Paxil and Focalin. Although there is a slight increase of obsessive symptoms when the stimulant medication is added, the drop in inattentiveness and impulsivity is pronounced.It's odd to think of a bar graph as a sort of picture of one's child, but in so many ways, it can be \u2014 each bar is a snapshot of her behavior (or, more accurately, my assessment of her behavior) at particular junctures.And just in case my answers are skewed \u2014 impacted by my knowledge of her medications \u2014 there is also the classroom teacher's evaluation, which shows a similar effect, though with fewer \"snapshots.\"About six weeks after we started seeing these genuinely positive results from the Focalin, the FDA issued a black box warning \u2014its most serious warming \u2014 on all ADHD stimulant medications, Focalin among them.I heard the news on the radio and at first it seemed serious: 25 children who were taking one of these medications, had died suddenly with strokes or heart failure. Sweet M's godmother, who was visiting at the time, shared her concerns. I wondered and worried:What did it really mean? What were parents supposed to do? What were we going to do?It took a while to sort out the implications of this most recent panic, but the reality is that the FDA's decision to black box these medications was not based on any new evidence or new studies. Rather it was based on the fact that a total of 25 people, among the millions who are now prescribed stimulant medications, suffered from cardiovascular failure. It is not unusual for 25 individuals in a million to have such failures, even without medications.Dr. Edward Hallowell, who specializes in the treatment of ADHD, writes in the Los Angeles Times:The [FDA] recommendation was based on an upsurge in stimulant prescriptions, which the panel found alarming when coupled with 25 reports of sudden deaths in people taking the medications \u2014 even though there was no proof the stimulants caused the deaths. In other words, it isn't that the drugs are more dangerous than we thought, it's that they're probably being too freely prescribed: A federal survey found that nearly 1 in 10 12-year-old American boys takes a stimulant.Stimulants have been used since 1937 to treat what we now call attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Used properly, they have been proved safe and effective. Like all medications, and even water, stimulants used improperly can be dangerous, even fatal. But keep perspective: Aspirin is more dangerous for adults than stimulants. And penicillin is estimated to kill 500 to 1,000 people each year. Yet we rightly revere aspirin and penicillin, while cautioning that they be used with care. No black box needed.So what about those 25 sudden deaths? First, it is not at all clear that because a person dies when taking a certain medication, the drug caused the death. Nor is there evidence that the number of sudden deaths is statistically significant \u2014 meaning more than random. There are 30 unexpected, sudden deaths per year per 1 million children between the ages of 10 and 14. More than 1 million children of that age take stimulants. Of the 25 deaths cited by the FDA panel, 19 were children. Therefore, we cannot conclude that stimulants raise the risk of sudden death.So why the panic? Panic and risk management are an increasingly prevalent state of mind and response to contemporary events. Cultural critics Toby Miller and Marie Claire Leger have written a valuable article that makes the point that contemporary parents are engaged in a complex calculus of risk management. In a rapidly changing global order where there is the risk of occupational obsolescence not only for ourselves, but also for our children, parents are engaged in ongoing assessments of what is riskier for their children: taking a stimulant medication and remaining competitive in school, and subsequently, it is hoped, in a global economic context, or exposing their children to potential side effects from various psychotropic medications, Ritalin among them.Miller and Leger are building on the work of German social theorists Urlich Beck and Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim, who argue that we are moving into a new period of modernity that has as its main features a highly atomized form of individuality that they call individualization. In this context, class affiliation and social status become less important. And instead of engaging in a battle for access to resources, we find we are engaged in all sorts of activities intended to minimize our risks. They call this \"the risk society.\" In a sense, we all become unconscious insurance actuaries, trying to assess what course of action will offer our selves and our children the greatest chances to survive, and we might even hope \u2014 on a good day \u2014 thrive.Rather than condemn individuals for their use of psychopharmacological interventions, Miller and Leger analyze these trends within a particular moment of late modernity, in which individuals are urged to work on themselves, and their children, to remain ever marketable \u2014 as human capital.As a parent who is actively engaged in such assessments \u2014 and who among us isn't? \u2014 keeping Sweet M on the Focalin was a no-brainer. Beyond the fact that Sweet M is regularly monitored for changes in her blood pressure (a possible side effect of the stimulant medication), the reality is that the FDA's decision to black box these medications was not based on any new evidence or new studies.While I might long for a world where my daughter could thrive without either of the medications she takes, we certainly do not inhabit such a world now, nor can I expect that we will we anytime soon. My own tendency to want to resist or refute the medical protocols of our day are mitigated by my parental desire to create the best possible life for my child in a world where the odds are already stacked against her.And so while it's a bit odd to think of parenting as a risk assessment exercise, I'm afraid that the Becks, Miller, and Leger are probably correct: we're constantly calculating the odds and aiming for the best outcomes.May we continue with the finest information, our very best possible judgment, and the most beneficial outcomes for all.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  parenting  \u2022   Ulrich Beck  \u2022   Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim  \u2022   Toby Miller  \u2022   Marie Claire Leger    \u2022   risk society  \u2022 Ritalin\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oe-hallowell26feb26,0,390168.story?coll=la-sunday-commentary", "http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:_pXfJnblzpQJ:www.critpsynet.freeuk.com/RitalinMiller.pdf+toby+miller+ritalin&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1", "http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&isbn=0761961127&itm=3", "http://www.sagepub.com/book.aspx?pid=6726"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/03/risk-management.html", "title": "\nRisk Management\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 19, 2006", "body": "\nEver since I was leveled by that bicycle messenger a week or so back, I've been thinking about the sudden outbreak of loveliness that I experienced as I was lying flat on my back on 16th Street. Each person who came by to help suddenly looked lovelier than the last, and the blue of the winter sky was so exquisite that it nearly brought tears to my eyes. How was it that everything and everyone had suddenly become of so unaccountably lovely?All of this got me thinking about hormones.While much has been written about the \"fight or flight\" rush of adrenaline and coritsol that occurs when one encounters a stressful situation that calls for battle or retreat, I don't think much of anything has been written about the flood of chemicals that must be released when one is injured, knocked down, belly-up, wholly incapable of either a fight or flight, and thus completely dependent on the loving kindness of others.What, I wondered, happens when we're suddenly injured? What happens that inures us to the pain of our injuries and renders our impression of others beneficent?My thought was oxytocin.Oxytocin is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamus at the based of the pituitary gland. Associated with the contractions of childbirth, the onset of lactation and the overall success of maternal bonding, oxytocin also seems to be necessary for all sorts of social bonding.I don't know if anything at all has been written about the biochemistry of surrender. And I've spent a good bit of my professional life discounting biological explanations of social effects, but could it be that oxytocin is the hormone not only of bonding, but also of surrender? Could it be that there is an evolutionary value in having a lovely hormone that makes you loving and trusting when you haven't got even the remotest possibility of fighting or fleeing and quite urgently need the help of others? Perhaps the outbreak of loveliness that I experienced on 16th Street was little more than a flood of oxytocin.And what about oxytocin and autism?There is some evidence that dysregulations of oxytocin and vasopressin (the anti-diuretic hormone that helps create nighttime continence and the only other hormone known to be produced by the hypothalamus) may play a role in autism.So perhaps there is a biomedical, hormonal basis for both Sweet M's overall lack of interest in others and her nighttime incontinence. Perhaps her hypothalamus doesn't do a great job producing either of these peptides.Oxytocin has even been tested as possible medication to treat repetitive behaviors and lack of social interest in autistic individuals. The hormone was in the news this past summer when a study conducted at the University of Zurich that demonstrated how effective oxytocin is in heightening trust. Researchers even suggest developing a nasal spray to increase levels of trust in individuals with social phobia or autism.Completely by coincidence, while I'd been doing all this thinking about oxytocin, I've also been reading Susan Senator's powerful memoir of parenting her autistic son and his two brothers. Early on in Making Peace with Autism, Senator is very honest in describing a sense of detachment she felt from and for her eldest son \u2014 her autistic son \u2014 when she brought him home from the hospital.I read this segment with the greatest of interest because I, too, remember being puzzled at how I felt when I'd brought Sweet M home from the hospital. While there was something sort of adorable about her, there were, frankly, other moments when I would look at Sweet M and think \"who are you, where did you come from, and what are you doing here?\" Someone told me I had post-partum depression, or PPD. But frankly, I've been treated for depression, and on a scale of one to ten, the depression I felt postpartum was barely a 4 on my depress-o-meter.Now I'm wondering if there might not have been some sort of connection between my supposed PPD and Sweet M's subsequent PDD: not necessarily a causal connect where the equation is depressed mom yields developmentally impaired child. But rather that some biochemical deficit in the mother-child dyad that left me somewhat depressed and distant and rendered Sweet M somewhat detached and dysregulated. Perhaps she and I were oxytocin-deficient.Additional evidence for this hypothesis was that Sweet M and I were also plagued by feeding/nursing problems. No matter how much she nursed, and no matter how much I pumped, she just wasn't getting enough to eat when we were breastfeeding. After three months of frustrating and absurd interactions with \"lactation consultants\" we gave up and switched to bottle-feeding.All of my friends who were cheerfully breastfeeding their children described the maternal bliss they experienced when nursing and shortly afterwards. They felt content, happy, and less driven \u2014 even the most professionally successful among them. We jokingly, and politically incorrectly, dubbed this state of mind \"milk brain.\" Some among us were singing the praises of oxytocin and thinking it might be a prescription for world peace. And others among us worried about \"losing our edge\" \u2014 losing our critical acumen. But there was just one thing: I only felt this way once or twice in my daughter's entire infancy. And most of my fellow-mom friends seemed to feel this way much of the time. Hmmmh. Now I'm really wondering. Were Sweet M and I just not making enough oxytocin between the two of us?I realize, of course, that in thinking about this that I am treading perilously close to the dreaded and discredited \"refrigerator mother\" hypothesis that was advanced by pseudo-psychiatrist Bruno Bettelheim. Bettelheim and other, actual psychiatrists of his period (Bettelheim turned out to have been an impostor) thought that the autistic child was rendered autistic or schizophrenic by contact with his or her \"cold, intellectual\" mother. The proposed cure, of course, was to separate the child from the damaging influence of the mother by institutionalizing the child.In the last few days I've been wonder if there might not be just a tiny kernel of truth in this horrible mischaracterization of the mothers of autistic children. What if there was something biochemical in the mother-child dyad that made it exceptionally difficult for maternal-newborn bonding to flourish? What if the problems in affect were an effect of chemical processes gone awry \u2014 the result of an oxytocin deficiency?And what if the obvious love autism mothers have for their children \u2014 the love that anyone can see overflowing in the books of Susan Senator, Valerie Paradiz, Clara Claiborne Park, Eustacia Cutler, Patricia Stacey, Catherine Maurice, Beth Kephart, to name only a few, and in the blogs of so many autism moms \u2014 what if this obvious love is evidence of a remarkable triumph of heart over hypothalamus?Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  bed wetting  \u2022   enuresis   \u2022   oxytocin   \u2022   postpartum depression\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["hhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin", "http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/PaperFrameSet?OpenForm&refid=2&id=48dde4a73e09a969852568880078c249&newsid=8525697700573E1885256C9A00035424&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;u=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12496956&dopt=Abstract&ref=/news/content.nsf/news/8525697700573E1885256C9A00035424", "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=cache:K9Jf49fZn1EJ:www.iew.unizh.ch/home/kosfeld/papers/ottrust_damasio.pdf+oxytocin+autism+nasal+spray", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4599299.stm", "http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&isbn=1590302443&itm=1", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590302443/sr=8-1/qid=1142813009/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590302443/sr=8-1/qid=1142813009/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NDB4/qid=1142818562/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-4157793-5539929?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author-exact=Clara%20Claiborne%20Park&rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/104-4157793-5539929", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932565167/ref=pd_sim_b_3/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009LIGJ2/sr=8-1/qid=1142817988/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449906647/ref=pd_sim_b_2/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0688172288/sr=8-1/qid=1142818282/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/03/triumph-of-heart-over-hypothalamus.html", "title": "\nA Triumph of Heart Over Hypothalamus?\n"},

Well, that's almost what happened . . .I was about 1/4 of the way through the book when I finally couldn't stop myself from digging out sweet M's vaccination record to calculate her mercury exposure. I haven't ever seriously thought that M's language delays are a consequence of mercury poisoning, but reading Kirby's narrative really got me going. That's what muckracking journalism is meant to do, and Kirby has done it very very well. I even phoned M's doctor to get the brandnames of the vaccines from her chart so I could calculate her Hg load at each appointment in the first three years. Her doctor seemed to think I'd lost my mind, but begrudgingly pulled that info from her chart.For several days I was back to entertaining the idea that there really might be an autism epidemic\u2014all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding\u2014and that M. might really be suffering from mercury poisoning.  Afterall, I thought, what about that study that correlates mercury emissions from powerplants with neurological disorders?And, of course, this is the hook for parents: What if . . . what if . . . what if . . . her neurological challenges really are a result of mercury poisoning and I could have done something to help her and didn't?Damaged\u2014diseased\u2014disabled\u2014different:  these are the four d's that dominate the thinking about sweet M.

{"date": "Thursday, December 08, 2005", "body": "\nThis post is dedicated to the memory of Rigoberto Alpizar, the American Airlines passenger who was shot by air marshalls who misunderstood his anxiety as a terrorist threat. \u2022   \u2022   \u2022 In the public and professional part of my life, as a sociologist and cultural critic, I sometimes find myself speaking on panels or giving lectures. On Wednesday night, just shortly after Rigoberto Alpizar was gunned down in an airport skywalk when air marshalls misunderstood his frantic bipolar behavior as a sign of a terrorist threat, I was giving a talk about violence and representation. Completely by coincidence, my talk included another story of an airport terminal disaster, though admittedly on a much smaller scale.In spite of my usual practice of keeping a firewall between my personal and professional work, I had decided to talk about the sorts of social catastrophes that those of us who have children on or near the spectrum are well-acquainted with: those public meltdowns that look so violent, but have within them so many microinteractions of interpersonal violence and an enormous backdrop of institutional violence. In memory of Rigoberto Alpizar, this is the text of that talk, annotated and edited for the blog.  May such a fate never befall another person.Trauma and Violence TalkThe Drawing Center, December 7, 2005Sponsored by the NYU Institute for the Humanities andResearch in Trauma and ViolenceOrganized by Shireen R.K. Patell, moderated by Avital RonnellThank you, Shireen and Avital, for inviting me to be part of this panel. Looking around the room at this exhibition, and listening to the remarks Luiz and Patrick made, I am reminded that violence and trauma come in all shapes and sizes. There are massive traumatic events that we typically call catastrophes\u2014the war in Vietnam, so movingly represented in this exhibition, the current the siege of Iraq, the disasters of Katrina and last year\u2019s New Year\u2019s tsunami, the events of September 11th, 2001.At the risk of doing exactly what Patrick has warned us about\u2014of indulging in the displacing metaphor of everyday life as a battlefield, of making equivalences between everyday personal disasters and the wholesale slaughter of war\u2014my remarks this evening will be focused on a somewhat smaller scale, on a more intimate set of concerns, on what those of us who have family members with neurological differences have come to understand as \u201csocial catastrophes.\u201d My use of the word \u201csocial\u201d is not academic. I am not using this word in the social science sense as \u201cin contrast to natural or economic.\u201d Rather I am using \u201csocial\u201d in a more vernacular sense: \"social\" in terms of the incapacity to conform to social conventions, and all that that can precipitate.I\u2019ll offer an example of a social catastrophe in the form of a story. The story involves a 4-year-old girl, her mother, a map, a telephone, an airport baggage claim area, and the numerous people who circulate through such a space, including, but not limited to the police, other passengers, taxi dispatchers, and local tourism officials.The mother of this story is me, and the four-year-old girl is my daughter in the year 2002.It was August and we were exhausted from months of navigating through the disaster assistance bureaucracies associated with the events of September 11th and the educational and therapeutic bureaucracies involved in caring for a child like sweet M. My doctor, only half joking, prescribed a vacation in lieu of inpatient care at Bellevue. So we found ourselves in the airport in St. Thomas after a long set of flights that had been many times delayed. We were tired and hot, and waiting for luggage that seemed to be even more delayed than we were.Sweet M. watched with rapt attention as each piece of luggage appeared from behind the rubbery black slats that separate the St. Thomas tarmac from the sweltering terminal and the conveyer belt that snakes through it.She was counting each bag. We were well into the twenties and our bags had still not appeared. Soon she was reaching out to touch each new piece of luggage as it slipped by. Touch, count, touch, her own personal blessing.Our bags were nowhere in sight, and with each touch she was leaning closer and closer to being swept onto the conveyor belt, lost as she was in the rhythm of the bags and their magical appearances\u2014the-now-you-see-it, now-you-don\u2019t of Freud\u2019s fort-da, only here it was automated, to her complete delight.Her father was anxious that she\u2019d be pulled onto the belt; he motioned me to move her back.A hurried passenger grabbed for a piece of luggage and bumped into her.  I glare at the passenger.  Watch out, I\u2019m thinking.  For Christ\u2019s sake.  Watch out.  You might imagine that this thought was simply one of maternal protection\u2014don\u2019t knock my kid over\u2014but I\u2019m worried about more than that.\u201cCome on, honey.  Let\u2019s go get a map,\u201d I say.\u201cNo-no-no. Bags, mama. Bags.\u201d I could see her starting. She has many fewer words that your average four-year-old and, perhaps as a consequence, she also has what her neurologist calls \u201cpoor frustration tolerance.\u201d\u201cCome on, bunny. Let\u2019s get a MAP.\u201d Although she is four, I pronounce \u201cmap\u201d with the utter enthusiasm one uses for coaxing a two-year-old. I act as if a map were the best thing ever\u2014something that would rival her other favorites: vanilla ice cream or the g-forces of an amusement park ride.I take her hand. \u201cMAP, I say, map.\u201d She reluctantly agrees.I realize at once that I may have made a mistake. In the management self-help books that I know so well from my other research, readers are told to manage expectations--to \u201cunder- promise and over-deliver.\u201d I fear I may have overpromised. I think now that this map thing had better be good . . .Across the small terminal there is a visitor\u2019s center\u2014a cubicle where a tall, white, middle-aged man wearing aviator glasses sits perched on a stool, ready to hand out maps and tourist information.\u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asks.\u201cYes.  Can we get a ferry schedule and a map?\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d  he says, and starts to hand me a map.M. suddenly looks panicked.\u201cI want a map, I wanna map,\u201d she exclaims in that excruciating voice that makes adult wince.The man stands up to his full height, towering above her, and brings his thumbs to his ears, wiggling his fingers like the antlers of an elk or moose engaged in a display of dominance. \u201cI wanna map, I wanna map,\u201d he mimicks her.With this, she unravels.\u201cI wanna map, I wanna a map,\u201d she screams back at him. The sound pierces the terminal. She has a scream that will sear the myelin sheaths off the nerve-endings of any hearing person in a quarter mile radius. When we\u2019d first left the hospital of her birth, the nurse had said\u2014 portentously as it turned out\u2014\u201cGood luck, you\u2019ve got a screamer.\u201d\u201cI wanna map, I wanna map,\u201d the tourism representative continues his mimicry. We have been working for a full year in speech therapy to un-do M.\u2019s own tendencies to echolaliac speech, but there is little I can do about this man, goading her on.\u201cJust give her the map,\u201d I say, my voice slow and low, nearly a growl.The man sitting under the Welcome to the US Virgin Islands sign flashes me a look that telegraphs \u201cGet your spoiled brat out of here.\u201d But he hands her a map. I thank him and we hurry out of the visitor\u2019s center. M. is clutching her map, methodically tearing it into tiny pieces that leave a trail behind us through the terminal.F. is still waiting for the luggage to appear. I signal him that we\u2019re going to the snack bar. I\u2019ll get her a Sprite, I think. A Sprite and popcorn. Clear food, and white food, are the only things she will eat, not just at this snack bar, but anywhere. The luggage eventually arrives. F. somehow manages to stack it all on our luggage caddy and joins us at the snack bar.\u201cYou stay with her,\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019ll call the hotel.\u201d  I turn to M. and say, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201dShe looks bereft and starts again: \u201cI  wanna go I wanna go.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d  I say. \u201cCome on then.\u201dThe pay phone isn\u2019t far from the snack bar. M. loves phones, pay phones in particular. In fact one might say that she is obsessed with them. When we walk along the streets of the city, she stops at each one, picks up the handset and carefully selects her numbers. She doesn\u2019t speak, but listens intently to whatever the recording tells her: that her call cannot be completed as dialed or that she should please deposit 25 cents to make a call.Here, at the pay phone in the St. Thomas airport, however, there is another problem. The payphone is at the height of an average standing adult. Apparently the Americans with Disabilities Act hasn\u2019t yet inspired them\u2014or required them\u2014to lower it to the height of wheelchair users and four-year-olds. She can\u2019t reach the phone and she\u2019s starting to lose it again.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d I say, \u201cWe\u2019ll get a chair . . . CHAIR.\u201d I motion to the snack bar, and she and I retrieve a chair. She climbs up, visibly relieved that she can reach.I let her put the coins into phone.  She listens with satisfaction as each one drops, then I start to dial the number.\u201cI wanna do it,\u201d she says.\u201c Okay, okay,\u201d I say. One by one I read her the digits of the hotel\u2019s phone number and she slowly and carefully selects each one.She is holding the receiver.  I can hear the line is ringing and someone answers.\u201cHoney, Mama needs to talk on the phone.\u201d  I reach for the receiver.\u201cNo no no,\u201d she screams.  \u201cI wanna talk.  I wanna talk.\u201d  She bangs the handset against the phone\u2019s housing.At this, a uniformed man, short and squat, charges toward us, shouting, \u201cWoman, control your child. Control your child right now. WU-MAN, control your child or I will call the police.\u201dOne of the things that M.\u2019s psychologist Monica has told me is that when children with autism and related disabilities panic and tantrum that it is important to think about them as terrified mammals, and to give them space. Don\u2019t startle them. Stay close, but not too close. If you are too close, she says, it boosts their adrenaline production, and increases their panic.But it is much too late for safe spaces. She is now in a full panic, startled by the rush of this man shouting at me and at her. By now she is screaming and flailing. I pick her up to carry her away from the phone, away from the airport guard yelling at me, at her, at us. F. has gathered the luggage and moved toward the taxi stand. We have to leave. We have to leave now.She\u2019s screaming, \u201cLet me go let me go let me go\u201d\u2014writhing in my arms as though she is seized by some spirit. She screams, \u201cHelp me, help me, somebody, help me, help me, anybody, help me.\u201d I think it must look as though I am abducting her. She scratches at my face and draws blood as I navigate my way to the taxi stand. A bystander yells, \u201cHit her, just hit her.\u201d The taxi dispatcher shouts \u201cJust hit her.\u201dI can\u2019t hit her.  I don\u2019t hit her.A woman sitting on a bench says, \u201cLady, your kid got somethin\u2019 not right with her?\u201dIf it were today, and not 2002, which was early in our adventures with M., I would reach into my pocket and take a small card that says:What you are witnessing is a child with autism. This child is not a brat, does not need discipline, and we are not bad parents. Autism is a neurobiological disorder that makes children behave in ways that most people don't understand. People with autism are often confused and upset and react in ways that are socially inappropriate, such as a tantrum. Please be patient while we teach our child how to function appropriately in the community.Such a card does actually exist\u2014it is sold by Autism Link, a group that advocates for autistic individuals and their families. Of course offering this label in M.\u2019s case would not be technically accurate. Despite having many features of children in the spectrum, M. has never qualified for a full-fledged autism diagnosis. (See My Kid: Autie or Not.) But accurate or not, such a label can go a long way toward quelling the squall of the social catastrophe. The bystanders can walk away, perhaps they will be shaking their heads, but they can walk away, confident that there is a category to contain what they have just encountered.Much has been written about the violence of naming, as well as about the social construction of diagnostic categories, so I will not rehearse those arguments here. You know the names and the arguments: Levinas, Derrida, Delueze, Foucault and our own Avital Ronnell among them. Rather, I will propose that the diagnostic category, while it produces all sorts of violence, also attempts to frame and contain eruptions that, while not always in themselves violent, as this one appeared to be, are nonetheless deeply disturbing. Declaring that someone is autistic is a sort of social remedy . . . while it may be a disservice to the complexity of that person\u2019s experience and neurological particularities, it is also a palliative . . . a remedy for the discomfort of difference.In English the words that are most frequently deployed to contain such eruptions begin with the letter D. One is diseased-disordered-disabled-disturbed-demented-deranged-or, in the case of our daughter, developmentally-delayed. One is diagnosed, and, it is hoped that, through and across (dia=Greek for through and across) this knowledge, this gnosis, the person and/or their symptoms, can be contained and often constrained.But M.\u2019s symptoms have defied containment, and she has often refused to be constrainted. Instead of one diagnosis, she has eleven, each of which describes a features of her behavior and disposition. Indeed, her psychiatrist\u2014who is as fine a physician as any in the city\u2014was once pushed to offer a Dx of autism, and deflected it by calling her \u201cspectrumy.\u201d Not a technical term, to be sure, but certainly an excellent volley.Why would one want to deflect a diagnosis of autism, if it were accurate? The answer is simple. When this medical term is transposed into the world of education and social services, it has implications for how one will be seen and served. I am told by the social worker and advocate who has helped in our school search that in the New York City school system, a label of autistic assumes severe cognitive impairment, what we formerly have called retardation. Although this is inaccurate\u2014autistic individuals are often remarkably intelligent and insightful\u2014a diagnosis of autism could, even today, consign her to a warehouse rather than an education. On the other hand, I am told by autie activists parents, that should she require Social Security Disability because of the challenges that such a neurological disposition presents, she would be be ineligible for such assistance without the autism Dx. Accepting a label for a child, in these worlds, becomes an occasion not only for managing expectations, but also for limiting possibilities.And for those of us who are interested in fostering tolerance for neurodiversity\u2014involved in the emerging movement of activists advocating for social acceptance and reasonable accomodations for those with neurological differences\u2014there is the question of whether and when one should be \u201cout\u201d about being \u201caut.\u201d [See Kristina Chew's dazzling reflection on being \"aut.\"] To claim the name displaces the stigma\u2014as in other social justice movements\u2014for example, the LBGT movement, with its embrace of tranny or, at earlier moments, dyke. If enough people are out about being autie or aspie (the autistic community\u2019s self-naming for persons Dx\u2019d with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome), then there is the possibility that the practices of warehousing, exorcising, or sedating autistic children with neuroleptic medications will rapidly become obsolete.Autistic adults (for example, Temple Grandin and Donna Williams) who have written about their own perceptions, describe their thinking processes as lacking in the capacity to generalize. While they may have a full array of particular images in mind that are tagged with a single label, for example, with the label \u201cchair,\u201d for the autistic individual there is no generic chair, no general principle of \u201cchairness.\u201d It seems that for autistic individuals that there is no Platonic ideal, of \u201cchair,\u201d or of anything else. Grandin has a remarkable passage in her book Thinking in Pictures where she describes her process of designing a cattle processing plant as one of sorting through hundreds of thousands of images that she has in her memory and then putting the pieces together to create a new blueprint.For autistic thinkers, it seems, all the world, and everything in it, is particular. This would, in part, explain the autistic person\u2019s need for routine and order, and the autistic tendency to become easily overwhelmed by new sensory information. If, for example, every time you came into a room you encountered that room and everything within the room as perceptual information, rather than as phenomena subsumed into general categories, life would be extraordinarily overwhelming, however beautiful, terrifying, and dangerous.There is a violence in naming, and an even greater violence in generalizing, as those of us who are neurotypical are prone to do. Tonight, at some risk of appearing idiosyncratic and personal, I have tried to move from the particular to the general, to find the whole of the world in a single aspect, as the sociologist Georg Simmel would urge us to do. One can hope that if one is precise and particular enough, that one can move toward theory that is well-grounded enough to honor and encompass the particular, the peculiar, and the rare, in both neurology and elsewhere.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/national/09plane.html?hp&ex=1134190800&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;en=4a96070d0b4ffe44&ei=5094&partner=homepage", "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/national/09plane.html?hp&ex=1134190800&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;en=4a96070d0b4ffe44&ei=5094&partner=homepage", "http://www.autismlink.com/store/index.php/action/item/id/9/prevaction/category/previd/featured/prevstart//", "http://www.autismlink.com/", "http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/2005/12/aut-about-autism-159_03.html", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0679772898/ref=sib_vae_pg_7/002-9401026-0345662?%5Fencoding=UTF8&keywords=when%20I%20&p=S00M&twc=142&checkSum=c1Os2Nq41xi7uxDQ4pbhSeMEG9OSn3lgXNZHM9798TA%3D#reader-page", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415341728/ref=sib_vae_pg_89/002-9401026-0345662?%5Fencoding=UTF8&keywords=a%20gift%2C%20an%20undeserved&p=S02Q&twc=1&checkSum=u%2FMqELJ%2FozOVYkiVBefCxD4k5OowIr6NN12qeESQj48%3D#reader-page"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2005/12/terminal-disasters-and-social.html", "title": "\nTerminal Disasters and Social Catastrophes\n"},
{"date": "Friday, December 09, 2005", "body": "\nThis blog entry is posted in gratitude to Kristina Chew, whose dazzling account of her life with her son Charlie, informed by a keen knowledge of Classical Greece, has accelerated my own thinking about autism and authorship.Back in late September a friend who had just moved to Texas to take a tenure-track academic appointment came into to town to avoid the advance of Hurricane Rita. She and I were going out to get a coffee and talk about the vicissitudes of new academic jobs (hers) and academic job searches (mine).Sweet M. wanted to come with us to the coffee place, but as soon as we got there was restless and roaming, even disappearing for a few minutes, ducking into the yarn store next door, giving me that moment of panic\u2014where could she be, where has she gone\u2014that parents know only too well.This coffee shop idea was not going to work. The weather was fine, so we got our coffee to-go and headed to the grungy playground across the street from the apartment building where we live.Just before we rounded the gate into the playground, a woman with a large, brown dog walked by. My M. is terrified of dogs. Although we no longer need to cross the street when we encounter someone walking a dog, we still have to navigate to the other side of the sidewalk whenever possible.But today was different.  Today M. just said, \u201cLook Mama, brown dog.  Ugly brown dog,\u201d she remarked.\u201cYes, honey, it\u2019s a brown dog.\u201dI am thrilled of course, because not only is she having a bit of conversational interaction\u2014not typical for her\u2014but she\u2019s strung two adjectives together.The woman walking the dog glares up at me.  \u201cYou should teach that child some manners.\u201dI don\u2019t say anything, and we round the bend into the playground and sit down at the chess tables next to the chain link fence that separates the playground from the sidewalk and the dangers of the street beyond.The woman with the dog does not give up. She approaches us, but she is on the other side of the fence from us now since dogs are not permitted in the playground.\u201cYou know,\u201d she says, with a faintly British accent, \u201cyou should really teach that girl some manners.\u201d\u201cAnd, you,\u201d I say, \u201cShould grow up.\u201d\u201cGeez,\u201d my friend says, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you have to put up with.\u201dBut this is a small social disjunction\u2014it didn\u2019t rise to the level of social catastrophe, such as our airport terminal disaster. But since I have no official diagnosis of autism for M., I have been, until recently, reluctant to just say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if my child offended you. She has autism, a neurobiological condition that makes navigating the social world more challenging than for most people.\u201d I did not yet know about the informational cards prepared by Autism Link for just this purpose. I had not yet read Kristina Chew\u2019s dazzling blog, with her reflections about being out about being aut.Yesterday afternoon I was on my way to the post office and the probably British woman with the brown dog\u2014perhaps it is an ugly brown dog, I\u2019m not much on canine aesthetics\u2014was standing on the corner talking with someone.Buoyed by the response to my talk on Wednesday night, and by the solidarity of the autism mom blogs, I approached her and said, \u201cExcuse me, I just wanted to introduce myself, and apologize. A month or so ago my daughter offended you by calling your dog ugly, and I just wanted to apologize now. My daughter has autism, and I didn\u2019t want to just announce that to you and the world with her there, but I wanted you to know that I didn\u2019t think I handled it very well, and I wished I\u2019d been able to share more with you then.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d she said.  \u201cYour daughter didn\u2019t say ugly, she said, she said shitty.\u201d\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think she knows the word shitty. But whatever she said, I\u2019m sorry if she offended you.\u201dI actually don't know if M. knows the word shitty\u2014I'm inclined to doubt it since that's not one of our favorite household expletives. Back when she was in her echolalic stage we switched to cursing in French\u2014merde alors\u2014just to be on the safe side.  This is inconvenient if we're in Quebec, but it leaves me fairly confident that shitty is not in her vocabulary.\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI don't know either. Does your daughter play chess? Miriam here,\" she gestures to her friend, \"teaches chess.\u201d And soon we three are off and running\u2014talking about chess, and autism, and the chess team at M.\u2019s school. Suddenly woman with the brown dog stops, and apologizes. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m so sorry, I must have been in an grouchy mood that day. I just didn\u2019t know.\u201dAnd how could she, really, when even M\u2019s doctors don\u2019t really know . . . when even I don\u2019t know, five years into this process. We are still searching for a diagnosis, from the Greek dia (through) and gnosis (knowledge).  We need more knowledge.She went on to tell me about her chemotherapy, and how a friend\u2019s learning disabled child had grabbed at her scarf, pulled it away, and then laughed at the bald head that was revealed. She went on to tell me about her own son, with triple-bypass surgery. She went on to tell me her name.How little we know about each other. But at least she and I are on the same side of the fence now.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismlink.com/store/index.php/action/item/id/9/prevaction/category/previd/featured/prevstart//", "http://www.autismlink.com/", "http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/2005/12/aut-about-autism-159_03.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2005/12/what-do-we-know.html", "title": "\nWhat Do We Know?\n"},

I was, as might be expected, decked out in interview drag . . . suit, hose, pumps, the full hope-to-offend-no-one interview look. I looked considerably more turned out than Sweet M. is accustomed to seeing me.When I got home and took off my coat, she looked me up and down and said, \"Ooooo, hubba hubba!\" In a similar vein, about eight or nine months ago I was watching on the close-circuit TV at the speech language lab at NYU, where M. has speech-therapy twice a week.  The student clinician asked M. if she'd like her to read a story, and M. replied, with the full prosody of Austin Powers repartee:\"Oooo, yeah ba-by, that's what I'm talking about.\"The student clinician blushed at least two shades and I nearly fell off my chair laughing.For the next couple of months, any question that could be answered in the affirmative would, as likely as not, get the full \"Ooooo, yeah, shag me baby\" tone.  I started to tell her that just a \"yes\" would be a better answer, but the Autisn Power prosody continued.M. seems to be learning English the way I learn a foreign language.  She learns set phrases, complete with inflection, and then deploys them as appropriately as she can.  So it's almost as though she's a foreigner, prone to all the blunders and faux paux any tourist might make.  I'm not sure where she heard Austin Powers--maybe she saw a TV commercial--but this acoustic mimicry is one of her autism powers.The trouble, of course, from a parent's point of view, is how to avoid having an already seductive-looking child speak in terms that are dripping with sexual innuendo that she can't possibly yet understand, while, at the same time, encouraging her to communicate.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2005/12/austin-powers-autism-powers.html", "title": "\nAustin Powers, Autism Powers\n"},

This year Sweet M. has gotten the idea that if she isn't good that Santa will bring her a stocking full of coal.Although we are not proponents of the coal myth, we have encouraged the belief in Santa, patriarchal though it is . . . [patriarchal because all of Mom's hidden elfish work is attributed to a jolly old white guy from the North Pole.] We're assuming that she got the coal section of the story from a cartoon, because it's not a part of the story we emphasize.Anyway, the coal story has proven to be a remarkable behavior modifier. As soon as she got the idea into her head, she was going out of her way to be helpful and sweet. One night she even brought me a plate of cookies and milk and said, \"Here, I've gotta be good so that Santa will come.\"But the Santa-coal story is cutting both ways this year. The year is an unusually tight one for us.

Although we made the cut-off date for standard shipping, the gifts still aren't here and I'm waiting anxiously. Because this year, if her list to Santa doesn't make it, it will mean something: she'll think she was bad.And that's the problem with this myth, of course. It's a myth that says if you don't get what you wished for that you're bad. It's a myth that says if you're not well paid and always gainfully employed, you're bad.

We no longer have to stop at every payphone to dial pretend phone calls, or be sure she gets to swipe the credit card at the supermarket checkout counter, or make sure that no one else in an elevator pushes any of the number buttons. But, to my surprise, her band-aid fetish remains.\n\nFor a while I was using my reverse psychology approach\u2014going all out on band-aids, making sure we had nearly every cartoon character: Barbie and Care Bears, Scoopy-Doo and Dora, Strawberry Shortcake and Sponge Bob.\n\nEventually, I figured, she'd just get tired of band-aids.\n\nWrong.\n\nRetrospectively I can see the madness of this: why would she ever tire of them when they were so much fun? But, at the time, indulgence was my strategy.\n\nOn any given day we'd have at least 4 or 5 choices of band-aids around, and she'd have several on her fingers. They were sort of a disposable jewelry or body art. She seemed to like to fidget with them in class. At one point, I'd say we were spending about 20 dollars a month on band-aids. Sometimes, if we weren't careful, she'd leave one on for too long and the skin on her finger would get irritated, rubbed raw from the adhesive or the water that collected under the bandage.\n\nSince my reverse psychology wasn't working, we slowly weaned her from the many colored and many charactered collection of band-aids. We kept the band-aid boxes out of sight, and only allowed them for actual bonafide injuries.\n\nLast week M had a little paper cut. Her father had gotten a giant economy size box of regular beige-y camoflage \"sheer\" band-aids, and so we pulled it out and dressed the tiny cut. And left the band-aid box on the kitchen shelf.\n\nMistake.\n\nLast night after M's bath she was changing her own band-aid, and F noticed that she'd wrapped a band-aid around her finger so tightly that she was cutting off the circulation. Then I noticed that she was actually changing the band-aids on not one, but four fingers. I don't know how long she'd been wrapping these fingers\u2014probably for at least a week. I hadn't noticed the flesh-toned bandaids, designed as they are, to blend in, and her skin was irritated and peeling under the supposedly comforting and inconspicuous wraps.\n\nWe carefully pulled off the band-aids and dressed the distressed skin with an ointment, then wrapped up her little fingers in a gauzy wrap that would let the air get to her skin. Sort of an uber-bandage.\n\nWhat strikes me about Sweet M is how what she does isn't all that different than what any of us do: the way she'd chosen to comfort herself, to care for herself, had become an unexpected self-injurious behavior.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7557/1921/1600/dora.gif", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/01/ache_217.html", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/stealth-grief.html", "http://www.thismom.com/", "http://www.thismom.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/band-aid-fetish.html", "title": "\nThe Band-aid Fetish\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 03, 2006", "body": "\nThis morning as I put Sweet M on the school bus at 7:15 it was actually starting to be light outside, even through the torrential rain. It is satisfying to see how the days are lengthening on each end, but particularly so in the morning, when we're usually still so bleary-eyed.That's why it was especially bad news that M's bus driver Molly delivered: \"The route has been changed, and starting Monday M's pickup time will be 6:30.\"6:30? M's going to get on a bus at 6:30 in the morning to travel a distance of less than two and a half miles? She's going to sit on a bus for 90 minutes before she even starts her school day?Cars were lining up behind the bus as I tried to get more information from Molly:  Why the change?  Who do I call?  What's behind this?  The waiting cars behind the flashing lights of the bus were patient enough, but if I'd blocked the street much longer they'd have been driven to honking, so I reluctantly released Molly and the bus to continue on their way\u2014and I headed upstairs to call the OPT, the Office of Pupil Transportation.The first operator I spoke with was no help at all, and insisted that there had been no change to the route or schedule. In fact, she kept trying to convince me that M has been being picked up at 6:30 since September, which might have been amusing if I wasn't so upset about this.Right now we have finely tuned schedule. I get up at 6:30. Make M's breakfast and pack her lunch. Wake her up at 6:45, get her breakfast, teeth brushed, clothes on, and out the door, to be downstairs in time for the 7:10-7:20 pickup. I let her sleep to the absolute last minute because, like so many kids on or near the spectrum, she has a very difficult time getting to sleep at night. Always has. If she gets to sleep by 10:30\u2013which is fairly typical for her\u2014she's getting a little more than 8 hours of sleep on a good night, and that has been working for her.Now, if she's supposed to be on the bus on at 6:30, I'll be getting her up at 6. Forty-five minutes earlier, 45 minutes less of deep, restorative REM sleep.As most of you know, M has been doing pretty well at school this year. Her chronic meltdowns from last year have mostly stopped, and she's learning to read, to do double-column addition, and to play with her peers. Forty-five minutes less sleep could be a serious wrench in the works of this progress.But operator #1 continued to insist that there had been no change\u2014that M has been the first pickup on the route since September\u2014until I said, \"Okay, so let me just repeat what you're telling me because I'll probably have to call our education attorney to sort this out, and I want to make sure that I understand what you're saying.\"\"Oh,\" she said, \"Oh yes, I see now that she used to be 6th on the route, and she was just changed to the first pickup. Well, there's nothing I can do about that.\"\"Okay,\" I said, \"So at least we agree on the facts. Thanks, and have a great day.\"I hung up, and called back and got a different operator, who was infinitely more helpful. She told me what was up: the school day has been lengthened by 37 minutes for kids in the general education population who need remediation, so they've completely changed all the bus schedules. She told me that I'd have to call the CSE, the Committee on Special Education, and she gave me the name of the person to call and a phone number.The CSE doesn't open until 8:00, so I waited until then to call. At 8:20 I was still getting the recorded message saying that they open at 8. I have to admit that it seemed more than a little ironic that they expect little kids to get up at 6 a.m. to spend 90 minutes traveling 2.5 miles to school when they can't even get their own offices opened by eight.The number I was calling was a general number, so I figured I'd better get this CSE official's direct line. This is the moment where we pause and say thank god for the internet. Ten seconds later I had his direct number. A woman answered the phone, and transferred me to someone's voicemail\u2014but not to the voicemail of the CSE official I was calling. So I hung up, and called back, and miraculously got the head of the CSE for my district on the phone. He answered his own phone.While I was sorely tempted to launch into my screed about how they don't answer their main phone line and have some kind of nerve to have kids riding buses for 90 minutes, this was definitely not the time for that. This was the time for honey-voice.Honey-voice was born when I was sixteen years old and working at a movie theatre box office, answering the telephone and selling tickets. Long before the days of voicemail recorded schedules for movie times, teenagers like me answered the phone and told people what time the shows started and what the tickets cost. It sounds easy, but actually, it was fairly annoying as jobs go. The reality is that many people are cranky and irritable on the phone with people that they never expect to meet. In fact, they can be downright abusive. Enter honey-voice.Honey-voice has a sickeningly sweet, deliciously seductive cadence: \"Monica Twin Theatres, how can I help you?\" I'd murmur into the phone, as if offering any pleasure imaginable rather than tickets to the usually G or PG-rated films.It was remarkable. While my box office coworker continued to get nasty calls, my rude callers dropped to almost zero. I even had callers ring back, just to \"double check the show times and say hi.\" And this was in the days before phone sex.When people came to the box office to actually buy their tickets they had no idea that this honey-voiced theatre employee was me because when I was selling tickets I'd just use my regular voice.Honey-voice, or a rather less suggestive, more maternal version of her, served me well this morning. I explained the problem with the change and how we had worked so hard this year to get M's behavioral issues under control so that she wouldn't have to be placed in a more restrictive, more costly setting, and that we didn't want to throw a wrench in the works by having her be exhausted every day at school.The CSE official said he'd handle it right away\u2014walk it over to the desk of the person in charge of my child's case immediately. And, amazingly, within 15 minutes I had a return phone call.You would have to have had other experiences with the New York City Department of Education to know just how exceedingly unusual this is. I guess that in spite of my honey voice, they could tell that I am at heart a squeaky wheel, at least when it comes to getting Sweet M what she needs. Just like me, mindful this morning that the cars waiting behind the bus would eventually start honking, they decided to keep the wheels turning.The woman who called back even opened the phone call with a joke: \"I hear the Department of Education has offered to provide your child with a scenic tour of Manhattan every morning.\" She told me that I'd have to ask Sweet M's doctor to provide a note stating that for medical reasons she needs \"limited time travel of no more than 60 minutes.\" Then I'd have to fax this to the a particular person at the DOE, and ask for an expedited hearing.So it sounds as if even though I'll get the doctor's note today, that we'll be putting Sweet M on a bus at 6:30 am for at least a week or so, because an expedited decision could be a month or more from now. And I haven't even begun to figure out how we'll work out the afternoon piece of this: if she gets home at 4:30, how will she be able to make it to her 4:00 afterschool speech therapy two days a week? I am reminded of Kristina Chew, who had to move heaven and earth, and race the Pulaski Skyway, to cover 15 minutes in Charlie's afternoon.And then there is the problem of changing buses: if we make a fuss about all of this\u2014and get get limited time travel\u2014she could find herself scheduled on a different route, with a different bus driver and different bus matron. We've had this team for two years, and they know M really well, so we'd really prefer to stick with the same people.And, in all of this, I found myself wondering about something. Last week I went to a conference developed by Valerie Paradiz and the ASPIE School, and hosted by Marymount Manhattan College, on creating schools for aspie teens. One of the presenters talked about \"autistic families\"\u2014not as families made up completely of autism spectrum individuals, but families where one person's autism shaped the entire family's behavior, rendering the family rigid, inflexible, and unwilling to change routines.I wondered if I've become an autistic mom: Am I being rigid and inflexible, or is it outrageous to ask a kid to ride a bus for 90 minutes to travel a distance of 2.5 miles?Bus matron Launa, Sweet M, and, concealed behind the wheel, reliable driver Molly.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  parenting  \u2022  special education \u2022  education\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/01/191.html", "http://marymount.mmm.edu/cgi-bin/MySQLdb?MYSQL_VIEW=/news/view_event.txt&newsid=359", "http://www.valerieparadiz.com/", "http://www.aspieschool.org/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/wrenches-squeaky-wheels-and-autistic.html", "title": "\nWrenches, Squeaky Wheels, and Autistic Families\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 04, 2006", "body": "\nReading Kristina Chew's post about the excrement that is dished out to us and our kids in a culture that thinks of cognitive and neurological dysfunction as \"unclean,\" has helped me realize why I am so resolute\u2014perhaps even obsessive\u2014that M not be derailed from her spectacular progress this year.Last year, in the midst of Sweet M's most egregious meltdowns, some folks at her school suggested that we look at another school which they thought might be more appropriate. I had looked at many, many schools when M was in the year between nursery school and kindergarten. Given the ambiguity of her diagnoses, I had focused my attention on the LD schools rather than the schools for kids in the spectrum. It was difficult to know what sort of setting would work best for her, with her basically average intelligence overall, and her \"splinter skills\" in visual perception, her significantly delayed language development, and her temperament (which, in the relative calm of her nursery school setting, had been alright).M's SEIT (special education itinerant teacher) suggested that M could be okay in a general education New York City kindergarten.M's speech language pathologist said that a general ed setting would be a disaster.And the first psychiatrist with whom we met said that we ought to be looking at special ed schools, but she didn't specify exactly what sorts of special ed settings we should seek.So off I went, focused on \"the least restrictive settings.\" I looked at public schools in our neighborhood, one with a \"collaborative team teaching\" which is supposed to be the gem of the district. I looked at private, but state-approved (therefore funded), schools for kids with learning disabilities. And I looked at private but unfunded LD schools. It was a busy year. My search was exhaustive. I prepared more kindergarten applications for M than graduate school applications for myself in earlier years. Four times as many.Some friends without kids, and friends with NT kids, intimated that I was being your typical New York City over-the-top mom. And maybe I was. But I know that in order for my day to go well\u2014in order for me to be able to focus on my professional responsibilities\u2014I have to know that M's day is going okay, too. This wasn't martyr-mom behavior: taking care of my child is a critical part of taking care of myself.Eventually, through a long process of application and interviews, M was offered a seat at her current school, a state-funded school for kids with language-based learning disabilities and ADHD, but not specifically for kids in the spectrum. In fact, were M to be officially diagnosed in the spectrum, she'd be considered inappropriate for this particular school.Although last year was a tough one for her, we still thought (and think) that her current school offers her the best possibilities for a rich education and the fullest life opportunities. The teachers are loving and well-trained. The curriculum is flexible. The afterschool programs mirror what is available at general education schools. And the school is picture perfect\u2014the facilities are new and a visual delight, there is rooftop playground, a airy library and computer lab, an outdoor garden, a greenhouse for science projects.But when the meltdowns were unremitting, M's principal and school psychologist were strategizing with us about other options and met us to look at another program for kids with more challenging issues. Rather than a freestanding school building, the \"school\" was housed in parts of two floors of a mixed use (office and manufacturing) building. The \"library\" was several plastic crates of books. The classrooms were dark, and crowded despite the 6:1:1 ratio. The furniture was old, worn, and mismatched\u2013haphazard, disorienting, visually grating.And as we walked through the hallways, we came across a little boy sitting on the floor unattended. He looked up\u2014right into my husband's eyes\u2014and said, \"Help me, help me.\" I saw F shudder just before an aide came out to coax the little boy back into a class. I suspect that his own childhood experience of strict French military schooling might have been invoked.We briefly observed a class where a girl around M's age was being congratulated for counting to 4\u2014which is an incredible accomplishment for so many kids, especially for one's put in such unreinforcing settings, but which would not be challenging at all for Sweet M. Then we ran into an occupational therapist whom we knew from M's preschool services\u2014an aggressive and incompetent person who had once tackled M and thrown her to the floor because she wasn't willing to immediately get off an office chair that swiveled. And when I say immediately, I mean immediately. M had been enjoying the chair for all of a minute when she was wrestled to the ground. This person was the head OT for the school.Now I have to tell you the bad news.When I'd been initially looking at schools, this one had gotten glowing reports from parents. It is considered a fantastic program . . . a groundbreaking program . . . a gem of a spot for a kid on the spectrum. I hadn't seen it then, because, as I said, I'd been looking primarily at LD schools.We had a cordial meeting with the head of the school, a woman who was clearly a passionate advocate for autistic kids, and a wonderful and warm person\u2014working 24/7 to try to make a good program for these kids\u2014but offered the refuse of the city as her resources.When F and I left the school we walked about two blocks in complete silence. I think it would be fair to say that we were speechless. \"What do you think?\" I eventually asked. He started to speak, to almost stammer a reply. The multilingual man was struggling to find words. So I interrupted him. I don't remember my exact words, but I suspect that they probably started with a stock phrase about stepping over my dead body, or \"if-it-were-the-last-school-on-the-planet.\"We sent notes to everyone thanking them for their time, concern, and commitment. And we meant it: these are all concerned and committed educators.And we refused the placement. We have to refuse to accept the refuse, the leftovers, the hand-me-downs, and the outright excrement that's offered to us and our kids. But how do we do that, and still support the educators, like this devoted head of school, who find themselves struggling to create new settings for our kids? That's the really difficult work. How do we take the loads of manure that are thrown at us and use them to cultivate something lush and vibrant.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022  special education\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/02/taboo_subjects_.html", "http://www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD/MGArticle/RTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1137833815664&path=%21news&s=1045855934842"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/refuse.html", "title": "\nRefuse\n"},

While we were there, I mentioned the Dr. Phil show, with the brain imaging slides. I guess I was wondering if we ought to be thinking about some brain scans for Sweet M.Dr. B's response surprised me, and I'm guessing that it would also surprise Dr. Phil's viewers, so I'm going to share it with you.When I mentioned that the Dr. Phil show had announced itself as offering new treatment options when all the show seemed to offer were new diagnostic tools in the form of brain scans, Dr. B interrupted.\"But they're not even that,\" Dr. B said, \"They're not that new, and they're not even good diagnostic tools because we just don't have enough data yet to be able to use them diagnostically. What these places [he named two brain scan centers] are doing,\" he said, \"is charging people $7000-9000 for pictures of their brains or their kids' brains, for images that don't really tell you much of anything.\"Dr. B works at very prestigious medical research institute himself, so I'm inclined to trust his opinion about such matters.An article in Sunday's New York Times (2/5/06) suggests nearly the same degree of skepticism about brain scans\u2014not at the level of individual diagnosis, but at the level of contributing to our overall knowledge of brain function:   \"Any new method in neuroscience is powerful in terms of evolution of the field only insofar as it tells us that something we thought we knew is wrong,\" said Dr. J. Anthony Movshon, director of New York University's Center for Neural Science. So far, he said, brain imaging has not done that.    The technology, he said, though now central to brain science, \"is in one sense disappointing, in that so far it has told us nothing more than what a neurologist of the 19th century could have told you about brain functions and where they're localized.\"   And that may be where the hazard lies. The brain's increasingly popular image is a fascinating prop, a colorful as well as useful map, but so far it provides only the illusion of depth (emphasis added).  All of this suggests to me that the Dr. Phil segment on Asperger's was more of an hour-long infomercial for brain scan providers than a show exploring the challenges that families with Asperger's face.And given the high-costs associated with raising kids in the spectrum, the last thing we autism parents need is another costly test that has dubious diagnostic value.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  parenting  \u2022  Dr. Phil  \u2022  brain scans\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/weekinreview/05carey.html", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/02/the_wages_of_au.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/scanned-or-scammed.html", "title": "\nScanned, or Scammed?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 05, 2006", "body": "\nLast night M and I were hanging around engaged in our own version of parallel play: she was playing on my computer and I was lying around on the bed reading a book.We do a lot of parallel play in our household: there are times when I'm on my computer, and F is on his, and M is watching the television with the headphones on. The completely cyborg family, plugged into our various virtual worlds.But last night we stepped out of this in the most unexpected way, via the medium of the telephone.I noticed M had started playing with my home office phone, so I took the other phone and called her.Hello, is M home?No, she replied, feigning a British accent, M is out.Railly, Miss M's out?  I said, also affecting a British accent.  Where has she gone?She's out\u2014on a date\u2014she said, emphatically.A date?  Railly? And with whom has she gone on a date?With Brian.She's gone on a date with Brian?  Why that's splendid!  And wherrrre have they gone?They've gone to the park. They're sitting on a bench . . .  kissing.Oh my, they're kissing.  Well, that sounds very very . . . grown-up.Yes, they're kissing.  And Susan came over and she is the most be-u-ti-ful girl and Brian went with her.Oh my.  That sounds awful.  How did M feel about that?M was sad\u2014very sad.  But then Max came and she went with Max.Raillly?  She went off with Max.Oh yes . . . and they went to the carnival.Oh splendid.  And what did they do there?They went, she said,  in the tunnel of luvvvvv.  And on and on and on the narrative went. Soon M was back with Brian because Arnold came along and broke up Brian and Susan.I was reminded of an R-rated movie called Bob & Ted & Carol & Alice that I never saw because I was too young when it came out. If M's narrative continued much further we'd soon be getting into the restricted rating.Then, growing tired of storytelling, she shreiked:  April fools april fools april fools.  I tricked you.  Happy pranks day happy pranks day.Fiction.  The girl is writing fiction.  Steamy romance novels, if I have the genre correct. Unlike the memoir author so recently dragged through the mud, Miss M seems to have clear ideas about fiction and nonfiction.And this is the child with social deficits.So how did this flood gate of narrative open from the girl with the significant expressive language disorder.My guess is that it was because we weren't looking at each other . . . we were talking to each other on the phone, sitting in the same room, but looking in opposite directions. There was no nonverbal communication to understand, just the narrative, her own narrative of Brian & Max & M & Susan, and it was play.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022   James Frey\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064100/plotsummary", "http://www.selfhelpinc.com/blog/2006/01/james-fall-guy-frey.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/brian-max-m-susan.html", "title": "\nBrian & Max & M & Susan\n"},

I've been reviewing her report card in advance of the meeting, trying to decode the document and figure out what I should be pushing for and what I should be doing at home.These report cards aren't like any that I received in school . . . they're 25-30 pages long, with detailed reporting on various subskills. So, for example, a writing skill like \"Uses capitalization appropriately\" is noted as \"emerging,\" \"developing,\" or \"mastered.\" Behavioral issues, such as \"Listens and respects others' points of view\" are recorded as \"needs improvement,\" \"consistent progress,\" or \"excellent.\"But the funniest things in this report card is from the health class. One of the skills in that reports is \"Can discuss the importance of handwashing.\" It is one of two skills the section that she has been marked as \"mastered.\"Ask an OCD kid to discuss the importance of handwashing and you can almost cut right through the language disorder.At the conference on teaching Aspie kids that I went to two weeks back, Valerie Paradiz talked about building on Aspie kids' preoccupations as a way of extending learning: use what they love as point of departure for other learning. So a child who is preoccupied with maps becomes an expert on all kinds of geographical information, not just place names. And a girl who is hyperfocused on hamsters develops an experiment with her hamster family.This suggests something that I've always loved in the philosophy of Georg Simmel: that if you look at any particular thing closely enough, thoughtfully enough, patiently enough, that you can unfold the secrets of almost anything. That goes for our autie kids too. from Georg Simmel, The Philosophy of Money, page 55Now off to the parent-teacher conference.

{"date": "Sunday, February 12, 2006", "body": "\nSweet M's IEP for the current school year calls for her to be reading at a K.5 level by the end of the year\u2014the end of what would be second grade, if we were counting.As disappointing as this goal was to me\u2014chronic reader that I am\u2014it seemed appropriate enough since she wasn't reading at all last year. But as a person who makes my way through life reading, the idea that my daughter might not ever read at all, let alone read with pleasure, was weighing heavily on me.Although I know M has been doing better in reading since we recognized that this was a  reading emergency and started a sight word program at home, I was curious as to how her teachers thought she was doing and was looking forward to the parent-teacher conference.M, the teachers reported, is now reading at an early first grade level. She's done a years worth of reading instruction in four months.Her reading teacher described how she\u2014the reading teacher, not Sweet M\u2014started to cry in a recent reading lesson because M had gone from reading nothing at all to reading full paragraphs in a matter of days. Seeing something like this, she said, is the reason you do this sort of work.Although I will probably forever wonder why M spent two years struggling\u2014herself crying\u2014with the Wilson Fundamentals reading program before her teachers switched to a sight reading program combining the Swain and Merrill approaches, I am grateful that she is, at last, learning to read.M has taught us that she is completely capable of learning to read\u2014once we learned how to teach her.That got me thinking about how much more I learn about her every day. Every time I think I have a handle on her ASD-ADHD-OCD-ODD-PDD, NOS I learn something new.The latest thing I've learned is that M, though fairly well coordinated, has a visual problem with what her eye doctor calls \"crossing the midline.\" When she was having her eyes examined recently, the eye doctor asked her to track a light without moving her head. In the process the doctor and I could both see that at the point where the eyes need to track across the center point of the visual field, her eyes stop, ever so slightly, until she can refind the spot. Her right and her left brain don't communicate with each other with the ease that we NTs apparently have. And, of course, this can have implications for ease of reading because it will be difficult to keep your place if you lose your focus or tracking right at the center of your visual field.This anomaly would also explain a rather astonishing result on her recent neuropsychological tests. On a test of fine motor skills called the Purdue Pegboard test, Sweet M, to my complete surprise, scored in the lowest percentile (But what was really amazing was that when asked to perform the test using both hands at the same time, she scored in the 61st percentile, or slightly above normal. What to make of this? I'm not completely sure, since I didn't see the test protocol, but my guess is that when she had to cross the midline (use her right hand to perform a task on the left side of her visual field) that it was nearly impossible for her to do the task. But when she could use both hands, it was a breeze.All of this reminds me of a book that was popular back when I was in college: Julian Jaynes's The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Jaynes's book was controversial at the time, and isn't tremendously fashionable now, but essentially he argued that consciousness (we might add, NT-consciousness) developed when the mind adapted and started communicating more fluidly across the brains' hemispheres. Perhaps, this suggests to me, that at least some of M's problems with so-called \"theory of mind\" and language processing have to do with this bifurcation of her brain.But reading books\u2014my most recent stack is pictured above\u2014and spinning out theories is easy when compared with reading what is actually going on for our kids.Sweet M has been being tested and retested for more than five years now. How, I asked myself, and I asked her OT as nonconfrontationally as I knew how, could this \"crossing the midline\" problem have gone unnoticed\u2014not just by the OTs, but by the dozens of others who have examined her over the course of these years.Well, her OT said, probably because we couldn't get her to follow the directions, so we couldn't fully test her. In short, we couldn't read her because we couldn't reach her.We have to reach farther.  We have to read more carefully.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022   special education\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.julianjaynes.org/bicameralmind.php"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/reading-101.html", "title": "\nReading 101\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2006", "body": "\nIn a book called Weaving a Family: Untangling Race and Adoption, the sociologist Barbara Katz Rothman has written movingly about her experience of parenting an adopted daughter who is African American, when Rothman is herself ethnically Jewish and racially white.She describes the social interactions in which she and her daughter Victoria have to announce and \"perform\" their relationship of mother and daughter because our racial stereotypes prevent us from seeing them as such. The guy at the ice cream truck assumes that they aren't together. The teacher at the school doesn't initially think of them as related. Rothman takes pains to head off these painful misrecognitions at the pass. She writes: . . . I learned to stand behind her with my hand clearly on her shoulder when we rang the violin teacher's door. \"Hello, I'm Barbara and this is my daughter Victoria,\" I say before the teacher can so much as open her mouth. And put her foot in it. I call Victoria \"my daughter\" like a newlywed on a fifties sitcom said \"my husband.\" Often. With a big smile. Straight at you.The fact of Rothman and her daughter's relationship is not an obvious social fact: they have to work to cut across racial stereotyping to announce themselves as a family, to gain our recognition of their relationship.For those of us who are parenting kids on or near the autism spectrum, we often have exactly the opposite problem: we may look completely \"normal.\" So normal, in fact, that the only possible explanation for our kids' outbursts or behavioral episodes\u2014or whatever we decide to call these meltdown events\u2014is bad parenting and bratty behavior.While Rothman and Victoria have to \"perform family\" to be accepted as family, those of us parenting on or near the spectrum have to announce ourselves as not normal, as not-NT, in order to make ourselves and our children make sense in the world. Kristina Chew writes movingly of affixing the autism awareness magnet to the side of her car.  I've only recently started announcing M's neurological predisposition when faced with either social hiccups or social catastrophes.Being \"out about being aut,\" in Chew's memorable phrase, becomes one of the questions that faces autism parents. It is not only a practical question of what to say to judgemental strangers in the midst of a child's crises des nerfs or to what extent a particular diagnosis will limit, or enhance, a child's educational opportunities. It's also a political question of to what extent one wants to eliminate one's own, or one's child's, neurological distinctiveness\u2013to what extent one wants one's child to be able to cover or pass as NT.For some, the goal of early intervention is to render the autistic child indistinguishable from his or her peers. The \"triumphs over autism\" described by autism moms such as Catherine Maurice or Patricia Stacey have as their evidence of success the indistinguishability of their children from their neurotypical peers. Participation in a general education classroom becomes the sign of hard won \"victories\" over autism. For others, the goal of autism education is to create a context in which autistic individuals can thrive, and to render the wider world more accepting and nurturant of neurological diversity. These issues of visibility and invisibility influence how we picture or represent autism.Add to these issues the stereotype about kids in the spectrum: that they can be, and often are, unusually attractive. They are said to have an otherworldly beauty, to be nearly elfish in their enchanting loveliness. Autism expert Uta Frith writes: \"Those familiar with images of children who suffer with other serious developmental disorders know that these children look handicapped. In contrast, more often than not, the child with autism strikes the observer with a haunting and somehow otherworldly beauty.\"In the first pages of Clara Claiborne Park's remarkable 1967 memoir of her family's life with her autistic daughter (Elly in the memoir, but Jessy in life) she describes Jessy's changeling beauty. Kristina Chew writes of the cuteness factor that helps cut Charlie slack. Similarly I noticed early on that that M's public episodes, however disconcerting to those around her, were met with more grace when she was otherwise adorable.The first time I became aware of the autism-otherworldly beauty construct was when I was still hoping that we'd find be able to find a pro bono attorney or advocate to handle our case against the New York City Board of Education. When I spoke with a possible attorney on the phone she remarked, \"I can almost picture your daughter . . . She's probably extraordinarily beautiful, isn't she?\"At the time, she happened to be at her most beautiful . . . Disarmingly beautiful . . . I couldn't deny it.And, in fact, I think that her dazzling nursery school class picture may have contributed to some of the educational opportunities that she has enjoyed.Autism has its own beauty, its own aesthetic, but picturing autism isn't easy.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  parenting  \u2022  Rothman, Barbara Katz \u2022  Maurice, Catherine  \u2022  Stacey, Patricia  \u2022  Park, Clara Claiborne\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807028282/qid=1138147241/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9401026-0345662?n=507846&s=books&v=glance", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2005/12/taking_off_the_.html", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375508201/qid=1138154976/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-9401026-0345662?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449906647/qid=1138154577/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9401026-0345662?n=507846&s=books&v=glance", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009LIGJ2/qid=1138154641/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-9401026-0345662?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0631229019/qid=1138157590/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-9401026-0345662?n=507846&s=books&v=glance", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316690694/qid=1138147934/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-9401026-0345662?n=507846&s=books&v=glance", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/01/190.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/01/picturing-autism-part-1.html", "title": "\nPicturing Autism, Part 1\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, July 14, 2007", "body": "\nAfter the July 4th holiday Sweet M, Fathersvox and I went to visit a school that he and I had seen in the springtime and thought might work better for M than her current placement.I had told M that we were going to visit a school that needs a smart girl like her, and that if she liked it \u2014 and only if she liked it \u2014 we could think about her going there.  I told her that she'd have a meeting with a psychologist, and get to see the school (that was what I'd been told).We kept our family reunion rental car an extra day and drove the 1 and 15 minutes (it's that long a commute, even counter traffic) and arrived a few minutes early for our 10 a.m. appointment.   We checked in at the front desk, and then waited in the lobby.  We waited, and waited, and waited.  At about 10:30 I asked the reception person if the psychologist we were meeting had been detained.  \"She knows you're here,\" was the response.Okay.So we waited and waited and waited some more.At 11 a.m. the psychologist came out to greet us.  She spoke first to Sweet M, and insisted on shaking her hand.  Okay.Then she said hello to me and shook my hand.  Although we did meet in the spring, I hadn't expected her to remember me.She said nothing at all to Fathersvox, so I introduced him.Then she escorted us through the halls of the school.  I thought she was giving us a tour, but actually she was looking for a classroom where she was planning on having Sweet M sit in on class.  This had never been explained to me.  I had simply been told that I would need to drop M off for a couple of hours for her interview, and to be sure to bring a lunch for her.The psychologist couldn't find the classroom, so we wandered around up and down the stairs until she asked someone for the correct classroom.When she found the classroom, the psychologist urged Sweet M to go in and join the class.M folded her arms, and said in that most cartoon-like, sing-songy bratty voice a kid can muster, \"Oh NOOOOOOOO, I am NOT going into that classroom.\"\"But M,\" said the psychologist, \"we even have a desk for you with your name on it.\"The cartoon bubble over my head \u2014 you know, the one of what you're really thinking \u2014 would have read, \"Genius.  Pure genius.  Now you'll never get her in there.\"\"Oh NO,\" M repeated, \"I am not going in that classroom.  I am not going to your stinky school.  I have a school I like just fine and I am NOT transferring.\"While part of me is cringing, part of me is thinking, \"Whoa, M, how'd you know the word 'transferring' -- Great vocabulary!  Great usage!  Where'd you learn that word?\"At that point the teacher of the class that M had apparently been slated to sit in on came out and said, \"It's okay, you're just in time to go to gym with us.  You like gym, don't you?\"Now I am doing everything in my power not to burst out laughing.  Like gym?  What are you, nuts?  No, she doesn't like gym.It went downhill from there.But the coup de grace of this morning was the moment I was leaving the psychologist's office. She'd suggested that we speak privately.  Fathersvox and M were dispatched back to sit on the benches in the hallway.  In the private meeting, the psychologist told me, wisely, I thought, that we should work out a transition plan for M -- that sending her anywhere else when she's so attached to her school and would be so angry about leaving -- would be a mistake.Then she said, \"I am not shutting the door on her application, we have rolling admissions, but I think she needs to be prepared for a move.\"  As we are walking out of her office, she handed me a book to read, which left me with both hands full. She opened office door and said, \"Believe me, I am not shutting the door on her application\" and then she walked through the door ahead of me and let the actual door to her office, a heavy wooden door, slam closed against me.  It was such a movie scene that I'd wished there'd been a cinema verite documentarian there to catch the moment.  Hilarious.  If I wrote this up in a novel, I'd be accused of being heavy handed, but that's actually what happened.The trouble, of course, is that I am proud of Sweet M for speaking her mind.  I was annoyed that I had not been told in more detail what they had planned for her \"interview.\" And all I can say about the one-hour wait without even a perfunctory apology is I guess they are testing either the parents' frustration tolerance or their level of desperation about finding a suitable school.In the car on the way home we were all sort of quiet, processing what happened.  I broke the silence, \"Hey M, can I ask you a question?\"\"Maybe.\"\"Where'd ya learn the word 'transfer'?\"\"Oh, I saw it on a cartoon.\"\"Wow.  Good word.  Good vocabulary.\"Now if only I could find a school that wasn't like a cartoon.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/07/school-interview.html", "title": "\nSchool Interview\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 21, 2007", "body": "\nLast week I was taking a taxi to midtown Manhattan for a meeting.  The day wasn't too hot, so the taxi window was down. As we were passing the Old Navy store on Sixth Avenue I heard, and then saw, a woman yelling \u2014 Stop it, just stop it, stop it, stop CRYING.  She was tall, dressed casually in shorts and a t-shirt, and leaning over a little girl of about seven, who was sobbing uncontrollably.  There was a little boy standing nearby.My impulse was to yell at her that she should stop hollering at the little girl, but knowing how utterly unhelpful drive-by parenting can be, I did something else.  I got out of the cab and went over and ask her if I could help her.  She started sobbing herself, explaining that the girl had been crying for two bus rides and wouldn't stop crying, and that all the people were staring, so she had to get off the first bus, and then she did the same thing on the second bus and that she is just so so so tired of it.  I said I understood and explained that I had a daughter who cried and tantrumed a lot and asked if there was anything I could do to help.  No, no, that's okay, she just has to stop crying.  I said, I know, but she probably can't help it.  Then she said, gesturing to the little girl, and sobbing, she's just like me, she's just like I was.  I said, I understand, my daughter's is a lot like me too -- high strung . . . she used to cry so much that the police came.  She said, Oh yeah, that's happened to me too. She said So you only have one, and I said yes, and she said I have two.  I said I can see -- you have one who's easy going and one who's less easy going.   Yes, she said and laughed just a little.  She's been crying because I wouldn't buy her a toy a Kmart until later today, and now she hasn't stopped crying.  I said, I understand.  She can't help it.  It's as though her brain gets stuck.  She said Yes, but she has to stop. The little girl was still crying, and now she was acting like she had to use the rest room, saying I have to go, I have to go.  I said Do you want me to help you get her to the restroom in Old Navy?  No she has to stop crying before I take her in there because everyone is starring at us.  Oh I said, but she has to go to the bathroom.  Yes, she said, but she has to stop crying first. At that point, behind me, out of view, a police car had pulled up.  Two of New York's finest got out, a young woman and young man.  What's going on, the male beat cop asked me.  Not much, I said, her child is crying, she's frustrated, I'm trying to help her out. The woman sat down on the sidewalk, against the wall of the Old Navy storefront, and started sobbing.  I'm a good mom.  I don't hit my kids.  But she won't stop crying.  She's been crying for two hours because I won't buy her a toy.  Then she said, This always happens to me because I'm brown and my kids are white.  No one thinks I'm their mom.The woman cop said No no that's not what we were thinking.  But someone called because they were worried about your kids.The mother said to her daughter, Now you see what you did.  Now the police came.  Now that's scary, isn't it?The girl had stopped crying.  She looked terrified.The one officer said, Don't worry, it's okay.  It's a beautiful day.  Why don't you help your mom out and behave, okay?The little girl nodded. The officer said to the little girl, Now tell your mom you're sorry.Sorry mommy, she said.Now everybody's sorry, he said.  Time to get going and have a good day.  Be good. You can go, the cop said to me. I know, I said.  When I turned around I saw that a crowd had gathered to watch what was going on.  I headed out on to Sixth Avenue and hailed another cab, but when I got into the cab I burst into tears, realizing that I'd done no good, and had maybe even made things worse. And realizing that this poor woman is being mistaken as her own kid's nanny, and has grown accustomed to people scrutinizing her caregiving as though she had no parental authority at all.  Had I mistaken her for a nanny and not realized it?In the first nanosecond I'd looked at her and her children, in that moment of \"blink\" -- of instantaneous impressions that Malcolm Gladwell writes about -- I think I hadn't quite sorted out if she was a mother who was losing it or a nanny having a meltdown.  But the moment I spoke with her, I sensed she was their mother.  But maybe that's why she had been so eager to establish her biological link -- saying \"she's just like I was.\"  Oh, this was so much more complicated that one's average drive-by parenting moment.When the police arrived, somehow their authority had actually been a help.  The little girl was somehow able to pull herself back together, at least long enough to stop crying and say Sorry Mommy.  In that sense, this little girl wasn't at all like mine . . . I had been so wrong thinking she was just like my little one. Sweet M is not calmed by the presence of police.  On the contrary, for us the police have always only escalated difficult moments.This ever-so-light-skinned, possibly Latina mother, and her two fairer-skinned children have been with me all week.  I can't stop thinking about them and the ten minutes I spent with them -- my brain's almost as stuck as the little girl who hadn't gotten her toy at Kmart. When you see a mother losing it, what can you do?  How can you help?  Should one even try, or should one walk on, mind one's own business, and remember what they say about the pavement of the road to hell?  Should one abandon one's good intentions? I just don't know.  I don't know if I'd do that again.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/07/somewhere-another-mother-is-losing-it.html", "title": "\nSomewhere Another Mother is Losing It (And What Can You Do?)\n"},

A-duh for mom.But what is also interesting is that we are so unphysically active in our city life that Sweet M hasn't had a scab since she learned to talk.  No bike riding like Charlie, over at Autismland.  No ski lessons like Bud.  No skateboarding or roughhousing.  No scabs.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 04, 2007", "body": "\nFathersvox and I are shell shocked right now.  Well, let me speak for myself, as he and I haven't really spoken since we came home from seeing the psychologist who did Sweet M's ed-psych evaluation.  So let's start this whole thing all over again . . .I am shell shocked right now.  Earlier today we had the meeting with the psychologist who did Sweet M's evaluation. He was concerned about \"her disorganized thinking.\"  That her language and communication disorder cannot fully account for what he called her \"associative and psychotic-like thought processes.\"  \"Psychotic\" is not a word that a mom wants to hear in the same sentence as her child's name.  But since autism used to be considered \"childhood schizophrenia,\" I forged forward with my questions. I asked if he's saying she is psychotic.  No, just that her thinking is disorganized in the same ways that thinking is disorganized in psychotic people.  Does she have other symptoms of psychosis?  No, he doesn't think she's delusional, or hearing voices, or schizophrenic, but that she is in her own world, and therefore oblivious to the logic of the world around her.So I asked if he thought the autism Dx makes sense.  Afterall, we've been warming up to the autism Dx for nearly two years. No, he was emphatic, she's not autistic, he said.  And it certainly wouldn't make sense as an educational category for her.  She's not completely withdrawn, he said.  She's interested in what's going on around her.  She doesn't belong at the $72,000 school for ASD kids that you looked at, though they'd be happy to take your money, he said.  Fathersvox quipped, Good luck to them if they can find our $72,000 because we can't.At that point I was thinking, Geez, all the autistic kids I know and read about are interested in what's going on around them, and are engaged at some level with their families.  I'm thinking, what sort of autistic kids do you know that are completely withdrawn.  I don't know any autistic kids like that . . .  I understand the idea that having an autism Dx in New York City isn't great because then you get an autism educational classification and they send your kid to an awful 6:1:1 with no academics. But come on \u2014 she's not withdrawn enough to be autistic, but her thought processes are psychotic-like?  What's up with that?No, he says, her problem isn't autism.  It's more a psychiatric problem, he thinks. And then I am completely stupefied because I thought autism was a psychiatric diagnosis, as well as a neurobiological condition.People, I gotta tell ya, over here at Autism's Edges my heart is breaking.  Why can't anyone see the kid that is there?  Why can't anyone help us with this \u2014 help us with her?  How can this be so hard in the middle of the richest city in the richest country in the world, seeing the supposedly best of the best doctors?  How can this be like this?  And this guy is a good guy, a nice guy, a lovely person, and the head of child psychology at a huge and prestigious institution.  And I feel confident that he has no idea how upsetting his lack of clarity was and is. And frankly, I wouldn't even begin to know how to tell him.And then there is the matter of her academics: reading at a late first or early second grade level instead of a third grade level (her age group).  He says she's so underperforming academically that she won't get into one of the two schools we've identified as possible placements. I say that he probably can't have any idea how hard we have worked to get her reading to where it is now.  I say I feel as though we've been scaling Mount Everest since the reading emergency of fall 2005, and now someone tells us that we're not even at the base camp.  He nods sympathetically.He mentions her throat clearing behavior and says he thinks it's probably a tic, and that we should see a neurologist.  Of course, he says, then all you'd really have is another diagnosis, though some of the medications for tic-disorders might help with other things going on for her.So he's saying that her problem is psychiatric, but that she probably needs to see a neurologist (We tell him that we've seen two, but still, he thinks it would be good for us to see another neurologist, even though one of the two we've seen is, he agrees, really excellent.)And then, the piece de resistance.  He asks about the possibility that she has sleep apnea -- because she has this gaggy throat thing that happens waking and sleeping -- and I mention that she has enuresis, but that her attention and school work got so much better when we let her have her nighttime diaper back.  (For those of you who've been reading along here for a while, you'll remember this.)  I mention that lately she's been getting ready to give up her nighttime diaper \u2014 that she says she's almost ready.  And he says, well, she's nine years old, you should get rid of her diaper.  You've gotta push her. And I'm sitting here now, sitting here sort of shell shocked, and I'm just thinking \u2014 you don't get her, you don't get us, you don't get any of this.  Remind me not to tell you anything about my kid, because you totally don't get it.Then, of course, he also says, utterly contradictorily, and completely unpersuasively, you are doing exactly the right things for your daughter.  She has a great psychiatrist.  You're looking for a better school setting.  You're doing all the right things.  Except for those minor details that she's got psychotic thought structures, wets the bed because you're not pushing her enough on growing up, and has a gaggy throat clearing tic that you've not had treated.  Apart from that, you're doing a great job.  Really.  No kidding.  You folks are super.In the cab coming back from the big midtown institute we are completely silent.  Sweet M is with us, and we are all listening to the rain falling, the flip-flop of the windshield wipers, the splashing in the gutter. How low can water go? What happens to it on the way down?  What does it take with it on its descent? And despair \u2014 how do you spell despair?  I'm not sure but it begins with the same letter as diagnosis.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/04/how-do-you-spell-despair.html", "title": "\nHow Do You Spell Despair?\n"},

Sometimes you just want to wrap your wounds in warm woolens and nestle in, forgetting everything from the day before, forgetting the crazy world of diagnostic ambiguity, and the disturbing implications that your child is \"disturbed.\" You just want to wrap that old hole-y sweater around you and wear big socks and not think too much, since thinking (other people's and your own) is what got you into this jam in the first place.We will be taking MOM-NOS's advice and getting chocolate, the only known antidote to Dementor-induced dementia, but we couldn't do it today.  We would have had to go out for that, and we weren't going anywhere.  We were in full-scale retreat.  Called back the cavalry. Turned and ran like crazy back to our own little cave with the idea that we will never, ever, ever come back out again.  Or at least never-ever go back to any ed-psych evaluator.While I was curled up in a ball, I heard Sweet M in the other room as she yelled out to her father, \"Hey F___ (she calls him by his first name), What's eternity?\"\"Ternity?\" he asked.\"No, E-ternity,\" she said.\"Oh, eternity.  Hmmh.  What's eternity?  Well, it's uhmm.  Ask your mom, she has a PhD \u2014 she oughta know what's eternity.\"He might have just said English is her first language and not mine, but whatever.\"Ma-om, ma-om, what's eternity?\" she yells to me in the next room.And so I join her in the living room.  She's watching a cartoon, and someone must have said \"eternity.\"\"It's all the time that ever was and all the time that ever will be.  It's all the time always.\"\"Oh.  It's a lot of time.\"\"Yes, a lot of it, all of it, ever.\"Lately we've been hearing a lot of questions about time over here.  Sweet M is coming into time . . . coming into some idea of time . . . into her understanding of time.Apparently she is late on this, as on so many other things, and one wishes one had all the time in the world, so that there would be no problem of catching up . . .  Or being left behind.  One wishes one's child wasn't clocked against the averages of her age group.  One wishes one had eternities to help them get where they're going.That would the the sort of autism every day that would work for us: all the time we need to get her all the help she needs.  No developmental windows that are constantly threatening to close forever.  No emergencies on the cusp of puberty.   No developmental changes among the typically developing that leave her out in the cold.  No nine month school calendars that leave her with three months off and no therapy, no services, no assistance at all.  An autism eternity \u2014 That's the sort of autism every day I need.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://www2.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=19421951&postID=4627083530051983829"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/04/autism-eternity.html", "title": "\nAutism Eternity\n"},

{"date": "Friday, April 06, 2007", "body": "\nI watched Oprah's The Faces of Autism last night, after Fathersvox and Sweet M had gone to sleep.  No point in Sweet M seeing it.  And Fathersvox doesn't really keep up on the autism news . . . he's of the mind that Sweet M isn't on the spectrum, so at least one of us agreed with some of the things the doctor said on Wednesday.  (Don't get me wrong, he was as knocked out by the meeting as I was, but it wasn't the lack of a Dx that had him reeling.)\n\nThe thing that I just couldn't get over is how long it's taken Oprah to do this show.  I mean really.  Autism has been mainstream media fodder for at least four years now . . . cover of Time, cover of Newsweek, bestselling books from Daniel Tammet, Donna Williams, and Temple Grandin.  So where has the autism show been?  It's a bit puzzling.  But better late than never, I suppose.\n\nLike many others, I thought Oprah did an alright job on her two key points \u2014 awareness and compassion.  The tolerance was a little too much like \"putting up with\" \u2014 it didn't exactly overflow to acceptance.  And she did finesse that vaccine debate pretty well.  Impressive, but then she's Oprah!  That's her special genius . . . reconciling the irreconcilable.\n\nMostly I was dismayed that all the children who were featured seemed to have quite dramatic classic autism features . . . as others have commented, if this is a spectrum disorder, where was the range?  It's that sort of representation that has folks like the doctor we saw this week saying that Sweet M couldn't possibly be autistic because she's not withdrawn enough.  The MTV True Life episode two weeks back had a greater range of experiences \u2014 though on MTV they left out the girls.\n\nBut I loved the dad who said someone asked him if he would love his son more if his son could talk, and he said, No, I love him now. Same here. I couldn't love Sweet M anymore than I already do.  As it is my heart is cracking open every day at her tenacity, and determination, and whimsy, and joy.\n\nI have to say that I was weeping when the father was talking about the little house that his family gave up so they could move in with his mother and have more adults on hand to help.  It was such a sweet little modest home, and he couldn't even keep that if he wanted to make a place for his kid in the world.  That was a sad, sad moment. \n\nBut then Oprah had to turn it around, searching for the department of happy endings.  I'm always squeamish when we have to go to \"the it made me a better person\" angle.  The lemonade making gets so old.  We are all on the lookout for the Department of Silver Linings \u2014 how else does one get through the really hard things that happen in life \u2014 but the narrative predictability of the \"it made me a better person\" is just a little tired.  I know it's really popular.  And sometimes I even like it.  But somedays it feels off and old.  Is anyone else tired of the \"adversity forged me\" narrative?  Or am I just grouchy because I have yet to get the chocolate antidote to the Dementor attack as advised by MOM-NOS?\n\nTomorrow, chocolate . . .\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/04/post-oprah-spin.html", "http://www.blogger.com/Is%20anyone%20else%20tired%20of%20the%20%22adversity%20forged%20me%22%20narrative?"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/04/autism-ala-oprah.html", "title": "\nAutism ala Oprah\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 07, 2007", "body": "\nOne of the themes in narratives about autism is the autism migration theme: families moving, often halfway across the nation, in search of better services, better chances, for their children.  A subtheme is the theme of moving from town to town, in search of a better school district, or to live with relatives so there will be enough hands on deck to tend to the needs of our sometimes demanding kids.Kristina describes the bittersweet of moving from the midwest, where she and her husband Jim had tenure-track and tenured jobs*, to be closer to family and in an area with better autism services.   MOM-NOS describes the happy situation of buying a house with her in-laws so that there is a four-to-one ratio of adults to child.  A father on the Oprah show talked about giving up the little house he loved and moving in with his mother so that his son could have more care. And recently Jim and Kristina made a similar move because they needed to find a better school.When we sent Sweet M to a summer day camp a couple of years back, we learned that the town where the camp takes place has the highest precentage of special education and autism kids in the state.  No, there's no mercury in the water \u2014 there are good services in the public school district.  Home resale values in the town have skyrocketed, as that school district became widely known for its programs. (So communities, come on, autism services are good for your real estate values \u2014 get moving on better special education services, there's something in it for you.)At Barry Prizant's autism conference in the fall, many families talked about moving to towns in Massachusetts and Rhode Island where there were better services for their kids than in the towns and cities where they'd initially put down roots.  This autism migration isn't exactly on the scale of Steinbeck's dustbowl refugees or the Irish potato famine migrations or the Armenian diaspora, but all across the country families are on the move, looking for services for their kids.If you have a story about this that you'd like to share, would you post it here?  . . . Or email me at mothersvox at gmail dot com?  I would like to know more about autism migration.* Tenure, for those not familiar with academe's arcania, is a tradition akin to hazing wherein after six years of intensive work at teaching, publishing and community service, one can qualify for guaranteed lifetime employment.  It's one of the traditions of academe that offsets the relatively low salaries that professors receive (given their years of training and preparation).  Although tenure-track jobs are on the decline nationwide as universities use more part-time and contigent labor, for those who have it, it is often hardwon, and hard to give up.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/12/a_great_gift_55.html", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/all-in-family.html", "http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200704/20070405/slide_20070405_284_101.jhtml"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/04/autism-migrations.html", "title": "\nAutism Migrations\n"},

All on her own, without any prompting, she wrote the big bunny a little note, and then she sprayed it with perfume.

{"date": "Friday, June 08, 2007", "body": "\nAs those of you who've been reading Autism's Edges for a while are aware, I'm known to be mildly to moderately kvetchy.  Kvetching is Yiddish for complaining, hopefully in a sort of robust, community-building sort of way.  Kvetching is one thing that New Yorkers are famous for, along with the Mets, the Nathan's hot dog, and the Empire State Building.  But this week I wasn't kvetching much because this was one of those weeks when one relishes the centrality of the congested, noisy, expensive place that is New York City  \u2014 because this week the city could have been famous for autism culture, from Javits Center to the Empire State Building.First there was Book Expo America at the Javits Center: the annual conference of the book industry that brought Kim and Fran Peek, John Elder Robison, and Ralph James Savarese to the city.  I missed the Peeks' joint book signing of The Real Rainman, and I didn't succeed in snagging a copy of the galleys of John Elder Robison's forthcoming  Look Me in the Eye, but I did have the pleasure of meeting Ralph Savarese at his Book Expo signing and then heard him and his son D.J. read on Wednesday evening at Syracuse University's Lubin House on East 61st Street.Above: The Savarese family reads from Reasonable People and other texts.Meanwhile, on my own autism-mom front, I spent most of Wednesday doing half-hearted school applications for Sweet M, looking as we are for a more appropriate and supportive setting for her.  Then on Thursday there was the social studies fair at her school, where I got to see that she understands considerably more about immigration than we or her teachers give her credit for.Above: Sweet M's model of a turn-of-the-nineteenth-to-twentieth century Lower East Side tenement.On Thursday evening I heard more than a half a dozen autism parents and autistic individuals including autism-mom blogger Kim Stagliano who blogs about life with her three autistic daughters on Arianna Huffington's Post; Michele Pierce Burns and Michele Iallonardi who have been active with Autism Speaks; and fiction writer and autism mom Barbara Fischkin, who organized the reading, billed as the \u201cFirst Annual Writers on Autism.\u201d  Let's hope it's the first of many.  Autistic college student and writer Rachel Kaplan co-read from her work with her mother; John Robison read from his forthcoming memoir (Robison is also the sibling of  bestselling Running With Scissors author Augusten Burroughs); novelist Sheila Kohler read a fictionalized account of a grandmother's encounter with her daughter's denial of the deafness in her child; and Landon J. Napoleon read from his novel ZigZag.It's been a big week, and it hasn't felt like Autism's Edges, but rather like Autism Central.There is much to think about from each of these events .  .  .  and I'll be mulling things over for the next couple of days . . .  thinking through what I heard and saw and felt, writing more about Ralph Savarese's book, and mulling over the politics of autisms' communities.The thing that was clearest this week is that there isn't any one thing called autism at all, or even anything as simple and sequential as an autism spectrum announces itself to be.  There are so many autisms, and so many responses to life with autism.  Even as we ask the wider world to embrace neurological diversity, I hope we'll embrace the neurodiversity, the autisms, among us.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Real-Rain-Man-Kim-Peek/dp/0965116301/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181350669&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Look-Me-Eye-Life-Aspergers/dp/0307395987/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181351195&sr=1-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Reasonable-People-Adoption-Neurological-Difference/dp/1590511298/ref=sr_1_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181351480&sr=1-1", "http://http//www.grinnell.edu/academic/english/faculty/savarese/", "http://www.amazon.com/Reasonable-People-Adoption-Neurological-Difference/dp/1590511298/ref=sr_1_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181491820&sr=8-1", "http://kimstagliano.blogspot.com/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-stagliano/the-crappy-life-of-the-au_b_37742.html", "http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0703/25/lkl.01.html", "http://wordpress.com/tag/severe-autism/", "http://www.barbarafischkin.com/", "http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=19421951", "http://www.amazon.com/ZigZag-Novel-Landon-J-Napoleon/dp/B000H2M3EW/ref=sr_1_6/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181354777&sr=1-6"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/06/autisms-every-day-every-night.html", "title": "\nAutisms \u2014 Every Day, Every Night, Everywhere\n"},

I think the last time I made cake was 1876, so she's got that right!But seriously, how cute is this?It got me thinking about happiness, truth telling, and telling the whole truth, as some fellow autism mom travelers have been thinking about lately.  What do we share, how do we share it, and what does the very act of sharing our times of happiness, rage, grief, and dismay in a space like the autism blogosphere \u2014 where anyone with an internet connection can drop in and have a look \u2014 do to our lives?What do we post, what do we \"save as draft\" in perpetuity?This year I've been overwhelmed by your support when I cut loose and shared some of the difficult things going on at Sweet M's school and with the psychologist who evaluated her.  Moved.  Amazed.  And aided in the most fundamental ways.Yet I shuddered to think about any of the educators and psychologists involved coming across the blog. The representations, while always true, are also inevitably partial.  None of them are the wicked Dementors of a Harry Potter world, even if in our world they became so for a time.In a culture where a book and DVD like The Secret has become a #1 bestseller, paying attention to anything that's not going well is consider ill-advised, at best, and dangerous, at worst.  If one thinks that one's thoughts are the only thing that creates reality \u2014 that's what The Secret proposes \u2014 then sharing thoughts about events that aren't optimal becomes positively counterproductive.That worries me, because the times that I've shared my moments of misery with you have been some of the most productive for me and for our family \u2014 as you have all weighed in so eloquently.But on the other hand, if we're just out here in the blogosphere kvetching about the difficulties we face, well, that would make for some god-awful reading, wouldn't it?I've more than once stated my dismay about the narrative necessity of happy endings and lemons squeezed into a sweetened solution.How do we speak truth yet also inspire each other?  How do we make a space to write about our work as autism moms and dads where we aren't pulled to represent ourselves as happily-ever-after?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.selfhelpinc.com/blog/2007/03/dream-big-and-forget-secret.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/05/happy-mothers-on-mothers-day.html", "title": "\nHappy Mothers on Mother's Day\n"},

I probably would have been silent yesterday even if there hadn't been a blogosphere-wide day of silence and contemplation for the Virginia Tech victims. I've been away on a work trip \u2014 still am \u2014 and the time has itself been filled with silence.  Not the silence of trying to coax one's language-impaired child into speech, but the silence of working in solitude in a quiet place, where the only \"noise\" is the internal sound of the ideas that one is knocking about inside . . . In a Zen sort of way wouldn't qualify as silence at all, but compared to my usual life in the city, it's a miracle of quietude.I am ambivalent about being away from Sweet M and Fathersvox for work. It's necessary since I'm currently the primary wage earner for the Vox family and the contract I'm working on requires it.  But it's also a guilty pleasure.  I get a great deal done when I am away.  And my body relaxes in ways that it never does when I'm at home with them in the city, in our rather crowded apartment where, when the window are open and street noise is light, one can actually hear the sounds of the subway pulling into the station.But it's not just the street noise that makes the city noisy.  Somehow when I'm at home with M and her dad, I feel as though my attention is divided . . . that I have antennae that are out, searching for information about what they're up to, what they're thinking, what's next on the agenda. When I am home I feel as though I am constantly attending . . . Much as an attending (as in attending physician) is required to be attending, on call. When I'm away, my antennae are drawn in and I can rest.  I can think.  I can work with a focus \u2013 an intensity \u2013 that tends to elude me when I'm at home. I began to wonder how this might be for other autism parents.  Do you ever get a respite from your autism caregiving responsibilities?  Do you have this experience of quietude and shifted attention that is so refreshing and productive?

{"date": "Sunday, June 10, 2007", "body": "\nautismadoptionalternativesaltruismalacrityanalysis andall night . . .when I stayed up reading Ralph James Savarese's A-list account of his adoption of DJ, a six-year-old  boy abandoned by his birth parents because of his classic autism and their own emotional impairments, then cast adrift in the rough, unforgiving seas of the American foster care system.At four in the morning, just shy of three-quarters of the way through the 400-plus-page account, I reached a point that I sometimes encounter in reading \u2014 I wanted to finish, get to the end, know what would happen next, and I didn't want to finish, get to the end, and not be able to stay wrapped inside this astounding narrative where the boundaries between parenting, activism, and advocacy are fluid if not seamless, an account that certainly complicates some of the recent discussions of the role of parents in the autistic rights movement.First, for those who've not yet picked up their own copy of Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption (and I urge you to do so right now), a brief plot summary (spoiler alert: skip this paragraph and the next if you don't want to have the narrative trajectory derailed): Savarese and his wife Emily, an autism inclusion advocate and expert, met DJ through her work.  DJ had been abandoned by his birth father, and neglected and abused by his alcoholic birth mother.  He'd been sodomized and further abused in an overcrowded fostercare home where an adolescent boy, also a victim of sexual abuse, had tried to work through his own trauma by violating the then-speechless-thus-perfect-victim, DJ,The story retraces the Savareses' journey through the twisted legal terrain of fostercare adoption, and into the pioneering territory of full-inclusion for DJ in a public school, in the least-restrictive educational setting, the contested terrain of facilitated communication, and the heartwrenching reunions of DJ and his birth sister \u2014 the child who had taken care of her little brother when addiction had rendered their birth mother incapable of mother-work. Through uncompromising love and commitment to DJ and his personhood, the Savareses create a home that is safe enough for DJ to reveal \u2014 in his own typed messages \u2014 the magnitude of the abuse he'd suffered in fostercare.  I did skip ahead to read the last chapter, written by DJ himself, so I know that there is an amazing conclusion, if not a saccharin-laced smiley-faced happy ending.While there is much to love in this book and this family (pictured here), and much to discuss about it, what appeals so profoundly to me in the story is Savarese's unwillingness to throw out the baby with the bathwater, whether that baby is his son, a commitment to inclusion and the principle of the least restrictive setting, or the emancipatory possibilities of psychoanalysis \u2014 a theory that has a well-deserved bad reputation in the autism world, saddled as it has been with the legacy of mother-blaming encapsulated in Bettelheim's \"refrigerator mother\" hypothesis.I have been grappling with this very theoretical issue in my own more work, wondering what to do with psychoanalysis, and wondering what atypical language acquistion means for the development of structures like the unconscious and desire.  Like Savarese, I came of age intellectually in the cultural studies milieu of the late 1980s and 90s and was steeped in a heady brew of psychoanalytic theory, dialectical materialism, and feminism.Autism parenting has challenged each of these frameworks, but none more aggressively than psychoanalytic theory.  I'd backburnered my questions about this until recently, when my psychoanalytic reading group had asked me to present a paper about autism and psychoanalysis at a regional conference in February.  I had agreed, and then, still conflicted about the role of psychoanalysis in autism's misrepresentation, I was sick the weekend of the conference and wound up not going. Conflict can do that to any body.Savarese's narrative, healing for himself and his family, has been similarly healing for me. With an easier integration of my lived experience and theoretical models, I hope to be able to present that paper this summer at a national conference \u2014 thanks to Savarese and his intellectual and emotional integrity.And more on Reasonable People in the days to come . . . 100 or so enveloping pages to go.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/06/censorship.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Reasonable-People-Adoption-Neurological-Difference/dp/1590511298/ref=sr_1_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181489749&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/06/is-for.html", "title": "\nA is for  . . .\n"},

(Full disclosure: This blog does not receive any support for product endorsements.)We weren't exactly following the assignment -- we ought to have been making a model of the Pyramids, or of Victoria Falls or Mount Kilamanjaro -- but I knew the cookie dough wouldn't hold the shapes for those sorts of things well enough once it was baked, and I didn't have time to run out an buy a supply of Model Magic or get several hundred yellow Legos to build the pyramids.Making the cookie dough Africa wasn't the easiest thing for her . . . she really hated the smell of the cookie dough . . . and hasn't ever been wild about the texture of Playdoh, but we persevered, and the edible Africa was modeled and baked.We packed it carefully for the trip to school, and it was apparently on display in the hallway, when the inevitable happened.

{"date": "Thursday, March 29, 2007", "body": "\nThere are seasons created by the angle of the planet in relationship to its source of light and heat, and then there are seasons created by our calendars \u2014 by the activities and events that we organize around the cycles of the earth around the sun.  In the autism parenting blogosphere, it seems that we are in the season of testing, which will soon give way to the season of placement meetings.Many of us are shuffling out little ones off to the very best psychological professionals that our resources and geography allow, perhaps imagining that someone new and better could unravel some of the mysteries that are our beautiful children.  Others of us are, perhaps wiser in that we hold out no hope that tests will tell us much about our dear ones, rely on testing provided through our faltering system of public education.This time we were in the first group \u2014 we had sought out the services of the most highly recommended educational tester in the city. Either way, there is a day when the written report arrives, when we sit in front of it searching for signs:  what does this score mean for her future, what does this line suggest about where we should send her to school, what could we do for her that we aren't already doing?For me, that day was  Monday.  The report came as an email attachment. Because we'd gone to such a sought-after evaluator, it had taken more than two months to get the write up.  But when it was finally done, it came instantaneously.Perhaps it was worth the wait.  For the first time ever we have a report that seems to be written in English \u2014 I can't even find a single phrase of arch psychobabble therein.  And, as the doctor told me back on the day of the testing, Sweet M's IQ jumped by ten full points.  She is described as cooperative and compliant (rather than oppositional and defiant, as in the prior report).  And next week we'll meet with him to ask him about his assessment and recommendations.All of this would seem to be good news, wouldn't it?  But still I am left this week longing for some image of the child in the fourteen single-spaced pages, some signs of Sweet M herself.  There is one place, midway through, where the report mentions her idiosyncratic speech:M's thought process was difficult to evaluate more precisely due to her reported expressive language difficulties.  However, there are some concerns regarding her functioning in this arena as her verbalizations did appear to be idiosyncratic and unusual.  As mentioned earlier, she would often begin responses with \u201cI vote,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m voting,\u201d or \u201cMy choice is.\u201d  Ah yes.  There she is. That's her, that's that dear girl. Back in January she would start her sentences that way.  Now she has moved along to another phrase . . . if you ask her a question she'll say \"According to my calculations . . . \" and scratch her head as though she's deep in thought.  My guess is that all of this is strategy to stall, so that she has a few extra seconds to try to formulate the expressive language she needs to reply to the question at hand.What was most interesting in his findings was the lack of verbal working memory that little M possesses.  I found this fascinating, and so set out to do my own testing.We were lying around on the bed, and I said:  \"M, let's do an experiment \u2014 a listening experiment.\"\"Okay!\" she replied brightly.\"Listen carefully to what I say.\"\"Okay!\"\"I'm going to say three things, then ask you a question.\"\"Okay!\"\"Ready?\"\"Okay!\"I spoke slowly and paused briefly between each sentence.\"The house was red.  The car was green.  The dog was brown.  What color was the house?\"\"Can you say it again?\"\"The house was red.  The car was green.  The dog was brown.  What color was the house?\"\"Green?\"\"Hmmh.  Nope.  Sounds like it was hard to remember.  Let's try something else.\"\"Okay!\"\"I'm going to say three sentences, and I want you to repeat them after me, then I'm going to ask you a question, okay?\"\"Uh-huh.\"\"The house was blue.\"\"The house was blue,\" she repeated after me.\"The car was green.\"\"The car was green.\"\"The flower was pink.\"\"The flower was pink.\"\"What color was the house?\"\"The house was blue!\"  she exclaimed.So she can't remember the language unless she repeats it \u2014 one of those crucial functions of echolalia.I try to imagine what my life would feel like if every time a new set of words came into my ears the content of the second to last set disappeared.  How confusing, how scary, how anxiety-provoking would that be?The seasons come around each year, and as a species we've had millennia to grow accustomed to them, to learn about them, to see the repetition in them, to take it in.  Each year some of the same things, over and over and over again.  Repetition.  And with this most recent swing around the sun, with the season of reporting, more light than heat.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/03/season-of-testing.html", "title": "\nThe Season of Testing\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2007", "body": "\nWhen I was traveling last month, I came across this advertisement in the terminal at JFK and I snapped this picture because, well, lately I've been thinking a lot about intelligence and stupidity.   About how utterly ironic it is that people race out to buy Baby Einstein products to help foster their kids' intelligence, but if they actually had a late-talking kid like Einstein they'd think him in need of early intervention and special education.My rumination about intelligence and stupidity started a couple of months back when our education attorney told us that Sweet M's completely average IQ is too low for her to be considered for a state-funded special education school that has been recommended to us. The school, we're told by several reliable sources, is only interested in kids on the spectrum if their full-scale IQs are topping 125.  Seems you've gotta have a near-genius level IQ to qualify for special education resources these days.And then there was the fact that I had to get Sweet M retested since her last neuro-psychiatric evaluation was deemed \"worthless\" by our education attorney. So we took little M off to a well-regarded child psychologist and, low and behold, her non-verbal IQ jumped by nearly ten points from her last test, done only 18 months ago.  How could this supposedly stable score be so remarkably labile?  I guess Heisenberg's Principle regarding the impact of the observer on the testing outcome must have been at play.As a former smarty chauvinist (someone for whom standardized tests were easy and for whom the tedium of traditional schooling was almost bearable) I grew up in a family where the worst insults were those regarding one's intelligence.  The most stinging perjoratives were retard (accent on first syllable as in RE-tard) stupid, idiotic, cretin, moronic, imbecilic, and more rarely, ignoramus, which was reserved for the most notable moments of supposed idiocy.  For fun and sport we played around with euphemisms for intellectual impairment.  You know the sort of sayings I mean . . .Not the sharpest knife in the drawer.Not the brightest light in the chandelier.A couple of beers short of a six-pack.The lights are on, but nobody's home.Apparently others shared my family of origin's pasttime, as there are several sites online that chronicle figures of speech for intellectual impairment and difference.  There's a whole list of them on one minister's site.  So much for being charitable.On the other hand, we aren't exactly charitable to anyone who shows up at the other end of the IQ scale.  On that side we've got \"egghead,\" \"bookworm,\" and, for the gals among us, \"bluestocking.\" These have fallen out of use, but been replaced with nerd, geek, dweeb.But the terms for those deemed unintelligent still outnumber those who are supposedly gifted by many columns in any thesaurus. Like the Eskimos, with their dozens of words for \"snow,\" we modern Westerners seem to have some sort of preoccupation with stupidity.  Perhaps our Enlightenment inheritance of believing in reason \u2014 the idea that being reasonable and thinking intelligently was a way to trump God \u2014 has gotten us so preoccupied with intelligence.What is this thing called \"intelligence\" and its inverse, stupidity?  All sorts of people have written about this, some parsing intelligence into types (for example, Howard Gardner with his theories of multiple intelligence), but one book I've been reading this month helps explain so much about intelligence and why we all seem to be so stupid about it.That book is Typecasting: On the Arts and Sciences of Human Inequality.  As the book's subtitle suggests, its authors Elizabeth Ewen and Stuart Ewen look at various ways in which pseudoscience and art have been used to justify social inequality.  Physiognomy and phrenology, IQ tests and their use by eugenicists all fall under the thoughtful scrutiny of Ewen & Ewen.For me personally, and apropos of our lives over here at Autism's Edges, Typecasting helps me understand how Sweet M's current school could have been so \"wrong\" in their decision (their assessment now) to have admitted her in the first place.Four years ago when she met with the admission's counselor, her IQ testing was average, low-average, just as it is now, but she had the physiognomy that we in the West associate with intelligence: symmetrical features, high cheekbones, a strong highbrow and chin, clear blue eyes.  How could someone look like she looks and not be bright?  She looks bright.  As Ewen & Ewen uncover, there is a long and sordid history to these judgments based on first impressions.Over the next weeks I'm going to be thinking more about intelligence and stupidity.  Why do we associate intelligence with speed and light?   What are the implications of assuming that speed and intelligence are equivalent, or the intelligence might be measured  much as candle-watts are?

First she escorted me to the sea lions in the middle of the zoo, then to the chilly and refreshing penguin and puffin house to the north, then around a path to watch the polar bears snoozing and swimming, arriving to the rainforest exhibit complete with assorted tamarins, snakes of all sorts, and one awful looking tarantula, and finally off to the petting zoo to feed the sheep and goats and cows.  The penguin and puffin grotto is dark and cool.We made several visits to cool off.What was especially nice is that I'd never been there. Never visited the little zoo made famous by the animated feature Madagascar. Never ventured through the gates. That probably seems odd for the parent of an eight-year-old who has been living in the city since her birth. I'm not much of a zoo fan.Some people loathe zoos because they're unkind \u2014 inhumane \u2014 to the animals they house. And while I can see their point, I'm not just not that empathetic with our fellow creatures. I just find zoos mostly hot, and stinky, and too big, and overwhelming, and well \u2014 dysregulating. Sweet M didn't want to get sheep slobber on her hand,  so she used the zoo map as a feed spoon.But not so with the sweet little Central Park Zoo on a school day mid-afternoon. The scale is delicious \u2014 you can see the whole zoo in an hour or two, never worrying about what you might have missed. You can linger in the penguin grotto confident that you're not missing out on some monkey exhibit or elephant show. It's well edited. And I was, fortunately, in the company of an excellent zoo tour guide.And to top it off, it's sprinkled with quotations from poets embedded throughout the walks.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 12, 2006", "body": "\nOne of the characteristics attributed to people on the spectrum is so-called mindblindness \u2014 the incapacity to imagine the thoughts, motivations, and state of mind of someone other than oneself. I think it's a terrible mistake to attribute this characteristic to people on the spectrum when it's so readily available to all of us.Not long ago I had a most challenging experience of mindblindness myself \u2014 blinded as I was by the outrage that I felt at the way Sweet M's school had proceeded in their attempts to persuade us that they were not an appropriate setting for her.Some of these ways of persuading us included taking away the behavior plan that had worked brilliantly for her last year, switching her back to a reading program that had not worked in the least, and sending her home on Halloween when she'd done nothing more than express no interest in joining in the spooky activities.  This decision meant that I lost a full day of worktime when I was on a critical deadline for a consulting project.  Each and every one of these moves on their part escalated my rage and indignation until I was nearly blinded by rage at what I experienced as their harassment of her, and of us.So angry was I that I was not only blind, but also fairly immobilized, as I oscillated between rage and despair \u2014 an emotional back and forth that is almost guaranteed to produce exhaustion.  In the midst of this, I saw my doctor, who curiously enough recommended that I take a medication recently approved by the FDA for use with autistic children to help with meltdowns and self-injurious behaviors.She didn't think it prudent for me to take this medication longterm, as I'm not typically enraged.  She thought it might be useful as a way of more or less breaking the fever of my rage, allowing me to retain my sense of righteous indignation while returning to me the focus, energy, and presence of mind to proceed creatively and constructively on Sweet M's behalf.  As I'm always willing to give something new a try \u2014 especially when I'm at the end of my proverbial rope \u2014 I took the prescription and off I went.And I have to report that it was amazing.  With twenty-four hours I was clear and focused \u2014 still cognizant that what has happened is terribly wrong \u2014 but able to think about what might be helpful to move us forward.  I was able to understand the school's point of view, even if I adamantly objected to it and to their actions.  I was relieved of my child-avenging rage \u2014 which had been blinding \u2014 and restored to some sense of equanimity.  Chemically-enduced equanimty, but equanimity nonetheless.My Buddha-in-a-bottle adventure was short-lived, as side effects from the medication became worrisome.  But the good news is that my doctor was right: in my case it was as though a fever had left me temporarily impaired, and a short course of medication restored my sense of perspective.During that same week, Sweet M made this drawing: the earth from outer space, with a satellite inbetween.No lack of perspective from her \u2014 no mindblindness here.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-blindness"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/12/mind-blind.html", "title": "\nMind Blind\n"},

And they'd each written and published a book modeled on Laura Nemeroff's If You Give a Pig a Party.  Sweet M's was called If You Give a Dog a Donut.    It went like this: . . . . If you give a dog a donut . . . he will want a glass of milk.     If you give a dog some milk . . .Nearly all the parents came to class, eager to see their little one's accomplishments.  (Sweet M's father had to stay home as he has been suffering from a dastardly case of shingles, which makes him contagious with the chicken pox virus, and in some serious, serious pain.)  So it was just me, the mom, on site yesterday.One by one each and every child went up to the front of the class, perched themselves on the table with their teacher, and read their stories aloud.Each and every one, except, of course, Sweet M, who sat in a chair in the corner twisting a paper clip into a hundred permutations, and fiddling with a stack of Legos.I asked her if she wanted to be the official publishing party photographer and use my camera \u2014 usually this appeals, and offers her an option to participate and yet remain at the edges of the social milieu \u2014 but she demurred, so focused was she on the possibilities for this particular paperclip.On one hand, I don't really care that she didn't want to be center stage.  At a birthday party we went to this weekend, I was literally breaking up fights among a whole posse of girls because all the girls in her class wanted to hold her hand.  So she's not lacking for attention, friends, or social interaction \u2014 something that was not the case last year.It's been an amazing year.  She learned to read: from no reading to a first-grade level of comprehension after just 4 months of Swain Reading.  She had multiple playdates and is beloved in her little posse.  And she's doing double-digit addition and subtraction with regrouping.And on the other hand, the sight of her perseverating on a paper clip can still break my heart.  She'd written a great book, made incredible strides, and she didn't get to stand up and take a bow for all of her amazing work.I hope she knows how amazing she is.   And how incredibly she did this year, all year long, not just on the last day.And to remember for next year:  If you give this girl a moment in the spot light, chances are she'll want a quiet corner and a paper clip.(With apologies to Laura Nemeroff.)Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022 speech-language disorders  \u2022  special education parenting   \u2022   children's art\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060283262/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060283262/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/104-4157793-5539929?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/06/if-you-give-girl-year-end-party.html", "title": "\nIf You Give a Girl a Year End Party . . .\n"},

But this morning, reading the New York Times article about new parental attitudes and experiences raising transgender children, reminded me so much of our experiences with Sweet M:Ms. B., 41, a lawyer, accepted the way her son defined himself after she and her husband consulted with a psychologist and observed his newfound comfort with his choice. But she feels the precarious nature of the day-to-day reality. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convey the relentlessness of it, she said, \u201cevery social encounter, every time you go out to eat, every day feeling like a balance between your kid\u2019s self-esteem and protecting him from the hostile outside world.\u201d (emphasis added)How many of us raising children on or near the spectrum feel the relentlessness of the potential hostility of the social world and the demands on us to mitigate that hostility?Reading through the autism parenting blogs one finds that hostility and fear of our children can be found almost anywhere: at schools when educators give up on our children, in supermarkets when an episode of dysregulation prompts well-meaning or terrified others to call for the police, when a child's frustration at the changing space of the city, and the shortage of taxi's, overflows and he or she is thought of as a brat with bad parents.How do we insulate our children from the world's misunderstanding and hostility?  How do we provide them with tools for self-advocacy?  And how can we educate others so that misunderstanding and hostility gives way to knowledge and acceptance?

Move over Maurice!One of the many things I learned at Dr. Karen Erickson's conference presentation earlier this month is that learning to read is imperative for our autie kids because once they're able to read, their vocabularies can expand exponentially.  What isn't readily accessible to them through an auditory channel can be accessible through vision.My experimental sample of one seems to prove Dr. Erickson correct. We've been seeing a linguistic explosion around here. It really has seemed super-sonic. And many requests for read-a-loud.  Will you read me Ms. Frizzle?  Will you read me Sponge Bob's A Very Krusty Crab Christmas?For me this is a dream come true, as one of my fantasies of motherhood \u2014 put aside in the face of the realities of the particular child we conceived \u2014 was of reading aloud to my little one.  Since I had a mom who wasn't a read-aloud type, one of my compensatory fantasies was of reading bedtime stories to my own little pumpkin.   Breastfeeding and reading aloud \u2014 two kinds of succor \u2014 were central in my pre-motherhood fantasies of maternal life.It didn't seem it was going to turn out that way.  As all the mothers in my mother's support group were contentedly breastfeeding and reading aloud from the Maisy books, I was bottlefeeding Sweet M with Alimentum, the only thing that she wouldn't projectile vomit, and turning on Teletubbies because she'd literally grab any book from my hand and throw it across the room.What a difference eight years makes.One of the things  the parents of so-called special needs children are told is that \"you'll dream new dreams.\"   While I understand that this is meant to be encouraging, I've always found that idea cloying and annoying, as I've commented elsewhere.Happily for me, in this case new dreams weren't required, just a dramatically expanded timetable, or the patience to wait for Sweet M's own burst of supersonic speed.As Sweet M put it:Little Bear was little.Now Little Bear is big.And I'd have to add that Mama Bear is thrilled.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Maurice-Sendaks-Little-Bear-Festival/dp/0694017019/sr=8-1/qid=1166368307/ref=sr_1_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/clds/about.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Where-Maisy-Lift-Flap-Book/dp/0763607525/sr=1-2/qid=1166368462/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/12/little-bear-mama-bear.html", "title": "\nLittle Bear, Mama Bear\n"},

We were reluctant because the school is in another borough of New York City, quite far from where we live \u2014 over the river from us \u2014 and we weren't feeling particularly sanguine about having her so far away, especially in case of any other extraordinary events such as those we experienced in September 2001.But once you've heard person after person sing the praises of a school over and over and over again, you start to put aside your hesitations, you start to be persuaded.   And it's a state-approved, state-funded school, and so would not require us to sue the Department of Education for private school tuition.So we were eager to talk with the attorney about this particular school.  After a quick look at Sweet M's neuropsych report, the attorney announced: This is what'll keep her out of X school.  This full scale IQ is too low.Too low? I asked.  Sweet M has a low average full scale IQ, with fairly typical splits associated with kids with language impairments.  We'd always been told that IQ scores like these have to be interpreted with caution because there is too much variation between the performance IQ and the verbal IQ.Yes, much too low, the attorney replied.  X school is looking for ASD kids with fullscale IQs of 125 or more.So now in order to qualify for a special education setting one has to have an IQ that is two standard deviations above the mean?  If these are the kids who go to the state-funded special education schools, you've gotta wonder what it takes to qualify as gifted and talented.I have the sinking feeling that we have entered the looking glass world where everything is the opposite of what it's supposed to be.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/12/looking-glass-world.html", "title": "\nLooking Glass World\n"},

The first sign of progress was that she was letting the daughter of one of the wealthiest families at the school steal her chair and she wasn't complaining about it.  As it was described to me, this little girl was stealing Sweet M's seat just to see what M would do.  No one was stopping this little girl from engaging in this provocative behavior.  But now Sweet M was tolerating this.  I had to wonder about the class(room) politics of this . . . teaching my child to be comfortable when members of a more privileged social class appropriate her place and attempt to provoke her . . . but what was more interesting to me was the next example of Sweet M's progress . . .The psychologist went on to tell me that Sweet M is making amazing drawings . . . of female figures.\"First,\" the psychologist told me, \"She outlines the figure, then she colors it in.  And she's made many of them.\"\"I know the motif,\" I said.  \"It's sort of a primitivist image of a woman, isn't it?  Big hips and bright colors.  Sort of a combo of my body type and her babysitter's.\"\"Oh, no,\" she said, \"It's not primitive at all . . .\".\"Oh,\" I said, \"I didn't mean it was primitive.  I meant it was primitivist . . . like the art movement.\"\"Oh, okay,\"  she said.  \"But what is so interesting is that she makes the outline first, and then colors it in.  It's just exactly like her . . . she really needs that structure.\"Hmmh, I thought.  So now the fact that she outlines her figures is a sign of atypical psychology or neurology.              And now that 1 in 150 children in the U.S. are said to be diagnosed with ASD, one of the things that is going to hardest to navigate is what is a symptom and what just is . . . what just is an amazing and delightful and endearing characteristic of one's child, not a sign of disease or disability or difference.  Once a child is labelled PDD-NOS, or ASD, or one of the tags from the DSM pull down list of possibilities, everything about them is up for discussion, as some sign of pathology, where what's bad is bad and what's good is bad, too.While it may be to our culture's credit that we are recognizing the existence of neurological differences in children, it's also a problem when everything becomes a sign of pathology.Take these drawings, for example.Sweet M has been making house pictures ever since her difficult re-entry to her school in the fall.  Wanting to be home? Wanting to feel at home?  Wanting to find one's way home?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps a beautiful motif of a house, in the sunshine, rendered in various ways on various days.Oh, but there are so many of them.  I have more than a dozen.  So perhaps it's repetitive, obssessive.  Who knows?  But what I do know, for sure, is that she is trying to find a way to feel at home in the world.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 27, 2006", "body": "\nA psychologist who is very experienced with autism and Asperger's observed Sweet M at her school last week, then called me to report on what she'd seen.She told me that Sweet M sat on the edge of the playground and didn't want to join in with the other kids.  That most of the time she wasn't even watching them. And that unlike other kids who have some troubles with peer engagement, she also didn't reach out to any adults either.She told me that this was sad.  She didn't tell me that Sweet M was sad, but that she herself was sad watching my daughter sitting on the edge of the playground.She thought there should be an immediate and aggressive intervention of a speech-language pathologist assigned to M to keep her engaged during recess.I don't know.  I was one of those kids who never ever spoke to anyone at recess until I was eleven.  I thought recess was pretty damn boring and I just couldn't quite wrap my brain around why kids would run around chasing balls.  It just didn't make much sense to me, so I usually sat on a bench and read a book.  Fathersvox had a similar experience, but without the book \u2014 he'd wander off at recess in the French countryside and sometimes not even wind up back at school.  I had to wonder if this coincidence in our profiles is not a coincidence at all, but an example of the assortative mating that Simon Baron-Cohen has been writing about.  But I digress.What stayed with me about this conversation was that the psychologist was talking about Sweet M's lack of social interaction at recess as though it were a crisis in need of immediate intervention, a tragedy in need of action, a symptom in need of a remedy.I couldn't help but wonder to what extent this could be another example of NT criteria being applied to atypical neurology.  Is not playing with the other kids at recess a tragedy?  Do we need an immediate intervention?  Or do we need to let her have her recess time to chill out, to think things through, to observe and relax on her own, in her own way?Or is the expert here right? Does social impairment, whether based in a language disorder or a \"social deficit,\" really have long-term negative effects?   Should we plan an immediate intervention?  And is my skepticism perhaps some sort of defense mechanism against seeing the reality of my child's suffering?These are the sorts of questions that drive autism parents mad because you can never really know whether you're depriving your child of an opportunity to grown and develop by not pushing in a particular way, or whether by pushing you'd be depriving your child of themselves \u2014 their right to be themselves \u2014 and the sense that they way they are is fundamentally just fine.I asked Sweet M about recess \u2014 about whether she wants to play with the other kids \u2014 and she said \"Ewe no.  I like to be by myself.\"But then when we were working on her word family flash cards one day this past week we came to the card for the \"-ad\" words: add, bad, dad, fad, had, lad, mad, pad, sad.  She'd drawn a picture of a sad fellow to illustrate the -ad card.\"How's he feeling?\" I asked.\"He's sad,\" she said.\"Wow, why's he sad?\" I asked.\"Because he doesn't have a friend,\" she replied.Later, we were walking around on Christmas day, taking in the wonderful quiet of New York City when  two-thirds of the population has decamped for cozier places, and it's not business as usual.  All of us love the city when it's quiet like this.  (Perhaps a sign of our own social impairments?)I said, \"M, can I ask you a question?\"\"Okay.\"\"If it could be easier for you to have a friend at school, would you like that?\"\"I don't  know,\" she said.  \"I can't know everything!\"And I don't know either.  Don't know whether this is so terribly important.  Don't know how I could find and afford a SLP to spend recess coaxing her into interaction.  Don't really know what to do or think about this.The expert felt sad watching Sweet M's social isolation.  I felt sad (and bad) hearing about it.  But is this really sad?One thing is certain \u2014 the word family card for \"-ed\" words is a lot more cheerful.

These young people, still in the \"care\" of the Rotenberg Center, sang the praises of the GED (the so-called Graduated Electronic Decelerator), which administers electric shocks every three seconds, much as any prisoner testifying under threat of retribution would espouse the beliefs of his or her keepers.It was interesting to note that the preponderance of Rotenberg students who testified that the GED had helped them stop their angry behaviors were young African American males \u2014 a group that has good reasons to be angry if employment, life expectancy, and incarceration statistics are any indication of the challenges that they face.Similarly, the preponderance of parents speaking in favor of the use of electric shock on their children were parents who seemed not to have adequate access to other resources.  Some spoke hyperbolically of the \"torture\" of trying to raise them \u2014 of the challenges they faced and the difficulties of finding schools and services \u2014 without addressing the fact that what these regulations propose is the state-sanctioned use of actual torture on their children.Parents who favored the use of the GED electric shock machine spoke about not wishing their children to be an \"drug-induced straight-jacket\" \u2014 yet they frequently referenced older medications that are far from the optimal and most current medications for addressing aggressive behaviors. And they spoke, heartbreakingly, of children that they did not feel could be helped in any other way. I found myself wondering what sorts of supports \u2014 social, medical and psychiatric, legal and educational, if any \u2014 these families had received.But for every parent who spoke up in support of the use of aversives, electric shock, and restraints, there were two and three parents, educators, and survivors of aversives who spoke out against them.  A young woman from Long Island with Tourette's Syndrome who has started a program of youth ambassadors to explain Tourette's, spoke eloquently of the idiocy of punishing children for behaviors that they can't control. Several women spoke of ongoing psychological damage from having been subjected to the use of restraints for days on end.And there were attorneys from the New York Lawyers in the Public Interest and the New York Civil Liberties Union to remind us of the horrors of Willowbrook in 1972 and the illegality of many of the proposed practices.And a psychologist from the New York State Psychological Association's Task Force on the Use of Behavioral Interventions with Children spoke of how the restraint provisions of the proposed law violate federal law; how such measures could not be \"safely and humanely enacted\" with minimally trained staff; and that there is not adequate peer-reviewed research to support the use of aversives even if it were legal.Nevertheless, it was a scantily attended hearing, scheduled mid-summer when the luckier among us are away on holiday.  Although there were more in attendance than my late afternoon photo reveals, it was disturbing to see how few voices were raised against this practice. There was no loud protest, no locked arms, no autistic version of ACT-UP on behalf of our neurologically challenged children.But there is still time to let your thoughts and concerns be know.  Written testimony is being accepted until August 28th.

I was in the unusual position of seeing them from behind, as they were walking hand in hand down a pathway on the NYU campus.I caught up with them when they stopped for traffic at West Fourth Street, and took her father's hand, to make a threesome. She dropped his hand and spun around to take mine, almost as though some magnetic force dislodged her and reattached her on the other side of the group. Her father let go of my hand, and we were once again in our family unit of 2 + 1: (Sweet M + parent) + other parent.Our family is fractured. Lots of families are. Lots of autism families are. We are a classic case: parents invested in the child and divested in each other.As  we walked home,  Sweet M had something to share.Guess what guess what guess what, ________!!?!!

Pigeon mites are nasty. The segment showed an exterminator fumigating for the mites and installing spikes.Wow. I thought.

{"date": "Saturday, November 04, 2006", "body": "\nOne of the things that alarmed me when I went to parent-teacher night at Sweet M's school was that they've instituted something called \"responsibility room.\"If a child doesn't finish his or her homework \u2014 or if, in the estimation of the teacher, hasn't done his or her best work \u2014 then they go to responsibility room instead of going to recess.These kids are 8-year-olds.  With learning disabilities.  With sensory processing issues.  Many with multiple psychotropic medications.Responsibility room?I can understand having a study hall or homework make-up room \u2014 though I'd question even that for 8-year-old LD kids.  I can understand having a breakroom or a \"crash room\" if you don't feel like going to recess. But responsibility room?Onto the fact that someone is having some sort of troubles getting their work done, the school is loading a whole load of assumptions \u2014 and guilt \u2014 about individual agency, about individual self-control.  Contrary to popular delusions, humans actually don't have a lot of self-control. We are creatures of habit and creatures of instinct, and exercising self-control is something that is far more difficult than any of us are willing to say.  But we are a culture that has large-scale fantasies about individuality and self-control and self-making.  And Sweet M's school has bought into that idea big-time.When I expressed my concern about responsibility room, I was told that our kids need some sort of discipline.Fair enough.  But if you're like me you've probably noticed that the word \"discipline\" comes from \"disciple.\" The root of any sort of discipline worth engaging is a relationship, a loving, engaged, affective and sometime passionate relationship.But something happens when the relationship is not a loving relationship, but a relationship of bureaucracy to individual, or institution to individual.  Then discipline is anything but loving. Instead it is punitive.If I'd felt that Sweet M's teachers had a loving and engaged relationship with her I might have been less alarmed about this construct, but seeing what I've seen so far, responsibility room looks like the first lesson in Kafka's Metamorphosis, the first lesson in acquiescing to institutional power.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/11/discipline.html", "title": "\nDiscipline\n"},

Her psychiatrist once called her \"spectrumy\" -- but when asked if she was ASD said no.  I have a $3,000 neuropsychological evaluation done just over a year ago (that I still haven't finished paying for) that says unequivocally that Sweet M doesn't have ASD.Of course from our own research, and from reading dozens of wonderful blogs, we knew that all arrows were pointing to ASD, but no one ever stepped up to the plate and said ASD.  Yesterday, finally, a psychologist said the words, \"Your daughter has austism spectrum disorder.\"  She even pulled out her well-worn, yellow-highlighted paperback edition of the DSM to go through the diagnostic criteria with us.  Sometimes it's hard, even for we neurotypicals, to know what the appropriate response should be. On one hand, I felt like laughing and saying, \"Ah-duh, tell me something that I didn't know.\"  And on the other hand one wants to burst into tears:\u2022 of relief for having someone see the full complexity of Sweet M's issues \u2022 of rage for having been dragged along with partial views for so long\u2022 of grief for the time we may have lost in not having an adequate Dx and getting Sweet M all the supports and assistance that she needsWe've slipped right over the boundaries of autism's edges, into a new-old, familiar-unfamiliar terrain with our new Dx, our new visa.

Dishwashers.  Washers.  Dryers.  Even garbage disposals.I've also been dreaming of backyards, gardens, patios, swimming pools, nearby beaches.I think this may mean that my enthusiasm for living in New York City is coming to its limits.There are dozens of things that people put up with to live in New York City.  The ones that are obvious are the high cost of living from rent to food, the generally lousy public schools, the cramped and often crumbling apartments, the noise of traffic and neighbors, and the rarity of outdoor spaces.The ones that are less widely remarked upon are the usual lack of household conveniences: dishwashers, washer-dryers and garbage disposals in apartments.  For years it was illegal to install garbage disposals in Manhattan kitchens.  Don't ask \u2014 something about the sewage lines. And old apartment buildings like the one we live in don't allow washer-dryers in the apartments.  Supposedly it strains the plumbing.But last week, unexpectedly, my dishwasher dream was answered, in the most unexpected way.  I'd come home from a long day at work (yes, I've started on my new project despite the fact that I still don't have a contract.)  And all the dishes had been done.

{"date": "Saturday, November 18, 2006", "body": "\nSpecial Focus asked me to write a something about privacy and posting.  I'm grateful for her request because Autism's Edges is almost a year old, and it's time for me to think about where all of this is going, and what I will make of it in the coming year.Deciding when to speak and when to remain silent has all sorts of implications, both practical and moral, interpersonal and political. Every person of conscience who starts writing bumps up against this dilemma at one point or another, whether they're writing a blog, or a journal, or a book.How do we speak our own truths without trampling on the privacy of others, whether they're our children, their caregivers and educators, or other family members? Where does our right to share our experiences bump against another person's right to not share their own? How can one be honest and forthright yet not set off a series of detonations that destroy every relationship in sight?Blogs are particularly challenging. Remember how diaries used to have locks and be kept under mattresses so that one could pour out the contents of one's heart and then seal it away? Well, the blog, despite having the appearance of a diary or journal, is actually like a diary on steroids. It's as though it's being read aloud on the most popular radio station in your vicinity and then kept on replay, over and over. In other words, it's not a diary at all.The best bloggers are acutely aware of the distinction between diary and blog.  While a blog may look like a diary, in the best cases, that's a formal conceit.Blog entries from autism parents are typically dispatches from our private worlds, but usually they are not our innermost thoughts.  They're an edited version of our innermost thoughts. Self-censorship \u2014 aka editing with an eye to how others will understand us and what we've written \u2014 is critical.   Though, once again, I think that some of the best bloggers create the illusion that what they've posted is spontaneous, immediate, and their innermost thinking.For almost a year I've been posting about all sorts of medical, psychological, and educational issues related to Sweet M's neurological a-typicality. But I've been writing under a pseudonym, and have almost always hidden the identities of the care providers who've appeared in various stories. Once, when I was praising one extravagantly, I listed her name. But retrospectively, I wish I hadn't because she could google herself, come across the site, and bring it to the attention of others who did not get such enthusiastic reviews. Sometimes I've used initials, and other times I've just changed people's names, but I've been careful to avoid what might roll over into the arena where one could be accused, however unjustly, of libel.When we had a particularly egregious experience with a psychiatric professional, I didn't post about it. I held back because I could not provide the full dimensions of the story without writing something that had the potential for time-consuming blowback. That doesn't mean I won't write about it in the future, but for the moment, I have kept that private.Once I wrote a post that Fathersvox thought cast him in a poor light, and he was really annoyed. (Obviously I won't link back to it and add insult to insult.)And I put up pictures of Sweet M, which I've sometimes regretted.  While it seemed important to put a face on autism's edges, it's also important for her to have her privacy. Fathersvox was fairly unhappy about my using her image, and I may go back and delete those photos. Not that anything ever posted can be completely deleted. Once it's out there, it's out there.Sometimes I wish I'd felt I could be 100% \"out about aut,\" as Kristina Chew is, and puts it so well. But since Sweet M's diagnosis has been ambiguous, and her school placement has depended, in part, on her not being labelled autistic, I didn't think it was prudent to be completely out. And as bad as it's been this year, it was pretty great last year, and, unfortunately, is still the most appropriate option available to Sweet M.Of course being out is a political issue, but being out for someone else is a rather more complicated question.In the early HIV-AIDS activism of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, groups like Gran Fury and Visual Aids made it clear that taking control of the representation of being HIV-positive and/or gay, was a central part of the struggle for securing funding for AIDS research, healthcare funding, and social services. To win support for AIDS research and social services, activists had to stand up and say it loud, I'm HIV-positive and proud. Silence = Death became one of the most quoted mottos of late 1980s and early 90s. Initially having AIDS was so closely associated with the stigma surrounding being gay \u2014 AIDS was called \"the gay plague\" \u2014 that one wasn't necessarily dying of HIV, but rather from the maligning and hatred that stigmatized gays and limited medical care and research.But with autism, it's slightly different.HIV-AIDS is a disease. People with HIV-AIDS have a high likelihood of getting sick, and without treatment, of dying of other illnesses due to a compromised immune system. But being homosexual \u2014 which as recently as 1973 was considered a disease or psychiatric disorder \u2014 no longer is. That change is due entirely to activism on the part of gay women and men who basically stood up and said, I'm gay, and I'm okay \u2014 there's nothing sick about it.Autism is similar and different.  One doesn't get sick and die from being autistic. But the social difficulties of autistic people do create very real health risks. Autistic individuals have a much higher chance of being abused and/or murdered by parents who can no longer cope with both the stigma that continues to be associated with autism and woeful lack of support for autistic individuals and their families than do their neurotypical peers. There are remarkable dangers in coping with institutional authorities, for example, the police. And there are the potentially long-term implications of certain kinds of self-injurious behaviors.But even so, it's not altogether clear that ASD \u2014 particularly as the DSM-IV-TR currently describes it \u2014 is a disease. It's actually more of a disposition or neurological variation onto which a psychiatric framework has been applied. At the end of the day, autism is more similar to homosexuality than to HIV-AIDS\u2014 it's a psychiatric category, not a disease. People once spoke of curing people of their homosexuality, much as they now speak of curing people with ASD of their autism. (Sadly some still speak of curing homosexuality, but that's a post for another day.)So being out about being aut is more similar to being out about being gay than it is to being out about being HIV-positive. By saying \"I'm autistic\" one is claiming membership under the rubric that is defining one as diseased rather than different. One is, at least provisionally, accepting the language of psychiatry that inscribes one as not only different, but aberrant. The gay rights movement rejected the psychiatric label of \"homosexual\" and used the label \"gay.\" The autism rights movement has come up with \"autie,\" \"aspie\" (from Lianne Holliday Willey), and \"neurological diversity\" or \"neurodiversity\" (Judy Singer).And then to further complicate the matter, many people posting about autism aren't autistic themselves \u2014 many, like me, are the neurotypical parents of autistic children. One finds that one can get into all kinds of scraps writing as a neurotypical parent. There are debates about speaking on behalf of one's child, speaking for one's child, and speaking about one's child.  These are nuanced, but important differences.  When one is writing about one's child one is \"outing\" someone who hasn't had any choice about it and who might, one day down the line, say \"how could you write about me like that?\"But at the end of the day, and the end of this post, I have to say that writing about being a parent of an autie child (whether Sweet M is ultimately diagnosed as autistic or not, I'm quite sure she's autie) is among my most important work. It's vital for me because, as Mom-NOS so aptly described, it provides me with some sort of local coherence. I get to work out a sense of how to think about my daughter, myself, our family, and the social and political institutions that shape our lives in a place where I have to think things through, where people comment and support, where people offer advice, and feedback and guidance.In the early women's movement \u2014 which I'm not quite old enough to have been a full-fledged participant in \u2014 there were consciousness-raising groups where women spoke intimately about the abuses they experienced both at home and in the wider world. The idea that the personal is political was born. But these groups were not listservs or bulletin board posts or blogs. They were intimate spaces where women could speak from their lived experience to build some sort of political analysis and action in dialogue. The internet provides a space where some of this can happen, but it's never a private space, which is its difficulty. But on the other hand, it reaches out from our living rooms, or laptops in airports, or lunch breaks in offices, and allows us to connect, to consider, and to contemplate the most crucial issues in our lives.In the end, then I think that silence for me would equal death. On some days that feels like a literal use of death and on others a more literary or metaphorical use. And I know that Sweet M, for whatever privacy she may want at some later point, she also wants and needs an alive, active, and engaged mom who can advocate on her behalf. It's a balancing act. There may be missteps along the way, but that's one of the edgy things about living at autism's edges.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://specialfocusblog.blogspot.com/", "http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/INTELLECTUALPROPERTY/libelfrm.htm", "http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/2005/12/aut-about-autism-159_03.html", "http://www.autismland.com", "http://www.gmhc.org/", "http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/GranFury/GFIndx.html", "http://www.visualaids.org/", "http://www.inlv.demon.nl/avunsi/", "http://www.jkp.com/catalogue/book.php/isbn/9781853027499", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiverse", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/privacy-rights-and-writes.html", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/07/send-in-idiots.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/11/silence-death.html", "title": "\nSilence = Death\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 02, 2006", "body": "\nLately I've been thinking a great deal about happiness and satisfaction. My fleeting glimpses of the former and my occasional brief encounters with the latter have left me wondering about these elusive states.Elsewhere I've come out against the neverending imperative to turn all lemons into lemonade,  to find silver linings in every dark cloud, to render all problems into euphemistic \"challenges\"  \u2014 a tendency that flavors so many of the special-needs parenting books.  Yeah, yeah, I'll dream new dreams, but just give me five minutes to realize that I even had a whole batch of dreams that I'm giving up.  I guess I'm just too cranky to make everything into all happy, all of the time.  (Maybe I need some of the 5HTP that This Mom is taking because she has been delightfully happy lately!  Where can I get that, Kyra?)But however cranky one might be, one does wish to have some modicum of happiness in this short go-of-it that we have on the planet.  I just wonder how one gets there.Thus you would probably not be surprised to learn that I've been reading Daniel Gilbert's Stumbling on Happiness, the cover of which features a spilled bowl of cherries. Gilbert is a Harvard psych professor renowned on campus for his happiness course, which this volume is said to distill.  The book is a compendium of counter-intuitive findings about happiness and satisfaction from the annals of research pyschologists spun together with Gilbert's own quirky brand of humor.Here's an example of a counter-intuitive finding:In one experiment two groups of students participated in a photography workshop.  At the end of the class, each student had made two prints.  One group was told that they could keep one print, but that they had to leave the other with photography instructor, as examples for his class portfolio.  They had to choose then, forever, which print they would keep and which they'd leave for the teacher's use.  The second group was told that they'd get to keep one picture, and had to leave one behind, but unlike group one, they were reassured that if they changed their minds about the photo they'd chosen that they could always call the photo instructor and swap the pictures any time.Several days later the members of each group were asked to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the pictures they'd chosen to keep, and interestingly enough, the group that did not have the option of changing their pictures were significantly more satisfied with their choices.  Really significantly more satisfied.You can wind up a lot more satisfied \u2014 a lot more happy \u2014 with something that you can't change.  You come up with reasons to be happy about your choice.  You affirm what you've got.While we tend to think that having options offer happiness, we seem to be wrong.More freedom, more choices \u2014 at least in such matters as which photos one keeps \u2014 simply doesn't translate into greater happiness or contentment.Whether this can be generalized to autism parenting, I wasn't sure.  So I began thinking about this satisfaction factor and what I've observed in my eight-plus years of parenting a \"challenging\" child.One of the things that has most puzzled me in my own journey with Sweet M is how anxious, and irritable, and distraught I'd become whenever I've contemplated some sort of \"cure\" for her.  Early on in this blog I called these unhappy moments of minor madness cure quest.Debilitating bouts of cure quest could be brought on any number of stimuli: by new research on vaccines and mercury and suggestions of chelation as a cure; by a nutritionist advocating gluten-free, casein-free diets for kids in the spectrum; by solicitous psychologists advocating auditory integration training for M's auditory processing challenges or parent-child interaction therapy for her putative oppositional defiance disorder.What was especially troubling was the sense of urgency they'd convey.  If you don't do this now your child might be lost. You may never forgive yourself if you don't try ___________ (fill in the blank.)  There's a limited window when you can start this intervention \u2014 you've got no time to waste.  Every second counts . . .I remember one psychologist telling me that he shuddered to think what our daughter's life would be if we did not continue in a course of therapy that required us to sit by passively while he taunted M with withheld \"reinforcers\" in order to \"expand her frustration tolerance\" and increase her \"compliance.\"  Fortunately he did not win my compliance, and we walked away from that \"treatment.\"  (I shudder to think what our lives would be if we'd agreed to participate in breaking her spirit in that way.)But like the parents that Cammie McGovern describes in her New York Times Op-Ed several weeks ago, I'd feel a sense of urgency and desperation, coupled with a nagging list of \"what-if's.\"  What if . . .putting Sweet M on a GFCF diet would stabilize her moods and help her concentrate and I didn't do it giving her digestive enzymes would help her with her moods and concentration and I didn't do it following traditional medical advice and treating her moods with psychotropic medications had horrible side effects that weren't apparent for years ABA would give her more freedom within certain boundaries than my own self-described hippie style parenting offered and I resisted because of my own resistance to anything Skinnerian what if parent-child interaction therapy helped her extend her frustration tolerance and I refused to do it because I objected to what I saw as a sadomasochistic dynamic. The list of \"what-if's\" was long and troubling, and I was often anxious and depressed.And really, come to think of it, who wouldn't be?While nothing can excuse the murder of a child \u2014 any child \u2014 I think I understand the despair and despondency at the heart of Dr. Karen McCarron's murder of her daughter Katie.  Cure quest \u2014 and Dr. McCarron seemed to have had a serious case of it \u2014 can be debilitating and deadly.I thought back on the times when I felt that there might be a \"cure\" for what \"ails\" Sweet M.  I'd read Catherine Maurice's Let Me Hear Your Voice, and her children seemed so much more impaired that Sweet M \u2014 if her children could \"recover\" from that level of impairment, then I should have high hopes for Sweet M, I thought.  I'd read Patricia's Stacey's The Boy Who Loved Windows and I'd think that I ought to have mortgaged our futures so as to spend every waking hour engaged in floortime.And then, alternately, I'd think that perhaps there was nothing really seriously \"wrong\" with Sweet M at all \u2014 perhaps she was simply high-strung and late-talking.I just didn't know what to think.  To tell you the truth, I still don't.  I look back on that time and remember only that it was all very confusing, and that most of time I was anything but happy.  Much of the time I was in the darkest despair.But for the moment I've got my bowl of strawberries, hold the lemonade, and I'm not altogether unhappy.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022 speech-language disorders  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   family life\u2022   positive psychology  \u2022   Daniel Gilbert\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1575665603/qid=1151890839/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-4157793-5539929?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.thismom.com/", "http://http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&isbn=1400042666&itm=1", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400042666/sr=8-1/qid=1151891710/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4157793-5539929?ie=UTF8", "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/05/opinion/05mcgovern.html", "http://www.pjstar.com/stories/062406/TRI_BA6ITNTP.028.shtml", "http://www.pjstar.com/stories/051706/PHI_B9RADKE1.033.shtml"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/07/lifes-bowl-of-part-two.html", "title": "\nLife's a Bowl of _____, Part Two\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 21, 2006", "body": "\nSo we did it.  We dropped out of camp.  Actually we dropped out of camp even before we dropped in.  We dropped out on July 4th, the day before camp was to begin.  It was our own little Independence Day celebration, and there were even some verbal fireworks, but not until several days later when I spoke with the camp staff to ask for a refund.What cinched it for us was the fact that I revisited the website where I'd read about the camp we'd signed up for, and I took a closer look at the favorable \"parent review.\"  Turns out the favorable review of the camp, written under the moniker \"Informed Parent\" had an email address that, when Googled, brought one back to the camp director's name.  In other words, the only favorable review of the camp was written by the camp's director.This did not inspire.There had been earlier red flags.  There was the fact that when I'd asked about the child to counselor ratio when the children are at the public swimming pool \u2014 a question that should have an easy answer like 3:1, or 4:1, or 5:1 \u2014 I got an evasive answer:  \"Your child will never be unsupervised at the pool.\"This was a bit alarming.  I assumed they'd be supervised \u2014 the question was in what ratio. Being supervised at the pool should be a given, whether NT or autie.And then there was the fact that they had really no interest at all in knowing what Sweet M had been doing with her current reading program.  They were going to make Wilson Fundamentals work for her.That was a concern.  Especially since we know that Wilson Fundamentals doesn't work for her.And then there was the fact that when I asked for a schedule of a typical day \u2014 so that I could prep Sweet M for a new routine \u2014 it took a week to get it because the director had to type it up  especially for me.  There was no schedule typed up that could simply be emailed to me.  They didn't have a prepared schedule a week before camp was to start.And, of course, there was the big ole flashing red light of Sweet M's week of silence as she dreaded the prospect of going to camp.Oprah has this line she uses about how first God whispers to you, then she gives a holler, and then she clobbers you over the head.  Finding out that the director had written his own review posing as a camp parent was the clobbering over the head.So we requested a refund \u2014 again \u2014 and this time they gave us one, albeit a partial one, that at least helps pay for some of the activities and tutoring that we're improvising.Inspired in part by MOM-NOS's decision to create Camp Bud for the summer, but also by the complete paucity of options \u2014 and what was probably a near disaster with this year's camp try \u2014 we decided to create Camp Sweet M home this summer.Instead of subscribing to the clock-discipline of getting up at 6 or 7 to drop her off at a bus by 7 or at camp by 8, we sleep in, getting up when we're rested.  I don't think we've done this since Sweet M was born.  It is an epiphany to be rested.Then, after we've had a little breakfast, we do some summer reading and math homework that her teachers had prepared in June.Then she watches some television and I go to work on my project that is still waiting for a contract, but that has been keeping roof over head and airconditioner on at least part of the time.Then while I'm out at work, Sweet M's father takes her to speech therapy, or to her new karate class.  She'd been asking to take karate, and now seemed the time, as her afternoons are lazy and open.And next week, as speech therapy ends for the summer, her teacher from last year will start coming twice a week to tutor her in reading so that she doesn't lose ground, and maybe even takes a leap ahead.And Sweet M is making drawings for her school friends, and sending them as her way of saying \"hi.\"So many camps have a native American theme \u2014 seems Sweet M's does as well.  And look how happy those campers look!I feel as though we stepped out of jail \u2014 time jail \u2014 where the walls were made of school schedules and bus schedules and other people's agendas for us and our child.I understand now why people choose to home school, as Kyra is doing for Fluffy.  It is delicious \u2014 utterly delicious \u2014 if your work life and circumstances permit it.Of course improvising Camp Sweet M has taken a bit of time.  You've seen my posts per week have plummeted.  Hopefully what we've lost in quantity we will be able to make up in quality \u2014 quality here and quality time with our dear girl.And so goodbye and good riddance to the myth that all well-loved and well-cared for kids go to camp.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022 speech-language disorders  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   family life  \u2022   summer camp\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/boy-of-summer.html", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/07/notes-on-camp-summer-sort-that-is.html", "title": "\nNotes on Camp \u2014 The Summer Sort, That Is\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 26, 2006", "body": "\nLast week Sweet M stopped talking.  She'd give a thumbs up or a thumbs down as \"yes\" or \"no,\" and if you insisted, she'd yield and use words.  But other than that, she was incommunicado.At school -- during the last week of school -- the kids were writing in their notebooks about what they were going to do on their vacations. Many of the kids were writing about going to camp. But M wrote that she was going to a hotel, and going in a swimming pool there. When M's teacher asked her camp, M turned to her and growled, \"No, I haaaate camp.\"As I mentioned back in March, Sweet M has not had good camp experiences.  Last year she was at an inclusion program at the local Y, and that didn't exactly work out swimmingly.  In fact, Sweet M didn't swim at all because no one was allowed to help her with her hair and swimsuit (as no one was allowed to touch her for fear of allegations of abuse).And the year before she went to a day camp an hour out of the city, which involved getting up at 6 to catch a 7 am bus several miles from our home.  When we went to the parent's day we saw how miserable she'd been all summer and our hearts broke.On the advice of M's doctor, I contacted Karenne Bloomgarden AKA \"The Camp Lady,\" who runs KB Camp Services in Manhattan, and helps parent's find appropriate camps for their kids.  Karenne was fantastically helpful and knowledgeable, and came up with three possible options that I followed up with.Unfortunately, the first one was full with a long waiting list.The second one wound up not seeming appropriate.  Even NT-me was starting to feel dysregulated when the camp representative started talking about the outdoor morning assembly with the groups doing cheers.But I was excited about the third option: excited and amazed to learn that there is a camp for special needs kids opening up just two blocks from where we live.  So I went about enrolling Sweet M.Now I am concerned.When Sweet M stopped talking, I sat down with her and asked her if she was worried about something.  She didn't say anything.  I asked if she was worried about camp.  She nodded her head.  Then I said that if camp was no fun that she could just stop going and we'd do something else.And guess what?  She looked obviously relieved and started talking again. She said, \"I hate camp.\"I said, thinking maybe we could get away with a name change, \"What about summer school?\"\"No, NO summer school.\"So I said she could go to new and better camp for one week to try it, and if it's no fun, she could do something else.I'm thinking I may take a cue from MOM-NOS and figure out some way to keep Sweet M home -- get her a babysitter to take her out to do things this summer instead of going the camp route.This morning I called the camp to ask if they'd prorate the camp fee if it didn't work out for Sweet M. I could use the refund money to hire a babysitter and set up a summer activities schedule for Sweet M.They said no. No refunds.You can't really blame them -- they have a program to run. They already hired their staff, etcetera, etcetera.But then when the administrator wished me \"good luck\" with a tone that rang of \"sorry, not my problem that you got suckered into paying for our camp\" -- then I was feeling pretty damn cranky myself.You know, I'm starting to hate camp, too.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022   special education   \u2022   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   family life\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/boy-of-summer.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/06/incommunicado.html", "title": "\nIncommunicado\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 31, 2006", "body": "\nWe had a magical experience today \u2014 we saw the year-end performance of The Magic Flute at the Metropolitan Opera House.Going to the opera is not something that we routinely do.  But a thoughtful colleague who was out of the country this holiday left us her four orchestra-seat tickets to the child-friendly, 100-minute, matinee performance.A couple of days ahead of this event I'd told Sweet M that we were going to the opera.The opera, she exclaimed.  The OP-PER-A.  We can't go to the opera.How come? I asked.I don't know.  But we can't go to the opera.Then a day or two later she turned to me and asked:  Do we have to have manners to go to the opera?Yes, I said, We do have to have manners.  But we do have manners \u2014 our manners are just fine \u2014 so we can go.Then yesterday she got down to her real question.Momma, do they have bathrooms at the opera?Yes, I said, They definitely have bathrooms at the opera.Do we have to have manners?  Do they have bathrooms? Do we have to inhibit our behaviors?  Do those people really manage to go all day without peeing? Having class is associated with bodily denial, with a steely self-discipline that is meant to both justify and atone for ones privileges.  Sweet M wondered will my body betray me as being some sort of downtown animal, some sort of beastly creature? Her concern was simple: Will I fit in?  Will I pass as someone with class?\"Opera\" was for her, as for so many, a stand-in for fancy, for uptown, for upscale, for wealth and privilege and propriety, that word that shares a root with property.  Nevermind that the opera used to be a wild and ribald public entertainment, not just a courtly spectacle, and not, as today, something usually priced out of reach of all but a few. This was something that she wasn't feeling too comfortable with, and she was worried: Will I act okay, what if I have to pee?After we got to our seats, I took Sweet M and her little friend Sweet W to the ladies lounge (aka the bathroom), so that they wouldn't have to get up during the performance.  When we headed back to our seats, we passed a woman who was pushing a little girl in an electric wheelchair \u2014 one of those massive enveloping and supportive chairs, complete with a head brace.  She was talking to the usher, and said, \"I will need some assistance.\"  The usher's reply, \"Did you let us know in advance?\"  With my two charges in tow, I couldn't hang back and hear how the rest of this conversation unfolded, but felt my mom-of-child-with-disability bear growl internally: Need she notifiy you in advance, you foolish arrogant able-bodied young person? Give her a hand.Shortly thereafter the woman and her daughter were escorted to the seats a couple of rows ahead of us.  The girl was beautiful in her dress-up dress, and the mother was beaming and whispered to her little one, \"Isn't this so exciting?\" as she hoisted her from the wheelchair into her lap for the duration of performance.  An usher stored the wheelchair out of the way for the performance.The Magic Flute is a quest story \u2014 what story worth its denouement isn't? \u2014 and in this particular quest the Prince Tamino is given a magic flute to help him rescue the Princess Pamina, who has fallen into the clutches of sorcerer Sarastro and his wicked servant Monostatos. Near the outset of the quest Prince Tamino meets a birdcatcher called Papageno, whose magic chimes will also aid the two in their quest. There are trials: they are tested in a vow of silence, and by fire and water. But in the end, because they've been good and truthful and courageous, they prevail, and find love and happiness. Pagageno, the birdcatcher, though fond of creaturely comforts \u2014 his feasting and wine and his lovely chick-a-dee Papagena \u2014 succeeds in being both animal and noble. That's the magic that music makes possible, the magic of  being both animal and noble.Sweet M and Sweet W made it through the performance without another bathroom break.  And the little girl with the graceful, courageous mother and the beautiful dress, and the physical anomaly that impaired her muscle-tone sat in her mom's lap through the show.  And we all saw how the bears cavorted with the humans.Magic: when the opera is for every body.Performance photo: Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesKeywords: autism   \u2022    Asperger's Syndrome   \u2022   ADHD   \u2022   learning disabilities  \u2022   speech-language disorders   \u2022   parenting    \u2022    education    \u2022   disability rights    \u2022   opera   \u2022   The Magic Flute\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/arts/music/01flut.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/12/magic-flutes-chimes-and-otherwise.html", "title": "\nMagic: Flutes, Chimes and Otherwise\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 28, 2006", "body": "\nSweet M sorts the words she knows. (September 2006)Over here at Autism's Edges we keep a lot of lists.We have lists of Dolch words Sweet M has learned; lists of things that Sweet wants Santa to bring her for Christmas (she still believes); lists of schools we've looked at and found inappropriate and lists of schools we've applied to which have found her inappropriate. We have lists that constitute diagnostic criteria, and we have lists of educational attorneys.Some days we try to keep lists of things we feel grateful for, as this is recommended as a way to boost one's sense of well being.  And other days we have lists of situations that we feel are hopeless, as this seems to keep us firmly grounded in reality.Apparently over at Sweet M's school they are also keeping lists.  I am told by the psychologist who cannot make a diagnosis \u2014 the one who read us the list of diagnostic criteria from the DSM-IV-TR \u2014 that Sweet M's school is keeping a log of anything that suggests that she is not appropriate for their setting.  So she doesn't really have to do anything spectacular to be booted out.  She just has to pick her nose.  Or not talk to another kid.  Or only eat pasta for lunch. Or prefer to play alone at recess.Earlier this year, in a meeting with the principal of the school, the principal explained to me that Sweet M has different teachers for reading, math, social studies, writing, and so on.  (Sweet M is in third grade, but has six teachers, one for each subject \u2014 six different people she has to figure out.)  She said we have her working with many different people because \"we want to have a lot of eyes on her.\"Not a lot of hands to support her, or hearts to embrace her, but a lot of eyes to assess her.The social theorist Michel Foucault compared this sort of surveillance to the panopticon, a structure where those in power have a sightline on every subject. Think here of prison watchtowers, or professors at a podium who can view every student.  The panopticon is a form \u2014 sometimes concrete and architectural, but most often social and bureaucratic \u2014 that focuses power in much the same way that the lens of magnifying glass can focus light.There are times when one feels one is becoming paranoid.  One is even tempted to check the DSM for the diagnostic criteria for various paranoid states.  But then one remembers that joke turned adage: just because you think someone is out to get you \u2014 or, in this case, your child \u2014 doesn't mean you're paranoid.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/11/lists.html", "title": "\nLists\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 22, 2006", "body": "\nSometimes an e-mail arrives that makes you sick to your stomach.  And just when you were settling into your delicious summer sans camp . . .This week I received one from Wrightslaw about the recent adoption of an Emergency Resolution of the New York State Education Department that allows schools to use aversives when approved on an IEP.Aversives are defined as:noxious, painful, intrusive stimuli or activities intended to induce pain such as electric skin shock, ice applications, hitting, slapping, pinching, kicking, hurling, strangling, shoving, deep muscle squeezenoxious, painful or intrusive spray, inhalant or tasteswithholding sleep, shelter, bedding, bathroom facilities or clothing; withholding meals, limiting essential nutrition or hydrationmovement limitation used as a punishment, including but not limited to helmets and mechanical restraint devicesplacing a child unsupervised or unobserved in a room from which the student cannot exit without assistanceAlthough the Emergency Resolution initially reads as though it prohibits aversives, read on, to section 200.22 and beyond, where the \"exceptions\" are outlined.Most remarkably, the Emergency Resolution requires \"the humane and dignified treatment of the student.\" Sounds like the language of the Geneva Convention \u2014 and we know how well that has worked out for prisoners of international conflicts.As the Wrightslaw e-mail points out, the fact that these regulations were enacted on an \"emergency\" basis, with no public hearings or public comment, gives parents and child advocates some time to plan and implement a strategy to persuade the policy-makers that these regulations are - inhumane.When I called the office of my state assembly person, Deborah Glick, to inquire about this emergency resolution, a staffer there said she'd do some research and call me back. When she called back she assured me that aversives could not be used unless the IEP mandated it and the Commissioner had reviewed the IEP. I can't begin to tell you how not reassured I was by this information.How many IEP meetings are missed because a parent gets the notice 24 hours before the meeting date? How would the single person at the top of an enormous bureacracy begin to know the needs of a particular child?Assemblywoman Glick's aide also told me that many parents desperately want to have IEPs that allow the use of aversives \u2014 that the NYSED is trying to satisfy parents on both sides of this issue.My thought was that if you or I were to put a child in restraints, or use electroshock, or withhold food as disciplinary practices in our homes, it would be called what it is: child abuse. And social workers would come and remove the child from said home. But when these same measures are planned by state-funded school employees, they're called \"behavioral intervention.\"Okay, so I'm soapboxing.But the use of \"aversives\" for kids with special needs is something that just seems so wrong, so nineteenth century, that I get a bit breathless about it.I'm going to save my breath for the hearings on this matter, now set in Albany, New York City, and Syracuse:Albany: Tuesday, August 8, 2006Time: 3:00 pm \u2013 7:00 PMLocation:Capital Region BOCESAdministrative Board Room1031 Watervliet Shaker RoadAlbany, New York 12205Directions at:http://www.capregboces.org/directions/DirectionstoCentAdmin.htmPlease note: you should enter the Administration Bldg by the entrance near the flagpole.New York City: Monday, August 14, 2006Time: 2:00 PM \u2013 7:00 PMLocation:Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building163 West 125th Street2nd Floor Art GalleryNew York, New York 10027Directions and subway information at:http://harlemonestop.com/organization.php?id=89Syracuse: Tuesday, August 15, 2006Time: 3:00 PM \u2013 7:00 PMLocation:Dr. King Elementary School416 E.

{"date": "Saturday, October 28, 2006", "body": "\nFor more than a month \u2014 an eternity in the autism  blogosphere \u2014 Autism's Edges has been dark.  Some may have even given up on this site as dead and gone.  I almost had.Too much had happened \u2014 too quick, too painful, and too daunting \u2014 to sum up in short posts.There were (and are) troubles a-plenty with Sweet M's school \u2014 troubles about which I have not felt it prudent to post given their complexity and what is at stake for Sweet M (i.e. a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting.)  There were psychiatrists to see and medication doses to adjust.  There were possible schools to research as alternatives and school tours to take.  There were conversations to be had about wonderful settings where the tuition is $72,500 per year.  There were attorneys to talk with.  There was the coordination of childcare since it was never clear when Sweet M would be sent home from school.  There were conferences with teachers and principals and heads of school.  There were conversations and quiet time with Sweet M to try to hold in tact her own sense of her wholeness, and value, and goodness.  There was just the everyday work of making a living to support one's fragile family. And there were some hours \u2014 not many, but some \u2014 of dark despair.Sometimes things are just too hard to write about, as MOM-NOS had observed.  I admired her for making that observation (as well as for much else), particularly when I myself only grew gradually more and more silent.At the heart of the particular despair that I felt was a single idea: that there is no place in the world for my beautiful daughter.  Folks who do cognitive behavioral therapy talk about the ways in which a belief or cognition can send one spiraling down, and I can see that. The idea that there is no place in the world for one's child is a quick ticket to despair.  Social banishment \u2014 even in the form of troubles at school \u2014 can inspire an almost primordial dread in the neurotypical.I've been working on banishing this mistaken idea, with some success.  But the exorcism of this demon got a big boost yesterday, fittingly enough under the auspices of the Jesuits and in the week before Halloween, at the extraordinary conference Autism and Advocacy: Witness and Hope that Jim Fisher and Kristina Chew organized at Fordham University.  It was a moving day of panel presentations, and evening of readings, where Mark Osteen read of the anguish of waiting for hours and hours as his autistic son took five times the typical time to awaken from surgery (for the removal of a wad of paper that he'd inadvertently lodged in his nose); where Bruce Mills shared the story of his neurotypical daughter's challenges being the sibling of an autistic brother; where Gloria Pearson-Vasey read from The Road Trip: Life with Autism, a book she coauthored with her autistic son Kevin; where Jean Kearns Miller (editor of Women from Another Planet) read poems and shared experiences of being an Asperger's mother.  There was an atmosphere of community, without the requirement of any uniformity or conformity, and the sort of hospitality that is more healing than any hospital.Many thanks to Jim, Kristina, and the folks at Fordham.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/privacy-rights-and-writes.html", "http://www.fordham.edu/Campus_Resources/Public_Affairs/topstories_723.asp", "http://www.kristinachew.com/", "http://www.case.edu/affil/sce/Representing%20Autism.html", "http://www.kzoo.edu/english/faculty/bruce.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Road-Trip-Life-Autism/dp/2895076030/sr=1-1/qid=1162077960/ref=sr_1_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://www.amazon.com/Women-Another-Planet-Universe-Autism/dp/1410734315/sr=1-1/qid=1162077773/ref=sr_1_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/10/hospitality.html", "title": "\nHospitality\n"},

And the time zone you've traveled to is that one dictated by the clock discipline of the institution.But the good news is that after last year's close encounter with the possibility of a 6 a.m. bus pickup for Sweet M, we've gotten the doctor-ordered \"limited time travel\" on her IEP.  That means that she can only be on the bus for an hour.  Beyond that, it's a violation of her rights to reasonable accommodations needed for a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting \u2014 you know the drill!  The tangible effect of this is that instead of having to get up at 6, as I've been doing with her for 3 years, we can now get up at 7!  Imagine the luxury of one more hour of sleep.Even so, getting up early and getting her on the bus by 7:30 has been a shock to our systems.  Last night she fell asleep at 7, I fell asleep at 8:30, and Fathersvox managed to hold out until 9:30.  Now, of course, I'm yawning . . .But even in her somewhat sleep-deprived, September-lagged state of mind, Sweet M has been loving school.

{"date": "Monday, September 04, 2006", "body": "\nPhew! \u2014 August was a blur with travel. After one work trip that took me to California for two weeks,  I stopped back home just long enough to go to the hearing on aversives and see Sweet M and FathersVox for a  couple of days before heading off on another work trip for a week.  Back in town another two days, then off, finally, on vacation, with Sweet M and Fathersvox, back to our off-season, frequent-flyer-mile boon Caribbean paradise.Photo: My favorite frequent flyer.Sweet M was unimpressed by the place \u2014  too many mosquitoes, too hot and humid, too much scratchy sand and strange crickety noises at night from the tropical landscape.  She begged me to turn the nine-day trip into a four-day layover, but when I explained that we had reservations \u2014 that we couldn't change our tickets \u2014 she hung in, and found some delight in bobbing in the not very big waves.  (Beach location pictures may follow, if the waterproof camera comes through for us.)But in the end, what Sweet M really loved was the end of the vacation.  The fact that she was going home.  On the ride on the ferry on the way back from the island we visited \u2014 bobbing up and down against the choppy waters \u2014 she was thrilled.And she didn't even fuss (much) when the airport TSA screener confiscated the seriously dangerous Hunt's prepackaged, totally sealed, chocolate pudding that we'd forgotten to take out of her airplane lunch box.We'd thought she'd eat her pudding in the three hours we had to wait in the airport, but she hadn't gotten around to it, and her carry-on was chosen to be rescreened just prior to boarding.  She certainly fits a terrorist profile, don't you think?  Especially in that lavender Hannah Anderssen dress.  It's a dead giveaway.As the officer droped her pudding in the garbage, her lip quivered, and she started in, but it's my chocolate pudding, but then she just pulled herself together and climbed onto the plane.As you might have guessed, I'm not convinced we're even the tiniest bit safer with TSA agents confiscating kids' chocolate pudding, but  I rejoiced at her reaction.  She's come a long way \u2014 and in much more than frequent flyer miles \u2014 from that first summer when we tried to escape to the Caribbean only to be caught in an autism edge's airport moment.We're all glad to have been there \u2014 to all of those there's \u2014 and even more glad to be back.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022  speech-language disorders  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   family life  \u2022   family vacations\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/09/phew-august-blur.html", "title": "\nPhew! \u2014 August A Blur\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 29, 2006", "body": "\nOne of the most interesting things that lingers with me from the Autism and Advocacy Conference organized by Jim Fisher and Kristina Chew is the way that there is a double meaning in the word \"qualified.\"There was conversation regarding the idea of not having a series of letters after your name, but perhaps being Q.B.E. \u2014 Qualified by Experience.  One knows autism by being autistic.  One knows autism, differently, but intimately, by being an autism parent.  Gaining one's authority and expertise from experience has a long history, only partly usurped by the rise of professional classes with their need for accreditation.Then there is the other sort of qualification \u2014 the speech act that puts limits on what we can state, on what we claim to know.  The autistic author J. Kevin Vasey (The Road Trip: Life with Autism) precedes many sentences with the caveat \"as far as I can tell.\"  The phrase places limits on the reach of any knowledge claims he makes; the phrase creates a high degree of linguistic accuracy.  The phrase reminded me that we can all, within our qualifications, make qualifications.Qualifications are how one claims ones authority, and qualifications are how one limits the reach of one's authority.Last week, speaking with a new psychologist who will be coordinating care between Sweet M's school and us I asked how the school observation went.  The psychologist went on at some length about Sweet M's limited social skills and communication dysfunction.Then she suggested that I attend a support group for parents of ASD kids that the NYU Child Study Center has recently started.  (At last, a support group!).  Terrific, I said, I'd like to do that.  Does that mean that you would be saying that Sweet M is ASD \u2013 that she is autistic and that we should get that diagnosis?Well, not exactly, she said.  But her spectrumy symptoms are creating problems for her socially at school.We went on to discuss the ambiguity of her neuropsych report \u2014 which reads as though she's EBA (everything but autistic) \u2014 and the relative merits of an autism diagnosis as compared with the potpourri she's had up until now.Qualifications.It seems that I am diagnosed as an autism parent, despite the fact that no one is yet willing diagnose Sweet M as autistic.As far as I can tell.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/autism-advocacy-conference-witness-and-hope/", "http://www.autismvox.com/advocacy-witness-hope/", "http://www.amazon.com/Road-Trip-Life-Autism/dp/2895076030/sr=8-1/qid=1162132701/ref=sr_1_1/002-4770870-2490444?ie=UTF8&s=books"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/10/qualifications.html", "title": "\nQualifications\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, March 28, 2009", "body": "\nLast month I went to California to be with my father when he died and to be with my family at his funeral.  The funeral was exactly a month ago today.On the phone from California to New York, I asked Sweet M if she wanted to come out for the funeral and she said, \"Uhp-hummm (feigned throat clearing), the school, uhp-hummmmm, the homework.  Remember 'the working hard' and 'the study hard'. I can't go, I have school.\"It's sort of hard to convey the inflection, but imagine a snarkey teenager (though she's not that old yet) mimicking back everything you've ever said about working hard and studying hard.  She completely has my number with that \"working hard\" bit.So she and Fathersvox stayed in New York and I navigated the end of life terrain \u2014 the ultimate aging out \u2014 without them close at hand.  Perhaps this is the aging out that has weighed most heavily on my mind.I have written very little about my father's illness.  In part that is because I have been some 3,000 miles away, dropping in as I can to assess the state of his life and my mother's, but largely unable to be of much help.Alzheimer's seems to be a 1,000  little deaths followed by a sigh of relief.   There are so many losses all along the way that the work of mourning is nearly done by the time death arrives.There were his years of pretending to understand us, of covering for his memory loss, followed by the getting lost at the airport in 2001 and then the many episodes of losing his car and finally \"losing\" his car keys when my mother finally took them away, then there was the forgetting of his AOL password and then end of his emails, and then the end of reading novels by the dozens as he once had, and the beginning of wandering and falling down, the brief and sometimes less brief hospitalizations, and then the not wishing to bathe or shave or change his clothes, always the terrible fear of losing his mind, and the inability to remember our names, words, places.In the last year there was the confinement in an assisted living facility that was thought to be safe and fine but that harbored everything from extraordinary care to incomprehensible sadism. Then there was the effort to get him home, then the hospice care, the precipitous decline and the several days of labored and then quiet breathing, and then quiet and a slack-jawed moment that is so hard to comprehend that surely it has given \"slack-jawed\" its very meaning.All of this is followed by a flurry of funerary activities to distract one for what has just unfolded, and to provide recognition of and closure on one man's life.So I am not at all sad about my father's passing.  I am relieved for him and for my mother, who labored to provide his care for all these years.Sweet M took it somewhat differently.When I got back she said, \"So Grandpa's dead.\"\"Yes.\"\"So I guess that means he won't see me go to middle school.\"\"Yes, he won't see you go to middle school.  Well, some people think he can see you from heaven, but I'm not sure about that -- I'm not sure how that would work.\"For her it is still exclusively about the people who see her and love her and celebrate her.  It is about her place in the world. Perhaps that is how it is for everyone, but she has not yet learned to dissemble regarding her M-centric world.We looked at the photos that I took to show her what the funeral was like.\"Hey!!!! You got to ride in a limousine.  I want to ride in a limousine!  I want to go to the funeral.\"\"Well honey I invited you and you said you didn't want to come because you had school.\"\"I know, but I changed my mind and now I want to go.\"\"I can see that you do want to go.  But we can't go back in time to do it over again.\"\"Because scientists haven't invented time machines yet?\"\"Yes.  And because so far as we know time only goes in one direction.\"\"Okay, but I really, really want to go to the next funeral.\"\"Okay.\"\"You promise?\"\"Yes, I promise.\"\"Who's going to die next?\" she asked with excitement.She could have been asking \"when will Santa come?\" so lacking is she in even the slightest trace of socially appropriate fear, grief, or bereavement.  Nothing but unbridled delight and anticipation.\u2022    \u2022    \u2022That is what I love about autism's edges.  We always have something to look forward to because it remains the upside-upset-down world where strength and weakness, good and bad, joy and sorrow, asset and liability, are impossible to distinguish.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JmcBVVIxUyE/Sc5Q5ZoMFsI/AAAAAAAAAWc/J64Zuw1CBo0/s1600-h/IMG_3020.JPG", "http://cbs2.com/local/Calabasas.Silverado.Senior.2.831861.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2009/03/finally-aging-out.html", "title": "\nAnother Version of Aging Out\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 21, 2009", "body": "\nBeing that it's January -- new year's resolutions and all that -- I had decided to do what our culture urges us to do at this time of year: make some health improving resolution.  And I did.  I got a physical from a new doctor since my dear doctor died.  I started a walking program.  Shifted some things in my usual eating.  You know -- all the usual health and fitness resolutions.But instead of focusing on my health as I had planned to do, I spent more than 17.5 hours in the first ten days of the new year on the phone fighting with our health insurance over getting one of Sweet M's prescriptions filled. It wasn't a new medication -- she's taken this medication since early December 2008 when she was diagnosed with reflux.  Her doctor chose it because it was *on* the insurance company's formulary -- it was an approved, preferred medication. But come January 1, the insurance company came up with a new Rx plan with a new formulary and were denying payment -- the week before she has to take standardized tests that will significantly impact where she'll go to middle school.  Since changing meds can change her functioning, changes are not a great idea, but they're an especially bad idea this week.I'd just buy her the medication, but frankly, we're about as short on greenbacks as this weathered tree is.So I was on it.  Making sure they approved  her medication -- no substitutions.Ultimately I got them to capitulate, after the aforementioned 17.5 hours on the phone.  Yes, I was counting.  And that was 17.5 hours when I wasn't taking care of my health -- wasn't getting in those 10,000 steps folks think we should all fit into our day, wasn't planning healthy meals, wasn't cooking or meditating or doing strength training.  And, of course, I wasn't doing the work that I am paid to do.My health insurance provider professes to want to encourage members to take better care of themselves -- they call it 360\u00b0 Health.  The even trademarked that name.  They're very committed to our health and well-being, or so their website with the smiling folks would suggest.   The theory is that if I were to get in better shape, they'd likely have to spend less money on me overall -- over a lifetime.  Or at least that is what their actuary tables say.The way I figure it, when the health insurance company wastes our time and creates undue stress in our lives to save a buck here and fifty cents there, they're actually costing us all.  Looking at things this way is called real-cost accounting, though most companies  would never bother to look at such a complete picture because the costs don't fall to them directly -- they don't appear on quarterly P & L statements.  Instead these are the costs that we bear invisibly: in lost work time, and in stress-related illnesses as our blood pressure rises, or our backs go out, or our knees buckle under the weight of all that we bear.  Insurance companies can ignore what they cost us, how they wear us out and wear us down.But we could fix that.  We could start invoicing insurance companies for the hours that we waste on the phone with them disputing their arbitrary and capricious denial of claims and those absurdly low limits for putatively \"reasonable and customer professional charges.\" We'd bill them for the time we spend punching in our ID numbers over and over again, listening to the treacly muzak while we're on hold, being transferred from one disempowered customer service rep to another. Bury them in invoices for all the hours they've cost all of us, for all the ways that they are destroying the health of our country and its citizens.I would love to see this happen. But activist reverie aside, how do you -- other autism parents -- find ways to take care of yourselves and your kids?  How do you strike a balance?  How do you stay resolute not only about your child's health and well-being, but about your own?Photo: Courtesy by Oruwu: Used courtesy of a Creative Commons Attribution/Non-Commercial Use License.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.empireblue.com/wps/portal/ehpmember?content_path=shared/noapplication/f2/s1/t0/pw_ad067392.htm&label=360%5Edeg%20Health%5Ereg"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2009/01/hidden-costs-of-mismanaged-care.html", "title": "\nThe Hidden Costs of (Mis)managed Care\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 26, 2008", "body": "\nSweet M's letter to Santa, October 28, 2008In late October, after the Toys R Us catalog arrived with the Sunday newspaper, Sweet M sat down to write her list for Santa. She was trying to avoid thinking about Halloween, a holiday she loathes, by looking forward to Christmas. And unlike any of the other 11-year-olds at her school, she still believes in Santa.Her Christmas list was long \u2014 very, very long \u2014 and both bridged gender roles and spanned the ages \u2014 the developmental ages, that is.  She was as ecstatic thinking over the possibilities of a Dora designer dollhouse as she was about a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon DS game.  She was as enthusiastic over the Leapfrog tag reading system as she was over the Hannah Montana videogame.  When toy makers put \"ages 3 and up\" on the label, they must have been thinking of Sweet M.  The \"and up\" applies in almost every selection.  My friend Mom-NOS observed a similar developmental spread in her boy Bud's toy selections.I was the scribe for Sweet M's letter to Santa.  That is, I typed the letter as she excitedly listed the items.  As her spirits soared with the possibilities of all the fun she could have, my spirits sank thinking about both the practical and theoretical implications of her list.Practically speaking there is the problem of a list of so many items that I'd need to rob a bank to pay for the stuff.  Well, scratch \"rob a bank\" and replace with \"rob the Federal Reserve\" since the banks don't have any money anymore.And then there is the problem of where to put whatever stuff we might get.  Our apartment is small \u2014 as are so many New York City apartments \u2014 and given her very expansive developmental span, we never quite know when she's done with something.  Legos to the Goodwill, or keep 'em another year?  Talking Amanda to the Salvation Army, or hold on for another round?  Barbies to the niece in California, or keep those Barbie travel trains and remote control convertible cars ready at hand?  Right now our apartment has taken on the look of a Manhattan Mini-Storage for a daycare center:  we have enormous bags of stuffed animals, bins of Barbies, Legos, and art supplies, and shelves of games and sporting equipment.And then there was the more serious problem:  how to teach her about other values?  Last year I took her to Operation Santa at the 34th Street post office and we chose two letters.  One was from a teenage boy asking for a Strawberry Shortcake doll for his little sister and the other was from a new mother asking for infant clothes for a newborn.  Sweet M didn't quite understand what these letters were, or why we were shopping for stuff for other people \u2014 people that we didn't know.  I explained that Santa needs helpers because there are lots of kids in the world and only one Santa, but that didn't sink in for quite some time.  For Sweet M, who does genuinely have a sweetness and kindness of spirit, imagining the needs of others is still what her teachers would call \"emerging.\"When we finished her 2008 letter to Santa, Sweet M eagerly addressed the envelope \u2014 to \"Santa, North Pole\" \u2014 and I dropped in the mail that evening.  I know it will wind up at the post office on 34th Street, and imagine that some adult like me will read it, and likely think:  \"Wow, what a materialistic spoiled brat\" rather than, \"Oh, a child on the spectrum with an emerging sense of empathy and compassion and a passion for the concrete world of things.\"What Sweet M has taught me today is that at autism's edges empathy is a road that has to be paved in two directions. We'll head back to Operation Santa next week \u2014 they open on December 2nd! \u2014 and we'll hope to see you there.Sweet M's drawing for Santa.Technorati Tags: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022 speech-language disorders  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   family life  \u2022    Christmas  \u2022    autistic girls  \u2022  Operation Santa\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/10/whats-not-to-like.html", "http://www.operationlettertosanta.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/ages-3-and-up-or-way-too-many-toys.html", "title": "\n\"Ages 3 and Up\" \u2014 Or Way Too Many Toys\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, March 14, 2009", "body": "\nWhen I first wandered into the autism blogosphere one autumn day some three years ago, I was struggling mightily.  Sweet M's school had told me that I should look for another school: that she was not learning to read and might not learn to read more than the most rudimentary of texts, that her meltdowns were too disruptive, and that we should be looking for another school because she needed more than they could provide.Autism was the A-word -- not because of an aversion on our part (though admittedly in the earliest days of early intervention we found the possibility of such a diagnosis daunting) --  but avoided because of the ambiguity of her diagnoses.  Beyond that, little M would continue to have more educational opportunities if she did not have an autism spectrum diagnosis.  (Yes, sad but true, even now, even in the 21st century in the grandest city in the nation.) Our goal was to keep her school placement until and unless we found a more suitable setting for our sweet girl.  So out came Autism's Edges, with autism right out front but with our names changed to protect the guilty, the innocent, and those who rapid-cycled between the poles of hero and villain.Since then lots of things have changed, not just hero-villain reversals and narrative whiplash, but other everyday things that matter enormously.  Perhaps the biggest change of all: Sweet M is in fifth grade and she is reading at a fifth grade level.  The fact that she is reading is nothing short of a triumph -- her personal triumph of turning perseverative behavior into perseverance, but also a professional accomplishment for the teachers, therapists, and doctors who have worked with her, and a hard-won parental victory for us.  Hooray.  She no longer has the meltdowns that frightened her teachers, her peers, and her father and I.  And she is no longer a little kid, but is instead poised on the edge of adolescence as her hormones race to carve a waist, fill out curves, and replace the sweetness of childhood with the richness of puberty.Amidst the changes, much has stayed the same: Sweet M is still at the same private special education school for kids with language-based learning disabilities (but that claims that it does not typically serve children with autism).  And the school would still like us to find her a new school, if there were a more appropriate placement. Sweet M continues to struggle with expressive and receptive language, although now her vocabulary is exploding as she can add words through the visual channel of reading (as one autism reading specialist suggested would happen).  She still has troubles with peer relationships; her auditory processing gap of several seconds makes the back and forth chatter that is typical for girls her age all but impossible.Of all these changes, the one that is most important for this blog is that Sweet M can now read.  Last night as I was answering an email, she sat and read over my shoulder.  Her privacy -- so precious to anyone, but especially to those poised on the edge of puberty -- has become an expanding constraint on my writing here and so I have written less, and less, and less even as more and more has been happening in our lives.  In some ways we may be aging out of this blog, though not out of our lives with a girl at autism's edges.Over the next couple of days or weeks or even months, I will be looking back over this blog, and thinking about where to go from here, not only for the blog, but for our family.  Should this blog continue as it has been -- with the protracted stops and starts of late? Probably not. Perhaps it should it take it cues from Sweet M:  she has blossomed and perhaps the blog should grow in some new direction? And finally should we at last capitulate and move Sweet M to a school for kids diagnosed with autism (because, her school says, it would be easier for her there), or should we insist on keeping her spot at her school because it is the least restrictive setting in which she can learn?This spring we'll ponder the question of aging out.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2009/03/aging-out.html", "title": "\nAging Out?\n"},

If you don\u2019t die of heart disease you die of something else . . .                \u2014 Steven B. Tamarin, M.D.               January 29, 2008 2:05 am      Link  It seems as though I have entered into the autumn of eulogies.  Another great one has passed away, and this time another one who has cared for me, for my family, and for hundreds in the city of New York.Steven Tamarin was among the last of what now seems to be literally a dying breed, a family doctor.  Sometimes wary of new medical panaceas, he'd posted the comment above on the New York Times Wellness blog earlier this year, characteristically funny and somehow eerily prescient.Steve, or Dr. T as we sometimes called him, first treated me when I was in my twenties, just back from living in Japan for two years, nearly penniless and without a job or health insurance.  I'd come to see him when friends who'd traveled to Central America on aid work recommended him -- I think they'd traveled there together.  Despite his Fifth Avenue office he'd said Just pay me $10 when you can.  Really, I'd asked.  Sure he said.  You don't have insurance, other people do, so pay me what you can when you can.  That's how we do socialism in this country.  It doesn't work well, but that's how we do it.  Later he'd move his office to a somewhat more modest, some might say shabbier, space on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.Steve was my doctor for more than two decades, my husband's doctor since we first met, Sweet M's doctor in the first weeks of her life.  He was there at the hospital when Sweet M was born.  He was the one who caught the \"click\" in her hip that presaged hip dysplasia and so saved her from future surgery.  He was the one who sent us off to the \"lactation consultants\" when she lost 20% of her weight in the first week of life, uninterested as she was in nursing.  He was the one I went to when there was the first intimations of Sweet M's developmental issues, and he sent us off to one of the finest developmental psychiatrists in the city -- someone who was an old and dear friend of his.  He was the one I sought out in the heartbreaking summer of 2002, when our worlds were falling apart in the wake of 9/11, our businesses imploding and finances collapsing, and our nerves worn raw with the progression of Sweet M's escalating tantrums and preoccupations.  That summer, frayed as I was, he was the doctor who told me that it would be better for me to go on vacation than to check myself into Bellevue.  When I was seized with pain two summers ago, he was the one who found me the most spectacular surgeon.  Year in and year out he was listed among the best doctors in New York in New York Magazine's annual doctor Oscars, and yet he continued to run a practice that cared for everyday New Yorkers, refusing to become a boutique practice that catered only to Manhattan's elite who can pay everything out of pocket.I remember one appointment in particular, when Sweet M's father and I were trying to conceive \u2014 a project that took us so long that technically it qualified as infertility. I'd gone to see Steve very late in the day.  He was so often at his office late because he always ran over time with his patients.  Frankly, an appointment at his office was often trying because he was seldom on schedule in those years.  The practice only began to run on schedule much later when he hired a wonderful nurse practitioner called Annie to keep him on track and manage the overflow.  That evening his office was quiet, dusty and disordered  because he was renovating.He sat at his big oak desk and I sat in the patient's chair and I said Wow, Steve, you're renovating.  And then, to my surprise, for just a moment our roles shifted to the story of his troubles.  He told me that he had to do something: that he spent so much time dealing with getting insurance companies to pay, and then often not succeeding, or being paid for just a fraction of his time, that even he was in dire financial straits.  He had to do something: the choices seemed clear.  He could leave his private practice and go on staff full-time at the hospital where he also worked.  Or he could rent out a part of the space to another practice and get a better office manager.  He wasn't willing to stop accepting insurance, so he was renovating. I was reading Marx for my graduate work and we talked briefly about how the work of care becomes increasingly expensive relative to the production of things because, no matter how one tries, one cannot mass-produce one-to-one attention.  We talked about the folly of healthcare for profit, we talked about the emergence of (mis)managed care.And then with just a moment's pause we shifted back to our patient-doctor roles and talked about infertility.  I said I did not want the high-tech treatments that I'd watched my friends suffer through \u2014 that I wanted to conceive or else just not conceive.  He smiled with what I can only describe as earnest mischief and said I have just the thing for you.  He swiveled around in his chair and started digging around in the credenza of his desk, heaped as it was with charts, files, bills, what-not.\"Here,\" he said triumphantly.  He pulled out a small pink cardboard calendar . . . an ovulation calendar.  \"This,\" he continued with a sparkle, \"is my magic fertility calendar.  I don't know how it works, but every woman I give this calendar to conceives within months. Just mark down the beginning of your cycle and have lots of sex, and you'll see.  It shouldn't work.  But it does.  It's magic.\"I was meant to see Steve this morning at 9 am, for my annual checkup.  We autism moms are notorious for not taking care of ourselves, and I am no different.  I was going to see him because I am feeling the need to start taking better care of myself if I'm going to last long enough to launch my Sweet M to some sort of self-sufficiency.  Since she's developmentally delayed, I'm figuring she'll need a couple of extra years for her launch, probably another five or ten extra years, so I'd better make every effort to be around for another twenty.Steve's receptionist called yesterday to say that they'd canceled the appointments for today. When I said, Okay, so let's reschedule, she put Blossom, the office manager, on the line to share the news that Steve died in his sleep over the weekend.Part of me has the heartbreaking and heartbroken feeling that Steve died too soon, died of caring too much in a world where caring less has become the only way to survive. Part of me thinks that the pressures of running a private practice under managed care were just simply crushing.  But what I know for sure is that with his passing, some of the magic is gone.Technorati Tags: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022 speech-language disorders  \u2022 autistic girls  \u2022  Steven Tamarin, M.D.  \u2022  obituary \u2022  unspeakable sadness \u2022 mourning\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JmcBVVIxUyE/STXOucyPW0I/AAAAAAAAAVE/hCZP2Fr617E/s1600-h/IMG_2258.JPG", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/will-cholesterol-pills-save-your-life/?scp=3&sq=steven%20tamarin&st=cse#comment-22423"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2008/12/autumn-of-eulogies-steven-tamarin-md.html", "title": "\nAn Autumn of Eulogies: Steven Tamarin, M.D.\n"},

There had been some tears, and there was the return to the image of the solitary flower, but she was mostly buoyant and enthusiastic, especially about the upcoming school dance and planning her birthday party.She was handling the two hours of homework each night.  Yes, that was \"two hours,\" not a typo.  (And it's not just two hours for her . . . the kids are expected to do two hours of homework after an eight-hour day.)She was suiting up in her sweats at home on the mornings when gym was the first activity of the day and participating in the field-day-like activities at a track by the river.She was tolerating the fact that now they have just a 15 minute recess with no other breaks.She was bewildered that library \u2014 her favorite thing \u2014 was no longer part of her schedule, but we'd started going to the local book store each weekend to give her the \"book browsing\" feeling that she seems to love.She was managing the transitions of going from classroom to classroom as they do in a schedule that reproduces the model of the typical middle-school.And she'd even gone out with her classmates on the out-to-lunch day that her school starts in middle school, though she'd stuck with eating her lunch from home.Overall, she'd been keeping it together pretty well, albeit with some tears here and there.But the other night, the night when she'd wished to take out the ancient Greeks so as to nip in the bud the whole idea of school and gymnasium, she told me, voice cracking, heart breaking, what was troubling her so much . . .\"I can't believe it.  They're going to grade our art,\"  she sobbed, voice shaking and tears streaming down her face.  \"How can they grade our art? Art is not for grading, art is for self-expression.\"She spoke slowly and struggled for the language to say this, as this is not something that we've ever discussed. But she had the idea fully-formed and articulated her dismay and disbelief, her sense of injustice, of something utterly wrong in her world.She seemed to have the sense that they would be grading her very self.I told her that I agreed with her completely \u2014 that art is for self-expression \u2014 but also that since she is such a good artist that she doesn't need to worry at all about her grades in art.This seemed to be only a modest consolation.For her, it seems to be the principle of the matter.Amidst all of this bewilderment, her artwork has returned to the motif of the solitary blossom on a landscape.

{"date": "Monday, January 18, 2010", "body": "\nChange comes fast and slow at Autism's Edges, which might also be known as PDD-NOS-Ville, or Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder Central. Sometimes it seems that things change overnight, and other times it seems to be an endless slog through language development, social skills faux pas, and battles for a free and appropriate public education.Yesterday was a \"change is on the way day.\"Lately Sweet M has been reading the Scholastic Children's Dictionary that she got for Christmas last year. Reading the dictionary was her idea.  Two months back she announced that she wanted to improve her vocabulary and asked  if I knew where the dictionary had gone. I dug it off one of our overpacked book shelves and she started to read one or two pages each night, sometimes commenting on the words.  Last night she said \"Hey, did you know that \"barrio\" is a name for neighborhood in Spanish?\"  She's in the B's now.Just before settling down to read last night, Sweet M said, \"Hey M, I've got three questions for you?\"\"Okay, let's hear 'em.\"\"What does plague mean? Why is H1N1 so bad? How did learning disabilities begin?\"Cartoon thought bubble over my head would have been reading \u2014 \"Whoo-hoo . . . three questions in a row!\"Okay. I know. These are typically developing four- or five-year-old questions.  A what question. A why question.  A how question.But still -- questions!  And three of them right in a row.  Do you remember when she couldn't follow three-stage directions?  I do.  I remember it in wrenching detail.So I answered her questions.  I answered them like I would have answered them for a really advanced five-year-old. The plague question and the H1N1 answers weren't very involved, so I won't bore you with the answers at this point.  But the learning disabilities question seemed really important, for all kinds of reasons.This is what I said:\"Many years ago people had the mistaken idea that some people were smart and other people were stupid and some were in-between smart and stupid or average.  Then scientists (Sweet M loves scientists and thinks they are the highest authority on the planet) discovered that all people learn in different ways.  And some people, like you, learn differently than the majority of people.  You go to a school for kids with learning disabilties.  You have a different way of learning or a learning disability.\"\"Let me guess:  I can't hear.\"\"Well, actually you can hear fine.  You have excellent hearing.  But when the sounds go into your brain, your brain has a tough time figuring out what they all mean.  So it has been hard for you to learn from just listening.  You like pictures. But other people are different.  Take me for example \u2014 I like talking.  You know I can just blah-da-de-blah-da-de-blah . . . \".\"Yeah, like when you're on the phone.  You don't stop til you hang up.\"\"Yup exactly. I don't stop 'til I hang up.\"And so change is coming to Autism's Edges.  We are all developing, bit by bit, and also all at once.

So what sort of pilgrimage would take me to Plymouth?   What you might expect at autism's edges: scaffolding Sweet M on her journey.Her class was setting out on a three-day field trip to visit the sites \u2014 the replica of the Mayflower in the harbor, the Plimouth plantation, and the grist mill that ground grain for the pilgrims in the years after their arrival.  And there were concerns about how she'd handle the three days, two nights away field trip. Last year's trip to a nature preserve had gone okay \u2014 she was with her aide \u2014 but still there'd been plenty of tears and homesickness. Since Sweet M no longer has that wonderful one-on-one who helped her last year\u2014just another bit of fallout from the state's budgetary shortfalls \u2014 her father and I went as her shadows. Our goal was to be neither seen nor heard: but just to be nearby in case we were needed.  For Sweet M's amusement we called this Operation Secret Parents.   Some might call this Operation Helicopter Parents, but I suspect that anyone who would think that has never parented a child on the spectrum.  We'd rather scaffold and buttress than pick up the pieces if something goes horribly wrong.Initially little M thought she'd want to see us on the morning of the second day, but the morning came and went without a call from her teacher, so we settled into touring the sites (on the opposite itinerary from her class, avoiding them at every turn) and visiting with some old friends whom we ran into near the town's grocery store, with me taking time out to grade some papers and write a new syllabus for the spring semester.By the end of the second day, we'd heard nothing from Sweet M and when the suspense was just too much, we spoke with the principal who told us all was well.  One of Sweet M's roommates had been homesick and wanted to call her mom, and M had said, \"Why would you want to call your mom -- you're just going to see her tomorrow.\" Easy for her to say with her own mom just two floors away!But still, this is is progress. Scaffolded, buttressed progress.  Perhaps over weaning, we sometimes think. But then we have no idea what the trip would have looked like if she'd gone on her own too soon for any reasonable level of comfort. Next time she'll no doubt voyage solo.So we have some progress of the pilgrim-y type: something for which we're so very thankful.An appropriate street sign from Plymouth.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2009/11/pilgrims-progress.html", "title": "\nPilgrim's Progress\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 19, 2009", "body": "\nOn Saturday we went to a potluck barbecue at the Woodstock home of a friend who is an advocate, educator and activist and the mother of a teenager on the spectrum.  All sorts of families with kids on the spectrum were there and I was filled with a feeling \u2014 such a very rare and delicious feeling \u2014 peace and acceptance.The last time I had such a feeling was at the autism and advocacy conference organized by Jim Fisher at Fordham University.  But this time was even better because both Sweet M and her father were along for the fun.  Our entire family was filled with a sense of ease and peace.Everyone at the potluck had been through the sorts of things we've been through with psychiatric and educational professionals, everyone had struggled to find appropriate educational settings, and everyone adored and supported their quirky, autie kids.When Sweet M had enough interaction \u2014 playing with foam-covered swords and running across a dandelion-feathered lawn \u2014 she retired to our friend's bedroom and watched some television.  She was joined by a boy about her age and when I peeked in on them, Sweet M and he were talking about their favorite programs.Later on that evening Sweet M told me, \"You know that boy I was talking to?\"\"Yes,\" I said.\"He told me he likes Arthur . . . but he doesn't tell his friends so they won't make fun of him.\"Sweet M likes Arthur, too.She's an Arthur-and-Dora-loving girl in a Hannah Montana world.And she'd talked with someone who has the same \"problem.\"Her tastes in television, books, and toys mark her as developmentally-different.  The delighted way that she says, \"Isn't he a cutie-wootie?\" marks her as developmentally different.  Even the high pitch of her voice, according to her one-on-one, marks her as developmentally different.But on this one Saturday afternoon, none of that mattered as we were not encumbered by neurotypical benchmarks.  On Saturday, she could be herself and be great.At another point in the afternoon, our friend and a young woman on the spectrum were heading off to take a ride in our friend's convertible.  The young woman, for whom it seemed that speaking was not the easiest of things, turned to me and asked if Sweet M would want to go with them. Someone for whom talking is difficult took the time to talk \u2014 in order to reach out to Sweet M.I asked Sweet M if she'd want to go in a car with no roof and feel the wind in her hair, and she jumped up from the television in a burst of enthusiasm \u2014 sure I'd want to do that!Later when I asked M about the ride she said:  \"It was so great . . . it felt like something . . . it felt like something like freedom.\"Another guest at the party \u2014 an older teenager \u2014 had brought along a turntable, speakers, and a crate of old vinyl LPs.  One of the LPs was an old Grateful Dead album that I hadn't heard since sometime in 1977, back in a time and place when listening to the Grateful Dead was cool.  When \"Uncle John's Band\" filled the yard with the Dead's acoustic blue grass and rock blend, I was filled with happy sadness:Well the first days are the hardest days,Don't you worry any more, 'Cause when life looks like easyStreet, there is danger at your door.Think this through with me, let me know your mind.Whoa - oh, what I want to know, is are you kind?What I've learned at autism's edges: kind is better than cool.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 09, 2010", "body": "\nWe are not really a once-upon-a-time sort of family.\n\nI write non-fiction.  The sweet girl reads the dictionary as her bedtime reading.  And I can't remember the last time her father read a novel.\n\nAnd, of course, for the most part, magic potents have not worked out for us.  Dragons continue to breathe fire.  Damsels in distress are still, much of the time, locked in silent castles.  (Okay, forgive the fortress metaphor\u2014I know it's a bit worn from decades of abuse and over use, but we still have many a silent and reclusive day over here at Autism's Edges so it still sometimes seems apt.)\nWe have worked with potents like Paxil, and magic powders like probiotics.  We've had raging meltdowns and fiery words with airport security, medical professionals and special educators, not to mention complete strangers.  And we still have a girl who is remote much of the time and with most of the people in her world.\nAnd we're thirteen years into this now.  Yes, we're officially thirteen years into this journey as of tomorrow at 6:04 pm when the sweet girl officially becomes a teenager.  \nUnlike other years, this year, for the first time ever, we are not having a big party.  We are not inviting all the kids in her grade.  Or our friends and colleagues from New Jersey with their lovely boy Charlie.  Or kids from our neighborhood.  No bowling alleys, no Mars 2012 theme restaurant, no rock climbing or gymnastics.  I have mixed feelings about the change.  \n\nThese big parties are just a bit too young for a teenager.  Now the kids at school are having smaller, exclusive events, sometimes even dates, with their closest friends and sometimes boyfriends.\nAnd that's the hitch.  The sweet girl doesn't yet have any close or closest friends.  She believes she has friends.  She thinks of her classmates as friends.  She does not yet seem to understand that friendly and friend are part of a continuum.  She is herself increasingly friendly, but she remains locked out of the rush of girlish chatter that marks adolescence and seals the bonds of BFFs.   There is just too much talky-talking for the girl.\nYet ironically, in honor of this auspicious birthday, the entry into that portal to adulthood, the sweet girl wants four things: a cell phone, real jewelry, keys to our apartment, and a dog (or a chinchilla, since they have the softest fur ever, an observation she made after petting one at the pet store near her school.)  All the kids in her class have cellphones now.  One of the girls wears only real gems.  Some of them get to walk home on their own and let themselves into their apartments.  And most of them have some sort of pet.  So these are more than age-appropriate gifts.  They feel like marks of arrival.\nI was trying to figure out how to swing all of this.  I had debated whether to upgrade my phone and give her my hand-me-down.  We talked about whether she would want a 3G or a 4G.  She could tell I was figuring out how we were going to swing this expense -- something of a stretch for us these days.  \nThen last Saturday the sweet girl said to me: \"Hey M, I have an idea.  Why don't we ask Santa for a cellphone for Christmas?  Then you won't have to spend any money!  Remember he brought you that cool computer writing pad two years ago.

{"date": "Saturday, April 25, 2009", "body": "\nSome of you who've been reading this blog for a while know that I can be given to grumbling, griping, kvetching -- as we say in the fair city we've made home.So you would not have been surprised to have heard me muttering about the forty term papers that I was marking for one of the classes I teach at a nearby private university.  On the whole they were a disappointing stack of documents.  The assignment I'd made was probably too difficult -- too open ended and requiring that the students use their skills of analysis (where present) with their skills of imagination.Because there was an uneasy fit between the assignment and their skill level, marking them was onerous.  It took me nearly an hour per paper, and I could have easily spent longer.  As I was slogging through the papers I'd grumble. They can't write, I'd say.  Did they ever take a comp class? I'd mutter.  Do they understand that papers need to have a thesis?  In the midst of my mutterings, Sweet M turned to me with a tone that filled with both innocence and earnestness and said, \"You know they're doing the best they can to graduate.\"Like she has been.  All year.  Closing a nearly two-year gap in reading.  Trying to catch up in math because the language of computation eludes her even when the arithmetic itself does not.  Studying ancient Aztec and Mayan cultures because they are part of the New York State social studies curriculum when she is still struggling to completely understand the linear qualities of time.  (How do you explain the idea of 100 B.C. and 100 A.D. to someone whose sense of temporality has only recently emerged?)She's been working so hard that she is often worn out.  She's not in the zone (of proximal development).  Instead she's often struggling to keep her head above the rising conceptual water.  Her extraordinary one-on-one support person does everything she can to close the developmental and conceptual gaps -- to throw her conceptual inner tubes and flotation devices and to otherwise shore up her understandings.  Her father and I do hours of remedial homework with her.  And still Sweet M's brain keeps developing along its own mysterious timetable, not exactly in synchronized swimming with developmental norms.And so I wondered yesterday: Are we working too hard?  Are our goals and expectations too high?  Are we giving our dear girl a life without balance -- a life where work consumes all else?In the midst of this year of hard work, Sweet M started singing in the shower at night.  She makes up very short little chants and sings them with a wonderful off-key atonality.  Most of the year they've been about time:  \"Tomorrow is Friday, tomorrow is FRI-day.  Tomorrow is Friday, hey hey hey hey hey.  There's just one day of school left . . . there's just one day of school left . . .  There's just one day of school left, hey hey hey hey hey.\"  She makes up different ones for each day of the week -- I suppose that she is anchoring the days of the week and the shape of the calendar into her lived experience.Last night she made up a new tune.  She was belting out a single line \"Be yourself and you'll be great, be yourself and you'll be great.  Be yourself and you'll be great, hey hey hey hey hey.\"When she was drying her hair I asked her where she'd heard that song.  She said, \"Oh that's one of my own makeups.\"Makeups -- so many things in so many different contexts.  To do yourself up and to do yourself over, as in making yourself presentable to the world.  To do something you missed, as in makeup exams.  To make up, as in to restore harmony to a relationship.  And to make up, as in invent something new, never before imagined.I'm so much more interested in harmony and invention than in putting on a good face and catching up.How can we help her to be herself so she'll be (and keep being) great?Do we keep up the pace -- pushing her (and ourselves) hard to meet external timelines for her education -- or do we drop off the neurotypical educational course?  Do we keep her at her school or do we look for an easier place for her to be? We keep making things up as we go along, but I find myself wondering if there couldn't be a better way.  I find myself wondering how long we can make this improvisation work . . .\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JmcBVVIxUyE/SfNOzufIFRI/AAAAAAAAAWk/BH_laGNvcFY/s1600-h/IMG_7960.JPG"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2009/04/making-it-up-as-we-go-along.html", "title": "\nMaking It Up as We Go Along\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 11, 2009", "body": "\nAbout three months ago Sweet M was watching television with a headset on and she turned to me and said, \"Hey M___, have you ever heard of a p-alarm?\"I said, \"A p-alarm . . . not sure . . . what do you mean?\"\"You know,\" she said, \"An alarm that helps kids who have my embarrassing problem?\"\"Oh, a pee-alarm,\" I said.  \"Yes, I've heard of a pee-alarm.  How did you hear about a pee-alarm?\"\"I saw it on TV.\"\"Cool.\"\"Can we get a pee-alarm?\"\"Sure honey, if you want one, we'll get one.\"\"Whoo-hoo,\" she hollered, \"no more diapies!!!\"Diapies, of course, was our baby talk for the night time pull-ups that she went back to after we spent a year in an abortive attempt at night time continence that she was then incapable of.  That was a miserable year.  With flawed advice from a well-intentioned friend and our visions of upcoming sleep-overs and cute nightgowns and all of that, we pushed and pulled and suffered . . . loads of laundry, interrupted sleep, and her own disappointment despite our efforts to be supportive.  I wrote about this painful interlude several years ago.Once we corrected our own efforts -- once we stopped trying to push Sweet M to be in a place that she wasn't developmentally ready to be -- we swore that we would never again push her around her enuresis.  Rather, we vowed to remain vigilent for signs that she was ready to try again.  Her doctor had even told me about the bedwetting alarm system about two years ago, but I wanted a sign from Sweet M.  Her \"whoo-hoo, no more diapies\" was loud and clear.We got the night-time wetness alarm from the bedwetting store online, and she's now almost always dry, except on nights when she sleeps too deeply from allergy medication and forgets to get up.Our job was less one of discipline than one of cultivation.  The metaphor of garden and cultivation is fairly well inscribed in our language and lives . . . kindergarten, the children's garden, where virtue is cultivated and wickedness weeded out.This is Sweet M's fire escape garden.  This year she selected all the plants herself, and made sure they made it into pots large enough for their development, except perhaps in the case of the \"hen and chick\" succulent ground cover that is searching for some place to put down roots.  She waters the plants daily, to the occasional dismay of the ground floor neighbors.  She makes her mulches of old leaves. She watches over her work. She harvests the chives for stir-fries and omelets.She understands that she can't push the plants to grow faster, or force them into bloom.  She just waters them, and gives them mulch and fertilizer, and waits for things to unfold.I hope I can emulate her wisdom as I think about where she will go to school next year.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bedwettingstore.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-cultivation.html", "title": "\nOn Cultivation\n"},

I have very mixed feelings about blogging under a nom-de-net.At one level, I would like everyone I know in every sector of our lives to know the particulars of our daily lives.  I want them to know about the issues with sounds, and foods, and various fears and preoccupations.  I want them to know about the meltdowns we all weathered.  I want them to know what a leap of faith it is to send your child off to school every day, year in and year out, knowing that she does not have enough language to report on her day.      I want them to know about why money is often tight since one of us has opted out of the labor market to remain available for the emergency school pick-ups and the trips to therapy appointments.  I want everyone to know about the extraordinary expenses of additional neuropsychological testing and speech-language therapy services that are sometimes partially covered by insurance, but usually are not.I want them to think about the work hours lost in endless school site visits in search of a more appropriate setting. I'd like them to understand the particular toll it takes to go to battle with the school and the school district at an IEP meeting.  I want them to know about the costly conversations with attorneys who can sometimes be as concerned with maintaining their good standing with the school district and with the private schools where placements can be made as they are with protecting any one child's interests.      I want them to know about that special anguish of having others see your child as a problem, as a set of pathologies. And the reciprocal difficulty of others seeing you, the parent, as the problem, because you are (pick one): too indulgent, too strict, too attached, too cold, or \u2014 one of my personal favorites \u2014 in denial.     I want to stand up and say, Yes, that's us. That's our life. This is how we spend our time. This is what we do. Welcome \u2014 welcome \u2014 to our world.      And I want them to know the bigger (and better) story as well, the upside, the good life that friends Kristina Chew and MOM-NOS and This Mom all cultivate.  I want everyone to know about those moments when the supposedly impaired girl masters something that others had told you would never be possible. I want every one to know about the triumph of the dry bed. The first overnight away. The learning to read. The extraordinary artworks. The self-advocacy. The emerging womanhood. The exploding vocabulary.  And the day that the girl who was silent steps up to the microphone.  I want everyone I've ever known and everyone I'll ever meet and everyone else as well to know about how the liability of perseveration has given way to the asset of perserverance.    The publication of Gravity Pulls You In raised the ante on the anonymity that many of us who blog about parenting children on or near the autism spectrum have held dear.

{"date": "Friday, February 19, 2010", "body": "\nLast month Sweet M was invited to the Bat Mitzvah of one of her schoolmates. Bat Mitzvahs can be notably gala affairs as the Jewish tradition is especially excellent at honoring the passage of their young people into early adulthood.This particular celebration promised to be an exceptionally special evening since the family honoring their daughter is among New York City's most affluent and privileged.  Their names would be recognizable to readers of the gossip columns.  A book on the shelves of our local public library chronicles the story of the Bat Mitzvah girl's great-grandfather and his remarkable business acumen.When the invitation arrived, I wondered what to do.  Sweet M emphatically wanted to attend.  This would be the highlight on the social calendar of the middle school girls.  But the invitation was addressed to Sweet M, not to us as a family.  She was invited, parents were not.Sweet M is twelve \u2014 old enough for a neurotypical child to be dropped off at a party with little or no concern.  But she is not neurotypical, however much \"progress\" she has made toward a normative presentation of self.I mulled the possibilities.  If she went alone and something set her off \u2014 a smell, a gesture, the noise \u2014 then it could be a very public social catastrophe.  It could spoil the event for everyone, not least of all Sweet M.  And given the circumstances it could end up on Page Six of the New York Post.If she didn't go at all, she would be disappointed and would feel left out.  She would miss an opportunity, one that is only available to her by the demographic fiat of her school placement.And if she went with me or her father as a shadow, well, that would be safer, but not very cool for a middle school kid.Over the course of three weeks I considered the options, and finally decided, on the last day to RSVP, to call the  hosts to explain that Sweet M would like to come, but that she would need one of her parents to shadow her.  To give you a sense of what we're talking about here, when I called I did not speak to the Bat Mitzvah girl's mother \u2014 I spoke with their social secretary. She was wonderfully gracious, a plan was made, Sweet M organized a beautiful outfit for herself, and off we went to the event, me in black, in the background, a shadow, in tow.The party took place at one of New York's elite cultural institutions, where an auditorium and three galleries accommodated the festivities.  You can imagine the background:  sweeping marble staircases, countless crystal chandeliers, and priceless artworks on every wall.  Lavish floral sculptures, some more than the height of an average room, set the stage.  Fresh sushi and other delicacies were prepared by a team of chefs.  An assembly of party entertainers made miniature artworks, provided individual psychic readings, and instant \"life-stories\" for the amusement of children and adults alike. A special checkered dance floor for the kids was rolled out across one gallery. Dozens of museum guards stood stationed in front of each 19th-century masterpiece to ensure that no swirling preteen careened into a Hudson River School landscape.The part of me that wishes for my own child to have an extended community and beautiful f\u00eate to celebrate her ascendancy to young adulthood experienced a twinge of envy, as might be predicted.  The part of me that is interested only in the beauty of the moment was absolutely enchanted by the elegance of the occasion.  There was no denying the sheer artistry of the event itself.  And the part of me that retains a particular class ressentiment found the extravagance of such an event disturbing.But I don't think any of this was on Sweet M's mind.  She was just having a good time, dancing, looking all around, drinking lots of ginger ale and Coca Cola.When the time for additional celebratory speeches honoring the Bat Mitzvah girl came, the children and adults gathered in another of the galleries.  Sweet M, who'd been nearby, left me at the rear of the gallery to join her peers who were sitting on the floor at the center of the room, near the microphone and the master of ceremonies.  One by one the siblings of the Bat Mitzvah girl gave delightful, loving speeches about their sister.  Then the MC asked if any of the Bat Mitzvah girl's classmates would like to say a few words.From far away, across the room packed with nearly 300 people, I could not see her, but I could hear the familiar sound of a throat clearing.\"Umph humph, I'd like to say a few words.\"It was Sweet M, using the prosody of a television announcer.My heart stopped. What was she going to do?  I had been shadowing her well all evening, and all had gone well, but at this point I was across the room with dozens of people between us.She got up, took the microphone, held it in both hands, and looked straight at the Bat Mitzvah girl.\"Rachel,\" she said, pausing for a moment, \"You give one great party.\"Everyone in the room burst out laughing, not exactly with her, but a little bit with her, and a little bit at her.This was one of those Little Miss Sunshine moments.   Toothpaste is out of tube, horse is out of  barn, train has left station. Your kid is on the stage and there is nothing to do but wait and hope.  Given the occasion, prayers might also have been in order.Sweet M seemed unphased.  She surveyed the room, then looked back at the Bat Mitzvah girl, and continued.\"Rachel,\" she said, \"Now you are twelve.  Now you are a woman.  Happy birthday Rachel.  You are the best.\"Every word she spoke was slow, deliberate, and seemed to come from the very bottom of her heart.The room burst into applause and I sat on a couch near the back of the room, tears streaming down my face.The couple next to me asked if she was my daughter, and I said yes, and that she's on the autism spectrum -- that this was about as much as she'd said all day, let alone in front of a room of 300 people.They marveled with me, and the speeches and party continued.  When I caught up with Sweet M, I congratulated her on her speech.  \"Thanks,\" she said.  Other adults came along to congratulate her on her remarks as well.  Eventually we got our coats and grabbed a cab, and headed back downtown, to our real lives, before the carriage turned back into a pumpkin.\u2022   \u2022   \u2022In the cab I congratulated her again.\"M___\", I said, \"Your speech was beautiful.\"\"Thanks,\" she said, with evident satisfaction.\"I just have one question.\"\"What's that?\"\"Do you like Rachel? Are you two friends?\"Sweet M turned to look at me with preteen-are-you-kidding-me-exasperation, \"Mom, I don't even know Rachel.\"\"But then I'm puzzled.  You gave such a beautiful speech.  What possessed you to do that if you're not friends?\"\"Well,\" she said with a mischievous smile, \"Don't tell anyone, but I just wanted to hold the microphone.\"And there you have it.  That's my girl.  She may manage to look NT, but she's autie through and through.However old she gets, she's still my oddball pumpkin, the one who doesn't need a gilded carriage.  She'd be the priceless one I was standing by that evening, guarding against the possibility of a swirling social catastrophe.In the end though, she was on her own, at the center of her own world, her own gravity pulling us in.As usual, names are changed to protect the people we encounter in Sweet M's universe.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/02/turn-at-microphone.html", "title": "\nA Turn at the Microphone\n"},

Somehow it sounds wiser in the French:  Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la meme chose. \n\nBut whether it's my English cliche or the sweet girl's father's French cliche, it's still a cliche: true enough most of the time for neurotypicals that it was elevated to cliche status, but not quite so true for the sweet girl. \nFor her, the more things change, the more they changed. \nAnd one assumption holds:\nChange is bad. \nSeptember arrived and she went back to school.\n\nSame school, different grade.\n\nSame principal, different teachers.\n\nSame gym teacher, but different gym location.\n\nThe changes were hard enough \u2014 especially having gym inside instead of at the beautiful outdoor park by the river.\n\nAnd then there was the same old problem: everyone, everywhere, always always talking talking talking. \nAnd so the September back-to-school was filled with tears. A lot of tears. Not quite so many as last year, but still plenty.  Tears at home.  Tears at school.  \nAnd the question that she asked last year \u2014 \"Why can't kids just stay at home and learn?\" \u2014 was asked again, with new and more accurate language: \"Why can't I be home-schooled?\"\nWhen I told the sweet girl that home schooling isn't the answer, she asked if I would talk to her teachers to ask them to not talk so much.\n\nAnd so I did.  I met with the team.  In the second week of school. And most of them were wonderful, but one was not so much wonderful, and she wanted to know, \"Well if the language demands are too much now, how is she going to get along next year, and the year after, and in high school where the language just gets harder and harder?\"\n\nThis was a deep breathing moment for me. \n\"Great  question,\" I said, \"And I'd be happy to make a meeting with you to talk about that when we have an hour or more to think about it, but right now we only have 45 minutes together to come up with strategies for a girl who is weeping because the language demands and the transition back to school are hard for her.  I'd like to focus this meeting on strategies for this week and next week.\"\n\nSo it's back to school time.  And here we go again: back to defending our girl's right to reasonable accommodations and a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting.\n\nBack to pre-teaching and post-teaching every night and every morning to coach her on new language.\n\nBack to trying to figure out how to get over the social hurdles that continue to trip her up.\n\nBack to the same routine of trying to conform.  \nIt always strikes me as ironic that autistic people are labeled as inflexible when they are expected to adapt in an inflexible, even rigid, educational system.  Who/what is inflexible here?\n\nSometimes I feel I need a change, a real change, not something that is just the same old same old.\n\nI want a good school for my girl.  Maybe I even want to start a good school for my girl, and other kids like her.\nThat would be a change.  A real change. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JmcBVVIxUyE/TJZ00JOpGHI/AAAAAAAAAiI/FEQXySWQNew/s1600/IMG_6276.JPG"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-things-change.html", "title": "\nThe more things change . . .\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 10, 2010", "body": "\n\nLately at Autism's Edges I've been ruminating on how one thing leads to another in ways that we can't ever expect, let alone predict.  You start out headed one direction and you wind up somewhere altogether  different, and oftentimes infinitely more interesting than anything you  could have imagined on your own.\n\nExamples of this one-thing-leads-to-another principle permeate our lives . . . most recently the gift of Pok\u00e9mon statuette led to a fabulous play date for Sweet M and me.  An autism conference two years ago and a reading group friend lead to my current teaching job.  And the weekend before last a trip to the grocery store lead to a late afternoon kayak ride with the sweet girl on the Hudson River.\n\nTake the trip to the grocery store on the first weekend of August.  It was a beautiful day \u2014 warm, not hot \u2014 as the heatwave of July had given way to a pleasant 78 degrees with a cloudless sky.  The sweet girl and I set out to go to the grocery store . . .   we didn't have anything at home that would work for dinner  . . . but when we got to the cross street that leads to the Hudson River, I said, \"Oh, let's just go have a look at the river.  It's a beautiful day . . . let's check it out.\"\n\nSo we walked along Prince Street as it turns into Charleton and then wended our way up to the Houston Street crossing of the Westside Highway.  We rounded the bend of Pier 40 recreation area and walked along a nearly deserted dock where an enormous Norwegian cruise ship was headed down the river and out to sea.\n\nWhen we circled back around the dock, we came across a landing, filled with kayaks and people kayaking.  I thought, wow, someday we should do that -- that looks fun.  I thought about Jim and Charlie and their fabulous kayaking adventures along the Hudson and Jersey's waterways.\n\nI said, \"Hey M, do you want to go kayaking sometime?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Great, we'll do that sometime.\"\n\nAs we got closer I could see that there was no line.  And the people on the river seemed to be having a lot of fun.\n\nBut I didn't have my wallet with me. I'd walked out of the house with just a single twenty to pick up some dinner, so I figured we wouldn't be able to afford the rental.\n\nI asked the woman working at the landing how much it would be for half-an-hour and she said \"Nothing -- it's free.\"\n\n\"Free?!\" I exclaimed, \"Free in NYC?!?\"\n\nYes, the volunteer confirmed that it was free. Free thanks to the Downtown New York City Boathouse.\n\n\"But we don't have any sunscreen on,\" I said, equivocating.\n\n\"Oh, no problem\u2014we have loads of sunscreen,\" the volunteer said, pointing to a gallon jug with a pump nozzle on it.\n\n\"What about life jackets?\"\n\n\"Oh, we have those, too,\" she said, pointing to a long rack of life vests.\n\nSo I put away my excuses, along with my twenty dollar bill and my cell phone, which I stored in a locker \u2014 yes, they had lockers and locks, too.\n\nAnd the sweet girl and I headed out on our very first kayaking adventure.\n\nMan-o-man it was fun.

They're both quirky kids with PDD-NOS-ish profiles.\n\nWe arrived at Hank and Kate's apartment around 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  Sweet M and Hank wandered off to his room, and emerged about two hours later having watched Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, played a couple of videogames, and traded Pok\u00e9mon cards.  M was thrilled to have some French Pok\u00e9mon cards to add to her English collection.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate and I spent two hours catching up on all sorts of autism parenting and others news.  We had a glass of wine and some wasabi snack treats.  It was like having a normal life.  It felt exactly like having a normal life.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I'm not advocating normalism.

{"date": "Sunday, October 24, 2010", "body": "\n\nOn Saturday I heard Temple Grandin speak at the New York Chapter of the National Autism Association conference.  Grandin is an impressive speaker.  She stood at a podium in a packed school gymnasium for more than two hours offering advice and inspiration to parents and grandparents and teachers who were looking for answers.  She was wearing her trademark Western shirt, one with elaborate embroidery across the yoke, and kept the audience mesmerized with stories of cattle and ranchers, autism and learning, brain anomalies and neurological plasticity.  She attributed her own formidable public speaking skills to years of experience and practice, not to some innate talent or gift.\n\nI'd gone to Grandin's talk less for answers than for a strong dose of hope.  Two shots of hope, straight up, with a chaser of muted ambition.\n\nLast week we had the sweet girl's parent-teacher conference.  I had been looking forward to the parent-teacher conference.  After all, I'd seen the head teacher the week before and she had been raving about how wonderfully Sweet M has been doing -- how she's enjoying the reading for English class (a book about two boys with disabilities who team up to support each other) and about what an amazing time she'd had on the overnight field trip.\n\nBut as soon as we walked into the classroom, I could feel something wasn't right.  If we were about to get a terminal diagnosis with a one-month life expectancy the affect in the room would not have been more grave.\n\nThe homeroom teacher started off by saying that Sweet M is so organized, hardworking, and focused on succeeding with her studies.  That she is so eager to please -- such a great student.   That in reading that she has great decoding and fluency skills -- better than some of her classmates.  And that she is so far ahead in terms of her organizational skills that she's able to get herself packed up at the end of the day and get started on her homework while she is still at school.\n\nThe way that this information was conveyed -- rote and joyless without any details -- I could feel myself waiting for the \"but\"-- for the sucker punch.  It came quickly.\n\nThe trouble is, said the head teacher, that when she's doing her homework she asks them for homework help.\n\nAnd that's a problem because?\n\nBecause it's a busy, hectic time since we have to help the other kids get their backpacks ready and make sure they have their homework.\n\nThat's understandable.  So is the problem how she's asking?  Is she inappropriate . . .  insistent and demanding?\n\nNo, when we tell her that she has to wait she is okay with that, but she is anxious.\n\nSo what does the anxiety look like?\n\nWell, she jiggles her leg and her body gets tense.\n\nYes, we see her jiggle her leg when she's concentrating at home. Is there a problem with her jiggling her leg?\n\nWell, she's anxious. And we'd like her to be more independent with her homework.\n\nThis is the part where, if I were in a cartoon, the air bubble over my head would read \"WTF?\" Let me get this straight: she is organized, ready to go, working on her homework, asking you questions, compliant when you are unavailable, and that is a problem? The other kids can't get their backpacks organized to go home, but you need Sweet M to be more independent?  WTF?\n\nSo what was it they were saying?  She's too much work?  We can't figure out what to do?  She makes us feel like we're failing?\n\nWe like to team build with the school.  We like to coordinate our efforts, so we don't always say what we are thinking.  But really, WTF?\n\nAt the end of the conference, the assistant teacher who had sat throughout with arms folded across her chest and smirked her way through the conference said to the head teacher, \"Phew, only two more [parent conferences] to go.\"  While we were in the room.  Standing right there. She said this when we were right there.\n\nThe next day I spoke with the principal.  She told me that the teachers had already told her that the conference had not gone well.  Well, they got that right. We can definitely agree about that, which is a place to start.\n\nSo what were these educators trying (and failing) to communicate to us with all of this gravitas and hand wringing and the mysterious but incongruent claim that they want our girl to be more \"independent\"?\n\nThe principal said that apparently Sweet M isn't understanding what is going on in class.  After five minutes she is, in their words, lost -- completely spaced out.  Daydreaming.  In another world.  She doesn't understand what is going on in the class discussion.  And she doesn't look like she's paying attention.\n\nIn other words, she has limited auditory and linguistic attention.  This is not late-breaking news in the Vox household, so why the gravitas?  Why no problem solving?  Why no strategies from the reading specialist?  Why no ideas for interventions?  After years, nearly five years of writing this blog and dealing with these educators, I am so weary of the long faces and hand wringing, and the looks of pity that are sometimes peppered with glances of contempt when one is seen as the parent in denial -- the person pathetically grasping at unrealistic hopes for their child's future.  \nI have grown incredibly weary of Pervasive Hopelessness Syndrome-Not Otherwise Specified.  \nUnlike PDD-NOS, very little is known about Pervasive Hopelessness Syndrome, other than that it is highly contagious.  Although there is thought to be a genetic basis for PHS-NOS as there is a frequent co-morbidity of depressive disorders, most cases of PHS seem to be brought on environmental factors.  For those with a genetic risk, for example, with first degree relatives with a history of depression, exposure to educators who have thrown up their hands can be particularly dangerous.  The onset of the condition can be sudden, but there are antidotes available, including:inspiration from autism activists like Temple Grandin, Donna Williams, Valerie Paradiz,  or Daniel Tammet.\nhanging out, online or in-person, with parents of kids on the spectrum who haven't given up hope.  Here the list is awfully long, so I won't list them all.  If you've been reading this blog, you know who I've been reading over the years.\nmemoirs by the really pioneering parents of kids on the spectrum, like the late Clara Claiborne Park or Grandin's mother, Eustacia Cutler.\none's own experience -- knowing that with skilled instruction and interventions and loads of patience one's child does grow and change and learn and develop.\nBut this last antidote can be in short supply.  These experiences take time to develop.  It's easy to forget that five years back, back in November 2005 when I started this blog, that the reading specialists at M's school had told us that she was not learning to read, and that they did not expect that she would.\nSo last weekend, reeling from the debacle of the parent-teacher conference -- I went to see Temple Grandin and got one serious dose of hope.  For the moment I am immunized against this most recent contagion of PHS-NOS.   Now I have only to figure out how to stop the contagion at her school \u2014 how to get this posse of teachers to rally around my girl instead of circling their wagons and leaving her to the elements.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/10/pervasive-hopeless-syndrome-not.html", "title": "\nPervasive Hopeless Syndrome-Not Otherwise Specified\n"},

The one thing we wouldn't be able to photograph would be the extraordinary changes in her language development.She is striking up conversations with schoolmates.  \"Hey K, what are you doing for Mother's Day?\"  She is keeping a diary (more on this later).  She is reading two pages of the dictionary every night.  And, the part that amazes me the most is that she is talking in her sleep.

Our local store didn't have a locking diary that suited her, so we bought this one, with its beaded butterfly cover and heart-shaped keys, from an online retailer.In advance of getting the diary, but with the promise of the diary within her field of expectation, she began to say, somewhat repetitively, \"This time I'm going to get it right.\"\"I'll have a new diary.  And this time I'll get it right.\"About the third or fourth time that I heard her say that phrase, with its slightly odd prosody \u2014 a kind of caricature of determination with bonafide resolve at its core \u2014 I asked her what she meant.\"You know, I'll do it right.  I won't scribble like before.\"She has had other diaries.  And she would fill them with pre-writing \u2014 \"scribbling\" \u2014 or with drawings, or with stickers from her vast collection.  But she seemed to think that she'd missed the mark in the past.  She seems to have the idea that she has to use language to get it right.\"But that was the right thing to do when you did that before.\"\"Oh,\" she said, \"But this time I'll really get it right.\"Getting it right.  Really right.I know just what she means.  I often think, in terms of this blog, or other writing, or in teaching or parenting, \"maybe this time I'll get it right.\"Don't get me wrong.  I get enough of the things right enough of the time to get through my life more or less intact.  More or less okay.  With an occasional verifiable success.  And with quite a bit of fun.But reaching for something new, for something beyond one's current circumstances or skill set or horizon of experience often comes with that anxiety: can I get this right?  And that anxiety translates into something a bit like perseveration:  I'll get it right. I can do this thing.  I know I can do this thing.  I think I can.  I think I can.\"Thing\" can be anything: learn new software program, learn new data analysis method (things on my own agenda), develop working group, take care of health and fitness issues.  You can fill in your own [blank] thing to get right.  We've all got 'em.Motivational gurus and educational experts and video game designers all talk about being in the \"zone\" or \"the zone of proximal development\" \u2014 in that sweet spot where one is skilled and successful enough at a particular task to take on a new challenge that is precisely enough calibrated to allow for your development and thus not be frustrating.  When those conditions are met, we enjoy what we're doing, and we do get it right because the task is so finely aligned with our current skills that growth feels natural, inevitable, and usually even fun.  Failure is impossible.It's not so much that we've gotten it right, but that the conditions around us have been right to maximize our growth and minimize our frustration.This almost always happened when you play a video game more than once.  If you went back to the game, the designers got it right.  The game was calibrated to take you along a path of continuous development.  Aka it was fun.When does this happen in life?  Not usually in school when standardized tests create false benchmarks and hurdles, except when teachers design extraordinary differentiated instruction.  Not usually at work, unless one has extraordinary mentoring or a great deal of control over one's assignments.I want more of this in my life.  Don't you?The challenge is that want that \"got it right\" feeling, but I don't want to get it from a videogame.  I want that feeling about parenting, about teaching, about writing, about being in the complicated world that is not always (correction: replace with \"seldom\") calibrated to be a right fit for each of us.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/05/dear-diary-1-this-time-id-get-it-right.html", "title": "\nDear Diary #1: \"This time I'll get it right.\"\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 30, 2010", "body": "\nAlong with the arrival of the locking diary \u2014 Sweet M's put the heart-shaped key somewhere I'll never find it! \u2014 my own thoughts about what to share and what to hold back have returned in full force.  If she's trying to capture her thoughts under lock and key, how much of our life together should I be posting here?\n\nLast month Sweet M and a classmate had a play date and they each left the bookstore with a large stack of books.\n\nBoth girls got The Head-to-Toe Guide to You, a Scholastic Girls' Life book.  It's a good guide on questions that come up in that life course called \"Puberty 101.\"\n\nSweet M and I started reading it together.  We were only up to page 11 when this came up:  \n\nWhile seeing their \"little girl\" growing up may be event-worthy, you might need to remind relatives that you body is a private matter\u2014and updates about it don't belong on the family blog.  One embarrassed girl tells us \"My mom thinks it's perfectly OK to share my bra size with anyone.  She even wrote about it in our Christmas letter.\"We won't be sharing that info here, or anything remotely similar.  Still, the internet is an unusual and quickly changing site of narrative production that confounds the paper-bound rules of publication.\n\nLast month I came across a web-based artwork called We Feel Fine by Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar.  If you haven't seen it, go take a look.  It's a beautiful interface that mines data from thousands of blog and then provides an array of visualizations of the affective temperature from the posts it has scanned, tracked and coded.  The visualizations are dazzling.  The data-mining is a little scary.  Ultimately, the artwork can take you back to the original post from which an emotional term or phrased was culled.\n\nSo your blog post or mine can be pulled out of context (I think of my context as the posse of autism parents who blog about their lives, challenges, and victories) into a broader context or framework sorted simply by affective phrases.\n\nThe phrase might be \"I feel fine.\"  Or it could be \"I am feeling enraged\" or \"cheerless\" or \"depressed\" or \"delighted.\" And then it can appear sorted with hundreds of other similar words or phrases.  So any post you or I make that has the phrase \"I feel\" or \"I am feeling\" can become part of a massive data set for Harris and Kamvar's semantic web artwork.\n\nPart of me loves this\u2014the possibilities for visualizing our lives together becomes so rich.  And part of me is terrified of the implications.  What will the uses of this technology be?  How will our words be understood when they're pulled out of their original context?\n\nUnlike traditional social science research, where data are aggregated (lumped together)  and anonymity assured, in We Feel Fine the data are both aggregated, and also  easily disaggregated, thanks to the powerful new tools emerging to mine the semantic web.  Disaggregated means that the individual phrase or data points right back to its source: you or me on our blogs.\n\nNo one has the expectation that a blog post is a diary entry under lock and key.  That would be madness.  We all understand that a blog post is a publication with a reach that can extend beyond any print publication.\n\nBut I wonder (and I feel worried\u2014that's a phrase that Harris and Kamvar's bot scans for) about how these tools will pluck our language out of context for purposes we can't even begin to imagine.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of We Feel Fine: Worried: Murmurs, May 30, 2010\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wefeelfine.org/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/05/dear-diary-2-i-hope-my-mom-doesnt-post.html", "title": "\nDear Diary #2: \"I hope my mom doesn't post this on the internet.\"\n"},

(For our friends in lands where Celsius reigns, that's -14.4\u00b0C.)  \nOn last night's 11 o'clock news I saw a segment that included an interview with a homeless 20-something young woman who explained that she'd been in her last semester of college, fallen on some hard luck, and wound up sleeping in the subway with her dog.\nWhen I woke up this morning, the first thought that came into my mind was \"What can I do today to make sure that Sweet M doesn't someday end up homeless?\" \nThe stream of thought that followed went something like this -- make more money (default anxiety-reduction thought); try to buy a house and put it in a trust for her with someone supervising the trust; live just long enough to launch her into some sort of work life and don't succumb to any lingering resource-depleting illness like Alzheimer's; build a better and stronger support network for her; move out of the city to somewhere that she'll have a closer social network (file this under \"geographical cure\" \u2014 the 12-step concept for futile moves in search of greener pastures), move to a warmer climate where homelessness is less dangerous (see preceding note on geographical cures); devote my time to affordable housing and homelessness activism; become more deeply engaged in the autism activism community; change her school so that she'll be somewhere that has lower academic expectations, but provides life-skills and vocational training; hope that the Mayan 2012 prophecy is correct so that I won't really have to worry about this.\nI turned to M's dad and said, \"What are we going to do to make sure that our girl doesn't someday end up homeless?\"\n\"Drink your coffee, would you?\" he said.\nA cognitive psychological study suggests that if you offer someone a warm beverage that they will, indeed, be more warmly disposed toward you, so he might be onto something here.  But seriously, these awake-in-the-middle-of-the-night thoughts were seriously intruding on the start of my day.\nOur PDD-NOS kids can be such a mix of potential and deficits, so hard to predict in terms of trajectory, that somedays I just don't know what I ought to be doing, as I've mentioned before.   I wonder what adults with PDD-NOS, or someone who is the parent of an adult child with PDD-NOS, suggest?  I wonder, what did you do?   How did it work out? What might have worked better?  Clearly watching the 11 o'clock news is not the best idea, but what is?\n\nIf you were here, I'd offer you a cup of coffee (or tea if you'd rather -- said to be better for longevity) and ask you to pull up a chair.

Very, very different. And she probably always will be. \nWe've known since 2005 that this was more than a little speech delay and low-frustration tolerance that she would grow out of.  And we've known since 2007 that the social challenges that our girl faces are not easy to remediate.  And now we know that some things are mutable and some are not.  She's learned to read, against the dire predictions of some naysayers.  Her social skills, while limited, are evolving.  And, with the help of an SSRI medication and lots of behavior interventions, she's developing a somewhat enhanced capacity to think before responding.\nAnd so, looking back at the last five years of this blog, and looking forward to the next five years of our girl's life, I wonder what's the best thing I can be doing for her? Hindsight is a poor substitute for foresight, but hindsight is what we get with this one-way temporality that we humans have. Don't you sometimes really wanna break out your crystal ball?  I'd even settle for a friendly visit from the ghost of New Year's future as all these questions continue . . .\nShould we send her to a school for kids who have more ASD-type neurology or should be keep her where she is, where she knows everyone and there are lots of neurotypical-ish models and high academic standards?  \nShould we apply for Social Security Disability since it's hard to know how she'll ever support herself, or should we continue to hold out the belief (which sometimes feels only like a hope) that she will be a fully contributing and self-supporting member in this society?  \nShould we move out of the city, or stay put because it is familiar and we have great doctors and other resources here? \nHopefully some answers will emerge in 2011.  In the meantime, happy new year 2011 to all of you who share our life at Autism's Edges.  Here's to year of unfolding answers!  Any clues, crystal balls, or prognostications you may have are welcome!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/01/goodbye-to-mmx.html", "title": "\nGoodbye to MMX!\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 31, 2010", "body": "\nFor months and months Sweet M has wanted to go to the Intrepid Museum \"to see the kind of boat grandpa lived on.\"I had demurred, having spent more hours than I care to remember of my own childhood summers at airshows, visiting aircraft carriers, or wandering the halls of air and space museums.  I remember in particular the airshows, where the Blue Angels would soar in formation overhead, doing loop to loops and other acrobatic aeronautics.For some people, like my father, who was a retired naval aviator, these shows were simply thrilling, and he wanted to share his excitement with his family.  What I remember from these shows was the noise, the crowds, the heat \u2014 it was always on the hottest or second hottest day of the summer.  There would be the burning sun, the smell of jet fuel and exhaust, the dropped sno-cones melting on the bleachers, the horrifying roar of the jets overhead.  And afterward, there would be the sunburn, red and blistering. Sunscreen was a prescription-only product in those days.  On such outings I often wept, or screamed, or quarreled with my siblings, or shutdown and stared at single object in an effort to maintain my equilibrium.Now, parenting a child on the spectrum, I understand that I had been experiencing sensory dysregulation.  It was just all too much for me.  But then I just understood summer and these outings as something to be dreaded and endured.So the idea of visiting the Intrepid, docked on the Hudson River, in the heat of the summer and the Memorial weekend crowds had, as you might anticipate, almost no appeal.But Sweet M had wanted to do this for so long. She wanted to honor her grandfather's memory by visiting the aircraft carrier and seeing the airplanes.  And so we went.We had sunscreen.And hats.And water bottles.And it was fun.Neither of us could believe that her grandfather had lived on a boat like this \u2014 sweltering in the South Pacific heat.  At the Intrepid Museum the bridge of the ship has an air conditioner so that the museum docents don't pass out, but there were no air conditioners in the aircraft carriers of 1940s.  And no sunscreen for the sailors or naval aviators.  And the noise and heat and commotion of jets taking off and landing was accompanied by the anxiety of the impending war with China (that became, instead, the Korean War.)I wonder how they did it.Which makes me wonder how the young women and men serving in Afghanistan and Iraq do what they do.  They do have sunscreen, and there are internet connections to family and friends. But as far as I can tell those are they only improvements. There is still the heat. To which one can add the sandstorms. And the constant anxiety of the improvised explosive devices, coupled with the military commands' failure to supply them with adequate equipment like armored jeeps and flack jackets.  They work alongside highly paid mercenaries who complicate and undermine their missions.

It seems such a harmless word.But then it brings along its entire tyrannical family of normal-centric words\u2014should, oughta, must,  and could've, meant to, ought to have\u2014the vast language of imperative or regret.Normal gains its power to harm from the legitimacy that we (and all the other persons, groups, and institutions in our culture) afford it.  But all of you know that.  If you're reading this blog, chances are good that you are intimately acquainted with the tyranny of the normal.Back in 19th-century America slavery was considered normal.  Enslaving Africans as labor for American and Caribbean plantations was the norm.  But to suture the damaging gap between the foundational American value of \"all men are created equal,\" the word slavery was a word displaced by a euphemism: \"the peculiar institution.\"For decades now activists, like the abolitionists of the 19th century, have been battling the peculiar violence of the normal.  Norms of sexual identity, and physical and cognitive abilities, and body size have all come under fire.But activism is not always a ready and soothing balm when one is struck close to home by this sort of violence.  Activism, and solidarity with those who share our own corners well outside the narrow perimeters of the normal, can help.But sometimes activism is little or no help to us in the moment \u2014 when we are suffering under the sway of the normal.

{"date": "Saturday, June 12, 2010", "body": "\nThough I am not usually inclined to turn to spiritual traditions for social problems, the Buddhists do have a very fine way of thinking about problems like the peculiar violence wrought by the category of \"normal.\"  \n\nThose wise Buddhists categorize suffering into two kinds: primary suffering and secondary suffering.  Primary suffering comes from actual physical sensation: the pain of an injury, hunger, or exhaustion.  Secondary suffering is everything else from the big old world of misery: feelings like anger, fear, depression, anxiety and despair that we layer atop unpleasant sensations or events in a finely-woven web of associations, judgments, and explanations.\nAs parents of kids on the spectrum we suffer in that gap between the delicious, delightful, quirky everyday lives of our inspiring and unusual kids and the crushing abstraction of normal and its kin, appropriate-acceptable-allowed.For the most part the pain we experience in parenting, as in other things, is this secondary pain that comes  from trying to fit into a concept or construct that simply doesn't apply.  Or in worrying about a future that we can't readily predict, no matter how many batteries of neuro-psychological tests we agreed to have conducted. Or in pondering what might have been and so finding ourselves waylaid from the present in the the wrenching land of if-only.\nWith the exception of exhaustion, and the occasional organic ailment, most of our problems at Autism's Edges have been of this latter type, secondary pain, the pain of worry, and rage, and anguish, and embarrassment, and despair.  And most of that has come from the misery of trying to match one's lived experience up to some inadequate set of abstractions.\nHopefully someone will loan us all a very sturdy bohdi tree when the next round of challenges come our way . . .\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/06/coping-with-violence-of-normal-part-2.html", "title": "\nCoping with the Violence of the Normal (Part 2 of 2)\n"},

Of course there are the physiological changes . . . hormones carving out a waist, hips, bust, and provoking the occasional acne.  But the real change of adolescence \u2014 a least among neurotypical folks \u2014 is that shift from caring about what your parents think to caring about what your friends think.I'm wondering how that's going to work for our girl, who has yet to find her way into the world of friendships.  What will her version of cool look like when she continues to be interested in Arthur while her classmates have moved far beyond Hannah Montana?We have, more or less, stopped wondering when she'll catch-up.

We had our IEP meeting and Sweet M gets to continue at her current school and go on to middle school, entering the sixth grade in the fall.She could not be happier about this.  She worked so hard in the past year \u2014 closing gaps in reading and in math specifically because she loves her school and wants to continue there.  Two weeks ago her class toured the upper school and she came home so excited:  \"In the middle school they have two science labs, and you history, and math, and English!  And guess-what-guess-what-guess-what \u2014 they have three dances!!!\"So, hooray, right?  Hip-hip-hooray, right?  Score another one for the Autism's Edges team, yes?Except that we lost her one-on-one paraprofessional who was really an ABA learning specialist who helped her close three years of reading gaps and completely restored her sense of belonging in the community of kids at school.  Sweet M grew and grew and grew over the past two years with all this support and social scaffolding.They \u2014 the school and Committee on Special Education team \u2014 wouldn't even agree to a short-term transitional para for the first three months of the year.  The argument is logical, though not altogether legal:  \"If she needs a para then she doesn't belong in a private 12:1:1, she belongs in a 6:1:1.\"  So we won.  Sort of.  And we're quietly wondering how next year will be.  Hoping it's fine.  Not altogether sure.The good news is that her para, whose judgment we trust, says she is 100% confident that Sweet M will be fine in the middle school without a one-on-one, transitional or otherwise.I was looking at Sweet M's fire escape garden last week.  We got home one afternoon and the tomatoes had gotten so big that the branches were falling down, the big green toms hanging over the edge of the pot, poised to ripen and fall seven stories and splatter in our neighbor's backyard unless we intervened.We added a stake and tied the sprawling branches.In gardening when the fruits of one's efforts grow and develop, you add supports to ensure your harvest.  In special education, you take them away and see how things fall out.Hopefully my analogy is flawed, and Sweet M is more like a tree whose roots have deepened and made her feel increasingly able to stand on her own.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2009/07/stakes.html", "title": "\nThe Stakes\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 13, 2009", "body": "\nNow and again we watch The Food Network's Iron Chef America, a game show that features a celebrity master chef like Mario Batali or Bobby Flay battling a challenger in \"Kitchen Stadium.\"  Their task: to make the best five-course meal in just under an hour using a featured \"secret ingredient\" such as trout, or flank steak, or parmigiano reggiano.  The secret ingredient must be featured in each course. A panel of food experts judges \"Battle Trout\" or \"Battle Flank Steak\" or Battle Parmigiano\" based on criteria such as flavor, originality, and presentation. The Iron Chef secret ingredient can result in some strange dessert outcomes -- beef-infused ice cream, beer meringue, and sea urchin custard are just a few.Sometimes I feel as though autism parenting is a lot like the timed kitchen stadium battle.  Your kid will only be this age -- whatever the age is -- once.  So the time limits are clear and the pressure is on. You know the clock is ticking. The master chefs you're up against can be renowned experts, school personnel, or board of education officials. The stadium is the school district, the Department of Education, or for some fierce contenders, federal court.Right now I'm appearing in Iron Mom: Battle \"Least Restrictive Setting.\"  One or two people at Sweet M's school have long believed that she should be in a more restrictive setting -- a 6:1:1.Sweet M attends a state-approved (and therefore partially publicly-funded) private school for children with learning disabilities. Some school administrators believe that she (and/or the school) would be better served if she were elsewhere: at a school where all or almost all the children are on the spectrum.Those of you who've been following this blog know that this has been an ongoing issue: every other year for the past six years we have looked -- in earnest and with open minds -- at other settings and determined that they would not be appropriate.We find ourselves in the odd position of making a mainstreaming argument even though she is in an LD school. Because the school has a much greater variety of children than a school for kids on the spectrum would have, it more closely approximates a mainstream setting than other places do. Maybe it's not mainstream, but it's a much larger tributary than the stream they'd like to send her to.The rules of this special education game -- the secret ingredient of \"least restrictive setting\" -- have left us with an outcome for Sweet M that seems a lot like flank-steak infused ice cream or urchin custard.  This is not exactly what you'd choose to make for dessert if you weren't working within a narrowly defined structure with very specific rules.But, of course,  the differences are clear: in Iron Mom America the battle isn't just an hour, but year in and year out, and the real stakes are much higher than just a tasty meal and haute cuisine bragging rights.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2009/06/iron-mom-battle-least-restrictive.html", "title": "\nIron Mom: Battle \"Least Restrictive Setting\"\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 16, 2008", "body": "\nEarlier this week my aunt passed away from complications related to lupus.  She lived a long life, nearly eighty years, had five children, four grandchildren, and dozens of nieces and nephews, friends and in-laws who treasured her in life and now mourn her loss.    We called her Aunt Sissy because she was the only girl in a brood of six siblings, so she was Sis to all her brothers, and Aunt Sis to us.  She and my father were siblings and verbal sparring partners.  Family gatherings \u2014 we shared all the birthdays, holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter and sometimes Memorial and Labor Days to boot \u2014 often erupted into verbal fireworks over the Vietnam war, the hippies, or the travesty of Vatican II.  Aunt Sis held her ground against my father, which was no easy feat, and through her example insisted that a woman's opinion mattered no less than any man's.Aunt Sis was exactly the sort of aunt one hopes for \u2014 one who can see what you need that your parents can't quite fathom whether from a sheer sense of overwhelm or inadequate perspective, or both, as parenting is essentially an exercise in overly engaged inadequacy.At eleven years of age I was a great worry for my parents.  I was smart enough, to be sure, but also peculiar.  I had no friends, and no interest in having any.  I read continuously, usually three to four books from the library each week.  I worked my way through the books, mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and other lowbrow fiction at a breakneck pace.  Loved the Lord of the Rings.  Isaac Asimov.  Robert Heinlein. Ray Bradbury.  Played with a chemistry set.  Wore big coke bottle glasses and read and read and read.  Retrospectively, of course, I now know that I was a geek in the land of beach blanket bingo. But at the time, I just knew that I was odd, very odd indeed, and not likely to be approaching anything resembling normalcy without a concerted effort, if at all.My parent were at a loss for what to do.  Piano lessons?  Perhaps it would help my social skills to be able to play the piano \u2014 even if you don't talk with people, you can always play a tune, or so went the reasoning.   Never mind that my  fine motor skills were not well-suited to the instrument and I had little sense of pitch and even less sense of rhythm.My aunt had other ideas.  In her wisdom, she figured that the door into my mind was through books since reading was what came naturally for me.  For my eleventh birthday she gave me a copy an etiquette book for girls called White Gloves and Party Manners.I was stunned by this little yellow treasure, a \"how to\" book for girls to learn \"proper\" behavior.  The cover had a line drawing of a lovely young woman in a diaphanous yet ever-so-modest dress wearing white gloves.  I found her, and the book's contents, immensely exotic.There were instructions on how to address various adults:  Should you meet a judge (not of the Supreme Court) you should say, for example,  \"How do you do, Judge Jones?\"  And if you meet a judge of the Supreme Court, you should offer your hand, or even curtsy, and say \"How do you do Justice White.\"From my neighborhood, overlooking a Los Angeles beach town, there was very little chance of encountering a judge, let alone a Supreme Court Justice, but it's always good to be prepared.  Equally exotic were the instructions on how to eat lobster and which fork should be used for the salad versus the seafood.I devoured White Gloves and Party Manners, treating it like the fantasy fiction that it was for me . . .  I'd been reading Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles, and this read like some strange sort of Eastern Seaboard Earthling Chronicles.  Imagine: somewhere people use fingerbowls, eat lobster, and write thank you notes on printed letterhead.  I had no idea where this place was, or what this etiquette might do for me, but it alerted me to the fact that there were other places and also rules of conduct that one could study and follow . . .  that if you were observant and exacting, you could figure out how to get along.  Over the next years I would study how people behaved, and read plenty of self-help and etiquette books as well so that eventually I could easily pass for neurotypical.  When I tell anyone now that I was once as anti-social as my own dear Sweet M, no one believes me. When I say that I did not speak with anyone at school for five years (other than to respond to teachers' questions) no one believes it possible.  But it's true.  I was a geek, bonafide, through and through.In the autism world we call this \"broader phenotype\" \u2014 when a relative has characteristics of someone on the spectrum, but doesn't qualify for a diagnosis.  Socially impaired kids like me weren't diagnosed back in those days, we were just weirdos to be shunned or left to our own devices.And Aunt Sis got it.  She got that I was a geek.  She didn't freak out about it.  She didn't reject it.  She didn't try to change me.  She saw the way in \u2014 through a girl's etiquette book \u2014 to help me find a way out.And all the years I've been posting on this blog, she has been my steadfast reader, often emailing me words of encouragement and urging me to never give up on my sweet little one, like she never gave up on any of her own kids, or nieces, or nephews.This week was Sweet M's 11th birthday.  Aunt Sis got to see her a month ago at my sister's wedding. She didn't quite get to see her through to her 11th birthday.  I don't think I will be giving Sweet M a copy of White Gloves and Party Manners.  Books aren't the way into her.  But I will always have the power of the recognition that Aunt Sis gave me, and I carry that into my parenting of Sweet M.So I will miss Aunt Sis.  Wish I could imagine she's reading this blog from some other dimension \u2014 somewhere with lobster for dinner and fingerbowls to boot \u2014 but for the moment I'll just remember the generous force of her recognition and affirmation, and all that she has given me.  Not etiquette, or manners, or airs to be put on, but something like grace.  \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JmcBVVIxUyE/SSDbktq3f-I/AAAAAAAAAUM/mos8pdopw0I/s1600-h/whitegloves.jpeg"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/white-gloves-and-party-manners-or-elegy.html", "title": "\nWhite Gloves and Party Manners, or Elegy for an Aunt Departed\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 18, 2008", "body": "\nLately Sweet M has a new expression.  When she's not feeling well, she says, \"I'm not feeling like myself.\"When the horse she likes best at her hippotherapy program tried to buck her off, as he'd done with several kids, she was completely calm as she reprimanded him with a sharp reproach, saying \"Tank, don't do THAT.  You scared me.\"  Later she told me, nonchalantly, that it was okay, that \"Tank wasn't feeling like himself.\"In the middle of August we decided, in conversation with Sweet M's doctor, to shift her off of Paxil and onto a different selective-serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, Prozac.I'd be lying to you if I said that I wasn't terrified about making the change.  Sweet M had started on Paxil at the age of five when her anxiety, inflexibility, and subsequent tantrums were debilitating not only for her, but for all of us as a family.The results of introducing Paxil when Sweet M was five-years-old were nearly immediate and dramatic: her obsessive-compulsive behaviors and rigidity stopped within two weeks, and her speech-language therapists were flabberghasted by the huge gains she made over the course of a Christmas holiday break.  So despite my apprehension about putting a child so young on a medication with blackbox warnings, and despite our serious problems with this medication in its liquid form,  I don't regret the decision.  Paxil was, for our family, nothing short of miraculous.  So I was very apprehensive about making the change to a new medication.The trouble was that Sweet M was gaining weight.  Paxil is notorious for causing everyone to pile on the pounds.  So slowly and steadily, under the careful supervision of her psychiatrist, we began the shift to Prozac \u2014 an SSRI that is thought to be weight-neutral in kids.  The transition period took nine weeks, reducing the Paxil 5 mg at a time and slowly introducing and upping the Prozac.As the Paxil was reduced we saw a face of our sweet girl that we'd not seen in years \u2014 a fresh-faced exuberance and much, much more expressive language.  It is hard to describe the change, but all I can say is that she was suddenly there \u2014 she was suddenly more emotionally available.  The Paxil seemed to have shut her down, or shut her out, producing the disaffected affect that we were mistaking as part of her neurological or psychological profile.  Her teachers reported that she was suddenly more present in class, participating in discussions and saying hello to others without being prompted.All was well until the last week of the transition, when the last 5 mg of Paxil were eliminated while the Prozac was kept steady at 20 mg.  Sweet M was suddenly not herself at all. Though, admittedly, it is hard to say what being herself would be given the presence of psychotropic meds in her life for six years, this next round of changes were disconcerting indeed. Suddenly, in that first week without any Paxil, she was inexplicably sad.  She'd retreat to the bathroom saying \"Can I be alone?\" and turn on the shower, and I'd hear her in the shower sobbing and sobbing.  When she came out I'd ask if she was okay, and she'd say, yes, I need to drink some milk and go to sleep.I was hugely troubled by the this, even as she dropped five pounds in two weeks (with no other changes in eating or exercise). When I consulted with her doctor, he advised that we stay the course and give it two more weeks before potentially upping the Prozac.We didn't have to up the Prozac again.  The weeping stopped, and we now have a girl who is increasingly verbal and without obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  The weight loss has leveled off, but the gains in better affect are apparent every day.The morals of the story are, I suppose, 1) be willing to shift course (change the medication), 2) be willing to stay the course (wait that excruciating, tearful two weeks), 3) be sure you have the very best psycho-pharmacological advice you can find, and 4) be willing to let oneself, or one's child's self, be a multiple and ever-evolving terrain.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/post-paxil-or-on-feeling-like-oneself.html", "title": "\nPost-Paxil, or On Feeling Like Oneself\n"},

And not because our girl's daddy's rich, or her mama good lookin'. \u00a0This year the livin' is easy because, for the very first time since our girl was diagnosed, we've found a summer activity that works brilliantly for her.\n\nIf you've been visiting Autism's Edges over the years, you know that we've tried a lot of things: day camps, inclusion programs, and horseback riding therapy camp. For the most part,\"camp\" has been a word associated with misery. With experiences that ranged from mixed to awful, in the past two summers we had opted to go with Camp Dad, using the summers to hone some math and reading skills, but missing out on the essential peer social skills activities that camp settings provide. For spectrumy kids like ours, who don't have an extended school year (or the daddy who's rich or a mamma who's good lookin'!), summertime livin' isn't always so easy.\n \n\n\nElectronic\u00a0hand puppets. Facilitatedby Becky\u00a0Heritage at the\u00a0Tech KidsUnlimited\u00a0Workshop. The eyes\u00a0lights up\u00a0when you close the\u00a0circuits.\nBut this summer is different thanks to the amazing work of Beth Rosenberg, and her teams of technology educators who put on week long Tech Kids Unlimited workshops. Last\u00a0week our girl took part in a\u00a0computer animation and electronic puppet workshop held at the Jewish Community Center on Manhattan's Upper West Side. \u00a0\n\nAnd this coming week, she'll head downtown to Pace University for a video game design workshop. \u00a0In just one short week, twenty hours all totaled, workshop participants made electronic puppets and \"bugs\" where they learned about circuitry, and short animated videos where they learned the fundamentals of animated movement, as well as programs like iMovie and iStopMotion.\n\nOne of the secrets to the success of Beth's workshops is that she programs the week with some of the finest tech education talent in the city, including\u00a0Becky Heritage, who worked with the kids on electronic puppets;\u00a0Gabriella Levine, who worked with the kids on making \"Blinky bugs,\" whose antenna cause their eyes to light up; and\u00a0Ardina Greco\u00a0and\u00a0Mark Dzula, both of whom are doctoral candidates at Columbia University and art educators\u00a0extraordinaire.\u00a0Along with amazing volunteers, the ratio of adults to kids in the room is more or less one to one, which is the golden ratio for our girl.\n\nThe electronic puppets, facilitated by Becky Heritage, was the week's first activity, and one of my personal favorites: the eyes light up when you put the hands together and close the circuits. Seems the perfect metaphor for what happens with our kids in these workshops: help them put their hands together, close the circuits, and see their eyes light up!\n\n Our girl made this short, but epic, film:\n The Battle for Love on Vimeo.\n For the first summer in a very long time, we've arrived at a feeling that Gershwin and Heyward captured . . .\n\nOne of these morningsYou\u2019re goin\u2019 to rise up singing\u2028Then you\u2019ll spread your wingsAnd you\u2019ll take to the sky.\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 \u2022\n*\u00a0Postscript: The show tune Summertime was written by George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, Dorothy Heyward, and DuBose Heyward.

{"date": "Saturday, July 30, 2011", "body": "\nFor the most part, our summertime this year been easy. But there's a final verse to Gershwin and Heyward's tune that has resonated mournfully across the season:\n\nOne of these mornings\nYou're going to rise up singing\nThen you'll spread your wings\nAnd you'll take to the sky.\n\nBut until that morning\nThere's a'nothing can harm you\nWith daddy and mammy standing by.\n\nThis summer has been marked by that excruciating reality that no matter how watchfully we stand by, there is still the chance that something will go horribly wrong before our kids take to the sky. \n\nEvery week there seems to be a new version of every parent's nightmare: losing a child because you allowed him walk a few blocks alone in one of the safest neighborhoods in the city, or sent her to summer leadership camp on an idyllic island in one of the safest countries in the world, or let your adult child exercise his right to live independently, even if that meant living on the street. The names that accompany these losses are specific: Leiby Kletzky, Utoya, and Kelly Thomas. \u00a0But the loss in every case has in it something mythic: the theft of a child, the slaughter of the innocents, the parent who outlives their progeny.\n\nOur girl wants so desperately to be able to go out on her own, down the block to the corner store or around the corner to the newsstand to buy her favorite spearmint gum. This summer we have taken the small step of letting her go on her own from a cab into the building where her summer technology class is, but we are far from letting her head out onto the streets alone. \n\nLast week a colleague and I were talking about how I was spending my summer \u2014 camped out on the Upper West Side having meetings or working on my laptop while our girl takes her technology workshops. We live just far enough away that it doesn't make sense for me to drop her off, go home or to my office, and come back to get her later.\u00a0When my colleague asked how old our girl is, I shared that she's thirteen.\n\nWithout a pause, he went on to tell me about how years ago he let his seven-year-old walk to the bus on her own in the East Village, and take the bus across town to her school. \u00a0He said he would trail her down the street far enough away that she didn't notice him, but that he had to let her go on her own. \u00a0That, he told me, was the same year that six-year-old Etan Patz disappeared in our neighborhood. His daughter, now forty,\u00a0was a schoolmate of Etan's. As with Leiby\u00a0Kletzky, Etan had begged to go out on his own, and the day he went missing was his first time out alone. Unlike Leiby, Etan has never been found.\n\nI took my colleague's comment to suggest that the world is a scary place but that perhaps I should be giving a thirteen-year-old more freedom. \u00a0Perhaps, as with the super-safe playgrounds that seem to promote anxiety disorders, that there is more danger in our levels of caution than there would be in having more faith in our kids and in our neighbors.\n\nBut somehow we're not there yet. \u00a0We're still daddy and mammy standing by.\n\n\nThe copyright for the lyrics to \"Summertime\" is held by \u00a9 Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., EMI Music Publishing.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 19, 2011", "body": "\n\nThis past Saturday I tried an experiment in micro-blogging:  I attended the all-day Hunter College Autism Symposium with iPad and iPhone in hand and live-tweeted much of the day.  I was on hand as a guest of the folks at Wellsphere and wanted to relay as much of the information as I could in the most immediate way.\n\nThe results of the micro-blogging experiment were mixed: I generated quite a few 140-character utterances tracking many of the exciting findings presented.  But there were some real problems.  My tweets fell victim to the absurdities of auto-correction and my own limited iPad keyboarding accuracy. #asd conference become #ass conference.  Not good.  Dr. Siller became Dr. Sillier, and then Dr. Duller (and I can assure you that Dr. Siller is neither silly nor dull.)  And finally, when reporting on clinical results of a parent-training intervention, one of my tweets incorrectly reported that significant results were found among non-verbal kids younger than 15 months when, in fact, the finding applied to kids who had some language at 15 months.  \nThe experiment revealed for me that micro-blogging is a limited medium.   That said, I'd do it all over again to be able to share some of the amazing research that the folks at the Hunter College Autism Center and the Weill Cornell Autism Research Project (WCARP) are working on.  Maybe next time I'll be tweeting from a Macbook Air, and thus a real keyboard sans iOS auto-correct, but in the meantime, let me reflect here on some of the highlights of the day:\n\"Translational science\" \u2014  Have you ever heard of \"translational science\"?  I hadn't, and was immensely interested to learn about this model that \"moves research from the lab bench to the bedside to the community.\"  Okay, so bedside isn't exactly apt for a syndrome like autism, but you get the picture: the folks at the Weill Cornell College of Medicine and the Hunter College Autism Center are building bridges between research scientists, clinicians, interventionists, and families affected by ASD.  In the process the experiences of parents and practitioners (which might otherwise be dismissed in a pure science context as \"anecdotal\" or \"n of 1\") can be reported and assessed, refracted, and considered through clinical and experimental lenses while, reciprocally, laboratory science is infused with the hands-on experiences of families and practitioners.\n\nExercise and brain function \u2014 A fascinating connection regarding the role of exercise in brain function came from Dr. Barbara Hempstead during a Q & A session.  Hempstead's work is on alterations in the metabolism of Brained Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF), a chemical involved in linking and impairing synaptic connections.  Hempstead shared that in laboratory studies (mouse models) one of the fastest ways to increase BDNF in the brain (and blood platelets) is to give the mouse an exercise wheel and let them run.  Could the well-documented phenomena of \"runners\" -- autism kids that run off -- and \"wandering\" in adults with Alzheimer's disease be in part a self-regulating attempt to generate BDNF?  Hard to say, but it makes some sense.  I couldn't help but think of Charlie Fisher's marathon bike rides with his dad, and of my own father's epic wandering as his brain function declined.\n\ninclusive education: Dr. Shirley Cohen, co-founder of the Autism Nest Program (with Dorothy Siegel of New York University) and founder of Hunter College's Autism Center, shared how the ASD Nest program is now functioning in 22 New York City schools. Based on the Collaborative Team Teaching model and designed for students who can work at grade-level but need services and supports, Hunter College has been training teachers to serve in the program.  The ASD Nest Program is a model for inclusive education for kids on the spectrum.\nbridging the ABA/DIR divide: The debates on the merits and shortcomings of ABA and DIR have circulated among parents and interventionist for years, but a presentation by Dr. Michael Siller suggested that there are many overlaps between these interventions when they are put into practice.  Siller pointed out that while traditional discrete trial ABA differs from the developmental intervention models,  more contemporary, naturalistic uses of ABA have many aspects in common with DIR/Floortime. In a lunchtime expert panel on interventions, Dr. Shirley Cohen remarked that when the key protocols of naturalistic ABA were presented to her trained team of graduate students with the title \"Applied Behavioral Analysis\" removed, students could not find any substantive difference between the behavioral and the developmental or relational.  Dr. John Brown spoke about the use of formal scripts in training kids on the autism spectrum and how protocols are being developed to introduce scripted language and then fade the scripts so that more naturalistic language can occur.  The limitations and value of both ABA and DIR/Floortime were highlighted, as was the importance of considering context when dealing with \"interfering behaviors.\"  Dr. Jamie Bleweiss made the powerful observation that \"problem behaviors come from problem contexts\" and demonstrated how an array of variables need to be considered when assessing the triggers of any behavior that interferes with necessary daily activities.\njoint attention studies:  Joint-attention (between parent/caregiver and infant) is foundational for language development.  Dr. Siller's presentation on parental responsive language (the role of parents in fostering joint parent-child attention) was immensely interesting. \n\nMy longtime autism parenting ear is keenly attuned to the \"blame the parent\" modality of many psychological settings, so it was fascinating to hear Siller underscore that autism parents mirror their children's utterances just as do the parents of typically developing kids.  Some parents mirror more, some mirror less -- but the lack of joint attention is not a consequence of bad parenting. \nThat said, given that joint attention deficits for ASD infants and their parents impair language development, Siller has developed a parent training program to boost parental responsive language.  Siller reported that this parenting training intervention had positive outcomes for children who had some language at less than fifteen months of age, but showed no results for those who were non-verbal at fifteen months.\n\nneuroplasticity and brain sculpting/pruning: The phenomenon of larger than average head size and brain over-growth in ASD kids (or the lack of typical culling of neural networks during the 12-24 month period) was discussed by neurologist Barry Kosofsky.  A question as to whether there is only a short window of neuroplasticity when interventions can work came from the audience.  There was a very interesting answer from one of the panelists: fluoxetine (Prozac) has been shown to increase neuroplasticity in animal experiments.  What this suggests is that it is at least theoretically possibly to extend (or re-open) the windows for possible biological or behavioral/relational interventions.  While scientists once thought that brain development was something that concluded (or slowed so significantly as to be negligible) new work on neurological plasticity suggests that the door for change doesn't shut at age 2 or 3 or 4 or maybe ever.  That said, earlier interventions still have the greatest impact, thus there was considerable discussion of early detection.\nearly detection, diagnosis, and interventions:  Identifying kids at risk for developing ASD was discussed across the conference.  Dr. Emily Forrest shared how the American Academy of Pediatrics has adopted a protocol for pediatricians to ensure that infants are assessed for ASD in the routine, if hectic, context of the 15-minute well-baby check-up.  Can I just say that I so wish that such a protocol had existed when our girl was in her infancy and toddlerhood?  Just a little over 10 years ago, our pediatrician was at a loss to explain our girl's screaming for hours on end (so-called colic), her extreme startle response to sudden sounds, her difficulty with feeding, her complete lack of interest in (and even annoyance at) hearing a book read aloud.  \nWhen our girl's speech was not developing like that of other babies among our friends and neighbors, our pediatrician dismissed my concern: \"Don't worry, she's just late talking.\"  When, at the urging of an experienced pre-school teacher, we finally consulted a speech and audiology clinic and received a report that described our girl as having \"perseverative play\" and \"echolaliac speech,\" our pediatrician said that she couldn't really comment because she hadn't written the report. She didn't even suggest a referral.\nWhen I think back on this, it seems so, well, cruel and senseless and overdetermined. (Overdetermined is sociology-speak for events that result from many converging factors.) We were first time parents trying to figure out how there could be anything at all \"wrong\" with our dear girl. Our pediatrician was overworked and underpaid (perhaps because she was in-network).  And I was in graduate school, so we really didn't have the resources to go out of network. Part of the long uphill battle for a differential diagnosis for our girl came from the structural convergence of these factors:  an ill-equipped pediatrician, a shortage of developmental pediatricians, and the prohibitively high cost of a developmental assessment that would not have been covered by our HMO.  Add to that the way that a language delay in a girl does not look as pronounced as it would in a boy.  Since girls typically develop language earlier than do boys, our girl's delay may have been really extreme when compared to typically developing girls, but barely noticeable when compared to a normative group that included boys.\nForgive my digression into recollections of the distant past and our girl's diagnosis. I'm so glad things are somewhat better for families faced with these issues now.  Autism awareness has come a long way in ten years.  Even so, Forrest and others shared that there continues to be a shortage of developmental pediatric specialists.  In a sidebar I learned that this is in part because developmental pediatrics is the lowest paid pediatric specialty.  Pediatrics is already a poorly paid specialization.  Makes one wonder how we as a society actually value the care of our children \u2014and how much less we value the care of the \"defective\" ones.\nAs a consequence of this shortage of medical expertise and lack of access to the limited supply of physicians, special educators who work in Early Intervention often find themselves providing informal diagnostic information.  In a sense they become the first responders when developmental pediatricians, psychiatrists, neurologists and other professionals who are formally qualified for these roles aren't available.  Dr. Jennifer Cross shared information on gaining access to the Early Intervention services that are mandated by state and federal law.  Anyone involved in a child's life \u2014 from a parent to a pre-school teacher \u2014 can request Early Intervention services.  This partly mitigates the detection and diagnostic pitfalls of our current system of medical care.\nEarlier and more accurate detection and diagnosis was also the topic of Dr. Catherine Lord's keynote presentation on the use of ADOS (the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule), the diagnostic tool that she developed with her colleagues in Wisconsin.   Lord's presentation was fascinating in many ways, but her clinical videotapes that showed children who were being evaluated for ASD and other developmental issues were particularly fascinating.  Lord has been working with some of these children and their families across many years, so videos from toddlerhood to adolescence showed the trajectory of development and the remarkably varied outcomes.  I wish I could share these videoclips with you, but I'm fairly certain that they are not cleared for blog distribution.  Clinical videos on early detection from Dr. Tricia Striano were also fascinating, and showed early indicators of ASD \u2014  subtle clues that might be observed by a trained clinician or an experienced parent knowledgable about typical development.  Some of Striano's videoclips \u2014\"What Infants Have to Say About Autism\" \u2014 are online at www.infancyresearch.com.\nthe pressing need for programs for autistic young adults represents a career opportunity: Dr. John Brown noted, for students in the audience and currently in school, that \"if you're looking for job security in a bad economy, work with adults on the autism spectrum.\" There is a serious unmet need for transitional services for the kids who will be moving out of high school and into adulthood.  Families like mine, with kids born in the late 1990s, will be aging out of high school in just four or five years.  Our cohort had limited diagnostic, intervention, and educational opportunities available when they were pre-school and school-age.  Now that they are in their early teens, the programs to serve them in the next stages of their lives are as radically insufficient as the diagnostic, intervention, and educational programs were just a decade ago.\n\u2022   \u2022   \u2022 \nMy experiment in tweeting the Hunter Autism Symposium was also insufficient.  It was akin to trying to feed a fire hose of information into a soda fountain straw: not exactly a total failure, but sputtering and spotty. Even a very long blog post like this one is not really adequate to all that was shared last Saturday.  \nI hope other parents or professionals who attended the symposium will share what they learned on Saturday \u2014 either here in the comments, or cross-posting from their own blogs \u2014 so that we can have as many angles on the day as there are ways to think about autism.  And I truly hope that the Hunter College Autism Center will post videotapes of the presentations online for others to see.  With multiple streams of information flowing into a common pool, our knowledge has a chance to deepen. That sort of pooled knowledge is exactly what the emerging model of translational science has in common with the open access world of autism blogging.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitter.com/#%21/AutismsEdges", "http://www.wellsphere.com/home.s", "http://autism.typepad.com/autism/2011/04/day-of-three-bike-rides.html", "http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/SpecialEducation/EducatorResources/About_ASD.htm", "http://practice.aap.org/public/ASDalg.pdf", "http://portal.wpspublish.com/portal/page?_pageid=53,70384&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL", "http://www.infancyresearch.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/04/pooling-our-knowledge-hunter-college.html", "title": "\nPooling Our Knowledge: The Hunter College Autism Symposium\n"},

It was funny, wasn't it?  The toothpaste in the ear canal scene was mild compared to what so many of us deal with day in and day out.  Wouldn't you like to be able to add in the reality for autism moms?Managing therapy appointments that would rival a professional case manager.Negotiating with your local school board for services or placements.Educating friends and family on what autism means for your child, your family, and for the wider community.Making this all happen on a single salary (what we do in our family) because one parent drops out of the labor force to deal with the above.  Make that a single 70% salary given the gendered deflation of women's salary that the video goes after.  (And we count ourselves lucky because Fathersvox shares the case management load, which is not the situation for single moms or dads taking care of kids on the spectrum.)Working hard every day to raise autism awareness and acceptance for all of our kids on the spectrum.Loving your child or children on the spectrum more than anything or anyone else in the world, never quite knowing where any of this will take you. It's never been more clear that love doesn't come with an unlimited 100%-satisfaction guaranteed warranty.Labor of love is what you'd call it all.  But what would make it easier for all of us -- moms and dads alike -- would be if women were not still earning the measly 70 cents for the dollar that their male counterparts earn for the same work.  That's why I posted the video from momsrising.org instead of telling you about the adorable breakfast that our girl conspired with her father to make for me. Wage inequality hurts us all.  It means that women more often than their male counterparts drop out of the paid labor force to manage the needs of their kids, on the spectrum or not.  It means that when the man drops out to do that case management work, you wind up with not a 50% loss of wages, but a 59% loss of wages (hypothetical numbers here: but let's say dad earns 100K and mom earns 70K, but dad drops out of the labor force, then the lost wages are 59% of the family's income.) Wage inequality locks us into gendered roles because it significantly penalizes those who step out of them.  We've made progress.  When I first entered the labor force the gender penalty was 40 cents on the dollar.  In 25 years we've gotten about 10 cents more on the dollar.   That's progress.  But consider our girl's progress: last year the toast and eggs were both sort of burnt.  This year the toast and eggs were perfection. If she can do that much better, we can do better too.  Much, much better.So this Mother's Day I'm standing with Mom's Rising to say let's solve the economic inequalities that discount women's labor \u2014 solve it 100% \u2014 and get our breakfast in bed too.Happy Mother's Day.

Describing something as a disease or a disorder is a matter of social convention.\n\nTake, for example, homosexuality. For quite some time (specifically in the middle of the 20th century) being sexually attracted to persons of the same sex was considered a mental illness. But in 1974, in response to the gay rights movement, homosexuality was stripped of its status as a disease (though it lingered on in another diagnostic category -- \"sexual orientation disturbance\" -- all the way through 1987). But today, \"curing homosexuality\" has gone out of fashion among all but a few fringe practitioners of conversion therapy, and the APA currently considers such therapy unethical.\n\nConversely, consider the case of Abraham Lincoln, whose dark moods and brooding affect lent him the gravitas\u00a0to lead the nation through the grief-stricken days of the Civil War. Some people argue that Lincoln would have no chance of being elected today since he would qualify for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. In our positive-thinking,\u00a0pursuit-of-happiness\u00a0contemporary culture, anything beyond the most fleeting sadness has become a pathology. Indeed, other DSM revisions currently under consideration include shortening the length of the normal period of bereavement (over the loss of a life partner!) to as little as two months.\n\nUnlike gay activists, who were delighted to lose the stigma of mental illness, autistic individuals and their families often need to maintain their diagnoses because, at least for the moment, access to support services and medications that alleviate some of the challenges of coping in a neurotypical world depend on such a classification. \n\nIn fact, access to services for autistic individuals (for example, insurance coverage) has increased over the past decade because of the work of activists and advocates. \u00a0In the days when my girl was receiving her first diagnoses, a PDD-NOS diagnosis would have hindered her access to pharmacological therapies, hence her psychiatrist's care to provide an array of diagnoses that would facilitate treatment that I mentioned in the first part of this series.\n\n\n\nLord and the DSM-5 team recognize that\ncare needs to be taken to not exclude people \nfrom access to services\n\nDiagnoses shift across time as social norms change. And those social norms are shaped, in large measure, by the institutional decisions of powerful, if well-intentioned, groups of professionals.\n\nI don't envy Dr. Lord and the DSM-5 committee the task of revising the volume's developmental disorders section. It's a sobering prospect to imagine that your decisions could cut or eliminate vital services for thousands of individuals who are currently diagnosed with autism.\u00a0But short of grandfathering in everyone who currently has a ASD diagnosis (which would expose the vagaries of the construction of these categories), it is hard to imagine how enough care can be taken that no one loses their diagnosis.\n\nLord's presentation made clear that the committee working on the revisions of the DSM-5 has heard the concerns of the autism community. How, or to what extent, they can respond to these concerns remains to be seen, but her arguments for revisions to the diagnosis were elegant and eloquent:\n\ncurrently autism diagnoses vary depending on the place where the individual is evaluated, which should not happen with functioning framework.\u00a0\n\n\nchanges in the presentation of autism since the DSM-IV was devised have been so dramatic that the new framework must account for many more\u00a0referrals of:\u00a01) toddlers and two-year-olds (due to better\nearly identification), 2) older and younger children without intellectual\ndisabilities, and 3) adolescents and adults with other psychiatric co-morbidities.\u00a0\n\n\nincreased\u00a0early intervention and the accompanying positive results make autism a far more mutable condition than it has previously been, and finally,\u00a0\n\n\nthere has been (and needs to be) greater attention to the special issues of girls and women on the\nspectrum.\u00a0\n\nThese changes, Lord argued, make the process of accurate diagnosis more\ncomplicated, and more important, than ever. The diagnostic framework for autism, she asserted, ought to be robust enough to be useful for all ages, all development levels, any gender, and \"all degrees of severity where there is impairment.\"\n\n\n\nLord: Deficits and capacities inside the spectrum\n\nAll of this makes sense, though there are lingering concerns. \u00a0For example, what if requiring repetitive behavior as one of the two primary symptoms of autism (a proposal being considered by the DSM-5 team) eliminated a whole swath of people from the ASD classification? They might well be pushed off into a newly minted diagnosis, Social Communication Disorder. Thus just as advocates for folks on the spectrum have achieved the hard-won fight for insurance coverage, some may be rolled off into this new diagnostic category for which no coverage is mandated.\n\nRecognizing how very much is at stake in the entire enterprise of revamping the DSM may be a first step toward advocating for accommodations and services that are not based on a deficit model that requires psychiatric categories for access to assistance. Instead, in a more just and equitable world, support and assistance would be based on the shared social goal of developing the greatest capacity for each and everyone of us, on the spectrum or not.\n\nI know it has an utopian ring to it, but in that world the parents of kids on the autism spectrum could sleep more soundly each and every night.\n\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 \u2022\n\n\nThis is the second of three posts reporting on the WCARP Autism Symposium 2012. \u00a0Check back in the next day or two for more on the clinical panel and a report on the breakout group that looked at services for adolescents. \u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://nyp.org/komansky/patient_care/centers_programs/wcarp/autism_symposium.html", "http://www.autismnj.org/MessagefromtheExecutiveDirector.aspx", "http://www.autismnj.org/", "http://nyp.org/komansky/patient_care/centers_programs/wcarp/autism_symposium.html", "http://www.autismnj.org/doc/whitepaper.pdf", "http://www.nationalautismcenter.org/nsp/", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/20/us/redefining-autism.html", "http://www.weillcornell.org/physician/clord/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/05/growing-up-with-autism-life-transitions_29.html", "title": "\nGrowing Up with Autism: Life Transitions, Part 2\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 01, 2012", "body": "\nIt's been quiet over here at Autism's Edges. At the blog, that is. In our lives it has been a bit noisier than usual this past three months because of our relative proximity to Zuccotti Park. It's about 12 blocks to the south, so we're between the former occupation site and other useful sites for protest: Washington Square Park, New York University, the New School, and Union Square.\n\n\n\nOctober 8, 2011: Our girl checks out the mounted\npolice horses staging at La Guardia. \u00a0The story of what\nthe mounties did when she tried to feed the horse will be\nsaved for another day. (File under \"over-reaction.\")\nOften, even now as I type, NYPD helicopters hover overhead to track the movements of the Occupiers. Sometimes the drone starts early in the morning, sometimes it continues into the wee hours of the morning, and sometimes it extends from morning to night, as happened last night when the occupiers returned to Zuccotti Park. When I fell asleep at four I could still hear the sounds of sirens and helicopters.\n\nTwo weekends back, on the day we were setting up our Christmas tree, the lot two blocks away, owned by the Episcopalian church, was the site of an action. A former bishop was arrested climbing over a fence to lead the occupiers to land \u2014 an open lot, a potential commons \u2013 that he and countless others argue a Christian church should share rather than enclose behind eight foot fences.\n\nSometimes we hear some commotion outside and look out the bedroom window to see protesters running down Sixth Avenue against the traffic and police mounted on their motorcycles weaving between cars to pursuit, trying to head them off, corral them.\n\nThis fall has been a tumultuous one in our small corner of the world, close, as it is, to the epicenter of the captains of commerce and consciousness.\u00a0Our friends who live uptown are surprised when we tell them about these eruptions of civil disobedience and police actions. Apparently uptown there is no disturbance.\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2011: View from our window -- the\nOccupiers marching south, the traffic stopped. And the\nempty lots that may reshape our view.\nOur girl takes it in stride. She is disposed to favor the Occupation. \u00a0The fact that\u00a0they are reading about the Gilded Age and the rise of the Progressive movement in her history class also helps. But her response to seeing protesters marching down Sixth Avenue blocking the traffic was simple, some might say \"rule bound\": they shouldn't so that \u2013 they are blocking traffic. \n\nWe have not entertained any higher order discussion of the role of civil disobedience in political change or the intuition of the framers of the Constitution that democracy requires that citizens be ever vigilant of an overreaching government. \u00a0We're simpler than that at Autism's Edges.\n\nWhat we have done is think about moving. I think about it nearly every day. We have lived here, in this apartment, for more than twenty years. Our lives are installed here \u2013 with built-in bookshelves and loft beds and handmade counters that her father lovingly created back in the days when he had a studio. (Or as my favorite West Village folk singers put it more lyrically:\u00a0back before the airplanes came and took the buildings down.) Tearing away from this place feels as though it will be almost as heartbreaking as those days were, with their smoke and dust and airborne sorrow.\n\nWe'd be leaving the neighbors that we run into on the sidewalks from time to time and compare notes about our kids. \u00a0We'd no longer live across the park from the place where our girl learned to walk. \u00a0We'd leave behind the sights of our past: the Children's Aid Nursery school building where a seasoned teacher first told us that she ought to be evaluated for language delays (we wouldn't have known as it was all so subtle and we were oh-so-very-clueless). And leave behind the corner green market where the Kim's know us and ask about our girl when she's not in tow. We'd leave behind the short walk to the Hudson River where we gave our girl's first goldfish, Sparky, a solemn burial at sea one frozen winter afternoon.\n\nLeaving here, this place we have loved, feels as though it will be less like pulling up roots \u2013 the typical metaphor for a move of this sort \u2013 than like pulling off a scab: we have grown into the wonderous-ness and wounded-ness of this place that is downtown and the place has grown into our own cuts and scrapes.\n\nStill, I am feeling that it may be time to move. The vacant lots next to our building \u2013 the ones just outside our living room and bedroom windows \u2013 were sold last year to a development company from Texas. \u00a0They paid $17 million dollars, so I'm guessing they have the money to build the fifteen story building that local zoning would allow. When they build, our only view of sky, trees, and avenue will be gone, as will all of our natural light. \u00a0I can see this coming, I just don't know quite how long we have until they break ground and the rumble of helicopters and motorcycles policing the occupation will become the background for din of construction.\n\nSo as 2011 comes to a close and 2012 unfolds, I wonder where we will be next year, not in some metaphorical sense, but concretely. Will we still live here, or will we have found a way to move? \u00a0How can it happen so that our lives can grow beyond this place where our girl has grown-up? \u00a0I don't know. I'm asking you all to keep us in your thoughts and in your prayers (if you do that sort of thing). \u00a0And on your autodial if you hear of an affordable 2-3 bedroom (that allows for the pet she wants) somewhere between here and the northern border of the city.\n\nMy new year's resolution this year: to love this neighborhood every single day we get to keep living here and find a place we can love as much where she can continue to thrive.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.care2.com/causes/ows-returns-to-zuccotti-park-on-new-years-eve-video.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/nyregion/occupy-wall-street-protesters-march-against-trinity-church.html", "http://www.roches.com/discography/moonswept.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/01/moving-ahead-in-2012.html", "title": "\nMoving Ahead in 2012\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 26, 2012", "body": "\nGrowing Up With Autism: Life Transitions was the topic of this year's Weill Cornell Autism Research Project Symposium for Families and Professionals. Growing up and facing life transitions\u00a0is exactly what we've been doing over here at Autism's Edges.\n\n\n\nAutism Symposium: Basic Science\u00a0Panel\u00a0\nPanelists: Drs. Rajadhyaksha, Casey, Lee,\u00a0Walkup, and\u00a0Dr. Barry Kosofsky,who convened the symposium,\u00a0at podium.\n\nIn a month or so our dear girl will be graduating from middle school, and so our attention has turned to the challenges ahead: the upcoming graduation ceremony and navigating the attendant social minefields that are collective celebrations. And then there is the longer look ahead, to the hurdles that may be in store in the next stretch: high stakes standardized tests, proms and the possibility of dating (yes, this seems impossible to me, too), and, depending on how the transitions unfold, planning for college applications or whatever else seems right.\n\nGiven this happy convergence of the informational and the intimate, I was delighted to report on the Autism Symposium\u00a0again. Appropriately enough for a day focused on autism and transitions, anxiety seemed to be the watchword for the \u00a0day. As anyone who lives on or near the autism spectrum knows, there is a fundamental autistic axiom that governs our lives: change is bad. Since life is pretty much ever-changing, this creates a whole array of challenges for us.\u00a0The first panel of the day looked at basic science and generated insights into why anxiety is such a foregrounded feature in our lives on or near the spectrum.\n\n\"anxiety anomalies\":\u00a0Although Dr. BJ Casey's presentation focused on adolescence, and how the emotional and regulatory centers of the brain develop at different rates creating the volatility characteristic of teens, the big takeaway\u00a0for me from her research is that treatments that work for neurotypical individuals may not work at all for autistics. In fact they might be incredibly damaging.\n\n\n\nFrom Dr. Casey:\u00a0Atypical development is \nassociated with less emotional regulation.\n\n\u00a0Dr. Casey offered the remarkable experimental finding that in persons with ASD, the fear response is not reduced when a particular frightening object, person, or event turns out to be harmless. In a typical, or adaptive response, encountering a threat that winds up causing no harm reduces fear responses. \u00a0But in folks with high anxiety \u2014 like some of us and our kids \u2014 instead of reducing anxiety, encounters with something scary that causes no harm actually increases terror. \u00a0Her research used fMRI scans of amygdala activity to uncover this anomaly.\n(If you're interested in reading her team's original research on this you can find Casey's publication on this online.)\n\nSo let's think about Casey's findings. \u00a0Say that you're autistic and you're terrified of dogs, as our girl once was. If we had treated this with exposure therapy (a widely respected treatment for phobias that gradually but repeatedly exposes you to whatever frightens you) then it's highly likely that we would have done a bang-up job of creating a super-phobia in our child.\n\nJust imagine if our girl had been misdiagnosed as having a phobia. Imagine we had pursued exposure therapy. Or worse yet, that we engaged in the non-therapeutic parental version of exposure therapy: \"You just have to get over this -- just pet the damn dog!\" I shudder to think how that might have worked out. By respecting our girl's terror as genuine, and treating her general anxiety with a pharmacological intervention, we now have a girl who'd love to have her own dog.\n\n\"anxiety across diagnoses\": The importance of getting the diagnosis right was underscored in Dr. John Walkup's analysis of the various multiple diagnoses (or co-morbidities) that are often assigned to ourselves or our children. Walkup described the diagnostic process as having two opposing tendencies: \"lumping\" vs. \"splitting.\" \"Lumpers\" aim to pull together characteristics to form a category while \"splitters\" tend to look for the specific or distinctive characteristics of a syndrome, disease, disorder or difference.\u00a0Without accurate diagnoses, Dr. Walkup asserted, one winds up treating symptoms: melatonin may work to treat insomnia, but you might be better off treating the underlying anxiety that's keeping a child awake.\n\n\n\nFrom Dr. Walkup:\nDiagnostic trends can create clusters or move\ntoward greater specificity.\n\nAnxiety is a feature of many different diagnoses. \u00a0Consider the alphabet soup of Dx'es that our girl has had related to her anxiety: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), oppositional defiance disorder (ODD \u2013 my personal favorite because the only thing accurate about it is that she's a little odd, though hardly oppositional), attention deficit disorder (ADD), and finally pervasive-development disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). \u00a0In this slew of labels \u2013 or perhaps we should say \"stew\" \u2013 \u00a0the lumper's diagnosis would be PDD-NOS, because it also included her expressive-receptive language disorder.\n\nWe were fortunate in that her psychiatrist took the initial decision to go the splitting route: the original three diagnoses he provided (ADD, GAD, and mixed expressive-receptive language disorder) entitled her to insurance coverage that would not have been available had she been cast as developmentally-disabled. Things have changed now that insurance coverage of autism treatment is mandated, but that original split set of diagnoses got our girl the best possible combination of psychopharmacological, behavioral, and educational interventions.\n\n\"anxiety in adolescence\": We're a long way from our own early diagnostic days, and with adolescence upon us, the work of Dr. Francis S.Y. Lee on anxiety in adolescence was of particular interest. \u00a0Dr. Lee's presemtation concerned the ways that in typical adolescent development there seem to be developmental \u00a0mechanisms, probably at the molecular level, to repress or mute fear response. Evolutionary biologists think these mechanisms exist to assist adolescents in taking the risks necessary to set out on their own. During such periods of fearlessness (when fearful memories seem to be repressed) the adventures that lead to adulthood can take place. (Or disasters can occur, but let's hold that for another day.)\n\nExtrapolating from mouse models, Lee hypothesizes that there are sensitive periods in adolescence when windows of fear-memory suppression may provide opportunities for pharmacological or behavioral interventions (to re-tune the fear response that is otherwise atypical in individuals with anxiety disorders and ASD). \n\nSpecifically, interventions that raise BDNF (brain derived neurotropic factor) levels may impart beneficial effects on attenuating the fear memory retrieval, and thus alleviate anxiety among the hyper vigilant.\n\n\n\nFrom Dr. Lee: Adolescence is marked by periods of low\nfear response, as shown in this table based on\nlaboratory work with mice.\n\nYou may remember BDNF from the report on last year's Autism Symposium: studies of BDNF hold promise for the treatment of multiple neurological disorders.\u00a0Deficits of BDNF caused by a single genetic variation (called a single\u00a0nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP for the Wikipedia readers among us)\u00a0are implicated in abnormal neuronal development and conditions including autism, depression, anorexia and bulimia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. BDNF can be boosted in various ways (for example, exercise has been shown to increase BDNF).\n\nDr. Lee's research, along with the transitional model for drug discovery described by Dr. Anjali Rajadhyaksha, hold out the possibility of new treatments. \u00a0Instead of simply reducing excessive anxiety with ongoing medication, new medications might modify the chemical mechanisms that make anxiety so dominant in autistics and their families.\n\n\nThe big takeaway from the basic science panel is that while anxiety itself may be unpleasant, in itself it is not the problem. \u00a0Rather, as Dr. Walkup pointed out, it's the life-limiting avoidance coping behavior that makes anxiety disorders so crippling.\n\nWhen our girl was dog phobic, we used to cross the street whenever someone was walking a dog. After a while, we didn't even like going out. Lots and lots of people walk dogs in New York City \u2013 in fact, they're nearly impossible to avoid.\u00a0But thanks to interventions that reduced her anxiety, now we have a happier problem: looking for a dog tiny enough for our apartment or an apartment big enough for our a growing girl and a dog.\n\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 \u2022\n\n\nCheck back in the next few days for reporting on the Clinical Panel which featured a surprise guest, Dr. Martha R. Herbert, who has a new book out on autism and its treatments called Autism Revolution: Whole Body Strategies for Making Life All That It Can Be. Other key presenters were: \u00a0Dr. Catherine Lord, who recently took on the job of directing the\u00a0newly-founded (but not yet up and running) Center for Autism and the Developing Brain, a project of the\u00a0Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital. Dr. Lord's talk offered insights into the upcoming revisions of the DSM that will dramatically alter the checklists for an ASD diagnosis. Dr. Michael Siller shared research on the importance of maternal (or parental) insightfulness in the effectiveness of play therapy; Dr. John Brown\u00a0reported on training kids to imitate their peers in naturalistic settings, and\u00a0Dr. Linda Meyer spoke about meeting the needs of adults on the spectrum and the people who care for them.\n\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 \u2022\n\n\nYou can also follow the Weill Cornell Autism Research Group on Facebook. In a month or so they'll be releasing videotapes of the talks so you can listen for yourself, and see what has the most resonance for you and your family.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://nyp.org/komansky/wcarp", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c_dA38UwCco/T8FujtU-1II/AAAAAAAAAqw/l5I1uND6Aj0/s1600/IMG_8663_basics_science_panel.png", "http://www.sacklerinstitute.org/cornell/people/bj.casey/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7VT0NYl1B8s/T8FpQH_7XTI/AAAAAAAAAqU/CI3Hr2XMlAI/s1600/IMG_8563-atypical+development+anxiety.png", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070413/", "http://www.weillcornell.org/physician/jtwalkup/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UH_jTdWt2a4/T8FpGuuiQ2I/AAAAAAAAAqM/iXYcIpm3BhE/s1600/IMG_8474-walkup-lumpers.png", "http://www.weillcornell.org/physician/fslee/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eIu3S8ju5_E/T8FpYZr-WKI/AAAAAAAAAqc/vDTB-2kNU68/s1600/IMG_8599+adolescence+reduced+fear.png", "http://www.blogger.com/goog_717524500", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism", "http://www.amazon.com/The-Autism-Revolution-Whole-Body-Strategies/dp/0345527194/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1338074129&sr=8-1", "http://www.facebook.com/weillcornellautismresearch"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/05/growing-up-with-autism-life-transitions.html", "title": "\nGrowing Up With Autism: Life Transitions, Part 1\n"},

BlogHer2012 was here in New York City so there was no need to head out to San Diego for that. And my academic professional association was in a city I have little interest in visiting. And I had multiple writing deadlines. But at the heart of it, I just wasn't feeling the pull of the Pacific as I typically do this time of year.\n\n\n\nAutomat interactive installation,\nNYPL Lunch Hour NYC\n\nWhat to do with our girl has been a series of adventures and staycation activities. Along with watching an awful lot of Olympics, we've gone on a number of outings: a visit to the\u00a0Lunch Hour NYC\u00a0exhibition\u00a0at the New York Public Library (a must-see as it's perfect for all ages - especially love the lunch box collection!), a couple of turns up and around the ferris wheel at Toys\"R\"Us Times Square (better for younger kids, but our girl still loves this activity), an adventure at the Terracotta Warriors at the Discovery Center Times Square\u00a0(if you're traveling with the sensory-sensitive, best if you arrive first thing in the morning on a week day so you'll have it mostly to yourself), but the most deeply joyous of our outings has been hyper-local: our girl has been attending the Mulberry Street New York Public Library Tuesday afternoon Crafternoon workshops for teens.\n\n\n\nTerracotta Warrior Photographer\n\nI've had a life-long love affair with public libraries ever since I discovered the local branch of my hometown's library and learned that there was more to read in the world than the biographies of Catholic saints (that's all they had on the shelves of my parochial in-every-sense-of-that-word school library). I think I was semi-permanently damaged by all those narratives of virgin martyrs and immaculate conceptions. The public library saved my life, and certainly my psyche. \u00a0And it seems it's doing something like that for our girl this summer,\u00a0where, even as I write this, she's socializing.\n\nYes, socializing. In fact, they're having an ice cream social today. \n\nLast week they made bead bracelets. Next week they'll decorate their own tote bags. And the week after that they'll make hair accessories.\n\n\n\nPeeking in the Crafternoon celebration at NYPL\nMulberry Street Branch -- a teen-only zone.\n\nIt's hard to describe how important things like this are for all kids, but especially for a kid like our girl, who is slowly figuring out what seem to be the strange steps of the social world. \n\nShe needs this more than she needs just about anything in the world: a place to hang out that's safe and where there are social hurdles, but they're low enough that she can clear them like an Olympian in training. \n\nThanks to the NYPL, for this uber-staycation moment.\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/07/summmmertime-and-livin-is.html", "http://www.autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/08/octopuss-garden-by-sea.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mW_JkJC3CnQ/UCq6Nmy04ZI/AAAAAAAAAso/ClcCtT9vkCQ/s1600/photo(4).JPG", "http://www.nypl.org/audiovideo/lunch-hour-nyc", "http://www.toysrusinc.com/about-us/times-square/", "http://www.discoverytsx.com/exhibitions/terracotta-warriors", "http://www.nypl.org/locations/tid/495/node/174240?lref=495%2Fcalendar", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kI4rb8WYFiY/UCq6SZ_uAnI/AAAAAAAAAs4/iEbKxkGyTIg/s1600/photo(6).JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vrqWvE_YOww/UCq60VthAnI/AAAAAAAAAtA/hhIBfB8DpUY/s1600/photo(7).JPG"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/08/staycation-crafternoons-courtesy-of.html", "title": "\nStaycation Crafternoons, Courtesy of NYPL Mulberry Street\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 05, 2015", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were looking for something special to do in LA that would give our girl a break from the challenges of Dementiaville (aka helping take care of grandma).\n\nOf course our girl Sweet M would always go for Disneyland. But the Magic Kingdom with holiday crowds and a new and\u00a0not-so-great disability access program\u00a0didn't sound too magical to me.\n\nWhere would we find our magic? Turns out it was at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo where the current show is Hello! Exploring the Supercute World of Hello Kitty. Our girl was watching the evening news one night and heard about the exhibition, told me about it, and we got organized to go. I'm so glad we did.\n\n\n\nGown for Lady Gaga made from\nHello Kitty plush toys.\n\nSweet M was enchanted \u2014 she was in what I can only call an aesthetic rapture. Part way through the exhibition she was just exploding with joy: \"It's just *so* beautiful!\" she exclaimed.\u00a0If an anesthetic is supposed to make you feel nothing, an aesthetic should make you feel something. And feeling she was: just thrilled at the scope and scale of the Hello! exhibition \u2014 at the massive, fantastic kawaii cuteness of it all.\n\nAs we turned the corner into the second to last room of the exhibition, slipping passed the gown for Lady Gaga made of Hello Kitty plush toys, I came upon signage that read:\n\nSOCIAL COMMUNICATION\u00a0\n\nOne of Mr. Tsuji's* passions has always been products that foster \"social communication.\" Thus the \"hello\" of Hello Kitty carries the meaning of reaching out in friendship. Sanrio's early goods focused on the means of communication\u2014 such as stationery, pens, and erasers \u2014 each with the cheery visage of Hello Kitty. . . .\u00a0\nAnd then, on the very next wall:\n\nFor some Western critics, Hello Kitty's mouthlessness symbolized powerlessness.\nBut Japanese people understand things differently. They assume Hello Kitty's design to be an abstraction. A typical Japanese comment: \"Hello Kitty has no mouth? I never noticed.\"\nI had never noticed either, so it's not just a Japanese thing. No mouth! And social communication as the emphasis of the earliest product lines . . . \u00a0How perfect is it that the Kitty is one of the characters my communication-challenged girl loves most?\n\nAnd the fact that there was a dress worn by Lady Gaga in the show made this outing even cool enough for her to talk about today, the first day back to school.\u00a0As you may know from earlier posts here, finding a way to love what she loves\u00a0and still be cool isn't the easiest thing for this seventeen-year-old Kitty fan. But Hello Kitty works some magic, making her developmentally atypical tastes a moment of cool.\n\nThank you Kitty-creator Mr. Shintaro Tsuji and exhibition curators\u00a0Christine Yano and Jamie Rivadeneira! You've made one autie-Kitty-lover and her mom ever so happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Mr. Tsuji is Hello Kitty's creator and the CEO of Sanrio that markets the Kitty's product line.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lovethatmax.com/2014/01/how-disney-disability-card-works.html", "http://www.janm.org/exhibits/hellokitty/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2015/01/hello-kitty-magic.html", "title": "\nHello Kitty Magic\n"},

On our girl's list of things she wanted to do in LA were: Disneyland. A waterpark (preferably Six Flags). And Rodeo Drive. Yes, Rodeo Drive. \n\n\n\nI'm not sure where she got the idea that Rodeo Drive was worth seeing \u2013 we've never been exactly a label-obsessed family (unless Hanna Andersson counts for baby clothes) \u2013 but she was seriously interested in seeing these four blocks in Beverly Hills. Disneyland in August heat wasn't going to happen. I soured on waterparks a few years ago after an unfortunate encounter with a waterslide. So Rodeo Drive was on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadgley Mischka Shop, Rodeo Drive\n\nOur girl was thrilled, eager to see what ultralux commodities were there on display. The first store we checked out was Badgley Mischka, with their shimmering chiffon evening gowns. Sweet M was enthralled looking at them, gently touching the poof of ruffles on one gown, dazzled by the jewels on another. All was well until a haughty sales person came over any said, \"Please don't touch the gowns \u2013 they're very delicate. You can just touch the hangers to move them.\" To my surprise, the saleswoman's attitude rolled right off our girl. I guess that's the beauty of missing nonverbal signals in social communication.\n\n\nSweet M just went about exploring everything, but no longer touched anything. I was less sanguine, and said, \"You know, my daughter is on the autism spectrum, and she learns by looking and touching, but she's also very rule bound, so she won't be touching anything else here.\" \u00a0She looked at me, icily, and said, 'Well, that's good.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis did not bode well for our continued Rodeo Drive visit. Sweet M would be just fine, but I might experience some class-induced emotional dysregulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHappily, every other store was amazing and welcoming: Max Mara, the Porsche Design Store, Christian Dior, Tiffany, Chanel. The staff were warm and friendly, apparently accustomed to visits from tourists from the 99% and accommodating of an autie teen girl thrilled to visit what she called \"the lap of luxury.\" It seemed the higher end the store, the more gracious the staff were.\n\n\n\nOn our way back to the car we walked by the Badgley Mischka shop and looked in the front door. Amazingly, our previously haughty retail staffer was clowning around with an African American colleague, holding up one of the very precious gowns in front of herself.\n\nI wondered what it's like to be a retail salesperson on Rodeo Drive, catering to the rich and their personal assistants while, perhaps, passing along a bit of attitude when you can. Thankfully, our girl hadn't notice any attitude; she was thrilled with her day.\u00a0She's much less fragile than any evening gown, and ever so much more dazzling.\u00a0\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0QOOyeHhIvE/UhEUpzvH4KI/AAAAAAAAA04/PAQPBsGVh48/s1600/badgley+mischka+salesfolks.png"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2013/08/autisms-edges-visits-lap-of-luxury.html", "title": "\nAutism's Edges Visits the Lap of Luxury\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, June 16, 2012", "body": "\n\n\n\nNote: This is the third of three posts reporting on the\u00a0Weill Cornell Autism Research Project (WCARP) Autism Symposium 2012\u00a0held at\u00a0Weill Cornel Medical College in New York City on Friday, May 11, 2012. Usually I aim to report on events within a week or so, but May and June have been crazy busy with graduations at the college where I teach, summer session intensive classes, and our girl's upcoming graduation from middle school that this post has been postpone and postponed! \u00a0More on the girl's upcoming graduation soon, but today, the WCARP wrap up!\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022\n\nAlthough anxiety was the leitmotif of the Autism Symposium 2012, there were moments of hope on the horizon as well.\n\n\nIn the world of autism, hope comes in at least two very different flavors. \u00a0The first is the hope for cures or interventions to mitigate the aspects of autism that can create profound limitations on an individual's quality of life. And the second is the hope for a world that can embrace, support and honor autistic individuals regardless of their degree of capacity.\n\nOf course the two are not mutually exclusive: one can hope for interventions to improve a family member's quality of life and work for a world where an autism spectrum disorder does not limit a person's opportunities for a full, rich, and rewarding quality of life. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Martha Herbert's \nnew book on\nautism interventions\n\nOne speaker at the Autism Symposium 2012 who wove these two threads of the autism discourse together was Martha R. Herbert, a professor of neurology at Harvard University whose new book The Autism Revolution: Whole Body Strategies for Making Life All It Can Be\u00a0offers parents of children on the spectrum some of the latest science on autism interventions. \u00a0Herbert observes that studies of identical twins, one with autism and the other without, make clear that autism is a condition of both genetics and environment. \u00a0That is, autism is an epigenetic condition. \u00a0\n\n\n\nDr. Herbert's presentation underscored that autistics are not \"broken for life,\" and, that in fact, there are numerous cases of individuals who lose their diagnoses (and not simply because the diagnostic criteria are in flux). \u00a0One of the most interesting aspects of Herbert's presentation was her reporting on the research of Ananth Narayanan and his colleagues, whose pilot study using propranolol (an old-fashioned blood pressure medication) suggests that this beta-blocker can increase neural connectivity in the brains of autistic individuals. \u00a0\n\n\n\nPropanolol has also recently been used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder with considerable success. This, of course, made me reflect on the huge language-acquistion gains that our girl made when her anxiety was first treated with Paxil. Perhaps reducing the anxiety that comes with autism helps increase the signal to noise ratio in the brain, and therefore alleviates other life-impairing aspects of autism. The less anxiety is being transmitted over the neural networks of the brain, the more opportunity there is for other meaningful connections being made.\n\n\n\nAlong with reporting on these research developments, Herbert also underscored that autistic individuals are often mis-assessed in terms of their intelligence. Citing the work of Michelle Dawson and her colleagues, Herbert noted that cognitive impairment in persons on the spectrum is over-reported because intelligence tests that rely almost exclusively on language processing (such as the Weschler IQ test) are typically administered. A more appropriate test for assessing intelligence in autistic persons is the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices. So not only are autistics not \"broken for life,\" perhaps they are not broken at all. \u00a0Rather, many are simply be working with a very different perceptual system that heightens anxiety and affects other neurological processes.\n\n\nWhether or not one imagines one child or one's self as in need of repair, interventions, healing, or cures, nearly everyone agrees that there is much more to be done in the work of creating contexts and communities where persons on the spectrum can realize their full potential and live rich and rewarding lives. \u00a0The afternoon sessions of the Autism Symposium took up these questions, but regrettably ran concurrently, so participants had to choose a session based on the age group that held the most interest for them. \u00a0I wanted to go to the 18 and above group (where our girl will be headed and for which Michael John Carley of GRASP was a speaker), but opted for 14-18 year old group that we're currently navigating and where speakers presented on resources for parents and kids on the spectrum.\nbreakout\n\n\nDr. Carole Gothelf of AHRC on aspirations forpersons with developmental differences\u00a0\n\nRonni Miller, who chairs the WCARP Parents Committee reported on inclusive programs to assist with social skills (check back at the WCARP site for slides of her presentation and the enormous list of resources she shared); \u00a0Dr. Carole Gothelf discussed planning for life after high school, and Catherine Jones and Valencia Small discussed issues of adolescence and sex education for teens on the spectrum. \u00a0As this was a small group, there was also time for parents and professionals to discuss confounding problems.\n\nAn issue that emerged from the discussion is that fact (a shocking one to me) is that there are no \u2013 zero, none, not a one\u00a0\u2013 inpatient psychiatric facilities for adolescents in the city of New York. \u00a0One parent reported the crisis of navigating a medication change in her adolescent son and finding him committed to an adult psychiatric ward after she called 911 for assistance.\u00a0Another breakout group participant mentioned the\u00a0widely reported tragedy of a boy in late adolescence (a 19-year-old college student) whose epilepsy medication had been increasing his aggression and who wound up pummeling his mother to death. These stories underscored the on-going need to insist on better services to keep our kids, ourselves, and the many people who care for them, safe and well.\n\nEnsuring that our kids on the spectrum have access to all aspects of a full life \u2013 work, friends, health, safety, and homes of their choice \u2013 is the underlying goal that remains constant amidst transitions across a lifetime. Programs like the WCARP Autism Symposium, focused this year on lifte transitions, help to support and facilitate this constant and ongoing work.\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://nyp.org/komansky/patient_care/centers_programs/wcarp/autism_symposium.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-91wR4JHNll0/T932PjcPfPI/AAAAAAAAAr0/h3me8Mm2hO4/s1600/herbert_autism_revolution.JPG", "http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-autism-revolution-dr-martha-herbert/1104154476?ean=9780345527196", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881209/", "http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticIntelligence_PS_2007.pdf", "http://nyp.org/komansky/patient_care/centers_programs/wcarp/index.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/nyregion/911-calls-capture-killing-of-teacher-her-son-is-arraigned.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/06/growing-up-with-autism-life-transitions.html", "title": "\nGrowing Up with Autism: Life Transitions, Part 3\n"},

Right?\" from\nwww.supportforspecialneeds.com.\nTwo weeks back I was finally getting around to storing the things from the BlogHer swag bags I'd hauled home from San Diego. The electric orange stress balls from Support for Special Needs were on top of the swag bags just as our girl was getting her backpack ready for school. Without much thought, I tossed one to her and asked if she'd like to take one to school to make the first day easier. Sure, she'd said, and tucked it into her backpack.\n\nWhen I'd picked up the three stress balls after the special needs mini-conference at BlogHer 2011, I hadn't been thinking of anything in particular. To tell you the truth, I don't really understand stress balls, probably because my anxiety doesn't come out in fidgeting. But\u00a0I so loved the humor that\u00a0Support for Special Needs had squeezed onto them (\"Stressed? It's going to take more than\u00a0a squishy ball. Right?\") that I'd taken enough for juggling.\n\nNot surprisingly, our girl's first day back to school was stressful for her and for us. Nothing new in that.\u00a0It's pretty much the same every year: even though her school is lovely, even though she knows all the kids, even though she has just a short bus ride to get there, and even though her teachers are loving and kind, she still cried, in her words, \"all day.\" She cried the second day and third day and much of the first two weeks. She tells us that she cried because everyone talks too much and there is too much noise. But this year she commented that she\u00a0squished the squishy ball and that helped, too.\n\nHer principal and teachers reported that she'd cried just a little, not all day and much less than last year, but that she'd kept the stress ball with her everywhere and it seemed to work so well for her. \u00a0They were obviously pleased. Squishing a stress ball is okay. Crumbling up paper and grinding pencils into desk tops is not preferred.\u00a0Something in the tone of their reports seemed to be congratulating us on thinking of sending it in, but actually it was a happy accident: the coincidence of unpacking a swag bag that contained a little bit of the genuis of www.supportforspecialneeds.com and packing up a backpack for the first day of school. \u00a0We had our \"no ideas but in things\" start to the school year, thanks to Support for Special Needs. Now we only have to find more things that work for our girl so that she's not in tears every September.\n\nI think we're going to need an awfully big educational reform swag bag to hold everything we need.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x3XW_TE2ySU/TnSfrwaqOiI/AAAAAAAAAos/ayQGYv2ecqc/s1600/photo.JPG", "http://www.supportforspecialneeds.com/", "http://www.supportforspecialneeds.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Carlos_Williams"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/09/swag-or-genius-in-things.html", "title": "\nSwag: Or the Genius in Things\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 07, 2012", "body": "\nRight now, as I write this, our girl and her dad are in the living room. \u00a0She is reading aloud from a book called Barron's Painless Earth Science. \u00a0I know, I know, this is not a very summery thing to be doing on the weekend after the 4th of July. \u00a0Prepping for Regent's exams that she won't take until next June is just about no one's idea of summer fun.\n\nBut that's what we do. \u00a0That's our sort of summer fun.\n\nJust now I can hear her reading about the phenomenon of urban heat: how the concrete and asphalt of the city absorbs more solar radiation than the surrounding countryside, and so the city gets hotter than the country.\n\nEven so, we're not headed to the beach (too bright, too hot, sand too scratchy, waves too loud). \u00a0And we are not headed to the pool (too old for the kiddie pool we long enjoyed and the other pool is too big, too loud, too deep, with too many kids, and much, much too splashy.)\n\nWe're staying in, enjoying the miracle that is air conditioning, and reading earth science. \n\n\n\nThe other night we did not head over to the Hudson River to watch the fireworks. \u00a0In years past we were able to just hang out at the edge of the river, near our neighborhood, but last year the NYPD roped off our shoreline and forced us north. With every bump and bustle I could feel our girl's anxiety (and mine) rising until I hailed a cab to get us out of the crush of people. \n\nThis year we stayed in: we watched the fireworks on TV. \u00a0Our girl was thrilled -- she waved her American flag in front of the TV and exclaimed \"Happy birth-day, America\" as she reveled in the music of pop stars she knows (and that we don't).\n\n\"This,\" she exclaimed with unbridled joy, \"is the best Fourth of July ever -- no crowds, no heat, and we can see everything!\"\n\nAs Jess at Diary of a Mom writes beautifully, autism families adapt. \u00a0That's what we do. \u00a0That's how we roll.\n\nThe struggle, at least for me, still comes from the oughts, or what I long ago dubbed, the \"ought-ism.\"\n\nIt's summer, so I feel as though we ought to go to the beach, or at least to the local pool. \u00a0It's the Fourth of July, and we live in New York City, so I feel as though we ought to go to the Macy's fireworks show on the Hudson River. \u00a0It's summer, and I feel as though she ought to go to camp, or on a cross country trip, or do something besides watching TV, playing video games, and reading the Barron's Painless Earth Science prep book. \u00a0I feel as though she's 14, she ought to have a friend by now, even if that's just one good friend. \u00a0And I feel as though I ought to be a better parent \u2014 ought to have her summer programmed for the greatest possible social, emotional, and academic growth. \n\nAnd this whole litany of expectations banishes me from the magic of our lives together. \n\nI try to shake it. I do my best to throw off what the Buddhists call the secondary suffering that takes what is and layers on top of it a set of judgments of what ought to be, of how we ought to be, about how I ought to be. Some days I get there, other days I just don't. \n\nOddly enough, this becomes just another in the litany of oughts:\u00a0that I ought to always be present to the magic of her life.\n\nSometimes I'm not. \u00a0Sometimes I wish things were different. \u00a0I wish she was headed off to camp to meet up with friends who love her. I wish she were begging to go out to the swimming pool, and that she could swim well enough to make that possible. I wish we were bicycling on the Hudson River Park bike path. \u00a0I wish we were headed across the country on a big impromptu \"stop where you will\" road trip, or off to Paris to visit her father's cousins and see the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAnd then I have to stop, and look back to the beginning of this post: \"Right now, as I write this, our girl and her dad are in the living room. \u00a0She is reading aloud from a book . . .\". \u00a0\n\nShe is reading. \u00a0Aloud. \u00a0From a book.\n\nThat was \"the ought\" that got this blog started: that she ought to learn to read, even if her her genuinely devoted teachers at the time were finding this assignment too daunting. \n\nSo what ought we go for next? \u00a0The social skills of friendship look every bit as daunting as reading once did. \u00a0And then there are the ancillary recreational skills of swimming, bike riding, volleyball or tennis. \n\nIt's a delicate balance between acceptance and advocacy, between embracing the girl we have while opening the door for the young woman she's becoming.\n\nI'd like to say that this balance is like bike riding: that once you've done it once it comes naturally. But it seems I'm still in need of training wheels.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/not-on-our-watch/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/07/oughtism-revisited.html", "title": "\nOughtism Revisited\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 29, 2011", "body": "\nOne of the worst things about eighth grade for our girl is the ringing of the bells between periods. Every time the alarm sounds, it jangles her keenly sensitive auditory neural pathways, and sets off a cascade of neurotransmitters to generate a flood of adrenaline. Instead of shrugging and heading from class to class, she races through the hallways as though pursued by a saber tooth tiger or a pack of wolves (not to mention the threat of detention for tardiness). When she hears a bell she'll plough right through any obstacle \u2014 inanimate or animate \u2014 to ensure that she's on time to her next class.\n\nThe excruciating (for our girl) sound of the school bell is, according to educator Cathy N. Davidson, one of the many remnants of an educational infrastructure designed to create the compliant and synchronized industrial workforce needed to populate the factories and offices of 20th century America. The bells, the desks in rows, the proscenium stage set of chalkboard with teachers at lecterns, the out-of-date textbooks, the separate vocational and college tracks, and the standardized multiple choice tests (the results of which can shape the course of a life) are the educational dead weight of the industrial age that could keep our country from realizing the genius needed to succeed in the current century and the future it holds. \n\nTwice in the past month I've had the pleasure of hearing Davidson talk about her new book,\u00a0Now You See It: How the Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work and Learn,\u00a0which takes up these and other problems (and possibilities) created by the disjunction between our neurobiology and the structures of our schools and workplaces. Along the way, Davidson's\u00a0research on neuroscience has led her to consider the anomalies found among kids like ours.\n\nIn a particularly evocative section of Now You See It, Davidson writes about the fate of children with Williams Syndrome across cultural contexts. In the United States, where happiness and effusiveness are considered virtues, the ebullient and embracing nature of Williams Syndrome kids make them more lovable and socially acceptable. \u00a0However in the context of Japan, where a reserved demeanor is valued, Williams Syndrome children are more likely to be institutionalized \u2014 possibly because of their (perceived) rude and intrusive behavior.\n\nReading this passage had me thinking about the social deficits that our girl has. She's on the other end of the emotional continuum from the Williams Syndrome kids. Our sweet girl is by no means warm and cuddly. She rarely engages in the back and forth of tween girlhood. She's not what anyone who'd just met her would call friendly or welcoming. Smiling is just not a default facial expression for her. In short, she lacks those social skills that are so highly rewarded in the \"how to win friends and influence people\" American context. Her reserved nature would be a problem for any kid, but it's especially a problem for a girl. While good cheer and an affable nature are valued in middle class American boys and men, they are all but required among the girls and women of this group.\nOur girl's social reticence is a very real phenomenon, but it is the social requirement of female friendliness that transforms her particular affect from a simple fact to a significant handicap.\u00a0\nAs our girl shoves her way through the hallway to get to class on time she is not just frantic\u00a0and rude, she's also unladylike, ungracious, and simply less lovable. She's violating the social norms of her nation, as well as for her gender and her class. I am painfully aware of how she seems to others -- remote, rude, awkward, pushy.\n\nSometimes I wonder if things would be better for our girl in Tokyo, home of the Pok\u00e9mon and Yu-Gi-Oh she loves. There she would be strange, but her strangeness would be chalked up to being a foreigner, to being\u00a0gaijin as I once was.

Our girl also has challenging food requirements; we have to carry food with us on almost all flights. We need to keep the food from spoiling, so we have tried to use ice packs. Try getting ice packs through a TSA check point. Have a go at that.\u00a0\n\nOne airline \u2013 which had promised us (a family of 3) seats together \u2013 decided, on the morning of the flight, that we could all sit separately. This took 45 tense minutes prior to the flight to almost solve. And this was after we had already arrived 3 hours early (at 4am) to ensure we'd get disability seating. We were all already exhausted before we even boarded.\n\nWe do as much as possible to plan ahead. Sometimes it's just not possible.\u00a0\n\nBut it is distressing to read all these comments second-guessing the mom:\n\nKeep a hot meal ready at hand? Sure thing.\u00a0\n\n\nAlways speak with total courtesy to dismissive flight attendants. Check.\u00a0\n\n\nWalk 1,000 miles rather than take a commercial flight. Got it.\u00a0\n\n\nPony up for first class at $1000+ per seat. Whatever you say. Will do that right after our health insurance reimburses us for the therapy we have to fight about every month\u00a0or agrees to cover the medication our daughter needs for her gastrointestinal issues.\u00a0\n\n\nCall the airline ahead. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.\n\nStay home and lock your kid in a closet seems to be what you're recommending. That was fashionable in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2015", "body": "\n\"Aim low,\" advised MOM-NOS. Years ago this wise autism mom described the perils of having one's child described as \"high functioning\" and the risks of being shortchanged on the supports and services that can make his or her so-called high-functioning possible.\n\nI've kept MOM-NOS's advice in mind over these years as we've tried to navigate a path for our girl that neither underestimates her potential nor overstates her functioning. Sometimes I fear we have aimed too high. Often I feel that she has had inadequate supports because we elected to keep her at a school that has high academic standards, but very minimal scaffolding for social communication issues.\n\nSo with the \"aim low\" advice echoing in my mind, and as our girl's 18th birthday approaches, I have found myself in the sometimes unsettling position of applying for Social Security disability for our girl one week and going on college admissions tours the next.\n\nThe transition planning materials I've been reading say it is imperative to apply for SSI before the child's 18th birthday. A good friend has nagged me, saying it would be irresponsible to not get our girl the aid that she needs now, and may need in the future. Our girl's school principal advised us to put in her application. And the final push came when I listened to a gentleman our age recount the nightmare of trying to get SSI for his autistic adult brother because, in his words, his parents had been too proud to ask for help. Our girl has no siblings to help her in the future, so it's up to us to get what she needs set up for her.\n\nDealing with the Social Security Administration has been a surprisingly good experience. The care and support of the people there has made me want to urge Congress to up their budget, expand their services, and ensure that a citation of excellence be awarded to the agent that handled our case.\n\nAnd yet. And yet. The requirement of abject debility in order to secure the supports one needs to foster and realize potential remains the autism parent's conundrum.\n\nAt one point in the phone interview our SSA agent remarked that this case should be a presumptive determination in our girl's favor because our girl would be permanently disabled. She'll be entitled to these benefits for the rest of her life, he assured me.\n\nI knew I was meant to feel happy, relieved and grateful, but you know that my heart sank.\n\nIf this were one of the 1950s Tom & Jerry cartoons our girl likes to watch, my heart would have fallen from my chest and crashed through the seven apartment floors below us and landed in the basement, next to the boiler, bruised, broken, in need of bandages.\n\nOuch. Permanently disabled. Entitled to a tiny (though admittedly helpful) $500-700 for the rest of her life. Restricted from having more that $2000 in assets. Limited to earning $1000 a dollars a month or less.\n\nThe next week the SSI paperwork arrived and I sat down to review it, required to certify, under penalty of perjury, that the contents were accurate. The management and reporting on her benefit was assigned to me because, according to the paperwork, she suffers from \"mental retardation.\"\n\n\n\nOur girl's watercolor, 2009\n\nYes, that was the language. Mental retardation.\n\nI winced. Apart from this not being accurate \u2014 we had never discussed our girl's IQ, which is pretty average as IQs go \u2014 mental retardation? \u00a0Do we even say that anymore? Isn't there a national campaign to end the use of the R-word?\n\nI phoned the Social Security agent to correct this point, and he was so apologetic. Yes, he said, no one uses that language anymore, but that's just one of the only boxes we can check. Some people, he said, call and yell at me about this, but it's really just the form.\n\nWe corrected the record for our girl by using the box for \"Other, please specify\" and noted that she needs assistance with her funds because autistic communication impairments make money management ill advised. I wanted to add \"at this time\" to leave wide open the door for her to manage her own affairs, but I didn't want to push it. A presumptive determination in her favor would be a great help for our girl.\n\nAs I searched for ways to reconcile the lows and the highs of this transition planning time, I came across this watercolor that our girl painted some years ago of a rocket against a field of blue, aimed at an amber sphere. At the risk of sinking into a banal metaphor, I'm no longer thinking of us as aiming low, as wise as MOM-NOS's advice has been. Now I imagine us shoring up the launch pad for our girl, making sure the ground is stable and firm, finding a way to set the stage for her launch, but allowing the destination and trajectory to be her own.\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/10/high-cost-of-high-function.html", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/docs/family_services_docs/transition/New_York.pdf", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0ZWK5_8Lnug/VkImXpukt4I/AAAAAAAAAFg/yAf9XngKZ-A/s1600/rocket%2Bwatercolor%2B4.jpeg"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2015/11/on-aiming-low.html", "title": "\nOn Aiming Low\n"},

The principal was also calling to\u00a0talk about the upcoming IEP meeting: about whether we could somehow get the Department of Education to support summer services for our girl, or whether we should be pushing to move her to a school with an 11-month program and a much longer commute.\n\nSo once again, we arrived back at the question of what is an appropriate setting for our girl. That has been the question that has animated this blog from the outset: what sort of world will work for a girl on the edges of the autism spectrum?\n\nWhen I'm confronted with these very difficult life questions \u2014 the kind of questions that ask you to make decisions on behalf of someone you love without really having any idea of what would be best (or even good enough) \u2014 I sometimes run in the opposite direction. \u00a0Instead of going to one of the many Autism Awareness Month events around the city where the Empire State Building was bathed in blue light, I ran full tilt away from the problems at hand.\u00a0Instead of going to an autism event, I went to hear British cultural theorist Sara Ahmed talk about her project \"The Willfulness Archive.\"\n\nAhmed is exploring the role of willfulness in the struggle against oppression and collecting these stories of willful subjects in what she envisions as a mobile archive. She opened her talk by reading a tale called \"The Willful Child,\" from the Brothers Grimm:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a child who was willful, and would not doeth as her mother wished. For this reason God had no pleasure in her, and let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a short time she lay on her death-bed. When she had been lowered into her grave, and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm came out again, and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in and spread fresh earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm always came out again. Then the mother herself was obliged to go to the grave, and strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that, it was drawn in, and then at last the child had rest beneath the ground.\nTale #117 is among the grimmest of the Grimms' household tales, and I found the story particularly difficult to hear. Ahmed unpacked the story quite brilliantly as a metonym for the willfulness of oppressed and marginalized persons who refuse to go along and get along. I heard the tale somewhat more literally: as an account of the struggle of autistic children and their mothers carried down to us through folklore. \n\nAt first my thoughts went to the most literal cases of the mothers (and fathers) who murder their children on the spectrum \u2014 the ones who beat them or strangle them or poison them or toss them out of windows or off of bridges. My thoughts went to the newspaper headlines that try to explain what everyone imagines as unthinkable: the murder of children who fail to conform and seem to be never at rest, even in their sleep.\n\nThen, following on path of explication that Ahmed explored, I asked myself, what is the rod that the mother wields? \u00a0Is it the psychopharmacology that makes it possible for our girl to sit still enough to do her school work, make her paintings, and engage in the occasional conversation? Is it the applied behavioral analysis that made it possible for her to gain some capacity to comply? \u00a0Is it the school bell that startles her into the conformity required by the school day? Is it the very diagnoses of autism, of ADHD, of Oppositional Defiance Disorder, that takes her neurology and renders it as pathology.\n\nIs it the incapacity to comply what we are diagnosing when we diagnose these \"disorders\"? Should cultivating the capacity to go along to get along always be viewed as oppression? And if not, when is it not oppression? \u00a0How (or rather, to what extent) is the parent's desire to ease a child's way in the world hijacked by other forces that wish to exact a complacent conformity?\n\nThe willful girl's arm rises from the grave. Our girl waves her raised hand frantically in the hope of being able to remember her answer long enough to have it in mind when she's called on. Our girl raises her hand because she longs to belong, longs to get along, longs to be able to go along.\u00a0So would another two months of school each year, another two months where there is so much to go along with, be a way to help her thrive, or just an extended blow to crush her into a deadened conformity?\n\nToday is a religious holiday of rebirth: a day for writing of bunnies and bird's eggs, of renewal and of budding possibilities. The ghastly arm rising from the grave is a very different sort of resurrection than one typically imagines on a day set aside by the Christian religions for celebrating renewal and rebirth. Partial, grasping, longing, the willful child reaches out to connect, to find a way to grow tall and strong. How do we reach back with open arms?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W7m6Clw3Kk4/T4HQyimzn6I/AAAAAAAAAp4/mzElzjfl5lc/s1600/empirestatebuilding.png", "http://centerforthehumanities.org/events/A-Willfulness-Archive", "http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/grimms/117wilfullchild.html", "http://liveslosttoautism.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/04/willful-child.html", "title": "\nThe Willful Child\n"},

From a pedagogical point of view, I wonder how I might use these interests to build out Sweet M's capacity to summarize and generalize, two of the areas of formal education that remain a challenging.Along with the lovely, if too short, visit with our neighbor and friend today, the day also brought Parent Conference Day.  We used to loathe the day, for even if there were no long faces and stories of putatively impossible challenges, there was always the othering, the endless othering. The stories of why she wasn't like the other kids, the stories about how, even though this was a school for kids with language-based learning disabilities, the her particular language-based learning disability was, well, just too much of a disability.So can I tell you how fabulous it is to go to a parent-teacher conference and hear stories of spontaneous conversations that Sweet M has struck up with her peers and teachers?  Can I tell you how wonderful it is to get a list of actual challenges rather than a global dismissal of her potential?  Can I tell you how much I love these middle school teachers and their principal?  It would be hard for me to express it, other than to say that I love them as much as Sweet M loves Pok\u00e9mon, and then maybe just a bit more.It's so much easier to learn when you love what you're learning, and when the folks you're learning with love you, too.  Pok\u00e9mon, our neighbor, her daughter, Sweet M, the middle school teachers, and social worker, and principal, today it's just a love-fest all around.  If I were to have my own Pok\u00e9mon character, the creature would be called LiLoLe: for life love learning (a constantly evolving type).\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/06/pokemon-and-lilole.html", "title": "\nPok\u00e9mon and LiLoLe\n"},

She loves to inspect all the cooking gadgets \u2014 the cherry pitters, the garlic presses, and the vast array of pepper and salt mills.After we've looked at all the kitchen gadgets, we work our way through the small appliances \u2014 the espresso makers, rice cookers, slow cookers, blenders, mixers, and summer cooking specials like Weber grills and ice cream makers.When we're done in the kitchen section, we head upstairs to the furniture displays in a vast space where one can walk from area to area where sample sectional sofas and coffee tables are setup in mock living rooms, bedroom sets are displayed with lovely linens, and patio furniture waits for a lazy summer afternoon under canvas umbrellas.Usually we'll settle into one of the living room floor sample set-ups and have a rest and a chat.  The space is peaceful because it's large and open and airy, and, of course because there is none of the detritus of daily life that accumulates in an actual home of any kind, and that overflows our city apartment.Today she told me, when I'm grown up I'm going to marry a rich guy so that I can have nice furniture like this.I told her that marrying someone rich is certainly one option, but that she might also be an important artist and sell her artwork for a great deal of money.  Or that she might want to do something else.No, she said, I think I'll just marry a rich guy.  He can work.So asked what she would do all day while her husband went to work.  Wouldn't she be bored?No, she said, I'll go to science museums.I think we may have the makings of a science museum docent here. But in the meantime I think I may need to consider doing some redecorating so she won't come to the conclusion that women who work for a living are condemned to bad furniture.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/06/pleasures-of-floor-samples.html", "title": "\nThe Pleasures of Floor Samples\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 22, 2006", "body": "\nIt was a bad, bad week at Autism's Edges.We are told by some autism advocates that we should never feel despair, nor wish we were dead, nor wish that we could  hurdle ourselves and our sweet children from great heights to some sort of fantasized oblivion where, in our darkest moments, we might imagine that that there would be a place in the world, if not for us, for our inert bodies.Yes, it has been a bad \u2014 very bad \u2014 week at Autism's Edges.Oddly enough, it started with a note home from the school about the buses.  There have been problems with the buses.  Apparently the buses are not arriving to school on time, and by the middle of the week it was taking two hours for Sweet M's bus to travel thirty-two blocks coming home in the afternoon.  Two hours \u2014 yes, two hours \u2014 to travel 32 blocks.The buses that serve Sweet M's school also serve two other schools, one of which is near the UN.  And George W. Bush, along with a whole host of presidential types from around the world were clogging up the tiny island of Manhattan with their motorcades, and blocked streets, and security check points.  But that was not what the note was about.The note was about the other schools served by the buses.  About how those other schools serve children with neurological and emotional problems that cause them to have disturbing behaviors.  About how \"our kids\" don't have those kinds of behaviors, and \"our kids\" are very very upset to see those behaviors.  And about how all of us should write to the agency in charge of the buses to make sure that our children don't have to be bussed on the same buses as \"those children\"  \u2014  you know, the ones with disturbing behaviors.  You see, the kids at Sweet M's school are supposedly without any neurological or emotional issues.  The kids at Sweet M's school are LD \u2014 not, horror or horrors, ED (emotionally disturbed) \u2014 as though the two were not intimately interconnected.I read the note with a sinking feeling.  Freud has a very useful construct to describe the phenomenon where members of an oppressed group direct their own aggression and hatred toward those who are almost exactly like themselves \u2014 and treat those who would be their natural allies with all the hatred and contempt that they themselves have experienced, often times ten.  He calls this \"the narcissism of minor differences.\"  So the lighter skinned African-American may spurn the darker, and the green Irish and orange Irish collide, the person insecure in their own sexual identity ridicules the homosexual, and high-functioning and more impaired auties and their allies parse the differences, the distinctions, the nuances.I knew that any letter home from school that made children with behavioral issues into the damaging and threatening Other did not bode well for Sweet M.And sure enough, by the end of the day yesterday a series of ineptitudes of several varieties resulted in Sweet M having not one, but two, massive meltdowns at school.We were told that she cannot come to school today as a consequence.  She's suspended.I protested that punishing her for behavior that is out of her control, and was precipitated at least in part by adult ineptitude,  is like punishing a person for having a seizure \u2014 after you've forced them to stare at a strobe light.They did not agree, so Sweet M stayed home, and instead of doing the remunerative work I need to do to support our fragile family, I called around in search of other schools  \u2014 as if there were any that I haven't already seen.So I am enraged, and I am outraged.   It is perhaps fortunate that alternating between despair and fury renders me so exhausted that I feel confident that I am no danger to myself or others.Of course the question remains: Is there any place in the world for my sweet (and sometimes sour) kid?Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  learning disabilities  \u2022  speech-language disorders  \u2022  parenting   \u2022   education   \u2022  special education\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.historyguide.org/europe/freud_discontents.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/09/narcissism-of-minor-differences.html", "title": "\nThe Narcissism of Minor Differences\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, October 10, 2010", "body": "\n\nBack when I was a college student -- a long, long time ago in the faraway land of Southern California -- I had to drive quite a long way to the campus where I was studying.  And during those long commutes in my ancient VW, I would listen to the AM radio.  I heard a lot of music that I might not otherwise have chosen: Top-Ten-type-tunes by bands like Fleetwood Mac, songs like Landslide, with a chorus that goes like this:\n\nI've been afraid of changing 'Cause I built my life around you.But time makes you bolderChildren get olderAnd I'm getting older too.\nAnd so when I heard that tune on my Pandora Internet \"Roche Sisters\" radio station, I was taken back in time.  And then I landed back in the the present . . . or rather the very recent past.\nLast week the sweet girl went on a field trip.  An overnight field trip.  Well, not just an overnight field trip, but a three-days and two-nights field trip.  On her own.  With her classmates.  Without me.  Without her dad.  Without us.  \nIt was something else.  Something entirely new for us.  Two days without the sweet girl.  We were sort of sad.  The apartment felt empty without her bouncing in at 3 pm from her bus and trudging off at 7:30 in the morning, or handing over the TV remote at 8:30 in the evening with her routine announcement: \"You can watch your show now -- I'm going to take a shower.\"  \nLast year when she had a field trip like this, we surreptitiously shadowed her.  The school knew.   And she knew.  But her classmates didn't know.  We called it Operation Secret Parents.\nBut this year, with just a little trepidation, she was ready to go it alone.  In fact, I think she was readier than I was.  But off she went, with her suitcase, sleeping bag, and backpack.\nIn the middle of the trip we got just one email, from school, saying she was having a fabulous time. \nWhen I picked her up at school on Friday, she gathered together her stuff -- suitcase, sleeping bag, backpack -- turned around to her classmates, and said, with perfect preteen inflection: \"Uh, later guys.\"\nSeveral called out, \"Bye, M___.  Have a great weekend, M____.\"\nShe hasn't said too much about the trip.  They picked apples and made apple cider.  They went on a long, long hike all the way to a waterfall.  And among her favorite things: this bird expert, who showed the kids a falcon and an owl.  She told me he even brought a dead mouse, and fed it to the owl.\n\"Was that gross?\" I asked.\n\"No,\" she exclaimed, \"It was so cool.  And there was a snake man, too.  He had a huge yellow snake. It was so big that two people had to carry it in.  It was shedding. And we got to pet it! Its skin was so dry.\"\nSo things do change.  Skins are shed, wings are spread.

{"date": "Saturday, December 02, 2006", "body": "\nNot long ago I heard an Asperger's mom to the second power \u2014 that is, a mom who has an  Asperger's diagnosis and is parenting a child with an Asperger's diagnosis \u2014 talk about the rage she felt toward incompetent teachers and educational bureaucrats who were not addressing her son's needs in any appropriate, let alone adequate, ways. An articulate woman, she described in some detail the Columbine-esque fantasy that she entertained, only in her fantasy it was she, and not her son, who was finally pushed over the edge.I know how she feels.  Of late, as I have oscillated between despair and rage over the paucity of options for Sweet M, I felt as though our family is under siege.  My fantasy life \u2014 which usually runs toward snorkeling in tropical locales or digging into rare materials in some far-off library or archive \u2014 was suddenly filled with annihilating rage.Images of Kali \u2014 the Hindu goddess with many arms and a belt decorated with skulls she's collected \u2014 came to mind as a  line from the Bhagavad Gita rolled over again and again in my mind: \"I am death, the mighty destroyer of the world, out to destroy.\"I found this distressing, and deeply so, as I have been quite attached to my fantasy of myself as a \"reasonable creature\" \u2014 as a person who can be counted on to come to sensible and deliberate decisions, as someone who can always let cooler heads prevail, even when I'm not so cool myself. The recognition of this rather fantastical violence within me was excruciating.  Taken with the rage I felt at the situation we've been facing \u2014 at how Sweet M has been treated \u2014 I was all but inconsolable.Kristina Chew, my friend and fellow traveler in Autismland and a scholar of classical Greek, directed me to a post she'd written on anger, autism, and Achilles when she'd been at a similar point with her son Charlie's school.  She points out that the first word in the Illiad, the ancient Greek epic of warfare, is menis, which translates rather uninterestingly, as \"rage.\"  Kristina notes that a more apt translation is \"child-avenging rage.\"And with that language I realized what had happened:  I'd come to a moment in my life where my attachment to my sweet girl, and my child-avenging rage, so far outweighs my attachment to my fantasy of myself as reasonable as to render the latter incredible.  As they have feralized my sweet daughter \u2014 saying the children treat her like a pet, and other things that I won't recount here \u2014 they have unleashed in me an animal force so fierce that I could barely recognize myself in all of this.There are good reasons that zoologists take care not to stand between a wolf and her pup, or a bear and her cub.  And as reasonable as we may imagine ourselves to be, at the end of the day, we're card-carrying members of mammalian society, subject to some mighty powerful instincts.Autism moms, something fierce.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/bgita10.txt", "www.kristinachew.com/autism/2005/10/helmet_on_121.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/12/something-fierce.html", "title": "\nSomething Fierce\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 02, 2007", "body": "\nLast week was the President's Day holiday winter week-off for school children, and we took the week off, heading out to California to see my parents and visit Legoland.In the past Sweet M has had a tough time visiting with her grandparents.  There are a lot of rules that she doesn't understand and that can change from time to time. There are grown-ups who would be thrilled if she could engage in small talk.  And an aunt with a dog \u2014 a German shepherd \u2014 that is pretty scary for M.  And there are uncles with beards.Top that off with often a good bit of shopping \u2014 one of her least favorite activities \u2014 and meals with foods that have odors that make her upset, and we've found that visiting California hasn't really had a lot of appeal for Sweet M.  Visits have tended to be dysregulating for her (and thus for me too), so we've kept them to a minimum over the past couple of years.There is also the matter that the ambiguity of Sweet M's diagnosis that, along with her utterly normal appearance, has led some family members to believe that M would be better behaved if only I were a stricter disciplinarian.  Oddly enough, I think that's probably true.  She might act more compliant, but I suspect she'd be feeling a whole lot more upset than she usually does. And you've gotta know that the idea that being a stricter disciplinarian could solve Sweet M's language disorder and behaviorial challenges doesn't really sit so well with me.But my father's Alzheimer's has been progressing apace, slowed somewhat by medications such as Aricept and Namenda, and it seemed as though it was time for a visit.  I wanted to see him while there was still a chance that he would recognize us.  And we sweetened the deal for Sweet M by offering to take her to Legoland first.After a series of complications stemming from the Valentine's Day ice storm flight cancellations, all of us arrived in San Diego by Monday the 19th, and headed to Legoland the next day.  We took a tip from Susan Senator's book and requested special assistance for rides so that we could get times to visit rides rather than wait on line, and I'd recommend that to just about any autism parent. Once in a while it annoyed us to hear a Legoland staff member excusing our prescheduled (and thus expedited) access to the ride by saying things to other parents like \"Sorry folks, it's a case of a handicapped child.\" I wondered if announcements regarding one's disability status are supposed to be part of the price one pays for using your disability-autism-parent access card at an amusement park.  I sort of think not.Nonetheless a good time was had by all.  Much shreiking took place on each of the several rollercoaster-type rides that are Sweet M's very favorites.  And we looked at the massive cities built entirely of Legos: every Lego perseverating kid's dream come true.We'd held up our end of the deal.  We went to Legoland.  It remained to be seen whether Sweet M would (or could) hold up her end of the deal and hangout at Grandma and Grandpa's house. And she did.  The first night she really wanted to leave \u2014 to go back to our hotel \u2014 and she let us know, both verbally, and with this rather dramatic note written on my mother's whiteboard.  In this photo the word \"want\" is obscured by my camera's flash . . .Then she settled in to watching some TV, eating her plain pasta with olive oil, and playing with new toys provided by her aunt and great aunt.What we loved about this note was that she used her words, as we are always asking her to do.  While we wished the content had been more upbeat, we were proud of her clarity and note writing.The next day, she would use her words again, once again in a way that I would never have anticipated, and in a way that was even more disturbing.

{"date": "Saturday, April 07, 2007", "body": "\nEven before I wrote about autism migrations last week, I had been thinking about immigration. Not in practice, as some of you are doing \u2014 thinking about crossing oceans in search of more supportive settings for your families* \u2014 but in theory.  Specifically I had been thinking about how to help Sweet M understand the concept of immigration.Just before spring break, I spoke with Sweet M's teacher. Her class had been doing a social studies unit on immigration, and apparently Sweet M just hasn't been getting it.  When they're doing social studies it's all based on verbal information \u2014 on class discussions \u2014 and it seems to be the proverbial case of in one ear and out the other, or just plain over her head.  So I said that over the break I'd do some work with her on immigration, using pictures and movies.We started out making this timeline of our family. Since Fathersvox is an immigrant to the U.S. and I've lived abroad, we had two local, concrete examples of what is and isn't immigration.  We started with the present, 2007, and went backward to when Sweet M was born, and then to when Fathersvox and I met and married, and then to when he moved to New York from Canada, and then to when his family moved from France to Canada.Then we started to do my story \u2014 how I moved from California to Japan and then to New York, and how that is not immigration, it's just called living abroad.Sweet M was so completely bored.  It was excruciating.  She hated doing this.  And I don't think she understood anything we talked about, even with all the pictures and drawings.  I realized that it's going to be nearly impossible for her to do a subject like this until she has a better sense of temporality and categories. Once you start to think about it, immigration is incredibly complicated.  First, there are so many categories that you need to understand:\u2022 continents\u2022 countries\u2022 states (and for Canada provinces, but we left that out)\u2022 cities\u2022 neighborhoodsAnd then there are the particular names of the particular continents, countries, and states. How do you remember which is a country and which is a state?  And what do you do with something like \"New York\" that's both a state and a city?And then, there is the matter of temporality. Since Sweet M's sense of time \u2014 of past, present and future \u2014 has just been emerging in a solid way, it's pretty hard to get her to think of \"10 years ago\" or \"20 years ago.\"  Then there is the baffling idea that time existed before you did. And harder still is the idea of temporary states of being (\"living abroad\" or \"traveling\") versus more permanent (or intended-to-be-permanent) states that would be examples of immigration. It's really hard!  So very hard.  Much too hard.  Even doing everything with visuals, it was impossible.I was back to thinking about that idea of a zone of proximal development . . . when something you're doing is close enough to what you already know, but just a little more challenging, it's really fun.  Then you're in what the happiness psychologists call \"flow.\"  But when it's even one step beyond that, it's frustrating, even torturous.Sweet M doesn't have the basic structures to take-in this social studies immigration information yet, so it's completely useless.  And so exceedingly not fun.Sweet M was not having fun.  I was not having fun. We were talking about Japan, and I was trying to get her interested, so I said, \"You know, Pokemon comes from Japan.\"\"Wow, really, Pokemon comes from Japan?\"This was the very first glimmer of interest she'd displayed in the four 30 minute sessions we spent working on this.\"Yes, really, Pokemon comes from Japan . . . The guy who made-up Pokemon is Japanese.\"\"Wow, cool! Let me write THAT down,\" she said. You'll see it right smack dab in the middle of the time line, the central information: \"Pokemon come from Japan.\"Now we just have to figure out what that means.  When Pokemon comes from Japan is that living abroad, immigration, or Pokemon invasion?*Thank you all who have written about autism migrations you've made or are planning. It was immensely moving to read about the journeys you've taken or are making to find what your families need.  I am interested because I am thinking of moving, but can't imagine what might be better.  We don't want to go from frying pan to, well, you know . . .\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JmcBVVIxUyE/RhhGZg5iEaI/AAAAAAAAACo/aDhc-2YrfDM/s1600-h/IMG_5113t+to+upload.JPG+"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/04/immigration-theory-and-practice.html", "title": "\nImmigration, Theory and Practice\n"},

I didn't even know she had a concept about dying, although there was that one goldfish, Snappy, who we consigned to a burial at sea by splashing her into the Hudson River estuary . . .Then I said something that I thought would be reassuring: \"I don't think so.  I think he'll be around for a good long while.\"\"Well I hope he dies in an hour,\" she replied.I was sort of shocked because there had been little interaction between them, and what little there was appeared to be pleasant enough.  And, on the other hand, he is in an increasingly difficult and impaired state, and obviously very advanced in years. It is scary and disconcerting to see someone who is up in years and who is losing their functioning. Between that and the fact that I hadn't known that she had any idea about death and dying, I was more than a bit taken aback.I wish I would have asked her more about what she said, but I reacted in what now seems like a hopelessly banal way, by saying \"I don't want to hear you say that again.  That is very mean and it would hurt Grandpa's feelings if he heard you say that.\"At some level, of course, Sweet M is on to something.  In some ways it would be merciful for my father to move on to whatever happens to people when they're no longer alive, but her response felt and sounded mean in a visceral way that I'm not accustomed to experiencing from Sweet M.  Afterall, we call her Sweet because she typically is.We want them to use their words, and then when they do we can find ourselves shushing them when they have something they want to say that we, or others, don't want to hear.  Should we be saying \"use your words, but only for what we want to hear.\"  I don't think so.But on the other hand, we don't want them saying things like \"I wish this one or that one were dead.\" What I wish:  that I were smarter, more flexible, and more ingenious in dealing with Sweet M.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/03/use-your-words-part-two.html", "title": "\nUse Your Words, Part Two\n"},

Quite the sight.\n\nI don't know about you , but when I read about amusement park accidents, I usually find myself wondering \"How'd they manage to do that?\"  But once it happens to you, you find yourself thinking \"Just how in god's name did that happen?\"\n\nIncredibly, my left big toe got caught in the top of the waterslide, so I was more or less dangling by a toe.  When I finally liberated the digit amidst a very un-family-friendly spew of reflexive expletives, I went zooming down the slide, luge-style, with my battered toe leading the way.\n\nThe park's first aid EMT was just about to look at my toe when a little boy of about six let out a piercing wail after colliding into another child and knocking out a tooth.  Following the rules of triage, I encouraged the EMT to deal with his bleeding younger patient, and hobbled off in search of an icepack.\n\nAs my incredulity gave way to bruising, swelling, and limping, and a pretty much spoiled week, I just kept wondering, \"How in god's name did that happen?\"  And to think I had been anxious about going to the hospital \u2014 about the impending surgery \u2014 when I ought to have been worrying about surviving Six Flags.\n\nBut the upside in all of this was that as Sweet M were reclining on the bed in our Lodge room, its Adirondack Camp decor replete with images of brown bears, she and I were musing about bears and mosquitoes.\n\nDo bears eat people? she asked.\n\nIf they're hungry enough, I said.\n\nNo, they don't, they eat fish and berries, she said.\n\nYes, they do eat fish and berries, I agreed. Detecting just a bit of anxiety there, I added, And the fish eat mosquitoes and flies, so they won't bite you.\n\nShe paused for a moment, and announced, So there you'd have a food chain.\n\nA food chain!  She knows what a food chain is!\n\nYes, that'd be a food chain.  Where'd you learn about food chains \u2014 at school?\n\nOh no, I learned it on TV.\n\nI'm begining to think I should stop looking for a new school for Sweet M and just invest in a widescreen television.  Some people think television is a damaging plug-in drug.  I'm thinking that maybe, as one of my favorite disability writers, Martha Beck says, it's a vitamin.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sixflagsgreatescapelodge.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/07/surviving-six-flags-gbgb-day-and-hungry.html", "title": "\nSurviving: Six Flags, GBGB Day, and Hungry Bears\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 20, 2007", "body": "\nLots of us took various trains to Brooklyn last night to The Old Stone House in Park Slope. I came from downtown on the #3.  Kristina, Jim, and Charlie came in from New Jersey.  Sarah came from the Upper West Side, the sister of mom-blogger KAL from Austim Twins came to represent their family, and lots of other folks as well. Brooklyn has been a destination for quite some time, but last night it was a destination for autism moms and dads thanks to the hospitality of Louise Crawford, who runs Brooklyn Reading Works and blogs at Only the Blog Knows Brooklyn.Originally Fathersvox and I planned on going with Sweet M, with the two of them working as my sweet roadies to sell my book. But at the last minute, as I was going over what I was going to be reading aloud that evening, I had second thoughts.  How would Sweet M feel to hear me reading to a room full of people about her episode in the St. Thomas airport?  How would she feel hearing me read about her troubles with enuresis and my troubles with oughtism? In the end we decided that Fathersvox and Sweet M would stay home.  Our excuse to ourselves was that it was a school night and she wouldn't be home until 11 from the 8-10 reading, but the real reason was that I didn't want her to be embarassed or feel she was being made a spectacle.  Of course this raises the questions that so many of us think about \u2014 about the privacy of our families and especially our children.Then when Kristina arrived with Jim and Charlie, I momentarily thought I'd made a mistake.  I was wishing Fathersvox and Sweet M were with me.  Wishing that Sweet M and Charlie could go for a walk with their dads.  Wouldn't that be so much fun?!?!  What Kristina read, among them one of my personal favoritess, The Wages of Autism, and Sappho's new poem and translating Charlie wouldn't have been any source of embarassment for Charlie. Her language remains so eloquent and constant in its theme of infinite affection and gratitude for her sweet boy not in spite of his autism, but with all of him.  Very moving, as ever, and a model for me of how to live on the other side of hopes \u2014 the full instead of the less.More on the fullness of the reading in the days to come \u2014 it was a wonderful and affirming evening for me \u2014 and hopefully a podcast courtesy of a wonderful little device from Belkin* that converted Sweet M's iPod into a digital recorder for the evening and Kristina's tech person, who will teach us how to upload audioclips!*as usual, full disclosure, this site does not receive any support for product endorsements.

{"date": "Tuesday, February 21, 2006", "body": "\n Autism activists such as Temple Grandin, Donna Williams, and Valerie Paradiz make the case that rather than trying to eliminate an autistic person's preoccupations, that these areas of hyperfocus ought to be cultivated \u2014 used to expand learning and future career opportunities.And that is why, this week, we find ourselves in Hershey, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of Milton Hershey and the home of Chocolate World. Yes, Sweet M is fond of sweets, and none more than chocolate.I'm hoping, of course, that vacationing with a chocoholic at Hershey World isn't akin to encouraging an alcoholic to take a tour vineyards and get a job at a winery.In our two days here we've gone on the trolley tour of the town of Hershey, where Chocolate Avenue's street lamps are shaped like Hershey's Kisses and there is a perennial scent of chocolate in the air downwind of the still-operating factory. We've seen a documentary about the cultivation of the cacao bean in the equatorial climate of South America and Africa. We watched the 3-D cartoon extravaganza promoting all of Hershey's products. We visited the Milton Hershey Museum to learn about Hershey's life.And M had the Hershey Factory Experience: she packed Kisses into a gear shaped plastic box and delivered them to the conveyor belt.                     After she'd put her box of chocolates on the conveyor belt, the chocolate factory \"supervisor\" said that M would make a great factory worker. I couldn't help but hope that I can set my sights a little higher for her. Industrial chocolate making is backbreaking work, or so the Hershey Museum says . . . .The Hershey Museum also offers the story of Milton Hershey's life. Hershey was an interesting character. Although he is counted among America's tall tales self-made success, he had several business failures before finally succeeding with his Crystal Caramel Company. In other words, his road to success was paved with failure after failure.After his fourth candy business failure, Hershey had borrowed money from an aunt, who had mortgaged her house to finance his final caramel company. Fluctuating sugar prices were, once again, threatening to put his company out of business. The bank was just about ready to foreclose on his aunt's house when a British company ordered all the caramels he had in stock, and then some. Hershey's fortune was made, and within a couple of years he sold his successful caramel company to invest in the even riskier chocolate business. Or at least that's the story the tour guide told us.Another story had Hershey borrowing the money to start his last caramel business from a former employee who'd worked in his Philadephia candy shop. It's not easy to get the real story behind these layers of choco-mythology.But what struck me about the overall Hershey story was the fact that this quintessential self-made man was actually \"made\" by the support that he had from his family . . . from his aunt who was willing to put everything on the line for him to his former employee, depending on who you believe.How like our kids all this seemed to me: so many failures on the road to basic successes, successes that are buttressed by our willingness to mortgage, figuratively, and sometimes literally, everything we have.One hopes the investment will pay off, but there are no guarantees and you have to just keep trying everything. Hershey moved from Derry, PA to Lancaster to Philadelphia to Denver to New York and back to Lancaster, then on to Derry, PA in his quest for success. Austim parents who have the means \u2014 and some who don't \u2014 move their kids all over the country in search of school districts and medical centers with appropriate programs.Like Hershey, you have to call in all your favors\u2014from family, friends, and even former employees\u2014to get what you need for your kid.And in the end, you just hope that it will all work out, somehow sweet.Our trip to Hershey has been.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  family vacations  \u2022   Temple Grandin  \u2022   Donna Williams\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hersheypa.com/attractions/in_hershey/chocolate_world.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_S._Hershey"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/sweet-adventures.html", "title": "\nSweet Adventures\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 15, 2006", "body": "\nChristine (of Day Sixty-Seven) wanted to know which autism books rate five-stars in my book. Since there are dozens of books that I haven't yet read, both from the stack on my shelf, and also pouring out of the publishing houses, this may be premature. But here goes . . . a 5-star list to date . . .Three favorite autie parent memoirs, not counting the blog memoirs that many of you are writing:                     The Siege: A Family's Journey into the World of an Autistic Childby Clara Claiborne ParkWhat is most dazzling about Park's 1967 memoir is that she bucked the medical wisdom of her time\u2014she lived through the era of the \"refrigerator mom\" theory\u2014and kept her daughter at home with their family. While the psychiatrists of the time were telling her that it was Clara's supposedly cold and impersonal nature that was creating her daughter Elly's autism, Park\u2014with a trail blazing courage\u2014quietly ignored them. Trust me, there is nothing cold and impersonal in this book. It's a classic.Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter's Life with Autismby Clara Claiborne ParkIn the 2001 follow-up to The Siege, we learn how Jessy (aka Elly) fared with the incredible support provided by her mom, her family and their community. She is an artist with a three-year waiting list for her work. Here the happy ending is not a \"cure\"\u2014but a life a meaningful life in the midst of community.Elijah's Cup: A Family's Journey into the C0mmunity and Culture of High-Functioning Autism and Asperger's Syndromeby Valerie ParadizParadiz captures not only the story of raising her autistic son Elijah, but also the emergence of the autism rights movement, and the implications of that movement for how we see our children. Rather than seeing them as \"damaged\" or \"defective\" or \"diseased,\" Paradiz models how we can elaborate and celebrate their differences and find ways to create robust and expansive communities for them, for ourselves and for each other. After reading book after book about curing-saving-rescuing my child (titles that are probably familiar to you) Paradiz offered a new way of thinking about autism\u2014through a social justice lens. And if that weren't enough, she writes beautifully. This book is a gift.Then there are the many books by autistic authors that have come out in the past several years. Donna Williams is probably the most famous autistic individual in the world. With nine published books\u2014many of them bestsellers\u2014she could take almost every spot in a top ten list. I've read about half of them, and found them all helpful:               Nobody Nowhere: The Extraordinary Autobiography of an Autistic Somebody Somewhere: Breaking Free from the World of AutismLike Color to the Blind: Soul Searching and Soul FindingAt the moment I'm reading two of Williams's text books: Exposure Anxiety: An Exploration of Self-Protection Response in Austim Spectrum and Autism and Sensing: The Unlost Instinct, and expect that they will be equally helpful in understanding Sweet M's relationship to the world. And I'm looking forward to reading her newest memoir, Everyday Heaven: Journeys Beyond the Stereotypes of Autism.               Like Donna Williams, Temple Grandin is a renowned autistic woman with several bestselling books, among them, Thinking in Pictures: And Other Reports from My Life with Autism and Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior (written with Catherine Johnson).While working on this list I was surprised to realize that I haven't yet read her earliest book: Emergence, Labeled Autistic.  I think I'll try to pick up a copy today.  Also, Grandin's mother, Eustacia Cutler, has a book just out called A Thorn in My Pocket: Temple Grandin's Mother Tells the Family Story, and that book is definitely on my \"to read\" list.Autism and the Myth of the Person Alone, edited by Douglas Biklen with contributions from a variety of autistic individuals, including Richard Attfield, Larry Bissonnette, Lucy Blackman, Tito Rajarshi Mukhopadhyay, and Sue Rubin. Reading about the world from the perspective of these autistic writers has been as helpful as anything I've read by a medical professional.Finally, two books that I love because they've helped me understand the implications of the social constructions of disease and disability . . .             Life As We Know It: A Father, A Family, and an Exceptional Child, by Michael B\u00e9rub\u00e9. As a professor of comparative literature and cultural studies, B\u00e9rub\u00e9 turns his knowledge of these fields to the task of understanding life with his Down Syndrome son. That might sound boring, but it's not. Believe me, it's amazing. He covers everything from our aversion to \"feeble mindedness\" to the problem of prenatal testing and the elective termination of Down Syndrome pregnancies.The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman. Fadiman tells the story of how cultures collide\u2014with disasterous results\u2014over the body and soul of a young Hmong/Laotian girl with epilepsy. Among the Hmong, Lia Lee's epilepsy is viewed as a sign of her special connection with the spirit world. But in the Merced, California community where her family lands as refugees from from the disasterous debacle of the American-Indochinese War (aka the Vietnam war), Lee's epilepsy is viewed as an illness to be treated. When the medical community requires that Lia be removed from the loving care of her family, calamity results. If you ever had any doubt that diseases are social constructions, then read this powerful account.\u2022   \u2022   \u2022That's my current list of favorites, with an emerging list of others to read.

How's that for mixed messages?In many religious traditions, pride becomes a sin when the prideful imagines him or herself as more important than god \u2014 leaving no place for grace.  But for the contemporary social activist pride is vital: black pride (\"Say it loud, I'm black and proud.\"), gay pride, and autistic pride are just a couple of examples of the liberationist pride\u2014pride as the antidote to the shame heaped on those deemed different, or those targeted for exploitation.So it seems that we're talking about two different kinds of pride here. Some languages and more nuanced than English and distinguish between the two senses of pride; for example, in French, self-respect is fiert\u00e9 and vanity is orgueuil.Self-respect is what we're talking about today, on Autistic Pride Day: that antidote for the shame and abuse heaped on those who are deemed different.And what of parental pride?At least in our culture it's expected that parents ought to be proud of their offspring.  But for autism parents, parental pride can be hard-won, with multiple shame and blame heaped on us.  On the microlevel there's the \"can't you control your child\" looks of strangers during the meltdown to assertion that  \"your child has no manners\" during the social snafu.  And on the macro-level of theory there's the refrigerator mom hypothesis of yesteryear and the genetic \"defects\" theories of today.Certainly, as Sweet M declined to be part of her school musical performance in the spring and sat out the spotlight during her classes' publishing party this past week, my parental pride was dinged, but only ever so slightly so.  Perhaps that's because I got to come back here, to Autism's Edges, to brag about her accomplishments this year \u2014 to share my pride in her achievements among people who know how hard won her victories have been, even when you don't know her personally.For me, that's a place of grace, made possible by all of you.

I've inadvertently taken off whole months from blogging as I've been doing all the  things that parents do when they aren't in a state of crisis over the  place that their child occupies, either in the present world of daily life or future world of our imaginations and of time's unfolding.I'm aware that this time I've had available to focus on other parts of our lives is a luxury that could  evaporate faster than our 401(k) balance did in the autumn of 2008.   The space to focus on the sorts of things that we imagine the parents of typically developing  children get to think about is something that parents of special  needs kids can't take for granted.ASDMommy writes beautifully  about this in a post called \"The  Other Mom,\" where she describes her feelings of living at the margins of normal parenting as her son's differences from other children make her own life quite different from other parents. It's hard to believe that for the past couple  of month's I've almost been \"the other mom\" \u2014 able to concentrate on  something besides getting a new neuropsych, or looking for a new school,  or consulting with a learning specialist, or adjusting medications, or trying to  find a summer camp, or developing a reading intervention.The change  wasn't dramatic.  It seems like these changes just crept up on us. But actually they didn't.  The changes happened not only because Sweet M is growing up, but also because she's just been growing in every way\u2014because of all the things that so many people have done to help her on her way.When I started to turn the soil over on this fallow blog a week ago, I began reading around on the blogs of other parents with kids on the spectrum or with communication disorders, looking at what was going on in neighboring fields.I discovered that in addition to the folks from my own initial blogging pastures \u2014 folks like MOM-NOS, Kyra Anderson, Kristina Chew, Estee Klar and Liz Ditz who have been blogging and parenting and advocating consistently month in and month out for years \u2014 that there are so many other fabulous folks with children who are just a little younger than ours who are hoeing similar rows to our own.Along with ASDMommy, another one that I came upon last week is the extraordinary site of Robert Rummel-Hudson writing about his girl Schuyler.  Schuyler isn't on the spectrum.  She has rare neurological anomaly that interferes with language acquisition\u2014what Rummel-Hudson calls \"her monster.\"  But her story and Sweet M's, their story as a family and ours, have many overlaps.When I read Rummel-Hudson's devastating post about the ways a particular test and IEP meeting had left his vision of Schuyler's future temporarily crushed, I thought of the time that a neuropsychologist told us that our girl had \"disordered thinking\" \u2014 standard code for psychosis.  I thought of the time that the psychologist with a new parent training method he was marketing told us that she had oppositional defiance disorder (when he hadn't even read M's history or evaluations, so he didn't understand that she couldn't even track his commands, let along follow them.)  I thought of the five-year battle we waged with Sweet M's school to keep her placement and to get her the services that she needed.We held to our view that Sweet M was smart and teachable and worthy of the work required to bring her along.  We cajoled, we debated, we picked her up from school in the midst of huge meltdowns, we negotiated, we threatened, we sought legal counsel, we got additional neuropsychs, we wept, we blogged, we remediated, we reached out for help, we overspent our budgets, we neglected our careers, we doubted ourselves, and we did what any parents would do.  We loved our girl.So when I read Robert Rummel-Hudson's post about the wrenching despair he felt after a particularly bad encounter with educational testing, I wept.  And I hoped that he will never ever capitulate to the crushing calculus of educational metrics.  (Somehow I doubt he ever will.)We are enjoying a hiatus from these particular battles right now.  We have a truce with testing, a zone of neutrality from the sometimes devastating demand that everyone follow normative developmental trajectories.  Now that we are in a cease fire, we can cheer others from the sidelines.And instead of spinning off into the world of \"the other moms\" who are taken up with other things, Kyra Anderson and I are looking back, looking inward, and looking forward \u2014 regrouping \u2014 with a thirty day blog fest \u2014 30 posts in 30 days \u2014 to see where we've been, think about where we are, and imagine where our kids may land.  I hope you'll join us all through June and beyond.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://asdmommy.wordpress.com/2008/09/23/the-other-mother/", "http://www.momnos.blogspot.com/", "http://kyraanderson.wordpress.com/", "http://autism.typepad.com/autism/", "http://www.esteeklar.com/", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/", "http://www.schuylersmonsterblog.com/", "http://www.schuylersmonsterblog.com/2010/05/truth-can-be-monster-too.html", "http://www.aboutourkids.org/articles/parent_child_interaction_therapy_pcit", "http://kyraanderson.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/06/tilling-30-posts-in-30-days.html", "title": "\nTilling:  30 Posts in 30 Days\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 12, 2011", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast night we heard a squeal coming from the bathroom -- sounded like a squeal of happiness, but we weren't certain, so I hollered, \"Bunny, you alright?\"\n\"Yeah,\" she called back, \"I'm just thinking about Pok\u00e9mon Black and White.  It's a whole new Pok\u00e9mon.  It's so exciting.\"\nThe best advice from the world of self-help literature and poetry alike is \"love what you love.\" Part of a poem by Mary Oliver (\"Wild Geese\") comes to mind:You do not have to be good.\nYou do not have to walk on your knees\nfor a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.\nYou only have to let the soft animal of your body\nlove what it loves. And our girl does.  She loves what she loves: Pok\u00e9mon, ice cream, Saturdays (because they mean no school and ice cream), Bar and Bat Mitzvahs (because all the kids dress up and have a party without the grown-ups and ice cream is often involved), Christmas (ornaments, cookies, gifts, and no school -- what could be better?), cute little dogs, her iPhone, snow days, any half-days at school, and summer vacation.\n\nI wish Mary Oliver were right -- that all she has to do is love what she loves.  So far it hasn't proven to be the case in every setting.\n\nWhen she's at school she also has to \"be good.\" Of course the language of an IEP doesn't say, \"be good.\"  It says something like \"Increase her awareness of socially appropriate behavior and demonstrate this awareness 85% of the time.\"\n\nEarlier this year there was a lot of socially inappropriate behavior at school.  There was loud hand waving -- couldn't wait to be called on and still can't.  There was crumbling up paper in frustration and grinding pencils into the desk until they broke.  There was screaming and shouting that she had to have her turn.  There was uncontrollable crying -- sobbing over not being called on, missing a turn, or any number of unfortunate and frequent classroom events.\n\nThings were hard.  Very hard.  The doctor we adore who has seen her for years helped.  We adjusted her medications.  We implemented a behavior plan to help the teachers understand that the aforementioned behavior wasn't voluntary -- for some reason the fantasy of volition still has most people enthralled, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nNow we have our easier-going girl back, mostly, I think, thanks to the meds.  She still raises her hand frantically to be called on.  But she doesn't scream when it doesn't happen.   And she squeals with delight about the premiere of a new Pok\u00e9mon show.  Whether that is socially appropriate for a 13-year-old girl we'll have to consider another day.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/02/socially-appropriate-behavior-85-of.html", "title": "\nSocially Appropriate Behavior 85% of the Time\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 20, 2007", "body": "\nMore years ago than I like to think would be possible, I was teaching a college course that required biweekly essays from students.  One of my students turned in a very, very graphic sadomasochistic fantasy featuring me and a colleague engaged in assorted activities that I've managed to mostly put out of my mind.The assignment had been to write about science education and an educated electorate, so there was no question that the student was more than a little off topic.The class I taught ended at 9:30 pm and the author of the paper also tended to hang out after class and shadow me on my way home.I was young.  I'd probably just turned 30.   And I was terrified.So I went to the director of the program where I taught, and he asked me if I had actually been wearing a black leather miniskirt in class as depicted in my student's paper.He wasn't joking.  And, for the record,  I wasn't one to wear black leather miniskirts to class.I asked to have the student transferred to another section of the course taught by a male colleague.  My request was denied.I was told that I should offer the student the opportunity to rewrite the paper since \"we should give him a second chance.\"  The director of the program explained that my student, who was a senior at that time, was planning to continue his education, planning on becoming a clinical psychologist.  I shouldn't fail him and jeopardize his plans of getting into graduate school.OHHHHH-kay.So when I watched the story of Cho Seung-Hui and his teachers unfold this week, I was not terribly surprised.  Horrified.  Appalled.  Bereft.  But not surprised.I was, of course, very lucky.  I'd just met Fathersvox, and he made it a routine to stop by and walk me home from this particular class.  Eventually my campus stalker gave up and went on to . . .  well . . . what?We don't really know now, do we?Because when this inappropriate misogynist tested the limits in my class at a major urban university, what he learned was that the university would back him up . . .   And I'd venture a guess that if you asked around, you'd find that you'd have a story just like mine from more than half the college teachers you might ask.Cho Seung-Hui wasn't that exceptional in form, only in magnitude.What makes the Cho story different?\u2022 Cho had breathtakingly easy access to lethal automatic handguns  -- he could pay for them on his student credit card.  My own wacky student probably would have had to scrape together the funds if he'd wanted to buy a handgun.  Easy credit does have its down sides.\u2022 Cho was taking some sort of psychotropic prescription medication, though the news reports don't say exactly what.  Several medications can produce bipolar manic episodes in people who might have previously only been withdrawn or depressed.  This is particularly dangerous in the springtime when light levels are increasing. And most psychopharmacologists don't monitor this that closely.  Even worse, many antidepressant medications are prescribed by primary care physicians who are ill-equipped to monitor adverse effects.  Cho was described as wearing sunglasses indoors \u2014 sounds to me like a guy with light sensitivity.  When my whacked out student was stalking me, prescription medications for mood disorders were extremely rare. Back then \u2014 in the ice age of the late 1980s \u2014 the medications for depression were MAO-inhibitors, and with their serious side effects, they weren't widely prescribed.  So my student was unlikely to have been coping with massive shifts in his neurochemistry.Some people are wondering about whether Cho was on the spectrum.  It sounds possible, from most of the reports.  If Cho actually were on the spectrum \u2014 and anyone reading this blog knows how blurry those diagnostic categories can be \u2014 then this horrific set of events could actually be a national wakeup call \u2014 for more substantive early intervention services, for better educational settings, for equal coverage for mental health care, for social skills training for everyone who wants it, for anti-bullying activism. And we won't even go near the munitions control debate \u2014 I'm guessing you know where I'd come out on that one.The autism rights community isn't the first community to grabble with this hero-villain community image problem.  Whenever one has a community developing positive role models \u2014 we have our Einstein, our Grandin, our Tammet, our Warhol \u2014 there is the flip side, the villains.  When Jeffrey Dahmer was discovered to have murdered and cannibalized young men, the gay community had a similar problem that the autism community may be facing with Cho. Being gay doesn't mean one is a perverted cannibal serial killer. And being on the spectrum doesn't mean one is a danger to oneself and others.Deviations from the norm are not inherently dangerous, but rage \u2014 and a couple of handguns \u2014 can be.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/04/my-own-cho.html", "title": "\nMy Own Cho\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, February 13, 2011", "body": "\nMOM-NOS has written a must-read post about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorders at Hopeful Parents.  The takeaway from MOM-NOS's post -- one that is indescribably important -- is that it does get better.  I know that might be hard to believe.  I know that for families in the first months following a diagnosis, or in the throws of battles with the schools and school boards, or with family members who think it's just a case of poor parenting, that it will be hard to believe that it gets better.  But it does.  I am living proof of that . . . the low volume of posts here at Autism's Edges in recent years is silent testimony not only to how much easier our lives are these days, but also to how much easier I am with our girl's challenges.Back in the days when I before I started this blog we were living a life of constant hysteria -- we did not know when the next explosive moment would be.  We did not know when the phone rang if the sound in the background would be our girl screaming as though she was being tormented by demons because there had been some minor (minor for typically developing folks) disruption in her routine.  We did not know if we'd be able to make it through a grocery store visit, or a walk to the corner, or a trip to the swings at the playground without an episode.  We did not know if our girl would ever learn to talk or to read.  We did not know how we would pay for therapies and interventions and lawyers.  We did not know how we would crawl out of the years of sleep deprivation.  We did not know how we would get from point A to point B without a crisis.  If you've read this far, you probably know what I'm talking about.  Every single day was like a personal battlefield with obsessiveness, explosiveness, and rigidity -- not just that born of our daughter's neurological difference, but that of educators, doctors, therapists, and family members.  We were embattled and angry and weary.At one point, I gave up.  It was October 2002.  We were still reeling from the impact of the 9/11 attacks on our lives and livelihoods. We live not far from the site of the former World Trade Center and all of us, including our then three-year-old girl, had seen things that no one should ever see.  But on the other hand, it was more than a year after 9/11 and nearly two years after our girl's first of many diagnoses. And things were not getting better.  Not even a little better.  There were therapies (OT and speech and a para) and there were constant trips to specialists, and things were not getting better.I was sinking.  Not fast, but steadily.  Sinking, sinking, sinking.  Most people think of me as pretty sturdy.  I look sturdy.  I act sturdy.  Resilient is a word people use to describe me.  So no one really knew that I was sinking.  Even the people I told that I was sinking didn't think that I could sink as low as I was going.To say that I wished to end my life would be to understate what was feeling.  I wanted to end my life and end the world.  In those days, when I watched apocalyptic films like Armageddon or Independence Day or War of the Worlds, I was rooting for the other side.  The space aliens and the errant asteroid were just getting the job done.  Three cheers for the space invaders.  Bring on the asteroids.  I understood, in a visceral way, why the fantasy of global annihilation has such popular appeal.One Saturday afternoon I just gave up.I am not particularly proud of this moment -- who would be?  But it did happen.  And for reasons that remain mysterious to me, the enemy did not accept my white flag.  I went on.  The world went on.  I crawled off the floor of my bedroom and vomited and went on.  And we got help.  Real help.  Helpful help.  A pediatric psychiatrist that we adore.  One of those doctors you would go to the end of the earth for, as Jess of Diary of a Mom aptly puts it.Slowly, and sometimes quickly, things changed. Our girl's anxiety was finally treated. Within days we were able to stop walking around our apartment as though there were land mines under the rug or the sink or the stack of books about autism at the bedside.   She smiled and laughed again.  My depression was treated and I started to see some light coming in through the cracks in our craggy lives.Psycho-pharmacology saved our lives.  Speech therapy, and talk therapy, and EMDR, and all the other therapies helped, but without the medication, we would have died.  This is not an exaggeration, it is just a fact.The medications were not perfect -- we had problems with dosing, and problems with the Paxil suspension, and ultimately the anxiety came back and we had problems until we got her on another medication.  And the medications didn't and don't solve everything.  Her speech and language improved exponentially, but she still needed speech therapy.  She still needed OT.  And she still needed a para-professional in the classroom.  But they gave us the space to help her, and to dig our way out of the depths of despair that had become everyday life for us.In the process of getting the help we needed, we lost some people in our lives.  In a particularly painful moment, one close friend suggested that we had failed as parents and were drugging our girl into compliance.  We love this person, but we couldn't listen to this.  We could see with our own eyes that our girl was feeling better, learning, growing, and developing in ways that would have been impossible when she was in the thrall of obsessions.  You may lose some people along the way, no matter what you do.  Please don't make the mistake I made and risk losing it all.  There are lots of people out here and there is help out here.  Lots and lots of help.  If you are feeling anywhere nearly as badly as I was feeling in 2002, get help.  You'll be glad you did.  Let the space aliens lose this round.Illustration: from the National Institute of Mental Health web page on PTSD.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-30xb_hqGBGw/TVhl5ra7gKI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/JTIsHhaKXU8/s1600/ptsd-brain.gif", "http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2011/2/11/asd-and-ptsd.html", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/doctors-for-all-my-friends/", "http://www.childmind.org/", "http://www.grasp.org/res_th.htm", "http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-research-fact-sheet/index.shtml"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-and-ptsd-reflections-on-what-may.html", "title": "\nAutism and PTSD: Reflections on What May Be the Most Important Autism Parenting Post You Ever Read\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 02, 2011", "body": "\nNot long ago our girl was a junior bridesmaid at my brother's wedding.  Originally she was meant to be a flower girl, but she's just been growing too fast to fit the flower girl role.  In the weeks leading up to the big day, there were many adjustments and alterations, not only to our plans, but also to the glorious and very grown-up (strapless!) bridesmaid's dress that his fianc\u00e9 had chosen for Sweet M to wear.  \n\nMy brother and his fianc\u00e9 went out of their way to include our girl in the bridal party and we were very touched by their consideration.  And so, together, we navigated the complicated terrain of our girl's sensory issues (no scratchy fabrics, dress can't be too tight), her language impairments, and her potential for some sort of emotional dysregulation.  I think at some points they may have thought we were probably just coddling her. Sometimes it's just hard to remember that for all of her progress, our girl remains very much on spectrum.  It's just hard to understand that someone can look so, well, normal, and yet be so very, very different. \nWhen the big day arrived we were in California, driving to the Wayfarer's Chapel where the wedding service would be held.  Our girl had been coiffed and coached:  the job of the bridesmaid is to walk slowly up the aisle, the job of the bridesmaid is to hold flowers in front of her waist, the job of a bridesmaid is to smile a lot of the time, and look happy and serene. The job of the bridesmaid is to remain calm even if the pantyhose are a little tight and the weather is a little chilly for a strapless gown.  Sweet M did it all, with grace and aplomb, and we couldn't have been more proud of her.\n\nAfter the ceremony there was a sizeable reception party.  My own family of origin is not an especially celebratory crew.  A mix of Irish stoicism and Pennsylvania Dutch austerity, we're not given to big ceremonies or lavish celebrations.  I can't remember the last time I've been to a big wedding party.  \nFortunately for us, and perhaps for my brother most of all, he's married into an enormous, joyous Filipino family who know how to have a good time.  I'm not usually one for ethnic characterizations, but cultural differences exist, and this one definitely works for us.  His new in-laws' joie de vivre is contagious. There was a beautiful ceremony followed by a reception with dancing, and speeches, and all of the usual wedding party antics.\nAnd that is, of course, where things got just a little complicated for our girl. We'd scripted and coached every aspect of the bridesmaid's job that we could think of, but we'd forgotten to explain the rules of the bouquet toss.  \nSo picture the scene:  it's been along day.  We'd started at 9am with a salon visit to get our girl and her grandmother coiffed for their roles. Then we'd driven quite some distance to move into the hotel near the wedding venue, where we dressed for the wedding.  Our girl had done well with the various unfamiliar items of clothing -- the pantyhose, the strapless bra, the dress tape and safety pins to ensure that dress stayed put throughout the afternoon and evening. Then we drove to the wedding, where Sweet M did a brilliant rendition of bridesmaid's behavior.  Then onto to the reception with cocktails and a long dinner with lots of new foods, new aromas, new people, surrounded by loud disco and techno-pop music, people dancing, and joking, and having a wonderful time.\n\nOur girl was handling it all well. Then, towards the end of the evening, the master of ceremonies called all the single women out to dance floor for the big moment of the bouquet toss.  The dance floor filled with the hopeful gals, our girl among them.  The lovely bride turned away from the hopefuls to toss the bouquet over her shoulder.  Our girl was, with all the other single gals, arms up, waving, hoping to catch the prized flowers.  The bride did one teasing decoy toss that threw them all off-guard, and then tossed the flowers high into the air.\nFrom the edge of the dance floor I was calculating the arc of the falling object in my mind's eye.  I was hopeful as it looked as though it was going to land, remarkably, right in our girl's outstretched hands.  The fact that I hadn't coached her on this part of the festivities, with its social demand of being a good sport, wasn't going to matter.  It looked as though it was going to be okay.\nBut then, in a fraction of a second, it wasn't.  A tall beautiful woman next to Sweet M caught the bouquet.  \nWhat happened next is a bit of a blur in my mind.  It happened fast.  Our girl lunged for the bouquet and grabbed it from the hands of the lucky winner, wrestling it away from her.  In the process her beautiful strapless gown slipped down over her little strapless bra, the shimmering aqua d\u00e9collet\u00e9 settling somewhere near her waist.  \nIn the throws of a social catastrophe in the making, you make choices in nanoseconds.  Priority one: get the dress back up over the bra.  Priority two: deal with the inappropriate social behavior as quietly and as well as you possibly can.  Priority three: Minimize embarrassment for the girl (and for ourselves -- \"Who are that girl's parents?\"), and ease any unhappiness amongst others that the gaffe may have caused.\nBy the time I'd gotten over to the girl and pulled the dress back into place, the single gals had dispersed and I couldn't find the real winner of the bouquet.  In my dismay at the turn of events, I couldn't actually even remember who had caught the roses.  \nOnce back at our table, I talked quietly with our girl about the bouquet toss.   She was so pleased and proud to have the white rose buds with the rhinestone studs pinned into their centers. \n\n\"Hey sweet girl, you didn't exactly catch the bouquet, did you?\"\n\"Well, not exactly,\" she paused to consider her words. \"Technically I fought for it.\"\n\"Yes, that is what you did.  If you play this game again in the future, you can't fight for it, you have to just let whoever catches it keep it.\"\n\"Okay, I get it.  But I wanted to get the diamonds.\"\n\"Yes, the diamonds in the flowers are beautiful, but you still can't tackle people to get the bouquet.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nWith wardrobe malfunction and teaching moment behind us, now we just needed to find the woman who actually caught the bouquet and apologize.  But our social reparations were interrupted as the evening's festivities weren't done yet:  now it was time for the single men to come up to catch the garter. \nThe unmarried gents gathered around.  The beautiful bride was installed on a chair in the middle of the dance floor, her leg lifted in playful provocation, as the groom engaged in the somewhat ribald ritual of retrieving the garter from under her voluminous gown.  \nMoments later the groom tossed out a garter.  The men scrambled to catch the prize and then our girl, sitting on the sidelines, bolted up and joined the men in the scramble.  My heart dropped.  Now what should I do:  haul her off the dance floor screaming, or let her wrest the garter out of some fellow's hand?  \nThen, in a moment of pure grace, my brother tossed out another garter. And another. And another.  The scrambling continued, as he tossed out garter after garter.  There were garters a-plenty for the guys and for our odd-ball girl, who emerged from the fray with a black and white satin treasure with a small white bow.\n\"Hey, look what I got!\" she exclaimed.\n\"Yes, you got a garter.\"\n\"What's a garter?\" she asked.\n\"Women used to use them to keep up their stockings.\"\n\"Oh.\"\n\"You know, sweet girl, when you're at a wedding again, remember that the garter catching is something that the guys do.  It's just for the guys.  The bouquet is for the girls and the garter is for the guys.  Weddings are about making it really clear that guys are guys and girls are girls.\"*\n\"Okay,\" she replied, brightly.\n\"By the way, dear girl, why was it so important for you to get a garter?\"\n\"Well, I never heard of a garter before -- I just had to see what it was.\"\nAnd that's our girl: on her own personal quest for gems and knowledge.  And she got them a-plenty, thanks to grace and goodwill.  We're so grateful to have enjoyed this occasion with our girl held close in everyone's hearts.  This is inclusion: the wedding edition.\n\u2022   \u2022   \u2022\n\n\n\n\n*Note to my more politically engaged readers: A more nuanced analysis of weddings and gender will have to wait for another day. Here we're just trying to get to an understanding of gendered norms. Later we can deconstruct them with our girl.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/04/inclusion-wedding-edition.html", "title": "\nInclusion: The Wedding Edition\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 09, 2007", "body": "\nBlogging in and around Autism's Edges is one of the most rewarding parts of my life.  Thinking about Sweet M in a safe semi-public space, learning about what goes on for other families, visiting at other blogs \u2014 these are the experiences of the past year or so that have saved my sanity, if not our lives.  So only the most compelling necessity could keep me away for more than a month. Often in the past six weeks, I'd visit at few other sites \u2014 checking in at Autismland to see how Kristina, Jim, and Charlie were doing; keeping track of Bud's progress in the chronicles of MOM-NOS; hoping that Kyra and Fluffy were thriving and that she'd keep on posting.  But posting I wasn't.  No comments.  No posts.All my attention was focused on two things: getting my work done and looking for a better school for Sweet M.  I won't bore you with the details of the work piece, except to say that I was seriously overbooked: preparing a 150-page grant proposal due in mid-January; negotiating a possible new job for the fall; and finally finally finalizing the contract that has been under negotiation for nearly a year; writing a chapter for a book on academic labor; and curating an exhibition for a small New England museum.  In short, I worked 10-14 hour days without a break from the second day of January until now.  I don't recommend this to others, but somehow that is just how the saying the word \"yes\" too many times accumulated into a January logjam.During the same time, it was also incredibly important to look at other schools for Sweet M, get a new ed-psych evaluation done, start thinking about summer camp (or not-summer camp) and deal with the ongoing negotiations with her current school about what they are willing to do for her.  Fathersvox and I looked at the $73,000 school that I'd previously seen and wondered if there was any way in the world she could go there.  I checked into other schools that are two-hours out of the city and wondered if there was any way I could get comfortable with the idea of Sweet M sitting on a bus for four hours a day roundtrip \u2014 or any way we could get comfortable with moving to the suburbs.  We met with the principal and head of school at Sweet M's current school and learned that they are willing to keep her next year, but think of her as a burden on their resources.  We went to the \"summer camp fair\" organized by the folks at Resources for Children with Special Needs.   And we spent two Saturdays, Sweet M and I, with a psychologist who is a gifted evaluator of children so that Sweet M can have a new ed-psych evaluation for the school applications that we will be doing.  (The good news: her performance IQ jumped 10 points from the last testing and the Woodcock-Johnson shows a one-year gain in reading in a little more than one year of instruction.  The bad news: the Weschler shows her reading at a mid-first grade level when she's slated to go into fourth grade.)All in all, it's been an awfully big month. But the biggest thing that happened all month is that Sweet M told me she's in love.  She's totally infatuated, completely smitten, deeply enamored, and just plain old in love with a little boy in her class whom she's known for four years.  Last week she shared this, along with a flood of anxiety \u2014 How can I tell him?   I can't tell him, can I? What if he knows?  What should I do?  Can I marry him?  Oh, he has to ask me, doesn't he?  How can I let him know that he's the most hunkiest guy?

{"date": "Saturday, July 18, 2015", "body": "\nTo the Woman Who Rolled Her Eyes When My Daughter Asked a Tour Guide If She Would Speak More Slowly:\n\nYou know who you are. You're the one on the college tour with your handsome son and tall husband. You're the one with the perfect salon-blonde hair, the Louis Vuitton shoulder tote, and the 1.5 carat heart-shaped diamond earrings. I saw you. I took you in. I thought about you for so much longer than you ever thought about my girl. I carried you along with us. I could not leave you behind on the tour, though my girl seemed to not even notice you.\n\n\n\n\nIt happened in a micro-second \u2013 your disdain and dismissal of my girl.\n\nAll of us were on a college tour (yes, dear readers, we are going on college tours \u2013 more on that soon!)\n\nWe were in the long echoey hallway of a major university in our city and the student tour guide was showing us the university's library from the corridor just outside \u2013 not from the quiet zone just behind the glass doors. A custodial worker began pushing a noisy cart through the hallway \u2013 it echoed and rattled off the long tile and cinderblock walls of the hall.\n\nAs the tour guide described the two million volumes available to students, my girl said, \"Excuse me, could you speak a little slower, I'm having trouble hearing.\" This was a polite request for an accommodation. She spoke softly, clearly, with good tone and no urgency (however urgent it may have felt to her). Trust me, we've worked on this.\n\nAnd that's when it happened. You rolled your eyes and then you looked around to find someone with whom to share this moment of superiority and dismissal. But no one returned your look. It's possible no one even saw you except me. My girl didn't seem to see you, for which I'm grateful.\n\nThe student tour guide graciously adjusted her pace and we continued on the college tour.\n\nBut from that moment forward, I could not stop thinking of you. Honestly, I was furious with you. Who could you be? Who are you that you would dismiss my girl's calm and polite self-advocacy?\n\nI tried (and failed) to be generous: Could you be terrified about the road ahead for the handsome young man you have raised? Could you be often considered stupid and slow yourself, as pretty blonde women generally are? Could you be scared and alone behind the branded bag and bobbles, next to the perfect-looking son and husband?\n\n\nI couldn't take your side. No, I wanted to take you aside and ask you how you could do that? How could you roll your eyes at my girl's request for a little slower speech?\n\nI wanted to tell you a thing or two about my girl. I wanted to tell you how she has worked harder than you have likely ever worked on anything just to learn to talk. I wanted to tell you that she was told that she'd never learn to read and is now passing her high school exams and looking at colleges. I wanted to tell her how she hard it is for her to process language, especially in noisy rooms or corridors like this one. I wanted to tell you that your contempt makes the world a smaller place for my girl, but for you as well, for you most of all.\n\nBut I didn't. I didn't take you aside because, well, I didn't want to upset my girl. She didn't seem to notice you and I didn't want her to. She's the point, you aren't.\n\nBut still, you were there, and you changed my day. You made me wince at the realization of how much farther we have to go. I thank you for that realization. I won't soon forget you in the heart-shaped diamond earrings. I hope that some day you'll have a heart that's made of something other than stones.\n\nYours in college searching,\n\nm.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2015/07/to-woman-who-rolled-her-eyes-when-my.html", "title": "\nTo the Woman Who Rolled Her Eyes When My Daughter Asked a Tour Guide If She Would Speak More Slowly\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 04, 2015", "body": "\nActually it's more than a year that we've been barely blogging. When last I posted, dear readers -- if any of you are still out there reading \u2014 I promised so very much more than I could deliver.\n\n\n\nI promised I'd write about how our girl's dad helped her increase her Regents* exam score by 22 points.\u00a0I promised I'd write about her fledging friendship and her trip with her class to the Grand Tetons.\u00a0I promised to write about our work doing neighborhood organizing.\u00a0And I didn't do any of that. Nothing. Not a word.\n\n\n\nI'd say that I let you down, except I probably didn't. You'd probably figured out long ago that I just wasn't going to be blogging much. You'd watched my blogging dwindle to one post a year over several years' time. There'd be the weeks, and then months, of dead air, with any new post an apologetic explanation of absence, like this one \u2014 sweeping leaves off a nearly abandoned site.\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't just the time-consuming work of fighting the\nconstruction that\u00a0has stolen our sunshine\nand disrupted our sleep.\n\n\nWhere did we go? It wasn't just the time-consuming work of the neighborhood organizing. Or the full time job. Or continuing the work of getting our girl through high school (she's a junior now). Or the visits to Dementiaville (aka LA) to take care of my 89-year-old mother.\u00a0All that that might have been enough to induce this silence, but that wasn't it. It was other things.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOr the flying back and forth to LA to deal with my\nmother's declining memory and cognition.\n\n\nThere was (and is) the nagging feeling that things are different now that she's a teen. It's not just that she can read whatever I write \u2014 that's been the case for years now \u2014 but also the feeling that I want her to be telling her own story. You know the disability rights motto of \"nothing about us without us.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe goal is hearing the autistic person's story, not just the autistic's parent's story. I take that seriously. And she has started telling her story, with an Instagram account. But I don't know if I should link to it or not. There is her privacy. And besides, she has more than a hundred followers there anyway: other folks who love Pokemon, My Little Pony, and Hello Kitty. It seems also that there is a place for our voices \u2014 for parent and caregiver voices \u2014 even as we cultivate our girl's voice.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd then there was (and is) the occupational hazard of over-thinking things.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSome of the colleagues that I've been reading argue that the work we do of sharing on the internet is just a way of participating in communicative capitalism, or platform capitalism, or what other people have long called the spectacle.\u00a0The argument goes like this:\u00a0We write, post, share, click \"like\" and engage via social media that capture our attention and our affect \u2014 our love itself \u2014 and sell them to marketers. Every corner of our electronic lives helps someone turn a profit.\u00a0The logic of these analyses is irrefutable: fortunes are being made off of our free content, off of our desire to connect, off of our desire to share.\n\n\n\nBut still, do we want to share less, live less, \u00a0love less, just because Google, or Facebook, or Twitter or Instagram or Tumblr executives are riding high on the profits they turn from our attention? \u00a0\n\n\n\nI don't have an answer to that question just now, but I'll be working on it this year, writing here and elsewhere. I don't know if the\u00a0gift economy of blogging has any chance of succeeding when the platforms are siphoning off so much at the top, but I'm going to see where the gift of writing with and about our girl takes me in the year ahead. If I pick up any momentum, I hope you'll come along for the ride. We may stall, or sputter, or just run out of steam. But let's see how far we get in the year ahead.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n*Regent Exams are the standardized tests that New York's kids have to take to get a high school diploma.\u00a0\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismsedges.blogspot.com/2014/04/our-home-at-autisms-edges.html", "http://www.autismsedges.blogspot.com/2013/06/friendship-movie-magic.html", "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=communicative+capitalism&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ei=9WmoVP3gDZGAygS0lIGoAw&ved=0CBsQgQMwAA", "http://networkcultures.org/mycreativity/2014/10/16/never-mind-the-sharing-economy-heres-platform-capitalism/", "http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/pub_contents/4", "http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/technocapitalism/voluntary"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2015/01/our-year-of-barely-blogging.html", "title": "\nOur Year of Barely Blogging\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 24, 2006", "body": "\nSince we were staying in a motel on our little mini-vacation in Hershey, PA, we found ourselves eating dinner out a couple of nights, which is something that we rarely attempt in the city. This proved to be the most challenging part of the trip because Sweet M's olfactory sensitivities make so many food odors disgusting for her.The first night, in an Italian restaurant with overpriced and barely edible food, Sweet M was squirming, grimacing, getting up out of her seat, and demanding, \"Ewww, get it away, get it away\" when our pastas with a slightly garlicky tomato sauce arrived. The second night, at a different restaurant, M jumped up when my tomato soup arrived and seated herself at an adjacent table \u2014 upwind, I suppose, from the offending odor.Sweet M's father was deeply annoyed by M's restaurant (mis)behavior. It's easier for me to empathize with her olfactory sensitivities as I have the advantage of having had overpowering morning sickness when I was pregnant with her. That is, I have a relatively recent and visceral memory of how affecting olfactory disgust can be. But for M's father this was becoming a quality of life issue. \"We have to be able to eat in a restaurant,\" he said. \"She's got to grow up and learn some manners.\" And, admittedly, the behavior was awfully annoying.This got me thinking about some of the times in Sweet M's life that I'd decided that something just ought to be a particular way. There are only a couple of examples of this, as I'm not much for imposing my will in the face of overpowering resistance on M's part. Most of the few times that I've taken such a stand, I've lived to regret it.Take the case of bedwetting. Sweet M has enuresis, the medical word for bedwetting. Sometime in her kindergarten year \u2014 with an eye toward the sleepovers that might be on the horizon in elementary school \u2014 I decided that the bedwetting had to come to an end. Her longtime babysitter, a woman who's raised five children and an even larger number of grandchildren, agreed that it was time. M's pediatrician thought it was time as well.And so we had Sweet M start sleeping without \"diapies,\" as she affectionately called them.About five nights a week she could get through the night without wetting the bed. But the other two nights the bed was soaked, which interrupted her sleep.Less important, but not insignificant, was the fact that I was saddled with pounds of extra laundry. If we lived in a suburban house with a washer and dryer, it might not have been so bad. But since laundry for us means schlepping out to the laundromat and paying $2.00 a load for washing and up to $4.00 for the dryer (depending on the drying time), this was a costly and time-consuming undertaking.Also, because M was still greatly in need of sensory stimulation, we'd let her jump on the bed, which would put small tears in the mattress cover, which would then leak and spoil the mattress. It was a mess, all around. I was spraying the mattress with those odor-killing sprays and schlepping to the laundromat, and basically devoting about 6-10 hours a week to this project of nighttime toilet training.We persisted on this course for nearly a year. We never scolded her about wetting the bed since we didn't want to make a huge deal out of it, but it was tiresome. She wanted the bed to be dry every bit as much as I did, but we just weren't getting there. Every once in a while we'd go a week without a bedwetting incident, but that was the exception, not the rule.M's psychiatrist suggested a medication for enuresis, but I didn't want her on an additional medication for something as unimportant as bedwetting.M herself was patient with our experiment in nighttime toilet training, but one day, after she'd wet the bed four nights in a row, I said, \"Oh M, what do you think we should do?\"She paused for a moment, put her finger to her head, and said, \"I know.  Let's get diapies!\"I mumbled something about let's see if you can get through the night since you're getting to be a big girl, no?Okay, she'd said, resigning herself.I became a little obsessed with bedwetting, discussing it with many friends. I learned, to my surprise, that two of the most accomplished women I know \u2014 one a professor at a major university, the other a prominent psychologist is the city \u2014 both wet their beds until puberty. Sometimes the brain \u2014 even the most able of brains \u2014 just isn't ready to sleep through the night dry.Nighttime continence requires both a hormonal function and some kind of bladder control during sleep. Apparently in some children a natural anti-diuretic hormone released at sunset condenses the urine at night, making bladder control easier. In other children, this hormone is absent, making dry nights more challenging, if not impossible. Like so many things, this is not a simple matter of willpower.About a year ago we changed pediatricians. M's first pediatrician had children herself and moved out of the city (which turned out to be a blessing for all of us.)When we met with our new pediatrician, I brought up the bedwetting problem and she said that there are things you can do . . . there is an alarm system that wakes them up when the bed gets wet, so it trains them, but it's possible that her brain just isn't developed enough yet to manage nighttime continence. Why don't you just get pull-ups for her?\"I thought we should stay the course, and move forward, not backward.\"\"Look,\" M's doctor said, \"Think of how much easier your life will be. Eventually she'll be dry through the night.\"This was one time that I was completely in tune with medical authority. We got the nighttime diapers. While they're by no means inexpensive, the cost is far less than what I was spending on laundry, not to mention in time. Some countries even have programs to subsidize the cost of diapers for kids with developmental differences. Very civilized. (See Sometimes Holland Feels Like Hell, January 7, 2006 if you live in Canada and need incontinence supplies.) But back to our story in New York City, the capital of rugged individualism and self-mastery . . .The week after we went back to nighttime diapers, I was at school event and M's teacher came up to me and asked, \"What have you been doing with M\u2014she's so happy and relaxed and focused this week?\"\"Diapies,\" I said.\"Diapies?\"  he asked.\"Yes,\" I said.  \"We've gone back to having a nighttime diaper and M seems to be sleeping better now.\"\"Wow,\" he said. \"Well, it's really working.\"Why did we struggle for nearly a year, with M never getting a good night's sleep, and me ever schlepping wet bedding to the laundromat, spraying the mattress with Febreze?I had gotten it into my head that M ought to be able to keep the bed dry. I'd been dreaming about the sleepovers that the little girl of my fantasies would be having with her little friends. She can't be wearing diapers to a sleepover, I'd think. And the people I trusted \u2014 her doctor, her babysitter, her father \u2014 all agreed that she ought to be able to do this. But the fact was that she couldn't. She just couldn't.In one of the self-help books that I've read for my other research there is an expression about the word \"should.\" Readers are encouraged to focus on what they want to do, rather than on what they think they should do. One writer tells his readers to stop \"shoulding\" all over themselves, referencing the very sorts of toileting and self-control issues that we were struggling with.In the case of this bedwetting problem our \"shoulds\" and our \"oughts\" got in our way of seeing what wasn't working for Sweet M. We weren't struggling because of her autism \u2014 or whatever it is that goes on for her \u2014 we were suffering from \"oughtism\": the inflexible belief that something oughta be a particular way, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding.I hope we will all be delivered from oughtism.  And arrive in a place where there are sweet dreams for all of us.Keywords: autism  \u2022   Asperger's Syndrome  \u2022  ADHD  \u2022  bed wetting  \u2022   enuresis\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuresis", "http://2irishboys.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_2irishboys_archive.html"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/02/oughtism-or-sweet-dreams.html", "title": "\nOughtism or Sweet Dreams\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 21, 2013", "body": "\nThree weeks back our girl asked me if we could go to the new My Little Pony movie. \n\nAt a theatre. \nDespite crowds.\nDespite popcorn smells.\n\nShe wanted, quite passionately, to see My Little Pony: Equestria Girls\u00a0on the weekend of its premiere. \n\n\n\nIt would be hard for me to explain how unusual this is. Let's just say that I can't recall the last time we've gone to a movie theater. Possibly it was a screening of Monsters, Inc \u2014\u00a0the first one, not one of the sequels.\n\n\n\nMy Little Pony: Equestria Girls was set to open on June 16th, Father's Day. That seemed an odd day to launch a movie if you actually wanted families to attend, but I put that out of my mind. \u00a0If her dad didn't want to come, he wouldn't mind our heading off to the movies and giving him an hour or two of peace. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAll week long our girl asked me, insistently, to get the tickets online. I had a busy week, so I put if off until Saturday, only to find that there were no online sales. Odd, I thought. But whatever, we'll just go to the movie a little early and get tickets at the box office. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat I didn't know, and couldn't have imagined, was that the 11am screening at the Chelsea Clearview Cinema was the only one scheduled for the entire city of New York. \u00a0There was one the next day in Yonkers. And another in Montclair, New Jersey. But other than that, no screenings anywhere remotely nearby.\n\n\n\nBut no worries, I thought. We'll just get there early. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen we arrived at 10:30, there was a huge line along 23rd Street with a few families with kids, but many adolescent and young adult men. We took our place at the end of the line and talked with a couple from Georgia who'd driven up to the city for the screening. They'd gotten their tickets online.\u00a0That was when I realized I had a problem: we might have a Pony-less Sunday. \u00a0\n\n\n\nI asked our girl to stay on line with the folks from Georgia and I went inside to find out what was up. The news wasn't good: Sold out. The only screening was sold out. I asked the usher if I could speak to the manager and she called her over. I explained briefly that I had a situation: 15-year-old ASD girl obsessed with MLP and no tickets for show. Could she do anything? \n\nShe wasn't sure, she said. She was trying to squeeze in an extra screening; she wasn't sure how that was going to work. But she told me she understood\u2014she'd worked with kids on the spectrum. Then she offered, \"It's really hot outside, your daughter probably can't tolerate heat, can she? Why don't you bring her inside, sit down in the lobby, and I'll see what I can do.\" \u00a0\n\n\n\nI went outside to retrieve my girl and told the couple from Georgia that they didn't need to wait on the line because they had tickets. As the four of us walked in, many of the \"bro-nies\" booed as if we were jumping the queue. Very un-Lil'Pony-ish if you ask me, but we were undeterred.\n\n\n\nErin, the autism angel theater manager, did just what she'd hope to do: squeezed in an extra show just 15 minutes later. Bonus: extra tight scheduling precluded the usual reels of commercials and trailers. \u00a0\n\n\n\nOur girl was completely enthralled throughout the movie: horrified at the misbehavior of Sunset Shimmer, terrified when the portal between worlds nearly closed before Twilight Sparkle could return to the Crystal Kingdom, and ecstatic when the ponies-turned-high-school-girls pulled together, stopped their bullying ways, and were getting the school auditorium ready for the senior prom. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was bursting with happiness\u2014not just at the movie, but for days afterwards: \"That movie was just awesome\u2014what was your favorite part?\" she'd ask me. She'd be grinning and laughing, and burst out: \"I can't stop thinking about that movie!\" \u00a0She told me it was so great that she couldn't get it out of her mind: she was playing it over and over again in her head in that way she can do that I can barely fathom.\n\nThis was a win. A big win. We have progress. We went to a movie. In a theatre. Without incident. (This last part, thanks to the extraordinary manager of the Chelsea Clearview Cinema. Thank you, Erin.)\n\n\n\nBut win or not, I find myself somehow forlorn, even bereft.\n\nPerhaps it's just some maternal\u2014and neurotypical\u2014projection of mine that I mourn the reality that our girl is in high school and she has not yet made a friend, not a single one. Her pure pleasure at the sweetness of this movie, where friendship makes for magic, speaks to me of a longing to connect so vast as to be possibly unbridgeable. Will that magic ever happen for her? Will she find a way to connect?\u00a0How do you connect when the things you love mark you as so young, so out-of-sync?\u00a0\n\n\nShe texted me when I was teaching yesterday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was an easy \"yes.\" \u00a0I thought the screenings were over and the DVD release was set for August. \u00a0How could I know that the distributor had caught on to how many Lil' Pony fans there are in the city?\n\nSo tomorrow, 10am, Upper East Side, more Equestria Girls.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe there'll be some other spectrum-y, oddball, equestria girls there. Somehow, somewhere, maybe we'll just find that posse of 15-year-old girls who still love the Lil' Ponies.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pk4Z01Ccrtk/UcStFJ-kcjI/AAAAAAAAAzU/cMHviJUqHDo/s1600/photo+(65).JPG", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_fandom", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0iiB8___blY/UcStS_dzLGI/AAAAAAAAAzc/gAA0j2O82sU/s1600/photo+(67).JPG"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2013/06/friendship-movie-magic.html", "title": "\nFriendship Movie Magic\n"},

So I booked the flight.\n\nWe got to the airport two hours early \u2014 at 5:40 am \u2014 and checked at the ticket counter, as I'd been told to do. \u00a0She looked at our boarding passes for three separate seats scattered throughout the cabin and\u00a0said she couldn't help us, but that customer service on the other side of security would definitely be able to help us. \n\nAfter we made it through the long line for security, we got to the customer service desk, where we were told that we would not be able to have seats together. When I objected, they said, well, they'd try to get us seats together, but there were no guarantees. When I said that we needed disabilities seating with reduced contact with other passengers, the guy at the counter looked at me like I was out of my mind. Our girl's dad even had a typed note with this information that he'd handed to the customer service agent who handed it back as though he couldn't read or, or more likely, just didn't care.\n\nAfter three phone calls to customer service, they somehow managed to find two seats together, so that the girl and her dad could sit side by side. \u00a0My seat was elsewhere. \u00a0Customer service kept insisting that we were seated together even though we weren't -- we were in entirely different rows, at the back of the plane, where our girl would have maximum contact with passengers coming and going from the lavatory. \n\nThough one never wishes for one's kid to have a meltdown \u2014 the toll is just too high on them \u2014 there are those times when one wishes that you could give clueless airline agents just a little taste of the disaster that they are courting by not taking an autism spectrum disability seriously. By blowing off a request for reasonable accommodation (that they had already assured us would be available before we booked the flight). \u00a0By acting like we were making this all up so that we could have cooler seats. \u00a0Yeah, right. \u00a0I've decided to get my kid a life-long neurological disorder so I can get preferential seating on airplanes.\n\nI wonder why it is that we get better disability accommodations on every other airline we've ever flown, even on frumpy old American Airlines. All I can figure is that Virgin America is just too cool to make reasonable accommodations. After all, having disabilities is just so not fashionable. \u00a0Or maybe it's that they're really not Virgin America, and therefore are not acquainted with the Americans with Disabilities Act. It's pretty hard to figure this one out.\n\nBut so much for putting the fun back in air travel. \u00a0As far as this family is concerned, Virgin America is a big old able-ist FAIL.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/08/virgin-america-no-accommodations-for.html", "title": "\nVirgin America: No Accommodations for Autism Families\n"},

Last week we had one of those moments.\n\n\n  There  had been some tears at school about a timeline project regarding the  Civil War. The project involved choosing three events during the war,  writing a ten-sentence paragraph about the event, and another  ten-sentence paragraph about why the event was important.  This was a  lot of writing for our girl.  Frankly, it's a lot of writing for most of  the kids in her class. I'm glad they're being pushed, but this is  definitely a push.\n  Our girl chose the election of 1860, The Battle of Shiloh, and Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg. \n  Regrettably  I was unavailable for homework help on the first night of this  multi-night assignment, but our girl took her best shot at it on her  own, and wrote lots of sentences, some of which did not make much sense.\n  The  next day her teacher asked her why she had chosen The Battle of Shiloh,  and our girl didn't really have an answer for her other than \"I have finished  this assignment, and I am NOT going to do ANY work on it over the  weekend \u2014 the weekend is my time for relaxing.\"  Her teacher was really  puzzled as to why she had chosen the Battle of Shiloh as one of the  three most important events of Civil War.  Our girl strongly resisted  changing her choice of events \u2014 \"it's my project, it's my choice.\" And  then, as it was reported to me, her flash drive where her work was saved  failed, and she burst into tears.\n  That's  pretty much what I would do if I had done something to the best of my  ability, followed the instructions as I understood them, been questioned  about my decisions, and then had a technological glitch that lost all  the work I'd done.  Bursting into tears would definitely be on my  repertoire of possible responses.  Seems pretty much NT to me.\n  Since  the flash drive failed \u2014 and we haven't recovered any of her work \u2014 we  had the opportunity to start over from scratch, and so she followed her  teacher's advice and shifted to the Battle at Fort Sumter.  I was  puzzled about why she had originally chosen the Battle of Shiloh, but  put it aside.\n  Over the weekend I coached her as she worked on her drafts.  The first one went something like this.\n  Fort Sumter was the start of the Civil War.\u00a0\u00a0The  Civil War began with Fort Sumter.  Because of Fort Sumter the Civil War  started.  The beginning of the Civil war was at Fort Sumter.  They were  running out of supplies at Fort Sumter.  They didn't have enough food  and military materials at Fort Sumter.  They were worried about supplies  at Fort Sumter.  They only had 97 men to fight at Fort Sumter.  They  didn't want to loose [sic] any men.\n  And so on.  \n  Pretty  much each sentence repeated the previous sentence.  As she wrote her  sentences, she would stop, and say, \"Wait, let me count how many  sentences I have.\" When I pointed out that the sentences said more or  less the same thing, our girl she said, \"Well, I have to get to ten  sentences.\" \n  The  grading rubric specified that the highest marks would go to papers that  fulfilled a number of criteria, including having 8-10 sentences in each  paragraph.  She took the rubric literally -- \"Write 10 sentences \u2014 get  an A.\"  The actual content of the paragraph was less important to our  girl than the number of sentences.\n  She was doing what planning and motivational speakers call beginning with the end in mind,  but the end she wanted was the A, skipping more or less right over a  coherent paragraph (a concept that she may not really understand,  whereas ten sentences is clear, quantifiable and incontrovertible).  Concrete and literal thinking \u2014 what we'd expect of our spectrum-y girl \u2014  and also, to her credit, planning for a desired result.\n\nAs  I was looking through her schoolwork binder to familiarize myself with  the Civil War I found some assignments that I hadn't seen. \u00a0Truth is, I  haven't been checking on her homework or schoolwork much these days.  \u00a0She's a teenager, and, as she puts it, \"You DO NOT have to look at my  homework \u2014 I have it UNDER control.\" \n\nInside her binder, I found a series of graded worksheets that she'd completed in her studies:\n  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Battle of Gettysburg, B+\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Election of 1860, B-\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fort Sumter, C\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Battle of Shiloh, A, Great work\n\nFor me this solved the mystery of her choice of the Battle of Shiloh. \u00a0Shiloh was one of the most important battles of her Civil War because she'd won, she'd gotten an A. \u00a0And she wanted to repeat that win, again and again.\n\nAfter  the historic Battle of Shiloh Major General Ulysses S. Grant was  questioned about his decisions, too. \u00a0He was savaged in the press for  the huge loss of life in that very costly encounter of the war. \u00a0People  claimed, falsely, that he'd been drunk and derelict in his duty. \u00a0He'd  kept his men in an unprotected field \u2014 a position that resulted in huge  losses on the first day of the battle, but that ultimately led to their  victory on the second day. Grant had the end in mind, in a much more  costly circumstance. \u00a0Grant was going for his own sort of A, like our  girl, not exactly thinking about what would happen in the middle of the  battle.\n\nIn  the end, we know how the story worked out for Grant \u2014 the Union won the  war, he became a hero, and later won the Presidency. I hope our girl  can rally her forces and pull out some of the wins she's going to need  in her own battles. It's feeling like she can.

{"date": "Monday, August 15, 2011", "body": "\nThe swag bags of new product samples that I hauled home from BlogHer 2011 were nothing compared to the real takeaway: the powerful sense that disability rights will be at the heart of any 21st century social justice movement. \n\nDon't get me wrong\u2014 I'm thrilled about my new Post-It Note sample products, my 3M damage-free wall hooks, the Ziploc lunchtime plasticware with a special compartment for salad dressing, and especially about the Dr. Scholl's arch supports custom-fitted with their new computerized footmapping kiosk. But all this stuff I'm carrying back to New York is nothing compared to the germ of the idea that disability rights will be the social justice and civil rights movement of this century.\n\nThe BlogHer 2011 convention, where nearly 4,000 bloggers gathered to learn more about honing their craft and expanding their readership bandwidth, may seem an unlikely place to launch or relaunch a movement for social justice for person of all abilities, but that may be exactly what happened at last Friday's Special Needs Mini-Conference.\n\nOrganized by Julia Roberts, founder of Support for Special Needs, and featuring bloggers Shannon Des Roches Rosa, Robert Rummel-Hudson and Aurelia Cotta, the Special Needs Mini-Conference was nestled in the middle of the BlogHer convention, in the middle of the middle day, at lunchtime. \u00a0In short, special needs were at the center of the BlogHer schedule. \u00a0It was certainly at the center of my schedule, as I'd not have made the trip to San Diego for the convention were it not for the Mini-Conference.\n\nAnd the trip was well worth it. \u00a0Each of the panelists brought a particular perspective to the conversation, but Robert Rummel-Hudson was most outspoken about the need to launch a reinvigorated disabilities rights movement in the face of the coming battles over budget cuts. \u00a0Rummel-Hudson, who blogs at Fighting Monsters with Plastic Swords,\u00a0called on bloggers to step outside of the special needs ghetto (my word, not his) to reach the millions of people who fancy themselves unaffected by disabilities.\n\nThe army of advocates and allies that disabilities activists will need in the coming budget battles will have to include those folks who have not yet faced up to the reality of their own human fragility and vulnerability. It may even need to pull in those people who think of our kids as burdens on the system.\u00a0Bloggers, Rummel-Hudson argued, can contribute to building a disabilities social justice movement by doing what we're already doing, but doing it better:\u00a0by telling our stories so well that everyone, special needs parent or not, finds themselves\u00a0embracing our struggles as worthy of their support.\n\nGathering these political allies for persons with disabilities ought to be the easiest of tasks. As Rummel-Hudson pointed out, disabilities know no political party. Disabilities impact families as politically disparate as the Kennedys and the Palins. But, on the other hand, as I commented from my seat in the audience, disabilities are frightening for people who aren't around them. There, in the person of the wheel-chair-enabled or the cognitively-different is the specter of dependency, of vulnerability, and of deviation from some ideal of a normal life.\n\nOf course we're all on a continuum of abilities. Somewhere in the back of our minds we know that we're all just one serious illness or one accident or one gene deletion from the ranks of the disabled or differently abled.\u00a0And if we live long enough to become old, frail, incontinent, and infirm, we'll all get to be disabled eventually.\u00a0The trouble is, that's a hard sell. Who wants to contemplate the reality that disability is a category we may all inhabit at one point or another, especially as rights and services are so paltry already?\n\nDisability civil rights strategy is ever so slightly different than that of other civil rights movements. Other social justice struggles have relied on alliances built across difference. For example, very few of us move readily between racial categories (though some people argue that we do and should). Similarly, very few people, save M2F transgendered folks, go from benefiting from male privilege to living in a world circumscribed by gendered stereotypes. But civil rights built around disability rights are somewhat different in that we can all enter the realm of the disabled. \n\nThat's not to say that we can't be othered, or treated as other by persons who imagine themselves superior and invulnerable. There were groans of recognition from the mini-conference audience as people recounted the looks of stricken pity, and the \"I don't know how you do it's\" that we all hear from people who imagine that our lives are horrendous and our children are some sort of pathetic freaks worthy of a 19th-century sideshow. Usually such expressions of pity, however ingenuous, come without any concrete offers of support. This tendency to make us the distant and undesireable other limits our allies, advocates, and alliances, even if a good pity party may help raise funds at the charity ball or annual telethon.\n\nDisability activism necessarily fractures the American fantasy of the heroic individual who rises from nothing to the pinnacle of success. In its place we foster the ideal of persons supported by, and supporting, each other.\u00a0Disability activism requires that we all embrace our own limits, our own vulnerabilities, our own profound potential for incapacity. Like the Buddhist meditation on one's death as the path to the fullest possible life, disability activism requires that we all face up to our own finitude, laugh, and get on with it.\n\nI'll be working on that, and telling our story as well as I can, and thanks to Blogher 2011, enjoying a new community of blogging compatriots and some custom\u00a0arch support from Dr. Scholl's.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogher.com/royo-special-needs-miniconference", "http://supportforspecialneeds.com/", "http://www.squidalicious.com/", "http://www.schuylersmonsterblog.com/", "http://nomatterhowsmall.blogspot.com/", "http://www.schuylersmonsterblog.com/", "http://youtu.be/yUJ8MhXTwtI", "http://www.footmapping.com/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2011/08/blogher-2011-unpacking-special-needs.html", "title": "\nBlogHer 2011: Unpacking the Special Needs Swag\n"},

I was planning on staying in California for an extra day, so I told our girl that I would be seeing her grandmother, and also possibly her two uncles. \"Great,\" she said, \"Tell them I said hi, would you?\" I almost dropped the phone in shock. Although this would be an ordinary conversation for a neurotypical family, it was extraordinary for us.\n\nII. Right after I got back from my professional conference, there was another conference, of the parent-teacher variety, the first of the semester. We view these events with a great deal of trepidation. Typically we are told that our girl is too this or too that, or not enough this and not enough that. But this year was different. Because our girl is an eighth grader, she is invited to the conference. It's a parent-teacher-student conference. \n\nPerhaps because she was there (\"nothing about us without us\") the conference took an entirely different turn. We learned that our girl scored highest of any student on their history exam and is the most sought-after study partner for history because her notes are the most complete. Everyone wants to study with our girl. And she's having no problem managing her anxiety from the bell or the passing period. The only thing they'd like to see her work on is talking with other kids at lunchtime (which she still doesn't do).\n\nInstead of discussing our girl as a bundle of pathologies and deficiencies and sites for remediation, we were talking about her strengths. \u00a0A conference that included her required that everyone present focus on her assets and progress. We had a hard time hailing a cab to get home because we were all floating about ten feet above street level.\n\n\n\nWall Street Occupation during October 29th snowstorm.Photo: David Shankbone, CC license, use with attribution.\nIII.

{"date": "Sunday, August 14, 2011", "body": "\n\r\n\r\nSea Life Aquarium, Carlsbad, California\r\nThis summer we were meant to go to a water park. I'd cut a deal with the dear girl: if she attended a\u00a0couple of computer animation workshops\u00a0she could go to a water park. Water parks are her idea of summer heaven. I'm much less enthusiastic, especially after the\u00a0wrenched toe incident of 2007\u00a0and a series of online reviews featuring human waste.\n\nBut still, a deal is a deal, and I was bracing myself for a day of sliding down inclines of various sorts in all kinds of questionable water.\n\nHappily for me, we didn't wind up at a water park. Our girl, you know the one \u2014 the one who is described as inflexible and rigid \u2014 changed her plans.\u00a0\nHere's how that happened. \u00a0\nWhen we checked into our hotel in San Diego, our girl caught a glimpse of the siteseeing brochures that lined a case in the lobby.* One of them was for the\u00a0La Jolla Caves Kayak Tour. We've missed kayaking on the Hudson this summer after the sewage treatment plant fire that leaked untreated waste into the river during the hottest days of July.\n\nI took this hotel-lobby-brochure opportunity to introduce the kayaking possibility.\n\n\"Hey Sweet M, what would you think about going on a kayaking tour of underwater caves?\n\n\"Underwater caves?\" she asked, with mounting excitement.\n\n\"Yes, underwater caves.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"When you're in a new place it is important to see the sites.\"\n\n\"So you'd be game to go to the underwater caves instead of a waterpark?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, underwater caves sound good.\"\n\nAnd that was that. A plan was changed. A deal was renegotiated. Our girl's longtime inflexibility is giving way to a willingness to try something new. \n\n\r\n\r\nLa Jolla Kayaking Tour at La Jolla Caves\n\u00a0(photo: courtesy Yelp)\r\nHer dad and I were a bit nervous about the kayaking tour. Her swimming skills are not great, and there was the matter of walking across the sand to the shore line since she still freaks out when her feet hit the sand. And then there was the hurdle of her making her way through the surf line out to the open water.\n\nTrue to form, our girl started to freak out when her bare feet hit the sand\n\nEwwwwee. \u00a0It's sand. \u00a0It's scratchy. \u00a0Oh, NOOOO, there's an insect. \u00a0Did you see the insect?\n\nOther people on the tour started to stare.\n\nFortunately, the folks at\u00a0La Jolla Kayak\u00a0were awesome. They put our girl in a kayak with Tommy, a seasoned former lifeguard, so she was in incredibly competent hands.\n\nI told our girl to take some slow deep breaths because pretty soon her feet would be in the kayak and there would be no sand.\n\nAnd that's what she did \u2014 she headed right out through the surf line with Tommy. \u00a0She was terrified, but she did it. \u00a0And once she was safely past the breaking waves, she was full of questions for the guides: what are these pink things on this kelp? (sea anenomes that attached to the kelp because the water has been so cold); are those sand sharks camouflaged? (yes); where are the sea lions? (it's too overcast for them to hang out on the rocks today).\n\nWe couldn't have been more proud of our inquisitive seafaring kayaking girl.\n\n\r\n\r\nPelly's Mini-Golf Course in Del Mar\r\nThe next day we hit Pelly's mini-golf course in Del Mar and the Octopus's Garden by the Sea exhibit at the\u00a0Sea Life Aquarium\u00a0in Carlsbad, which has my vote for best aquarium ever because it's just such a perfect scale for kids and families.

{"date": "Sunday, June 06, 2010", "body": "\nBeing Sweet M's parent has taught me to embrace being wrong.  I'm not sure if that's because she's on the spectrum, or if it's just part of the whole parenting package.Take this morning for example.  Sweet M wasn't running a 2K, she was running a 5K. She was running more than twice as far as I had anticipated.  So I was pretty far off.  On the other hand, I have to think of all the things that were right: she was running in a race, the race was this morning, and the distance was measured in kilometers.  But still, being 3K off is pretty far off.I used to loathe being wrong.  Needing to be right is an occupational hazard.  In my line of work, higher education, we all have to pride ourselves on being right.  We have to care about not only the broad swath of a thesis, but the page number for a footnote.  Being right, being certain, that's our business, our stock in trade.Professors and others in the expertise business profess to having some sort of knowledge that is not readily available to others -- some kind of specialty or know-how that took years of study or practice to acquire.  The internet is making pretty short work of this model of knowledge, and I think that's basically a good thing.  Most information, and the knowledge and understanding it makes possible, ought to be widely available, not squirreled away for a knowledge elite.But the politics of knowledge aside, Sweet M's parent has taught me a lot about being wrong.  The errors that we've made \u2014 at least the ones we're aware of \u2014 seem to fall into two general classes, errors of the head and errors of the heart.The errors of the head are fairly common, and usually easily resolved.  One lacks information, or forgets something, or puts some information together in the wrong way.  Examples might include my mistake today: thinking 2K instead of 5K.  Or forgetting that she was staying at school for an after school program.  Or thinking, as we did for a short time between 2003 and 2005 that we could leave much of her education to her school because they were the learning disability specialists, they had the superior knowledge.Errors of heart are another matter.  These are harder to live with.  \"Errors of heart\" sounds as though it would include being mean-spirited, wicked and nasty.   Or violent or neglectful.  And errors of heart could include those, but fortunately, in our case, I think those sorts of errors of heart have been rare or non-existent.  As parents, both Fathersvox and I are pretty good-natured, though we can fall into the occasional lapse brought on by exhaustion or illness.But the more insidious errors of heart come not from a lapse of love, but from a surfeit of it.  Among our worst errors of heart is one that I've fallen into again and again: the seductive lure of the normal.Early on I called it \"oughtism.\"  My first real encounter with my own \"oughtism\" was when I fell prey to the idea that she ought to be able to keep her bed dry at night because she was old enough, enough already.  That lead to a horrendous period of sleepless night, and anxiety, and loads of laundry.  In the end, because Sweet M is always learning and always growing, she figured out how to keep her bed dry when she was ready.Now it's easier for me to detect the onset of an episode of oughtism \u2014 the telltale signs are any sentences that start with \"By now she should . . . \"  or \"She really ought to be able to . . . \" or \"Most kids her age . . .\".    A recent episode included \"wow, she oughta go to summer camp\" even though she's never liked camp and never expressed any interest in going.Fathersvox has developed an finely-tuned oughtism detector \u2014 when he sees me entranced by the siren call of everyone else does it, he pulls me out of it with a \"Why should she?\"  Or a \"Who says so?\"  Or, on less patient occasions, \"You've got to be kidding.\"So I'm enjoying being wrong today.  This was an easy one.  She went more than twice as far as even I had expected.  That's another kind of error I'm getting used to.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2010/06/on-being-wrong-again-and-again-and.html", "title": "\nOn Being Wrong \u2013 Again, and Again, and Again\n"},

And the work of this has taken almost all the waking hours that haven't gone to teaching.\n\nIt started in November 2012 when we learned about the planned development, and has consumed us for the past year. Our girl has stepped up to help\u2014postering the neighborhood, writing to Mayor DeBlasio, lobbying our neighbors on Christmas Day 2012 with cookies she baked and a petition to sign. I could not be more proud of her and of my neighborhood. We have all worked very, very hard to stop the assault on our neighborhood. Sadly, we are not winning.\n\nWhen we went into the fight, we knew it would be tough, and that the chances of winning were slim.\u00a0 The Bloomberg administration was gung-ho on development\u2014especially of the luxury condos that now sit empty across the city while veterans and families and the mentally ill sleep in the streets, in the subways, and even under the scaffolding where the condos are being built. And Mayor DeBlasio seems to be following in his path, taxing empty lots to encourage development on every vacant lot in the city. \n\n\n\nConstruction of 16-story building\nnext to our home \n\nSo why go into a fight that you're not likely to win? The smart money in this fight was on the developer and the fancy charity that sold them their air rights in a real estate boondoggle. But smart or not, we went into this fight. Thinking about it now, I can only say that we did it because we love our neighborhood.\n\nThis is our home and our lives are as shaped by this place as they are by genetics or culture or anything else. This is where we conceived our girl and lived through morning sickness and preeclampsia. This is where we brought her home from the hospital on a freezing November day, a fragile bundle of blue and pink dreams. This is where we watched her grow, through hip dysplasia and colic and sleepless nights.\n\nThis is where she had her first birthday, and the sixteen birthdays that have followed. This is where I finished my dissertation and wrote my first book while she learned to crawl and to walk and to run. This is where she went to the local nursery school (soon also to be luxury condos). And this is where the seasoned preschool teacher named Donna told us something wasn't quite right. This is where we received the report, on the week between Christmas and New Year's Day 2001, that told us that something was wrong and that sent me to my computer to search (not yet in Google, but in Altavista and Yahoo) for the terms \"perseveration\" and \"echolailia.\"\n\nThis is where we watched from the roof on that terrible day when the planes flew into the towers and the people tumbled from the sky and the buildings scattered in a hail of dust. This is where she grew terrified of dogs and finally outgrew that terror. This is the place where she's had a Christmas tree each year, and Easter baskets in the spring, and where she learned, in the end, that Santa is a myth. This is where she got her myriad diagnoses and outgrew so many of them. This is where the early intervention folk attempted their interventions of speech therapy and ABA. This is where she came home every night after a long day at school. This is where she learned to read, to draw, and to play.\n\nIt is so much, and it is so little, this place we call our home. It is just a small apartment on a formerly quiet, tree-lined street across from a playground where our girl grew up\u2014but it has contained and shaped the narrative of our lives. \n\nWhen our girl wrote to then Mayor-Elect DeBlasio to ask him for his help in stopping the development that will steal the sunlight from the playround, this is part of what she said about what is happening to our home: Where I live and where my neighborhood lives isn't just a part of the city. It's a part of our happiness that will be taken away forever.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\n\nFrom our girl's letter to then Mayor-Elect DeBlasio. He never answered.\n\nAnd so we love this place in a way that isn't rational. We love this place because it has been the place that has shaped our lives. And we had hoped, in some small way, to shape it as well: to cherish it, to keep it safe from the assault of the developers. We wanted our girl to know that she can join with her neighbors for something she believes in and make a difference. We couldn't bear for her to fall prey to the cynicism and apathy that our oligarchy breeds. But alas, she may yet, because surely they are winning.\n\nThe battle may not yet be completely over, but we're pulling back and regrouping. And so we find ourselves back home, back at Autism's Edges. And there are nearly a year of adventures I've yet to report on. I'll have to fill you in on how our girl went from scoring a 64 on her Regent's Earth Science exam to scoring an 86. Yes, a 22 point gain in just three weeks of studying! And I'll tell you about her first walks around the neighborhood on her own, even as we both held our breath at home. And the week-long trip she took to the Grand Tetons with her classmates. And the most recent development: her first pal, a girl with whom she shares a passion for Pok\u00e9mon and Barnes and Noble bookstores.\n\nThis is still our home. We have not moved on just yet. We don't want to move, and we're not quite sure we'll be able to stay in the shadow of the tower that will take away our sky and our sunlight. But stay or go, wherever we are, we know that we'll always be living at Autism's Edges. I hope you'll stay with us as we find our way through this the year ahead. Thanks for your patience during our great silence. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://southvillageneighbors.com/2013/12/22/news-wrap-up-2013/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/realestate/south-of-west-fourth-street-tracking-the-ghosts-of-bohemia.html", "http://brokelyn.com/bill-de-blasio-plans-tax-nycs-vacant-lots-existence/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EU6NKkFPQxQ/U1Vw675wbwI/AAAAAAAAA3E/4xj2MRgKLzE/s1600/20140421+180.JPG", "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/realestate/commercial/sohos-gods-love-we-deliver-faces-obstacle-to-expansion.html?pagewanted=2", "http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2011/05/25/childrens_aid_society_buildings_will_become_luxury_condos.php", "http://southvillageneighbors.com/2013/02/19/save-the-sunshine-at-vesuvio-playground-and-pool/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TM6sCnmy3fU/U1VXbgREX_I/AAAAAAAAA2c/05J4yhx9QCQ/s1600/exerpt-deblasio-letter.tiff", "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/04/16/The-US-is-not-a-democracy-but-an-oligarchy-study-concludes/2761397680051/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2014/04/our-home-at-autisms-edges.html", "title": "\nOur Home at Autism's Edges\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 23, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nYesterday our girl made me cry. \u00a0In a good way, but cry I did.\n\nWe were watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade on television, and an Army military band came on, she looked up and said, \"Wow, Grandpa would love to see that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"he would. And if there is a heaven maybe he's looking on and can see it.\"\n\nShe was thinking about her grandfather, and what he'd like, even though he's been gone in body for nearly four years and in mind for more than a decade. Score one for expanded theory of mind.\n\nWe've been very careful about the God thing, and the afterlife thing, and the what happens when you die question. We say we don't know. That people believe in a lot of different things, but that we really just can't know for sure.\u00a0But regarding Santa, we have been careless.\n\nOur girl believes. In Santa, that is. And it's my fault.\n\nShe's 15-years-old, and she still believes in Santa. Over the past four years I have probed gently for an opening to break the news to her, and have never found an occasion to reveal that Santa is a worldwide performance art piece conducted by folks who still wish there were magic in the world in the form of a beneficent old man and his elves.\u00a0But I have felt that I have been doing her a disservice to continue acting as though there is a Santa as she moves into full-on adolescence.\n\nThis morning I proposed to her that this year, since she's a teenager, that we might want to do Christmas differently. That maybe it is time for us to retire Santa and do something else as a family. \u00a0I explained that Santa is something that parents do for their kids, and that she's getting to be a grown-up and will want to know how to do if she has kids or works with kids. That it's magic, but it's the magic that parents make for their children because they love them.\n\nShe looked at me with utter disbelief. \n\n\"What do you mean there is no Santa? \u00a0How did that bicycle get in here? \u00a0How to you explain the videos? \u00a0(We made these Portable North Pole videos for the past two years.) What about the cards he leaves us for the cookies? What about the presents?\"\n\nShe is furious with me right now. \u00a0Her words: \"You just ruined the most important holiday of my life. And what do you have to say about the Easter bunny?\"\n\nAs I started to explain, she said, \"Enough of your lies.\"\n\nBut which lies? \u00a0The lies that are the truth or the lies that are the story of Santa?\n\nI came from a big family and was very inquisitive -- think little detective syndrome here -- so I learned about Santa early on. I still remember creeping up the ladder to the attic in the house on McCain Street and seeing all the wrapped boxes. \u00a0My eyes grew wide and I thought, wow, look what I found! \u00a0Christmas! \n\nWhen I asked my mom about it, she told me that yes, there was no Santa, but to please keep it our secret because my brothers and sister still believed. \u00a0I was five. \u00a0And I was so excited to be in on the grown-ups' secret. It was thrilling to get to help my little sister and brothers have fun. \n\nFor some reason I was too young, or too Catholic, to make the next logic association: if no Santa, then no God?\n\nOur girl is fifteen, and now she feels hoodwinked. Angry. Bereft. And her mom, whom she trusted implicitly, has confessed to being a serial liar, an impersonator, and a forger.\n\nI'm going to break out my bad mom t-shirt and wear it all weekend unless you all have some ideas to save me from the horrible corner I've painted myself into.\n\nHow will she ever be able to trust me again?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.portablenorthpole.com/home"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/11/believing.html", "title": "\nBelieving\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 10, 2013", "body": "\n\nPlease review the illustration below and answer the question that follows.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nQuestion from New York State Regents Sample Earth Science Exam, January 24, 2013.\n\n\n\n\nNow pretend that your future college and employment options depend on your ability to answer said question (and 84 others like it).\n\n\n\nAnd while you're at it, pretend that you are 14- or 15-years-old. And that you have an autism spectrum disorder. \u00a0Or dyslexia. \u00a0Or haven't had breakfast. \u00a0Or your parents just divorced. \u00a0Or whatever else might be going on in the life of a 15-year-old.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you answer the question?\n\n\n\nI can't. \u00a0Even if I don't imagine all the other variables in this thought experiment, I can't answer the question correctly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn fact, I can't answer most of the questions on the 9th grade New York State Earth Science Regent's exam.*\n\n\n\nHas that hampered my prospects in life? Perhaps. I'm not an astrophysicist. I'm not a geo-engineer. And I'm not a meteorologist. \u00a0I'm okay with that. \u00a0I'm a tenured university professor at a highly-respected university in New York City. I've won numerous federal grants. I'm the author of a well-received book in my field from a major university press. Most people who know me think of me as rather well-educated and knowledgeable.\n\n\n\nUsually I wouldn't share this information about myself, but it seems relevant to these tests as some metric of educational attainment.\n\n\n\nBut if I were 15-years-old today, there is a good chance that I would not earn a high school diploma in New York State. Well, let me clarify that. I might earn what's called a \"local diploma\" in New York State.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnywhere else (as far as a I know) a high school diploma is a high school diploma. But in New York State we have an educational caste system where some kids earn a \"Regents diploma,\" some earn what's called a \"local diploma,\" and some earn an \"IEP diploma.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo earn a Regents diploma you have to earn at least 65 points on five Regents exams: English, Math, Global History, American History, and one science (either Earth Science or Biology). To earn a local diploma you have to have 55 or more on these four exams. Without that, you either don't graduate or, if you have an IEP, you can earn an IEP diploma. You can go to a private college with a local diploma, but you can't go to the New York State University (SUNY) system, the most affordable schools in the state.\n\n\nSince last summer we have been working hard to see that our girl will pass the five Regents exams that are required for the Regents diploma. The first of these exams took place in June. A passing score is 65 or above. A \"low pass\" is 55-64. And below 55 is a non-passing score. \n\nAfter a year of work toward passing these exams, our girl earned a 64. That is, she missed a regular passing score by one point. One point.\u00a0\n\nShe had a near perfect score on the lab section of the exam: 15/16. \u00a0She routinely earns A's and B+'s on in-class exams that cover the same material. Her teacher said this exam just had too much vocabulary for her.\n\nI was thrilled for her that she had passed, even with a low pass. Her father is heartbroken and angry that she didn't earn at least 75 points since she does much better than that in her course work.\n\nFor two weeks after the exam scores were in, we spoke, and argued, and spoke, about almost nothing else: he wants her to study all summer with him and retake the exam in August. I want her to have a summer break, revel in having passed it (4 of the 39 students in her class did not earn even a low pass), and start to look a the vocabulary for the upcoming Biology and Global History exams.\n\nI understand his position: he thinks that these exams and the information therein actually matter in life. He thinks it's a worthy goal to pass these exams with high scores. And he thinks letting her get by with a low pass is giving up on her and her future.\n\nAnd I think these exams are unnecessary and damaging hurdles that destroy a natural love of learning and replace it with a desire to pass, to score, to win \u2013 and often, to cheat a system that is unfairly rigged against our kids. I think they contribute to the single most annoying question I get in every class I teach: \"Will this be on the test?\"\u00a0I think these exams are destroying our kids' lives, turning them into test-taking machines. Having her study for these exams is, in my mind, nothing more than a necessary evil.\n\nSo we don't agree. We won't agree. We've agreed to disagree. We haven't decided what to do: whether she will retake the exam in August or not.\n\nWhat I do know is that as a society we seem to love our educational standards more than we love our kids if we are willing to subject them to this adolescent rite of passage called standardized testing.\n\nSo-called primitive tribal societies would incise their young people's skin with magical markings and rub in ash to create the raised welts of scarification, or send them into the forest to fend for themselves to mark the passage to adulthood, reincorporating them into the group when they healed or returned from their quest.\n\nHere in New York State we are somewhat more subtle. The scars we create are invisible: we mark our children's neural pathways with specialized technical knowledge that will likely be of no actual use to them, send them into the ordeal of testing arena, and then reincorporate them into a stratified society based, in part, on how well they perform this task.\n\nWe can opt out of this rite of passage, but what sort of future can we imagine for our girl if we do? That is the question we have pondered for the past three weeks. What do you think about high stakes exams for our kids, ASD and otherwise? What have you done about such tests?\n\n* The answer for the exam question, if not to these bigger questions, is \"D. White dwarf.\" You can look at this exam and any of the other archived Regents exams at:\u00a0http://www.nysedregents.org/\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/07/oughtism-revisited.html", "http://www.nysedregents.org/"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2013/07/modern-rites-of-passage-or-reflections.html", "title": "\nModern Rites of Passage: Or Reflections on the Tyranny of Standardized Tests\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 10, 2012", "body": "\nYou know, things have to be pretty horrible for there to be no benefit to anyone.\u00a0 And even our big wind from Superstorm Sandy did have a couple of good outcomes.\n\n\n\nLong lines to vote in a neighbor \nchurch basement.\n\nFirst and foremost is the possibility that it was Sandy that blew Barack Obama back into office, riding on the wings of the goodwill he spread across the region, where FEMA stepped up fast, however imperfectly.\u00a0 And the love affair between the President and Governor Chris Christie \u2013 well, it made me feel as though there might be hope for something called leadership instead of partisan bickering.\n\nThat win might be the biggest gift of Sandy for those of us who'd like our kids to keep their health insurance and who have girls whom we'd like to see grow up with a modicum of control over their reproductive futures.\n\nIt was the state of exception created by sheer scale of the losses that made people need to come together, need to rally.\u00a0 And there is the return, in beautiful force, of Occupy Wall Street in the mutual aid work of Occupy Sandy.\n\nCloser to home, there were the little artworks we made and the way we rallied together, and the gift of seeing a dear, dear old friend from Park Slope who warmed us up with tea and sent us home with bags of batteries and new flashlights.\n\nAnd then there was how well our girl managed the difficulty of the changes: power out, internet withdrawal, no television \u2013 it was like a giant electronic timeout from the universe. Time out is definitely no fun. Instead of the comforting routine of a shower at 9 pm, she had a tepid bath with pot-boiled water.\u00a0 She was a trooper for two days, but relieved to get to a hotel uptown and get warm, and go online, and use her phone.\u00a0 Although after two days there, she was desperate to get home.\u00a0 Luckily we got home. What a relief.\n\nAnd then, there's our marvelously clean freezer and fridge. You know how it gets. When do you have time \u2013 or the desire -- to clean out the fridge? But there's nothing like a giant block of melted, spoiled, and refrozen food to get a person cleaning up.\n\n\n\nBefore\n\n\n\nAfter\n\nFinally, there was the amazing thing that happened to me last week when I had\n to call the health insurance company about a claim that they have stalled\n and balked about. The health insurance company we have has outsourced \nsome specialties to another company to review \"medical necessity\" on those claims.\n\nTechnically\n the subsidiary company staff is not supposed to talk to members like myself who are \npursuing their claims \u2013 they're only supposed to talk to the health \ninsurance company or the doctor.\n\nBut my doctor's home was without power\n for 11 days and her office was without phone, fax, or voicemail. This was an exceptional situation. So I \nwas able to intervene and speak with a woman at the medical necessity vetting company who stepped up to \nhelp in the most amazing way.\n\nThis stranger on the other end of the phone said, I'll help you, I'll definitely help you. I know about disasters \u2013 I'll do anything I can to help you.\n\nAfter an hour on the phone, I knew how to help my doctor document the treatment plan as they needed it and they gave me the okay to fax it from my home since I have a working fax.\n\nJust as we were about to hang up, I said to the woman at the subsidiary medical vetting company \u2013 \"You said you knew about disasters? Can I ask what you know?\" \n\nShe said, \"Oh I know. When I was a girl I lived in Mexico, in La Paz, and I was in Hurricane Liza. You might remember it. It rained and rained and rained, and they thought the dam was going to overflow and flood the rich neighborhood, so the government blew up the dam and the water flooded down through the poorer neighborhood, my neighborhood, below the dam, all night long.\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning, I was in a pile of mud and there were corpses all around me.\u00a0 For three years I had to carry water many blocks in bucks as we rebuilt our house and I stepped on a cactus because I had no shoes. The aid workers gave me tetanus shots, but they made my arms hurt so bad I couldn't bend them when I was carrying the water.\"\n\n\"How old were you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ten,\" she said. \"It was 1976, I was ten.\"\n\n\"Oh my god.\u00a0 I am so sorry that happened to you.\"\n\n\"I'm not sorry,\" she said. \"I would do it again because, I know about disasters. I have compassion because I have lived through this.\"\n\nIt's an ill wind that blows no good is an old English expression.\n\nThe Chinese have another saying, more directive, from The Book of Changes, the Confucian oracle to guide to decision making. Work on what's spoiled.\u00a0\n\nI think I'm ready to do that.\u00a0 Fridge and freezer may just be the beginning. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9YhYWG9lguE/UJ8S6j5eHKI/AAAAAAAAAv0/sahhlpijeYA/s1600/photo(4).JPG", "http://www.facebook.com/OccupySandyReliefNyc", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E-yzV1CaJYg/UJ8RYL0IcQI/AAAAAAAAAvk/XNj6mH9XNjE/s1600/photo(3).JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LCcLi77k_NY/UJ8Rj61WABI/AAAAAAAAAvs/HuNztNm34j8/s1600/photo(2).JPG", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Liza_%281976%29"], "link": "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2012/11/an-ill-wind-that-blows-no-good.html", "title": "\nAn Ill Wind That Blows No Good\n"},
