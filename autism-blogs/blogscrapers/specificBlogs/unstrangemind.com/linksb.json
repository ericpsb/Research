Apologies for the inconvenience. I\u2019m still planning to visit Surfside Beach later, just not right now. I am inviting the world to my birthday party. I am planning to spend the first weekend in March (4th, 5th, and 6th)\u00a0celebrating my 49th birthday in Surfside Beach, South Carolina. In cooperation with  Champion Autism Network , Surfside Beach, which is just south of Myrtle Beach, has proclaimed itself to be the first autism-friendly travel destination where Autistic people and their families can enjoy a quieter, less crowded, family-friendly beach in a town trained to understand and accommodate Autistic people with a judgment-free attitude. Let me kno w if you\u2019re coming so we can celebrate together! Bring the kids: they are VERY welcome here! I don\u2019t have specific plans yet, although I might be doing a presentation. I\u2019m definitely going to have a banana split. And I\u2019m going to check out Surfside Beach so I can report back to everyone about food choices, general atmosphere, and autism-friendly holiday resources. And I\u2019d really love to see any of y\u2019all there!  \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/beachballoon.jpg", "http://championautismnetwork.com/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2016/02/13/come-to-my-birthday-party/", "title": "Come to my Birthday\u00a0Party!"},
{"date": "2016/03/30", "body": "It looks like caution tape because autistic shutdown is something that should be treated with caution. A shutdown now and then won\u2019t hurt, but regularly repeated over time, shutdown can lead to neurological damage, especially in children. By now, pretty much everyone who knows\u00a0much of anything about autism\u00a0has heard of meltdowns \u2014 episodes of frustration and panic that seriously disrupt the lives of Autistic people, to varying degrees and amounts per person. But shutdowns don\u2019t seem to get talked about as much as meltdowns and I run into people who, despite the blue-illuminated buckets of \u201cautism awareness\u201d out there, were completely unaware of the phenomenon of shutdown. I had a pretty bad shutdown last week so I thought I ought to write a little bit about them. The people in my day-to-day life were unprepared to deal with a shutdown and that increased everyone\u2019s stress levels. More education about shutdowns can\u2019t hurt and it could help quite a bit. Shutdowns and meltdowns are more similar than they might appear on the surface. One (somewhat simplistic but workable) way to think of shutdown is a meltdown turned inward instead of outward, much as some people describe depression as anger turned inward. My most recent shutdown started off as a meltdown. My brain was going through all its usual short-circuits when some synaptic gap got crossed. Or something. One minute I was out of control, smacking myself in the face, as one does, and the next minute I was on the floor, unable to move. I started to get tunnel vision. My hearing began to get fuzzy. My vision closed and closed like turning off an old tube-driven television, closing down to a tiny dot of light that winked out just as my hearing entirely cut out, leaving me alone in the numbly terrifying darkness. If you like to get your information from audio and video, you should take ten minutes to go watch Amethyst Schaber\u2019s magnificent  discussion of Autistic shutdown on her YouTube channel, \u201cAsk an Autistic.\u201d \u00a0I\u2019ll wait. Shutdown is a response to overwhelm. It is a self-protective response \u2014 shutting down the circuits before they fry, to use computer/brain analogies \u2014 but it is as much a system overload as it is a system failsafe. And too much overwhelm for too long can cause some longer-term shutdown and loss of basic skills. We\u2019re talking everything from forgetting how to tie your shoes to forgetting how to speak. And it can hit at age 14 or age 24 or age 54. As  Mel Baggs explained it : \u201d\u00a0Most people have a level to which they are capable of functioning without burnout, a level to which they are capable of functioning for emergency purposes only, and a level to which they simply cannot function. In autistic people in current societies, that first level is much narrower. Simply functioning at a minimally acceptable level to non-autistic people or for survival, can push us into the zone that in a non-autistic person would be reserved for emergencies. Prolonged functioning in emergency mode can result in loss of skills and burnout.\u201d I my case, it was just a matter of hours before I started coming out of shutdown, much like an ocean creature finally creeping onto a deserted beach after a long swim across the Marianas Trench of shutdown. But I only had one, isolated shutdown. An extended amount of time living on \u201cpersonal emergency reserves\u201d due to being forced to operate at a higher clock speed than my chips are rated for, combined with a series of shutdowns would have left me pretty burned out. I\u2019ve gone 17 days in shutdown before, unable to speak or properly care for myself. This is why shutdowns must be treated with caution and this is why going to apparent extremes to avoid shutdown is not \u201clazy,\u201d \u201cspoiled,\u201d\u00a0 \u201centitled,\u201d or any other judgmental adjective\u00a0anyone has ever been tempted to drop at an Autistic\u2019s feet. Or heap on\u00a0an Autistic\u2019s head, for that matter, since it\u2019s often on the floor alongside the feet once shutdown hits. Miller and Loos wrote about shutdowns and stress, both  in a manner accessible to laypeople  and in an  academic paper . Their observations were based on a case study of an Autistic six-year-old girl who was prone to shutdown under stress. The authors found that shutdown behavior gets labelled as conscious avoidance but is more likely an involuntary\u00a0physiological process caused by \u201cstress instability,\u201d an inability to regulate the body\u2019s overwhelming response to stressors. The authors hypothesize that shutdown begins with the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the brain\u00a0and quickly spirals into a debilitating feedback loop: the BLA is involved in experiencing emotions. When the BLA becomes overstimulated, it can become hyperreactive, leading to extreme emotionality, heightened levels of fear, and social withdrawal. The BLA can quickly become hyperreactive when exposed for too long to corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a \u201cstress-mediating neurotransmitter.\u201d In other words, stress gives the BLA a hair trigger and the resulting explosions feed more CRF to the BLA, ramping the overload up in a ratcheting cascade of intense panic that finally flips all the breaker switches, resulting in shutdown. This is probably why my own meltdown tipped over into shutdown: I had been stressed for days with multiple meltdowns and my system just couldn\u2019t handle any more stimulation so it shut off to prevent my brain from frying itself. My brain crawled up inside its own virtual Faraday cage to wait things out. In the case of \u201cthe SD child,\u201d Miller and Loos observed that one shutdown would make her extra vulnerable to more shutdowns during the following three weeks. It takes that long for the BLA to \u201ccome back down\u201d from its hyperaroused state. It\u2019s pretty easy to see how quickly things can take a bad turn if the brain is not given time to heal. This is the low-detail version of why I have a medical discharge from the Navy and why I was able to hold\u00a0a series of\u00a0minimum-wage jobs before the military\u00a0but unable to get a job at all afterwards. When I signed up for the Navy, I didn\u2019t understand my neurology. It was a devastating blow to not only fail at boot camp but come out of it so debilitated I couldn\u2019t even keep a roof over my head any more. This is why I speak so strongly about helping Autistic children to build low-stress environments that nurture rather than damage their neurology. This is why I warn so often against shaming Autistics for not \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d the way you think they ought to instead of the way that protects them from damage. Of course it\u2019s healthy to step out of one\u2019s comfort zone from time to time. What you need to remember is that the entire world is outside of an Autistic\u2019s comfort zone. We live our whole\u00a0lives outside that zone. Please recognize and honor that. I just can\u2019t say that enough: we  are  trying and the obstacles can be as massive for us as they are invisible\u00a0to you. Treat shutdown\u00a0\u00a0as the medical situation it truly is. Help us get away from bright lights and loud noises. Help us find a quiet space to re-regulate our nervous system. And be gentle with us as we recover from a neurological episode, understanding how delicately balanced our brains are after\u00a0marinating in the biochemicals of\u00a0stress. We need support, not blame. We need peace and stress-relief, not punishment. And, always, we need love, understanding, and acceptance.

{"date": "2016/04/10", "body": "When I\u2019m not working with the public, I start telling myself this story inside my head about how I\u2019m \u201cdisabled, but not really disabled, you know?\u201d Right, that story. Internalized ableism rears its ugly head again. And then, just as I\u2019ve gotten myself talked into the notion that \u201cthe last 20-something years of living on SSI have just been a sweet scam and how on earth was it so easy to get on that, anyway?\u201d \u2026 then I try working again. Like right now. A happy confluence allowed me to start driving Uber in the town where I was hiding from winter weather. My car is new enough and in good enough shape, I have a smart phone (although Uber will get you a smart phone, they are that desperate for drivers), I love to drive (I mean I love to drive the way  Clay Marzo  loves to surf. I have put over 22,000 miles on my car in the last year. I really, really love to drive. It soothes me.) So I\u2019m all, \u201cI can linger here and pay down my debt as I drive Uber. What magnificence.\u201d And the first week was really great, because I was stoked enough to drive several 8 hour shifts in my first week, which was also a really busy week because I drove my first day on St. Patrick\u2019s Day. The fact that I survived a three-day drinking holiday in a college town fueled those thoughts I always carry around with me about how I could really work, all the time, every day, and be awesome and stalwart and stoic and shoulder to the wheel because I\u2019m \u201cdisabled, but not really disabled, you know?\u201d And then reality hit. It got harder and harder to go to work and stay at work. If this were a job for someone else, I\u2019d be fired by now and it\u2019s only been three weeks. The only reason I am still capable of driving Uber is that I have no set hours and can turn my cab on and off as much as I need. Even with that, I hit a situation last week where I ended up needing to put some unruly people out of my car and work got even harder afterwards. Just like Clay Marzo can surf all day long but can\u2019t handle the people-aspects of competition surfing, I can drive like nobody\u2019s business (\u201cI\u2019m an excellent driver.\u201d \u2013 Rainman) but can\u2019t handle the people-aspects of driving a ridesharing/cab service. I\u2019m still driving. For now. \u00a0I need to pay down some debt I\u2019ve amassed that\u2019s got me painted into a financial corner at the moment. And since it turns out that I have to stay in town to fight to get health coverage, it makes sense to keep driving for a while, as I can, keeping a close eye on my total income to keep from losing my disability benefits (though they\u2019re not currently in danger, my income is turning out to be so slow.) I have to protect my SSI because it\u2019s so clear now that I could not survive on working for a living \u2014 my income from Uber quickly sank to a point lower than what I\u2019m recieving on disability (which, itself, is 20% below the poverty threshold.) I\u2019m pulling down about a quarter what I did that first week, even though business is every bit as steady as that first weekend. Uber can\u2019t keep enough drivers, so I\u2019m constantly on two runs at once all night long. There is more work out there than I could do. But I am still unable to sustainably support myself by working. Thing is, I find my endurance waning. If all I did all night was drive around where my gps tells me, I could work the legal limit of 12 hours a day, no problem. But I am driving *people* around. And that means interacting with people. And it sometimes means grappling with conflict. And it\u2019s really hard. And draining. And did I mention hard? Hard and draining. I know everyone\u2019s work is hard and draining. But I\u2019ve also watched what everyone else can sustain long term and compared it to what I can do when I\u2019m trying so hard I make myself ill. This is how I figured out that I\u2019m among that group of people for whom work, if even possible, is far more hard and draining than work is for abled people. I\u2019ve often thought the ideal job for me might be forest ranger on permanent fire watch. Or maybe lighthouse keeper. Or that guy who gets left behind on Mars. You know, pretty much any job that doesn\u2019t include humans other than just me. Me and some work to be done sounds like a really satisfying day. Me plus other humans and some work to be done? Rarely ends well. And the working world is so unfair, because I am the one who has to pay the price for the access lack and I am the one who gets blamed for access fail because everything\u2019s on my shoulders all the time. Oh, and I\u2019m starting to remember that I actually *am* that disabled and there\u2019s no shame in it; it is what it is. And it\u2019s not about trying harder, because I\u2019m already trying harder than anyone should ever be required to. It\u2019s about access and the lack thereof. And about not letting internalized ableism drown me under a false belief that I am and should always be the only person 100% in control of and the sole provider of my own access needs with no help or accommodation from anyone else. There\u2019s still a lot of work ahead of us activists and advocates if we are to carve out a world with true inclusion. It sucks how much work we have to do. Ever has it always been for those who hack through the wilderness with machetes. The work is hard and the rewards often come after the workers can no longer reap the benefits of their labor. But we are shaping the future \u2014 or trying to, anyway \u2014 and there is an intangible, intrinsic reward to being a builder, a fighter, a gadfly. We are  biting through , every day, piercing holes to let the light in. Whether shoulder to the wheel or struggling to avoid slipping beneath it, we keep working for forward momentum, gaining more ground, a millimeter at a time if that\u2019s all we can get for now. No, I\u2019m not very good at working for or with others. I want to work. I love to work. But this world still leaves only narrow gaps for people like me to try to slip into if we can. I can drive. I can write. I have a good memory and a thirst for learning. I have many skills, valuable skills. And I have a massive, rarely-met bundle of access needs that have stood as barriers between me and what I could earn for myself in life with those skills (and there\u2019s more than just money I could earn in life if I had the right tools. So much more) all of my life. In adolescence, I wanted to be a veterinarian. Or a neurosurgeon. There is little doubt I would have gone into some medical field or another if I\u2019d had autistic-understanding mentorship in my youth. And an autistic-accepting working world to enter into. So many other Autistics are in similar situations or growing up toward them. We are biting through but we need to keep biting and bite harder because we are still so far away from inclusion. We haven\u2019t even begun to leave teeth marks yet. We need a world where people aren\u2019t excluded for moving differently or for communicating in different ways. We need a world where people understand that fulfilling access needs requires more than ramps and sign interpreters and Braille. Yes, of course we need more ramps and ASL and Braille and captions and curb cuts and so many other important access aids. But for those of us seeking accommodation for neurodivergence (as well as those with chronic conditions, invisible disabilities, relapsing-remitting conditions that dramatically change in day to day access needs) access hasn\u2019t even begun. We\u2019re early in this battle. It\u2019s hard. We have to keep biting, biting, biting through. In the poetry of Laura Hershey, we all need to \u201cremember, you weren\u2019t the one / Who made you ashamed, / But you are the one / Who can make you proud.\u201d ( You Get Proud by Practicing ) We need to practice until we find enough pride to seek co-operation from others in getting our access needs met together. We need enough pride to own our needs and feel okay about getting them met and we need to shape a culture where access needs are respected and human beings \u2014 in all our variety \u2014 are valued. I\u2019m doing better with work than I ever have before, but still not well enough to support myself. In the process, I have gained further insight and increased clarity about myself. I have grown in compassion toward myself and practiced being proud. I have noted, yet again, some of the inequities that come with disability. And I have a renewed commitment to doing what I can to help roll the movement forward, pushing on for a better world, stacking hope upon hope in a collaborative effort to build a future where all are valued and supported instead of neglected and rejected.

{"date": "2014/11/07", "body": "About a month ago,  I wrote about the types of therapies used with Autistic children.  I mentioned the sorts of practices that are not advisable and what to look for to see if the therapy your kid is getting is helpful or harmful. I was thrilled to hear from lots of parents whose children are getting great therapy that builds them up in many ways. I am so happy that there are professionals out there who understand autism and work to help kids grow up to be their happiest, most productive Autistic selves instead of training them to pretend to be someone they aren\u2019t. Many other people asked for something more specific than the words I wrote. Some people gave me links to videos and asked me to comment on them. Others asked me if I had videos that showed good or bad therapy practices. That\u2019s what this post is all about. This is important stuff and many people specifically asked me to do this. It is not my intention to publically shame anyone by using publically available videos. I am sharing one video that I found particularly disturbing and two video examples of good therapies in the hopes that seeing these examples will help make the ideas I write about more visual and understandable. I\u2019d like to start with a four minute video titled \u201c Isabella 22- Knock-down drag out battle for Severely Autistic Child to attempt Speech \u201c. I want to warn the sensitive that this is a difficult video to watch. Many of my Autistic friends were unable to watch the video or could only watch a few seconds before they had to turn it off because of the level of suffering and because of the difficult memories it triggered in them. I watched this video several times so I could analyze and write about it and it was very hard for me, too. There are reasons why I am only sharing one example of harmful therapy and one of those reasons is that I just can\u2019t handle watching very much of it myself. And, again, I want to emphasize that I am not accusing Isabella\u2019s parents of anything. I am 100% sure that they are loving parents who care deeply about their child and her future and who believe that they are helping her to have a better life with the therapy they are providing for her. But I cringe in pain when I see what the poor girl is being put through in the name of helping her. I assume her parents put this video online to help others know more about therapy. Please take my comments in that light as well. Let me start by talking about my broad impressions of this therapy session. Just the title of this video is a first clue about the attitude the adults in her life have toward Isabella\u2019s therapy. They call it a \u201cknock-down drag out battle.\u201d Now, I\u2019ll be the first to admit that parenting, or being parented, can often be a battle of the wills. I was a pretty difficult kid and I\u2019ll admit that. But this video is nearly four minutes of Isabella crying with frustration and confusion while her therapist repeats \u201cma ma ma!\u201d at her, over and over, trying to get Isabella to say \u201cmama\u201d and get gummy bears as a reward. The therapist showed her candy, then withheld it from her while making lots of confusing sounds at her and leaving Isabella to try to figure out what the heck was going on, what was expected of her, and why she could see but not get the candy. If I dangled candy in front of a child but refused to give it to her and made her cry with frustration, you would call me a bully and say I was taunting the child and that I should stop making the little girl cry and just give her the candy, right? But because Isabella is Autistic, some professionals believe it\u2019s not cruel; it\u2019s therapy. There are so many important things to say about this short video of a therapy session. Something really important, though, is that this is not in line with the ways language acquisition occurs. What is happening in this therapy session is closer to the way animals are trained to perform tricks. When I was a pre-teen, I taught my standard poodle to shake paws. He never understood what a handshake meant to me \u2014 all he ever knew was that it made me very happy if I put out my hand and he put his paw in it. And he liked to make me happy, so he learned to shake paws very quickly and would do it every time I offered my hand. And I never used food to teach him, just affection. And I never made him whine with confusion or behave in a distressed manner. Now, I don\u2019t mean to compare an Autistic child to a dog. That would be demeaning. But look at this speech therapy and tell me that Isabella is not being trained like a dog to mimic a behavior she doesn\u2019t understand any more than my dog understood a handshake. In fact, Isabella is being treated far worse than most dogs are treated, because she is in real distress as she tries to get the candy and has no idea what is going on or why she keeps getting teased with candy. This is exactly the sort of trial-and-error behavior shaping you see when people train monkeys or bears to perform in circuses. It assumes that the subject being trained is incapable of understanding anything and must be bullied, badgered, and tempted until it randomly performs the act (or makes the sound) and then operant conditioning is applied to strengthen the desired response. This is not speech therapy, it is monkey training and, my apologies to Isabella\u2019s parents, but it is painful to watch. This is not a therapy that respects Isabella\u2019s personhood or addresses her needs. Not only is this treatment cruel, it is setting the stage for potential future violence. This kind of therapy creates massive amounts of frustration in people who have limited ability to express their needs and wants and who are often not allowed agency or autonomy. Right now, Isabella is wringing her hands and pulling at her clothing. How much of this can she take before she starts pushing the therapist away? When pushing doesn\u2019t make the frustration stop, how long will it take before she resorts to hitting or biting? I was a hitter and a biter, and just watching Isabella\u2019s frustration makes me want to forget everything I\u2019ve learned that keeps me from hitting people now. This is really important. People worry a lot about their \u201cviolent\u201d Autistic children as they get bigger and stronger and harder to control. But far too often, the \u201cviolence\u201d is stirred up by years of very frustrating therapy just like the session you are seeing in this video of Isabella. There\u2019s only so long that a person can take being pushed into sobbing meltdowns of frustration before they are willing to do whatever it takes to get the torment to stop. It is not only heart-breakingly cruel to treat a child this way, it is grossly irresponsible. Therapy like this creates problems. The best it will produce is a child trained to do things that make no sense in order to avoid distress and get rewards. The worst it will produce is a child that bites, kicks, hits . . . and gets bigger and stronger along with becoming less and less controllable. This therapy is not designed to raise a child who feels safe and comfortable with who they are, who feels safe to express their individuality, who is mentored in growing and developing into the best person they can be, expressing their true nature in ways others can come to connect with. The goal of being \u201cindistinguishable with their peers\u201d is a goal meant to make other people feel comfortable and happy. The goal of any therapy for an Autistic child should be to help the child feel more comfortable and happy. Therapy is not supposed to be about performing for others \u2014 it is supposed to help a person grow and express themselves in the truest, healthiest way possible. At 58 seconds, Isabella gives up and starts to wander away. The therapist gets her attention and shows her the candy again. Isabella goes back to crying because it is so frustrating for her. From her perspective, she is being teased and taunted with candy she can\u2019t have. She doesn\u2019t understand what the therapist wants from her and she is filled with anger and frustration and probably a massive sense of unfairness about the whole ordeal. At 2:20, the therapist says \u201cany sort of verbalization.\u201d Isabella is making plenty of verbalization and some of it is even pretty close to an M sound, but the therapy continues and those verbalizations aren\u2019t rewarded. How confusing for the little girl! And listen to what one adult says at 3:25 \u2013 \u201cwe can\u2019t let you win.\u201d What? Isabella is frustrated, angry, upset, crying, has no idea what they want, has made lots of \u201cmmmmm\u201d noise, has put up with having her lips pinched, having people make tickly uncomfortable sounds against her forehead, and the adults are framing the whole thing as some kind of battle of the will that they can\u2019t let her win? This is not a game to the little girl. She is not resisting making the sound because she is obstinate. That comment, about not letting her win, is possibly the most upsetting thing about this video for me. It\u2019s not a game. It\u2019s cruel. It\u2019s confusing. And I am sure that Isabella is not thinking of this session in terms of getting the upper hand or refusing to give the adults what they want. So how else can speech therapy look? Well, here\u2019s an example:  RPM \u2013 how it\u2019s helping non-verbal autistic children . These are not isolated cases \u2014 I know children and their parents who are using RPM to learn expressive language. Over and over, I hear the same story: the people around a child think they are \u201cnot in there,\u201d are deficient, incapable, not understanding, unable to communicate, or other similar or related thoughts. Then RPM is brought in and suddenly everyone is shocked to learn that the child they thought was \u201csleepwalking\u201d through life was actually soaking up knowledge like a sponge. I have also known parents of children who did not get any kind of language therapy but their child spontaneously began spelling words on an iPad or with magnetic letters. I have a few big problems with much of the standard speech therapy: 1. the emphasis on speech-only. I won\u2019t deny that speech is very important in this world, but some people never speak. Will we never give them a way to communicate? To me, that feels like punishing someone for being unable to speak. Deaf children who are taught sign first have better overall language skills, whether they learn to speak later or not. Their written English is better if they are allowed to start with sign instead of being pushed to only speak and write English. Autistic children are the same way. If you want good future language skills, don\u2019t insist on only one method of communication now. Allow signs and gestures. Work with pictures. Try RPM or another similar method of spelling. Try everything and don\u2019t make your child get stressed about language. The more you can open up your child\u2019s options for communication now, the better their overall language acquisition will be for the course of their entire life. 2. The emphasis on getting children to say things that please others rather than things that please parents. Isabella was supposed to say \u201cmama.\u201d Over and over, I hear parents say they suffer because their child doesn\u2019t say \u201cI love you.\u201d I find it unsettling that there is so much focus on getting children to say things other people want to hear. I rejoice when I see children learning to say \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d \u201cI hurt\u201d I want\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d Teach a child the things the child will want and need to say. \u201cI love you\u201d can come later. Be honest: those three words, \u201cI love you,\u201d are for you, not for your child. Therapy should not be selfish \u2014 it should be about giving the child the tools that are important to the child. 3. The teaching methods that involve lots of emotional stress and confusion. Don\u2019t underestimate Autistic people. We often look like we aren\u2019t paying attention and aren\u2019t understanding. Give us a chance. Don\u2019t just assume that you have no choice but to train us with candy and tears. Look for therapies and teaching methods that enlist us as partners in our education. I have another video to show you. I asked my friends to share therapy videos they especially like and this  five minute Sensory Diet therapy video  came from Cynthia Kim at  Musings of an Aspie . First, look at how much fun the kids are having! This is something I heard a lot from parents after my ABA post last month \u2014 that their children love the therapy they get and they laugh and rejoice and only cry when it\u2019s time to leave because they want to keep going. That warms my heart beyond the telling! Yes! If your child loves therapy, you chose well. This physical play therapy the kids are doing is really important stuff. The narrator mentions that the play is engaging their vestibular and proprioceptive senses and helping them to feel like they are a part of their body, connected. It is impossible to overstress the importance of this sort of sensory play. I am here to tell you that feeling disconnected with one\u2019s body has repercussions you can\u2019t even imagine. I work to get \u201cin\u201d my body more and my body-mind disconnect affects nearly every aspect of my life. It is imperative to know, hear, and trust your body. Help your child to feel more connected to their physical existence and you will have a calmer, more centered, more confident child. The kids are learning other stuff in this therapy, too. They are learning interaction with others, they are learning to ask for what they want and need, they are learning to take turns and consider others. There is a lot of social learning that is happening while they are focusing on body learning. This is great therapy! I admit, I\u2019m a bit envious \u2014 I wish I could go play, too. I hope that sharing these videos and talking about them has helped to make the idea of helpful vs harmful therapy more concrete and clear for you. I sometimes hear parents say that these ideas are great for kids wil \u201cmild autism\u201d but their child is \u201ctoo severe\u201d and needs more. You might already know that I feel that separating the Autistic world into \u201cmild\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d (or any other similar division you might choose) is harmful to all Autistic people. But beyond that, thinking this way about your child is harmful to your child. No child is \u201cso severe\u201d that they need to be made to suffer. If therapy time is stressful for your child (and especially if therapy time is stressful for the whole family) you really want to think about the therapy you\u2019re using and what the goals are and whether those goals are worthy of your beautiful child or not. I want to leave you with a link to a blog entry \u2014  Caregiver Burnout from Love Explosions . The entry was written to address parents who feel burned out with everything that goes into caring for autistic children, but it is far more valuable than just that stated goal. read this blog entry because it paints a picture of what a healthy family looks like. The author has two beautiful daughters, one of whom is Autistic. If you are one of those parents who thinks the ideas I\u2019ve been talking about here don\u2019t apply to your family because your child is \u201ctoo severe,\u201d you should know that the Autistic daughter in the Love Explosions family is non-speaking and has epilepsy and is, by any way you would choose to measure \u201cvery severe.\u201d (Although that is not the way I think of Evie! To me, she and her sister are beautiful, bright, wonderful girls who I think of first as little sisters and second as dear friends.) This blog entry will show you what a happy, healthy household with an Autistic child can look like and what \u201ctherapy\u201d and education for an Autistic child who is developing wonderfully into a healthy, happy Autistic adult can be. There is a lot to learn in Beth\u2019s entire blog, and there is much wisdom to be gained in this one entry about living happily together as a family. I urge you to read Beth\u2019s words and take them to heart.

{"date": "2016/05/05", "body": "I wasn\u2019t sure if I would write about this or not. I have shared many deeply personal and private things with my readers, but this is hard and humiliating and I\u2019m not even sure why this is harder to share, but it is. So please be gentle. I have anxiety so bad and have had it for so long that I didn\u2019t even realize how anxious my baseline state is until the first time I smoked marijuana and experienced what it\u2019s like to feel peaceful. My anxiety makes every day a struggle. Even my good days are riddled with anxiety. As I said, it is my baseline state.  I should add that therapy makes me more anxious. Every so often I struggle so much that I think about trying therapy again, despite knowing how hard it is on me. I get hopeful and decide to gamble on the off chance that this will be the time that I finally find a therapist who gets me and has the tools and training to make a difference in my life.  This morning was one of those times.  I saw a notice for a table at a local library branch. For two hours, a local \u201cbehavioral health\u201d (that phrase is so creepy) organization would have a table available for people, \u201cto learn more or to get information about ALL services [agency] offers.\u201d That sounded promising, so I went. The entrance to the library was a sensory nightmare. I had to get past a food box hand-out at the door. I am glad someone was feeding people, but it made for a confusing sensory nightmare plus a big audience of strangers watching me trying to get information about a sensitive topic.  Inside, I struggled to make visual sense of the room. There was a table with a person at it, but no sign identifying who they were or why they were there. It used up just about my last drop of processing to get to the table. So there I was, fidgeting, rocking, avoiding eye contact, having a really hard time of it and pretty sure it showed. \u201cIs this the [agency] table?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d And they waited for me to say more.  \u201cIt said you would have information about your services?\u201d \u201cWhat service do you need?\u201d Now \u2026 some of you are Autistic and some of you are parents to Autistics (and some of you are both.) So you know what I\u2019m about to say.  I couldn\u2019t make the words. And even if I could, I was not comfortable telling my troubles to a stranger in a very public setting.  I see now, at least somewhat, what they meant and what I was supposed to say, but in the moment, it was too much.  \u201cWhat do you have?\u201d They rattled off a string of words faster than I could process them all\u2013 who knows? There might have been a better fit in there for me, but I managed to latch on to \u201cmental health services.\u201d \u201cThose. Mental health.\u201d They picked up a pamphlet, \u201cyou can call this number, and\u2026\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t do phone,\u201d I blurted. This should really be an expected response from someone with anxiety issues, right? \u201cIs there just a pamphlet I could read or something?\u201d By now, I was hitting the end of my \u201cspoons.\u201d They tried to hand me the same pamphlet. I looked at it. It was for alcoholics and addicts. \u201cI\u2019m not an alcoholic,\u201d I said, feeling lost and helpless and pretty certain the wizard had nothing in his black bag for me. \u201cYes, but this phone number \u2026\u201d I was sunk. It was back to the phone call. If I could have made a phone call, I would have done it already, not come to a table hoping to get information and answers about how [agency] might help me.  \u201cThank you,\u201d and I took off out the door, double time, to go sit in my van where I shook and cried, getting myself together enough to drive away. What was the point of putting someone on that table who didn\u2019t know how to talk to anxious people and didn\u2019t know how to educate a mental health care consumer about their options without being stressful and triggering? How many anxious people are not getting helped because access to services is blocked by the lack of accommodation for the very issue that brings them seeking services in the first place? I\u2019m back to business as usual: coping with anxiety by hiding, leaving places, shaking and trembling, stimming, chewing on things, running away, having panic attacks, and smoking marijuana whenever I can afford it and get away with it (please bring medical marijuana to all fifty states! Better yet, bring medical marijuana *and* recreational marijuana so those who don\u2019t have the money or coping skills to go through the medical system can still have safe, legal access to a medicine they know helps them.) There is something really wrong when helping agencies become access barriers to the people who most need their services. I tell myself it\u2019s just as well: any agency that can\u2019t even advise me without sending me into a panic is not going to be able to help me anyway. And therapy that is not helpful to me is often actively harmful to me. But getting help with my anxiety was still a nice dream while it lasted. My point here? If you are in a position to help or serve a vulnerable population, do your homework. Destroy the barriers your potential clients face in seeking your help. Be sensitive to the needs of your target population and don\u2019t leave them high and dry because they are too anxious to make the right words and too put off by your continuing to offer things they\u2019ve already made clear that they can\u2019t access.  That\u2019s all. Vulnerable populations trip over our own feet enough as it is. We don\u2019t need to trip over yours, too.

{"date": "2016/02/26", "body": "a silhouette of an agitated looking person, surrounded by words of negativity and self-doubt, such as \u201cdeficiency,\u201d \u201cdisrespect, \u201d \u201cdisconnection,\u201d \u201cweakness,\u201d \u201crejection,\u201d \u201cabandonment,\u201d \u201cinadequacy,\u201d and so on. Mixed in with these words is the word, \u201cdisability,\u201d which does not deserve to be connected to words like humiliation, instability, inadequacy, and insignificance but still gets slipped into the mix unquestioned because society\u2019s ableism is so deeply ingrained in our cultural views that it is virtually invisible. It\u2019s a fancy academic-sounding term: internalized ableism. It means feeling less worthy than others, ashamed of who you are, unwilling to stand up for what you deserve, or even hating yourself. And it\u2019s so culturally supported by society that many people (including myself) can play host to ableist self-deprecation or self-loathing for years without even realizing it. I have been working on my own internalized ableism for years and still keep finding pockets of invisible ableism in myself. Let me put that in more blunt terms: after years of working on loving and accepting myself, I still find entire areas of my life in which I have held myself back unnecessarily due to feeling unworthy on a fundamental level. I\u2019d like to share with you some of what I wrote on my private Facebook wall this week, to help you understand how damaging internalized ableism has been in my own life: -=-=-=- When my daughter died, there was a small voice inside me that said, \u201cit might be for the best. You are poor. You are disabled. What kind of life could you have given her? There is a reason so many people in your life put pressure on you to abort her. Maybe keeping her was selfish. Maybe it\u2019s better that she didn\u2019t live. What right did you have to try to bring life into this world anyway?\u201d This is the first time I have fully admitted those thoughts in public. I tried once. I went to a meeting of Compassionate Friends, a support group for people whose children have died. I got the first sentence out, \u201cI was thinking maybe it was for the best that she died\u2026\u201d When I was interrupted by the meeting leader. He was angry. He shouted at me. He asked me if it was for the best that another member\u2019s child had died in a fire, that one was murdered, that one had died from cancer, that one had been hit by a car. He shouted and shouted and there was no room for me to shout back, \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about your children! I was talking about me and what a horrible mother I would have been. Maybe it was for the best because no one should have to have a mother like me!\u201d But I didn\u2019t shout back. I cried. And I ran from the room. And I fell down in the parking lot because I was crying too hard to see. I banged myself up pretty bad, but it didn\u2019t hurt. I was already hurting too much to feel it. And here I sit, almost 22 years later. In the intervening years, I told myself that I didn\u2019t really want her. I told myself that I didn\u2019t want a child, that I loved my freedom too much to give it up. I reminded myself of all the sacrifices parents make for their children and how expensive children are. How expensive and noisy and messy and heart-breaking. I congratulated myself for dodging a bullet and reminded myself how grateful I am to be unencumbered and not responsible for another human being\u2019s well-being. And life. And suffering. Because if I had a child, they would just grow up to hate me for all my shortcomings anyway. They would hate me for bringing them up in poverty. And they would be ashamed of my disability. And I would be burdensome to them. And, knowing my genetics, they would hate me for the disabilities they were born with because I was too selfish to just not reproduce. And the truth is that I mourn her every day. And the truth is that I mourn not becoming a parent. And the truth is that I watch my ovarian clock tick, tick, tick, seeing time running out and knowing there is never a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cright\u201d time to have a child, but that all the best times are behind me and I would be a fool to have a child now, at almost fifty years old, in poverty, living in a vehicle, only just barely starting to build a career, finally, after a lifetime of false starts and shredded dreams. And I wish I had the courage and opportunity to be that fool. And I know I won\u2019t. Because I\u2019m too scared, too poor, too disabled. And I would be a horrible mother. And my child would grow to hate me. But I beg of anyone reading this, I beg of the world: there are younger people out there who would like to have a family but are being held back because they are disabled and people in their lives have taught them that they shouldn\u2019t have children, that it would be wrong, that they can\u2019t do it. Do not leave those young people to end up in twenty or thirty years where I am, wishing they could turn back the clock and have another chance. No parents raise their children alone. All parents have a support system comprised of some combination of friends, family, government, society. Disabled parents need support as they raise their children. All parents need support as they raise their children. I wish I had not been so ashamed of my poverty and disability that I let life slip by without holding my own, living, growing child in my arms and doing what all parents do: loving them and raising them as well as I possibly could. Life\u2019s own longing for itself. I missed my chance to fulfill it. Don\u2019t let that happen to today\u2019s young, hopeful, disabled, would-be parents. -=-=-=- Feeling unworthy to have a family and raise a child is only one example of internalized ableism. People with internalized ableism can subconsciously (or consciously) sabotage their chances for a better education or a better job because they feel unworthy. They describe themselves using medical language of pathology because they were brought up to refer to their minds and bodies with words of lack and brokenness only. Some forms of internalized ableism superficially resemble high self-esteem until you scratch the surface. I meet people who refer to themselves as \u201chigh functioning,\u201d which might seem like a self-esteem phrase until you look a layer deeper and see the fear of being mistaken for \u201cone of those.\u201d When ableism is levelled against other people with your same disability but different support needs, it is a sign of internalized ableism as well. Those who truly accept themselves as they are have no need to punch down \u2013 whether directly or indirectly \u2013 against those with the same disability. Accepting yourself means accepting others who are like you, not fighting to distance yourself from those who resemble you in some way. I see people recoiling from the word \u201cdisabled,\u201d as if it were a great insult. You are fighting the wrong demons. Instead of fighting against the valuable and useful word \u201cdisabled,\u201d please fight against the underlying ableism that causes you to recoil in horror from the word, \u201cdisabled.\u201d Instead, do something pro-active to make the lives of disabled people better, happier, and more just. When you try to hide from the word \u201cdisabled,\u201d you are only increasing the sum total of ableism in the world and that is what will truly hold you or your child back in life. Sadly, internalized ableism has held me back from so many things I wanted from life. It is a great injustice to allow rampant, half-hidden ableism to squash even one more dream. Root out ableism, both in society and within yourself, and let\u2019s stamp it out forever.

{"date": "2016/04/26", "body": "Dear Young Autistic, I am like you. I am Autistic. Now I am a middle-aged Autistic (I\u2019m probably older than your parents) but I was once a young Autistic like you are now. One of my biggest struggles was (and is) with anger. People have commented many times over the years about my anger. You might be angry, too? People around you might talk about your anger to you or to each other where you can hear them. Or maybe people don\u2019t talk much about your anger because you\u2019ve got ways to push it down and hide it from everyone. If you think you aren\u2019t angry at all, check to make sure you didn\u2019t hide it so well you can\u2019t see it yourself. Why was I an angry young Autistic? I felt stuck in a world I never chose and couldn\u2019t understand. There were many things in life that were easy for me to excel at \u2014 often things others found difficult, like playing the piano, solving logic puzzles, quickly memorizing long poems and plays, learning foreign languages. But everything in life that required me to work and play with other people was out of my reach. I was angry because people would see how hard it was for me to try to fit into the world of people and they would laugh at me, call me names, tease me, exclude me, even hit and hurt me sometimes. I learned early that everyone talks to kids about how important being good at academics is and almost no one talks to kids about how important understanding humans is. But it turns out that understanding people is more important for success in the world of people than understanding academic subjects is. I was angry because the world was so frustrating and exhausting. I was stressed out, worn out, burnt out, cast out. My anger got me in a lot of trouble. My math teacher called me argumentative. My English teacher called me overly reactive. My parents said I was bringing trouble on myself by showing my anger because as soon as the other kids saw that they could make me mad, they had won. \u201cWon what?\u201d I wondered. Was it really a game to the other\u00a0kids? Some kind of contest?\u00a0What sort of cruel game is it to\u00a0single out\u00a0a classmate who is struggling and suffering and burden them with taunts and blows? Who \u201cwon\u201d when I retaliated in anger and ended up being the only one punished for an experience that was designed\u00a0from the beginning to punish me in every way possible? I\u00a0want you to know that I\u00a0understand. The world is completely unfair and there is so much that is genuinely worth getting angry about.\u00a0I know you have been worn down by your anger and by the world\u2019s reactions to it, but I want you to\u00a0know that you should never feel ashamed of your anger or lesser for having\u00a0a hard time controlling it.\u00a0It is logical to be angry when you are stuck in a confusing, often violent world, tormented every day, forced to waste so much of your energy trying to hide your\u00a0very understandable anger,\u00a0punished for things you can\u2019t help. I also want you to hold on to hope. I am decades older than you and I am still angry. I am very, very angry. Sometimes the only word for it is furious. But I get better and better all the time at\u00a0channeling that anger into producing things \u2014 writing, art, dance, music \u2014 that I value and that others (usually) do not want to harm me or shame me for producing. We are Autistic and that means that we have our own ways of growing and changing over time. You will learn to cope. You will learn to manage your intense feelings more and more every day. It will never be perfect; we will never be Mr. Spock. But it gets better; it gets easier. When I was young, I bit people. The last time I remember biting someone, I was 14. I would still bite someone now if they were attacking me and I needed to save my life or someone else\u2019s, but I haven\u2019t bitten anyone in anger in 35 years. That\u2019s a victory. I used to hit people with hard things and I stopped that, too. I no longer hit, bite, scratch, or kick out of anger, though I would do all these things and more if I were being physically attacked. That is what I have been able to control: responding with physical violence to those who tease and torment me. Yes, I still get teased and tormented as an adult. But now I am (usually) able to walk away from that person and have nothing to do with them. I know school can be hard. Hang in there! It seems like it will be forever, but soon there will come a day when you get to make more of your own choices. Soon you will get more choice about who you spend time around. Soon you will be allowed to avoid so many of the people, places, things, and words that make you so angry right now. In the meantime, don\u2019t let bullies and anger distract you from academics. Learn everything you can. Specialize in knowing about the things you love. Your knowledge and the use you put it to will be what lifts you out of the places you feel stuck in now. Learn breathing techniques. Consider studying meditation. Find a strength inside yourself, even if you think it isn\u2019t there. It is. And while emotions rage through you like seaside storms right now, trust that you can and will find calmer seas as you age. With autism, we get a great gift. Those kids around you will grow and change but somewhere in their mid-twenties they will hit a point where changes are slow and small. They may seem ahead of the game right now because they had all kinds of emotional growth spurts early in life while you were still working on getting your bearings. But we Autistics grow and develop throughout our lifespan. No, you won\u2019t see much in the scientific literature about that, but I know lots of Autistics my age and older and I feel very confident in telling you that you will continue to change and grow in your thirties, forties, fifties, sixties, and beyond \u2014 as long as you live. Take a moment to think about how marvelous that is, what a treat, what a privilege. You will find it easier and easier to remain calm, saving your anger for those times when you need its emotional jetfuel and not wasting it on automatically\u00a0reacting to jerks. Those jerks will be running the same tired emotional-social-developmental\u00a0treadmill for the rest of their lives while you will be ever reaching toward new adventures. Don\u2019t be ashamed when they make you angry. If not now, one day soon you will come to pity them. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/angry.jpg"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2016/04/26/dear-young-autistic-anger/", "title": "Dear Young Autistic \u2013\u00a0Anger"},
{"date": "2016/02/13", "body": "Today I presented at the Third Annual Autism and the Pursuit of Happiness conference, hosted by  Empower Autism . Asheville, North Carolina, has become one of my\u00a0\u201cspiritual homes\u201d because it is\u00a0a beautiful, laid-back city with a vibrant and thriving Autistic community, thanks to the\u00a0tireless efforts of\u00a0more people than I could count. Despite the cold temperatures and snow (my nemesis!), I feel so blessed to have been able to participate in this terrific conference. The organizers were welcoming, friendly, and meticulous in seeing to every detail to maximize the comfort and safety of us Autistic presenters. My fellow presenters \u00a0are an amazing, wonderful, honest and lovely group of people. The audience was attentive, eager to hear what we had to say, and approached the whole event with open minds and open hearts. I was asked by more than one person if the text of my presentation would be available online. I promised I would put them in my very next blog post, so here it is. Also, most of the conference was filmed and I will have a video of this presentation at some point in the future, although the specific date is an unknown to me. I hope you enjoy my transcript and I look forward to being able to share the recording with you all soon. Autism and the Pursuit of Happiness, Keynote Address, February 13th, 2016 What is happiness? We are bombarded with messages every day addressing that question. The answers range from the classic white picket fence family with two children and a dog to owning the perfect shade of lipstick or sports car to savvy investments to eating a decadent ice cream treat. Happiness is promised in advertisements nearly as much as sex (which is also a culturally approved route to happiness.) But with all of our culture\u2019s near obsession with happiness, who is talking about Autistic happiness? I hear so much talk about therapy and meeting milestones and being table ready. Socializing with one\u2019s peer group and developing coping strategies. Addressing medical needs and finding good solutions for people with high support needs as their parents age. So many important aspects of autistic lives are discussed every day, but who stops to ask if we are happy, fulfilled, and enjoying our one and only precious lives? Today we are the ones who will talk about Autistic happiness. You will hear from people discussing elements of happiness such as self-acceptance and love, harmonious family life, sexuality, empathy, relationships, and more. Today is the day we answer back to society and talk about our Autistic views of happiness and its pursuit. Today we do not wait for society to tell us what will make us happy. Today we take charge of our own lives and we will tell society. Autism is filled with happiness. Our joy is like a bubbling spring that comes from deep within the earth, from deep inside of us. When that spring is allowed to flow, our happiness is visible, palpable. We are, like all humans, born to rejoice. Happiness is when everything is arranged by color and size. Happiness is when the last number fits and the puzzle is perfect. Happiness is when a special, trusted person is near. Happiness is a feast for the senses that is just right, not too little, not too much. Happiness is a delighted squeal, a flapping hand, a leap, a twirl. Happiness is the gentle sawtooth edge of a cat\u2019s purr. Happiness is the sparkle of water, the tickle of shifting sand, the squish of mud. Happiness is emptying the can of shaving cream and the entire roll of toilet paper just to see how they look and feel. Happiness is when the hard things get accomplished. Happiness is feeling competent. Happiness is learning new paths to success. Happiness is making and keeping friendships. Happiness is being able to help others. Happiness is sharing the things we love, talking about them, words tumbling out of our mouths like carbonation. Happiness is not talking, holding words and thoughts inside and not being required to dilute them by sharing them with others who might not get it anyway. I often describe myself as a fundamentally happy person. Happiness is my default state. It surprises me when others do not agree with that description, but one day I realized that the people who do not connect with the idea of me as a basically happy person are the people who rarely see me happy, often because they, themselves, are sources of unhappiness in my life. It has taught me to re-examine my relationship with anyone who does not share my view of myself as being a naturally happy person. That was such an important revelation for me. You see, happiness comes first from within, but the things and situations and people we are surrounded by can amplify or squelch our happiness. This is true for everyone, of course, but experience and observation suggests to me that we Autistic people are much more vulnerable to the input or interference of others for many reasons. We have to protect our precious happiness from those who would steal it from us. And it\u2019s hard, because not all of our happiness thieves are intentionally stealing our happiness. Some are even trying to increase our happiness, but in misguided ways that end up accomplishing the opposite effect. Others decrease our happiness because they weren\u2019t even thinking about us or they weren\u2019t thinking about us in supportive, understanding, and nurturing ways. So it\u2019s not just about looking for the bad people, because a lot of very good people can diminish our happiness without ever intending to. They can drain our happiness away so innocently that they are as confused as we are about where our happiness went and why it has gone away. So we develop shields to protect us \u2013 and sometimes those shields are helpful but sometimes they block out new happiness along with the risk of losing the happiness we already have. And we look for happiness allies, people who love to see us happy and do what they can to foster our happiness. In return, we can seek their happiness as well. Because one beautiful thing about happiness is that it can build on itself, spiraling upward higher and higher, just the same way that misery can twist backward on itself, spiraling us further down into the depths of despair.\u00a0 But it is much more wonderful to soar higher and higher on updrafts of happiness, so we seek out our happiness companions and help one another learn to fly together. At a conference dedicated to the pursuit of happiness, it feels contrary to talk about the things that inhibit or diminish or even crush happiness, but it is an important part of knowing what something is to understand what it is not as well. The darkness that snuffs out happiness can reveal the shape of the light that happiness is. Understanding those things that we Autistics are trying to shield our happiness from will help others to add their strength and love to our shield walls. Understanding the enemies of happiness helps us avoid innocently becoming one ourselves. Our goal is to help everyone to drink fully from their personal springs of happiness, chasing away the things that drill holes in us and let the happiness drain out until our buckets are empty. So often, it is a balancing act. For example, loneliness can empty a person\u2019s happiness bucket. Loneliness is different from being alone. Being alone can be soothing, familiar, friendly. Loneliness is when we feel forced to be alone. Loneliness is isolation and alienation. In loneliness it is easy to forget that we are loved and lovable. It is easy to forget that we are not alone. But loneliness cannot be eradicated simply by being around other people. I don\u2019t know about you, but when I am around the wrong people I feel far more isolated, more alienated, and more alone than I do when I\u2019m by myself. Well-meaning friends, family, and therapists have encouraged me to \u201cput myself out there\u201d when I\u2019m feeling lonely and low. It is the universal remedy to loneliness and depression after all. For years, I marveled because that advice really does seem to work for some people but it didn\u2019t work for me. When I am lonely and I go someplace where there are people, I feel worse. At first, I thought it was just me \u2013 a sign that I was hopelessly broken. Then I learned that I am Autistic and I decided for a while that it might be an autistic thing \u2013 being around people helps make loneliness and depression better, except not for Autistic people. But now I realize that\u2019s not the full truth, either. The reason we are advised to go out in public when we are depressed is that connecting with people is what helps us feel less lonely and less depressed. The more difficulty a person has in casually connecting with people, the less helpful the advice to \u201cput yourself out there.\u201d Being with others helps Autistic people feel less lonely and depressed, too, but we have to be more careful about who we choose to be around when we want to feel less lonely. Being around people who don\u2019t understand us, people who blame us for things that are out of our direct control, people who laugh at our differences, people who treat us like children even if we\u2019re adults \u2026 and, honestly, let\u2019s face it, even children don\u2019t like most of the ways that children are treated \u2026 these people will make us feel more lonely, more isolated, more depressed. And so the person who encouraged us to \u201cget out there and meet people\u201d has innocently contributed to draining our happiness even when they were trying to help patch and fill our bucket. This is one of the reasons many of us become afraid of going to therapy \u2013 if we get a well-meaning but clueless psychologist, they can innocently steer us in directions that turn out to be very bad for us. But I noticed that the times I didn\u2019t feel good and needed connection and specifically chose to go someplace with familiar people, people I knew understand and love me, people who feel happier when I am happier, people I am happy to see become happier, it really did lift my spirits and make me feel less alone. It really did patch my bucket and help me get it filled again from that mysterious inner spring from which so much happiness flows when it has not been blocked by loneliness. So finding happiness and helping others find happiness is a balancing act. Sometimes we all need to be alone, but sometimes we are lonely and in those lonely times someone can blunder when they try to help us by encouraging or even coercing us to go to the wrong places. Happiness is a balancing act and autistic happiness even more so. And because our happiness is filled and drained in ways that can be subtly different (or, really, hugely obvious) it is so much more important that we learn how to protect our happiness and seek out our happiness allies to support one another and to cherish happiness together. Our happiness thieves are not all so innocent and well-meaning, though. Some of the big bads we need to protect ourselves from, and often need support and assistance from others, are injustices and oppressions that disproportionately affect Autistic people and other vulnerable groups of people. Many Autistic people are in more than one vulnerable group, making so many of us even more vulnerable to the big bads. Three of the biggest of the big bads are abuse, poverty, and lack of healthcare access. Abuse is obvious \u2013 of course it drains happiness. What I was shocked to learn was how much more vulnerable we Autistic people are to abuse than the general population. Disabled people, in general, are at three times the risk of physical and sexual abuse compared to the general population and Autistic people are among the most vulnerable of all disabled people. Just one example: a study found that 83% of women with developmental disabilities have been sexually assaulted at least once in our lives. The same study discovered that 49% of people with intellectual disability experience sexual abuse or assault at least ten times over the course of their life. If these figures shock you, they should. I have faced repeated abuse in my own life and still it shocked me to learn how widespread the experience of abuse is among people with autism and other disabilities. There are other kinds of abuse, too. Twenty percent of disabled people using a third-party payer system are passed from person to person, used as units of commerce by people who collect their disability money and give very little care in return, if any. That\u2019s one-fifth of those on third-party who are only cared for the very minimum amount required to keep them alive so the money keeps coming in. And, at the risk of overwhelming you with the big bads, I also want to remind you that so much of what gets reported as \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d is actually rape, assault, and even murder, the crimes verbally downplayed by a system that views disabled people differently and, as a result, often fails to protect us. Poverty is another big bad that drains happiness away. A British study found only 15% of Autistics had full-time employment. Many of us struggle on disability benefits that leave most of us surviving at 20% below the official poverty threshold. And I have known several Autistic people who have no income, no disability, no family to support them. Their lives can only be described with phrases like \u201ccrushing poverty\u201d since merely saying \u201cpoverty\u201d does not begin to convey their experiences. For many years, I knew them because I lived among them, crushed under the weight of lack myself. Twice the number of Autistics, per capita live in poverty than the poverty percentages of the general population. Transitioning from one\u2019s family of origin to independent living is so difficult. Finding and keeping employment is a huge challenge. Struggling to keep a roof over one\u2019s head with no or very little income feels like a losing battle every day. These hefty challenges leave little room for personal growth, rest, creativity, socializing, and, of course, happiness. The big bad of healthcare access drains happiness away through frustration, overload, and poor health. Too many Autistics had spotty healthcare, at best, before the Affordable Care Act and\u00a0 the ACA hasn\u2019t significantly helped increase access. Look at Mel Baggs and Paul Corby to see especially grievous cases of Autistic people being denied lifesaving medical care. Baggs had to fight for a feeding tube for zir gastroparesis due to being a non-speaking Autistic adult. Corby is still trying to get on a heart transplant waiting list despite being young and in excellent health other than his heart disease but he is being denied access to a transplant solely based on his autism. Our healthcare system is failing our most vulnerable citizens. These are the battles we have to fight in our pursuit of happiness. These are the big bads we must all be joined against if we are going to be one another\u2019s happiness allies. In this battle, the strategy that works for each of will necessarily be different. We are divergent in many ways and there are many different flavors of autism and many different support needs and combinations of support needs. There are many different skill sets among us and many different challenges. But all of this can be said of the entire collection of human beings. We are as much similar as we are different \u2013 similar to other Autistics, similar to other human beings. To find happiness, we must be understood in both our similarities and our differences, not just one or the other. I have found happiness. Most of my life it seemed impossibly elusive and I still struggle to protect my precious joy, but I am here to tell you that the Autistic pursuit of happiness is not a futile quest. I have had to color outside the lines and think outside the box in order to find happiness. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t just think outside the box \u2013 I live outside the box. I did my research and weighed my options and as a result I moved into my van because it is much more affordable than an apartment and gives me the freedom to move around, meeting other Autistics and working to increase understanding and acceptance of our different perceptions, our different lives, our different needs \u2026. and our commonalities as well. I know the life I have chosen is not for everybody, Autistic or not. For starters, I love driving and am pretty good at it, if I can say so myself. Most of my friends are not able to drive. Nearly all of my Autistic friends are unable to drive for a variety of reasons. I live in a very small space, which is also something that doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone (although I like to joke that my home may be small but my yard is three million square miles. How can I feel cramped with that much space to explore?) I have a lot of variety in my life, but I have found ways to build in the comforting routines that keep me grounded and happy. The main point of mentioning my alternate life style is that it is a way of living I chose for myself. I found the strength and courage to make a change. I found the power and autonomy to choose for myself. I surrounded myself with supportive people who were also excited about my choice and could help me sort through questions and problems that arose. This is what fosters happiness. Happiness is not a specific lifestyle, it is the ability to make decisions for yourself and be treated with respect and dignity, as a person who is capable of knowing what they want from life. Happiness is the freedom to choose and the support to make those choices into reality. This is what I want for all Autistic people: To have our competence respected, to have our support needs met with dignity, to be encouraged to build a life that serves our needs and wants. It seems to me that these are small things to ask for but so often it feels as if we are asking for mountains to be moved. Why are such basic things treated so often as unreasonable? But they are building blocks that are fundamental to the pursuit of happiness. Yes, a person can find happiness in the most extreme circumstances. Viktor Frankl taught us this in his classic book,  Man\u2019s Search for Meaning . But if we are committed to fostering the Autistic pursuit of happiness, we cannot dismiss the importance of smoothing the way for happiness to flow freely. Just because humans are capable of finding happiness in the deepest pit doesn\u2019t mean it is right for us to leave even one person lacking in the freedoms and supports that so many other people inherit as their birthright. Many of the things you will hear from presenters today will elaborate on themes I have barely touched on this morning. Listen with an open heart and open mind. These discussions of pursuing happiness are long overdue in the autism world. They are inextricably intertwined with issues of health and safety, survival and growth. The Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. quoted the prophet Amos, speaking of \u201cjustice rolling down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u201d When that righteous flood of justice roars through our valley, sweeping away the stones of restriction, oppression, stereotypes, and obstacles that crush us and dam our fountains of natural joy, we will be free to unfurl our tender roots. Nourished by our own flowing happiness, we will stretch our arms high, like branches growing upward, grasping the very rim of the sun. Our laughter will tumble down like birdsong as we pull ourselves and one another higher and higher still, rising on our tide of happiness, reaching ever toward an unlimited sky of dreams beyond today\u2019s imagining. The pursuit of Autistic happiness begins right here, today, as we uncap the well and drink joyously together. Thank you for joining us today.

{"date": "2014/11/08", "body": "Dear Jerry, I feel I may call you Jerry now, instead of Mr. Seinfeld, for  you have declared that you are one of us : those on the autism spectrum. That means you have declared yourself to be a member of my neurotribe and at least a cousin, if not a brother. Welcome to the family. I had some disagreement with other members of our tribe about your \u201ccoming out.\u201d Some are not so eager to welcome you as I. I have been told that since you are \u201cself-diagnosed,\u201d you do not count. I replied that there is so much stigma involved with being Autistic that I am happy to greet you all the same, because you may be taking the label yourself, single-handedly, but it is a label that comes with so much judgment and social censure that, while I am proud of being Autistic, I also recognize that it is not in the same class as diagnosing yourself beautiful or talented or rich. I have been told that no famous person should make this sort of announcement, but I think that attitude is part of the overall stigma that I fight against every day. Many of us, even those of us who are not self-diagnosed, constantly have to cope with an image problem. Because I write well, I am told I can\u2019t possibly be Autistic. A friend who presents in front of audiences with the poise and eloquence of a classical orator is told that she isn\u2019t Autistic enough or doesn\u2019t look Autistic. Any marker of success we show in the world is used as evidence to attack our integrity and our identity. How much more is that trend continuing when someone says you cannot tell the world that you perceive yourself as being on the autism spectrum because you have had a successful career, a television show, and so on? No, I welcome you as one of us. You have learned about autism and you have looked into yourself and seen autism inside you. You are willing to come forth and risk censure and ridicule when you tell everyone that you see autism there, inside yourself, and you identify with it. As you can see, the critics come from all sides, even your fellow tribe members. But I welcome you and I hope that you will choose to do much good on behalf of those of us who resemble you in one way or another. You believe you have done good for us already, through your work with Autism Speaks. But I am here to implore you to look further into that organization and choose to stop supporting what they do. You have identified as one of us now, Jerry, and that means you have an obligation to serve our needs from within, as a brother, as one of us. Autism Speaks  says terrible things about us . They  hire other people to say terrible things about us . They craft messages of horror and despair about us.  Last year, 43% of their budget was devoted to advertising. From 2012 to 2013, they increased advertising spending from $2.2 million to $52.2 million . . . . a 2,260% increase in funding  for sending the message that we are an epidemic, a tsunami, a devastation that destroys marriages, that is worse than diseases that kill people. Think on that for a moment, Jerry: you have been supporting an organization that says that people like you and me are worse than deadly diseases. Is that where you want to put your time and money? Do you think you are a blight? Do you think I am? You have always seemed to me like a kind person, someone with compassion in his heart. You have always seemed like someone who observes human nature and points out the absurdity of it, but in a way that could only come from someone who genuinely loves people. You find humans lovably absurd. I have always felt that you are a good and loving person. The good and loving thing to do is to stop supporting an organization that claims to help Autistic people yet only puts 4% of their budget toward the goal of actually helping Autistic people and our families. 13% of Autism Speaks\u2019 budget goes toward what they call \u201cscientific research\u201d but what is actually genocidal research designed to ensure that people like us are never born again, whether through discovering causes and eliminating them or devising a pre-natal test so that we can be aborted before we ever get a chance to take a breath. This is how Down Syndrome was \u201cbattled.\u201d  An estimated 90% of babies testing positive for Down Syndrome are aborted now.  Do you think I should have been aborted? Do you think you should have been aborted, Jerry? Do you think the world would have been a better place if you had never been born? I don\u2019t think that about you at all and I plead with you to stop supporting an organization that does believe that. Autism Speaks is an organization that is working toward a goal of \u201ccuring autism\u201d and that goal means that people like you and me, as well as all of our beautiful fellow neurotribe members, will be wiped from the face of the earth. I do not think that would make the earth a better place at all. I do not think destroying an entire neurotype is the way to make anything better about our planet. I do not think we should let anyone wipe out a people who are noted for, among other things, a very strong sense of justice and a depth of compassion so deep that we are accused of lacking empathy when we are forced to turn away from the extreme pain we find when we engage this world that can too often be harsh and cruel. I would urge you instead to support organizations that are supported by your fellow Autistics and that support the needs and goals of Autistic people, not of those people who would seek to destroy autism and Autistic people. Jerry, please turn your efforts toward groups like:  The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) ,  The Association for Autistic Community ,  Autism Women\u2019s Network ,  Association of Programs for Rural Independent Living ,  Autism National Committee ,  National Council on Independent Living ,  Ollibean ,  Taishoff Center for Inclusive Higher Education , or any group that supports Autistic people as fully human, fully participating, fully respected, fully supported members of the community of humankind. Thank you for reading this, Jerry. And thank you to everyone who read along with Jerry. This is my plea not just to you, Jerry, but to the world. Some Autistics have found worldly success, like you, Daryl Hannah, Dan Aykroyd, and more. But most of us need so much help and support. We need acceptance and accommodations. We need you on our side, Jerry, now that you have realized that our side is your side, too. Why do I not care whether you \u201creally\u201d are on the autism spectrum or not? Because the oppression of any person is the oppression of every person. Whether you \u201creally\u201d are Autistic or not doesn\u2019t matter because our battle is your battle anyway. We are fighting to be recognized as wholly human, worthy of dignity and respect, worthy of participating fully in the community, deserving of acceptance and assistance. We are asking to be known and wanted and treated well. We are telling the world that we have so much to offer if others will be willing to meet us half-way and accept what we bring to society. The world needs Autistic people, Jerry, and whether you are Autistic or not (and I am happy to believe you are, and to welcome you to the neurotribe!) it is time for you to see the harm that Autism Speaks does to our cause, our hopes, our dreams, our needs. We want to be part of the whole human family and Autism Speaks seeks to cast us out from the world forever. Please join us, Jerry. Please join your people. Please be fully one of us \u2014 not just in name or public recognition, but in heart and spirit and soul. Please do not support groups that want to hurt us and erase us. Please work to help make the world better for Autistics \u2014 better for me, better for you, better for everyone like us, our tribe, our family. Thank you, and I hope you will investigate the organizations I mentioned above and choose to put your energies and resources with us instead of against us.

{"date": "2014/11/24", "body": "Today, November 24th, is  N24 Awareness Day . While this is not specifically an autism topic, it is most definitely an autism-related topic. N24 (Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Syndrome, or hypernychthemeral syndrome) is a circadian rhythm disorder (CRD). \u201cCircadian\u201d means \u201cabout a day\u201d and the circadian rhythm is the body system that keeps people in sync with the 24-hour day and the natural cycles of light and dark on our planet. The main part of the body that keeps track of time is a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but every cell of the body has a \u201cclock\u201d in it, even blood cells. You can think of the entire body as a sort of symphony of time-keeping with the SCN as the conductor and the sun (or light in general) as the musical score. When a person has a CRD, something about the orchestra is broken. One example is Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD) in which the conductor can\u2019t stay on the right part of the score, so the person wakes up too late and can\u2019t get to sleep on time. DSPD is often mistaken for insomnia but it\u2019s not really, because a person with it can sleep just fine and for a full amount of time if they are allowed to go to bed very late and wake up very late. Another example is the opposite \u2013 Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder (ASPD) in which a person wakes up too early and goes to sleep very early. In both cases, DSPD and ASPD, it\u2019s not a preference. The person with one of these disorders can\u2019t help it and no matter how hard they try to sleep on a normal schedule, it won\u2019t work unless they get very specific treatment for the disorder. Just an alarm clock will never be enough. N24 is a very serious CRD in which the conductor has broken so much that you could say there are extra bars inserted into the musical score \u2014 too many hours. The brain functions as if they day is longer than 24 hours and so the person with N24 can\u2019t keep to a 24-hour schedule and \u201cslips\u201d around the clock over time. Depending on how long the brain\u2019s day is, a loop around the clock could take anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months to complete. During half that time, the person is sleeping in the day and awake at night. It is isolating and makes it difficult or impossible to keep a job, friends, even doctor\u2019s appointments. Why is this an autism-related topic? CRDs are three times as common in the Autistic population as they are in the general population. Sleep, generally, is a big autism topic with as many as 3/4 of Autistic people having some kind of sleep problem. I am Autistic and also have N24 and I would have to say that the N24 is more disabling as far as working goes than the autism. There are employers who are willing to work with the needs of Autistic employees and there are accommodations that could allow me to hold on to a good job. But it is nearly impossible to accommodate an employee with a disorder that makes it impossible for them to even show up for work at all half the time. There are treatments that hold me on a 24-hour schedule, but they require me to split my sleep in half so the best I could do would be to work half-time and then it would all fall apart the first time I got sick because I can\u2019t hold on to entrainment when I\u2019m sleeping off the flu and so I lose my 24-hour schedule and have to wait a month for my sleep to cycle back around before I can start therapy again and hold myself in that 24-hour schedule again. I know other Autistic people with N24, but most of the people I know with N24 are not Autistic because even though we have three times the chance of developing it, there are about 99 times as many non-autistic people so there will always be more of them with N24 than there are of us Autistic N24 folks. So it really isn\u2019t an autistic condition, just one of many health issues that we are more vulnerable to, due to our neurotype. So, on this N24 Awareness Day, what do I want you to be aware of? \n N24 exists, it is a real condition, it is seriously disabling and very hard to live with. \n \n If you know someone who just can\u2019t seem to get up in the morning and can\u2019t seem to go to sleep at night, learn more about CRDs and try to have some empathy for their struggles \u2014 above all, don\u2019t call them lazy! Sleep issues are not a matter of laziness. We have very little control over how our body responds to sleep. \n \n If you are an employer, think about ways you might be able to hire someone with N24. Even though it\u2019s a relatively rare condition, there are hundreds, possibly thousands of us and nearly all of us are unemployed against our wishes. If you have a job someone could do even though they are incapable of keeping regular hours, you could end up with a very loyal and productive employee if you consider giving someone with N24 a chance. \n \n There are treatments but they are complex, time consuming, expensive, and not 100% effective. Don\u2019t assume that treatment will always work perfectly and don\u2019t blame us or try to make us feel guilty when our treatment falls apart or doesn\u2019t make us able to work, despite all the effort we put in. Treatment can fall apart and many of us are still quite exhausted full-time, even when we are able to get our bodies into a 24-hour schedule. \n Thank you for reading. If you think you or someone you know might have a CRD, a useful resource is the  Circadian Sleep Disorders Network . There is a lot to explore on the site and if you have a CRD yourself, you may find information that will completely change your life there.

C is for Color No, this isn\u2019t about lighting it up blue or walking in red or toning it down taupe. Today I want to\u00a0talk about people of color and autism. When the average person thinks about\u00a0autism . . . well, wait. I think\u00a0maybe the average person rarely thinks about autism at all. Maybe this time of year, a bit.\u00a0But when the topic comes up, the average person thinks of someone famous \u2014 usually Temple Grandin \u2014 or someone fictional \u2014 usually\u00a0Dustin Hoffman\u2019s \u201cRain Man\u201d \u2014 or a little boy. A little white boy. A little white boy from a middle-class family. There are many layers of erasure here, but the thing I want to point out today is that all of those images of autism are white. When the face of autism is nearly exclusively a white face what happens to Autistic African-Americans, Autistic Asian-Americans, Autistic Native Americans, Autistic Latino-Americans \u00a0\u2014 any Autistic people of color? Those folks are under-diagnosed, under-served, under-valued, and under-protected. This is a problem for all communities of color. I am white, but dear friends have made me aware of the difficulties they and their families face and I want to do what I can to signal-boost autistic issues of people of color because I firmly believe that until all of us are valued, accepted, and honored, none of us are valued, accepted, or honored. Under-diagnosed:   Autism in Black  reports that diagnosis rates are the same across races but black and latino children are diagnosed significantly later than white children. This is a problem, because the sooner parents, teachers, doctors, churches, families, communities understand that a child is Autistic, the sooner everyone can learn how to work with that child\u2019s patterns of strengths and weaknesses and help that child to excel in every way possible. When an Autistic child goes undiagnosed, too often the people around that child unfairly blame the child for their troubles and often compound them unnecessarily. Without a diagnosis, a child is left without accommodations, without appropriate learning plans, and without the crucial understanding that leads to acceptance of the child, neurotype and all. When you combine disparities in health care access\u00a0with the stereotypes of autism as a childhood condition of mainly white boys, it is obvious why Autistic children of color are under-diagnosed and diagnosed late. It is vital for the health and well-being of children of color that we all work to change the tendency to automatically think of autism as a white condition and help all Autistic people get timely and accurate diagnoses. Under-served:  Too often, Autistics of color who need services end up in jail or prison instead. Autistic children and adults are at greater risk of ending up in the criminal justice system than the general population. Sixty percent of American prisoners are people of color (twice the percentage of people of color found in the general population.) \u00a0When you combine the higher risk of imprisonment of Autistic people with the higher risk of imprisonment of people of color, it is clear that we are letting too many people who need services in the community end up getting under-served (and often phsycially and psychologically destroyed) in prison instead. Under-valued:  There is a vicious circle here. Autistic people of color are not visible in the autism/Autistic community, so white people are less likely to notice that nearly all the organizations and spokespeople are white. Without a visible presence of people of color in leadership, the stereotypes about white autism are reinforced.\u00a0 It is time for all of us to speak up about the absence of people of color in leadership roles in our communities. Without a diversity of perspectives and without a diversity of voices being heard with respect to the diversity of needs, we are letting our Autistic brothers and sisters and their families down. Inclusion means everybody. Until everyone is well-represented and heard and valued, we are all losing out. Under-protected:  When young Autistic men are also young men of color, racism and ableism become deadly. Too often, the police use excessive force in dealing with Autistic black or Latino\u00a0men in stressful situations. You\u2019ve heard of the \u201ccrimes\u201d called \u201cdriving while black\u201d or \u201cwalking while black\u201d?\u00a0 Add to those, \u201cbeing Autistic while black.\u201d For just one example out of hundreds, Brobrubel\u2019s Blog has an entry,  Autism in Black and White , that compares how John Elder Robison\u2019s son, Jack, was treated for building and detonating explosives to how Neli Latson was treated for sitting in the grass, waiting for the library to open. -=-=- As a white person, I know that my voice should not be a front voice for the issues of people of color. But this is everyone\u2019s discussion. We should all be talking about this. We should all be asking where the people of color are in our community. What is most important is that the voices we should be listening to on these issues are those of people of color. The role of white allies is to encourage everyone to talk about these issues and then\u00a0be quiet and listen to what people of color want to tell us. This blog entry is short because this is not my story. It is the story of my brothers and sisters, members of my neurotribe, who live with prejudice and racism and erasure every day.  As Landon Bryce of thAutcast said  about black Autistic people, \u201cthey are ours.\u201d They are our family. We are their family.\u00a0We must listen to their story, we must make sure there is room at the table, we must value their voices. We must not talk over them. And that is why today\u2019s entry is so short. It is not that there isn\u2019t more to say \u2013 there definitely is.\u00a0But I do not want to talk over or speak for my Autistic family members of color. I only want to remind everyone that they are here, they are among us, they  are  us.\u00a0If our goal is, as I feel it should be, autism acceptance, we must remember that none of us are accepted until all of us are accepted. I challenge you to notice the color of autism as you look around our community and I challenge\u00a0you to do whatever is in your power to add strength to the voices of people of color \u2014 Autistic people of color and their families. Until they are heard and until their needs are\u00a0valued and until\u00a0they are cherished as\u00a0important members of our neurotribe we can talk about acceptance all day and all night but we will never find it. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/c.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autisminblack.com/", "http://brobrubel.com/2011/12/28/autism-in-black-and-white/", "http://thautcast.com/drupal5/content/what-if-media-treated-black-people-way-they-treat-autistic-people"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/c-is-for-color/", "title": "C is for\u00a0Color"},
{"date": "2015/04/01", "body": "\nThis is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge .\u00a0 The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . A is for Acceptance You may have noticed in the last half-decade or so that there is a growing trend toward speaking of autism acceptance instead of autism awareness. By now, most of you probably know why people are making that choice, but just yesterday I saw a lot of people arguing about the topic, so I think we still need to make it clear. Autism awareness, in and of itself, is not inherently bad. By now, most people are aware that there is a thing called autism but, in my experience, most people are not very aware of what that autism thing actually is. So I do, at least partially, agree with the people who say we still need more awareness. What I have a problem with is the form that awareness tends to take. A week ago, I had to stop listening to the radio because all the stations were already gearing up for April with lots of \u201cawareness\u201d and lots of advertisements about awareness events. I heard a lot about children with autism and nothing at all about Autistic adults. Not only do we \u201cage out\u201d of most services when we turn 18, but we also become invisible. It\u2019s as if the entire world stops caring about us once we are no longer cute children to worry about and, instead, inconvenient adults to be stuck with. I heard a lot of scare talk, including hearing us repeatedly compared to diabetes, cancer and AIDS. Diabetes, cancer and AIDS kill children. Autism does not. Diabetes, cancer and AIDS are illnesses laid on top of a child\u2019s underlying identity \u2014 they can change a child\u2019s philosophy but they do not change innate aspects of their identity. Autism is a cognitive and perceptual difference that is so deeply rooted in our neurology that it cannot be separated from our identity. Beneath cancer, there is a healthy child hoping to break free. Beneath autism, there is more autism \u2014 it\u2019s autism all the way to the core. Autistic children do not \u201cgo into remission,\u201d they develop coping skills and they mature into Autistic adults, and they work to learn ways to communicate with those around them. There might be suffering that can be alleviated \u2014 seizures brought under control, gastrointestinal disorders treated, methods learned\u00a0and sometimes medications taken\u00a0for mitigating anxiety. Autistic adults often do not resemble the Autistic children they once were \u2014 we grow and develop all our lives \u2014 but Autistic adults are still every bit as Autistic as they were when they were children, no matter how many coping skills are learned, no matter how \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d they become. At the center of the autism awareness movement is an organization known as Autism Speaks that functions like a giant magnet, drawing all donations to them.\u00a0In the ten years that Autism Speaks has been around, local organizations have watched their funding dry up. Autism Speaks dominates the autism charity scene now and, as a result, they have the power to set the tone when it comes to \u201cawareness.\u201d And that tone is one of despair and misery. We are portrayed as burdens who break up marriages and destroy the lives of those around us. We have been compared to \u201clepers\u201d (an outdated term for people with Hansen\u2019s disease) and our parents to saints for taking care of us. The awareness that is being put forth is shaped around a rhetoric of fear. Autism Speaks is one of the few organizations that is widely hated by the population it was established to serve. Only one Autistic person was ever accepted in a leadership role and  he resigned, saying , \u201cNo one says the Cancer Society does not speak for them.\u00a0 No one describes the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as an evil organization.\u00a0 All that and more is said of Autism Speaks every day.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tried to be a voice of moderation but it hasn\u2019t worked. Too many of the views expressed by the organization are not my own; indeed I hold very different points of view.\u201d So that is autism awareness. That is what we are rejecting. What is autism acceptance? Autism acceptance is seeing us as whole, complete human beings worthy of respect. Autism acceptance is recognizing that we are different and helping us learn to work within our individual patterns of strengths and weaknesses to become the best people we can be, not trying to transform us into someone we are not. Autism acceptance is remembering always that Autistic people are listening, including those who might appear not to be, and choosing to speak of autism and Autistic people in ways that presume competence and communicate value. \u201cTolerance says, \u201cWell, I have to put up with you.\u201d Awareness says, \u201cI know you have a problem and are working earnestly to fix it.\u201d  Acceptance  says, \u201cYou are amazing because you are you, and not despite your differences, but because of them.\u201d\u201d \u2013  Kassiane Sibley \u201cAcceptance is about recognizing that an autistic person is, and will always be, different but not less \u2014 even as some challenges are addressed.\u00a0\u201d \u2013  Amy Sequenzia \u201cAutistic people are not viewed as able beings, this view makes us suffer.\u201d \u2013  Emma Zurcher-Long \u201cAutism Acceptance means supporting the Autistic person in learning the things they want to learn and in gaining the skills they need for what they want to do. Autism Acceptance is the radical assertion that at the level of broad, overarching principles, what Autistic people need isn\u2019t that different. We need to be accepted for who we are. We need to hear that we\u2019re OK, we need to hear that the things we have trouble with don\u2019t make us broken or lazy or horrible people. We need people\u2019s actions towards us to reflect that. We need people to listen when we say we need help, and we need people to listen when we say we don\u2019t. We need to be taken as the whole people that we are, and we need to be met with the understanding that we are the experts in our own lives and abilities.\u201d \u2013  Alyssa \u201cGood teaching is based in deep respect for the individual, the cognitive learning style of each student, the shared excitement about the topic of study. Best practice in teaching autistic students isn\u2019t any different, though these faculty would be insulted if I told them so.\u201d \u2013  Carolyn Ogburn \u201cOver the past two years, I have asked Tyler many times how he feels about having autism. And while he clearly understands how the autism negatively affects his social skills and attention, he always tells me that he likes his autism. Although he has also told me, at times, that he wants to be \u201cnormal,\u201d he continues to insist that his autism helps him. So if he likes his autism, do I really have the right to counsel him otherwise?\u201d \u2013  Kymberly Grosso \u201cIf you have the autism acceptance song in your heart, add Paula and Est\u00e9e\u2019s voices to your blog rolls, Subscribe to their blogs. Tweet, \u2018like\u2019, and show your respect and support to these powerful women. Don\u2019t allow their names to fade into internet oblivion as others try to opt into autism acceptance because it is now the fashion. They were doing it before it was cool. It is easier to say accept autism now because others paid the high cost for daring to say it before us.\u201d \u2013  Kerima  \u00c7evik  \u201c Acceptance \u00a0means accepting yourself as you are, even in the face of persistent attempts throughout your life to get you to be what you are not. Especially in the face of persistent attempts throughout your life to get you to be what you are not. The best you can be is Autistic. Let me explain. \u201cThe best you can be is Autistic\u201d means that you are at your best when you are being fully who you are, able to express yourself and move through the world in ways that are right for you, comfortable for your body. \u201cThe best you can be is Autistic\u201d does not imply impairments, \u201cless than,\u201d \u201ccan only do so much.\u201d On the contrary, it means that you are who you are- your pervasive Autistic self (which actually includes those parts that observers might think are \u201ctypical\u201d just because they can\u2019t see anything that looks unusual to them), and that encompasses  all  of who you are, not just the parts that have been \u201cpermitted,\u201d and not just the stuff that whatever the DSM of the moment says are your deficits. \u201cYou have the right,  or should , to grow in ways that are good for you, that  you  think are good for you. You have the right to make changes in your life that  you  think are the correct ones for you.\u201d \u2013  Paula C.

{"date": "2015/04/02", "body": "\nThis is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . B is for Bullying \u201cAll kids get bullied; it\u2019s a rite of passage!\u201d \u201cJust ignore them and they will get bored and stop.\u201d \u201cThey only bully you because they\u2019re jealous of you. Be bigger than them and ignore it.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t coddle our kids. Bullying will toughen them up and make them ready for the world.\u201d We see a lot of talk about bullying these days and we hear a lot of schools talk about their \u201czero tolerance\u201d anti-bullying programs, but bullying is just as bad as ever and Autistic kids (and adults!) are particularly vulnerable. We get more than our share of bullying and we often have fewer resources to cope with bullying than other children do. (And, make no mistake, bullying hurts ALL children, regardless of neurology.) CBS News reported that 63%\u00a0of Autistic children have been bullied \u00a0and are three times more likely to be bullied than their siblings without autism. When I listen to the stories of the Autistic adults I know, it sure feels like that figure is too low.\u00a0 I told my parents about a lot of the bullying I faced in school, but there was a lot more I didn\u2019t tell them about. I was ashamed of the way I was treated. I felt like it did no good to tell, so why bother? My mother knew about the day I was boxed in the ear because the whole side of my head was still red when she saw me hours later. But I was too ashamed to tell her about the sexual lies about me that\u00a0my classmates had published in the gossip column of the school newspaper. She knew about the defacement of my (very expensive) school yearbook because she wanted to see the yearbook when I brought it home. She was angry about what the other children had done to my book. I misunderstood her anger and thought she was angry at me for letting it happen (if you\u2019ve ever been the subject of a nasty game of \u201ckeep away,\u201d you know there is not \u201cletting\u201d involved when fellow students destroy your property.) Because I misunderstood her anger, I was afraid to tell her about other incidents of bullying. The survey reported in\u00a0 the CBS news article involved asking parents of Autistic children about bullying.  Another report from Time Magazine  says Autistic students were bullied almost five times as much as non-autistic students with a 46% rate of being bullied (and parents in this study said they felt the true rate was even higher than that.) The figures may actually be low because parents  don\u2019t  always know. Their children may be afraid to reveal the bullying, too ashamed to talk about it, apathetic due to a belief that no one can help them anyway or due to depression caused by the bullying. Their children may have lower communication skills that don\u2019t provide the children with the tools to adequately communicate what is going on in school\u00a0\u00a0Or, in many cases, the children may not fully realize that they are being bullied. I think sometimes I missed realizing that I was bullied. And there are situations that I look back on as an adult and realize more of what was happening \u2014 situations where I thought the other children were my friends but when I remember our interactions, I am shocked to realize that they were doing horrible things to me and I kept coming back for more because I didn\u2019t know any better back then. The first time I remember being bullied was in second grade. I am pretty sure I must have been bullied earlier, especially considering what I remember of my behavior in first grade (I was a very\u00a0odd\u00a0child.) But the first I remember was\u00a0when I was seven years old. Someone, I have no idea who, had heard me playing piano and\u00a0asked if I could come to\u00a0the office and play a piece over the intercom during morning announcements. I played a piece I loved, called \u201cWhirling Leaves,\u201d that ran up and down the whole keyboard. I loved the sensation of crossing my hands over each other up and down the keyboard so that piece was my favorite to play. When I was done and had returned to my classroom, a boy who sat near me said, \u201cyou\u00a0finally did something right.\u201d It was what I have come to learn is called a \u201cback handed compliment\u201d and while I didn\u2019t know the name for a comment like that, it still stung and put a tarnish on my day. More than my day, apparently, since it still stings forty years later. That is mild bullying, though. As kids grow up, their bullying gets both more subtle and more overt. The psychological bullying gets more subtle, harder to counter, harder to get help with. The kids around me matured at a different rate than I did and I never had any idea\u00a0how to deal with the bullying words. But the bullying got more physical around middle school as well and that bullying got more and more overt. For anyone who says that bullying is just a rite of passage or harmless, they should pay attention to the ways Autistic pre-teens and teens get bullied. I was boxed in the ear, had rocks and bottles thrown at me, was hit in the head with a plank (science class, studying inertia and gravity with balls rolling\u00a0down boards), had bleach thrown on my clothes, was\u00a0tricked into eating\u00a0a laxative chocolate bar . . . and other things enough worse that I don\u2019t feel like talking about them. Even in university (the place that\u00a0high school teachers  swore  to me there would be no more bullying) I had fellow students pretend they were going to punch me, fists stopping inches from my face, and a professor \u2014 a grown man in a position of power \u2014 would growl at me like a rabid dog when he passed me in the halls. And all that was mild compared to what other Autistic\u00a0students have faced. In Fall of 2014, an Autistic teen in Ohio was tricked by classmates who said they were doing the ice bucket challenge but instead they poured human waste on him, filmed it, and shared the video around school. In January of 2015, an Irish teen had his pants and underwear pulled down and was forced to eat twigs while the bullies filmed the attack and later posted it on Facebook. In March, 2015, an Autistic teen in Louisville, Kentucky was threatened by a classmate with a knife and then choked so hard by that same classmate that the teen has been too injured to return to class. In 2013, an Autistic teen in Australia had his hands blown up and shrapnel embedded in his legs, down to the bone, by bullies who gave him a bomb made from a golf ball. I could go on and on, because these stories are popping up all the time, every week. Sometimes every day. What\u2019s worse, often teachers and the parents of the bullies say the Autistic children deserved the bullying they got. Sadly, that doesn\u2019t surprise me \u2014 I got a lot of bullying from teachers. A lot. Parents of bullies in Iowa claimed the Autistic teen who their children were bullying had \u201cbrought it on himself.\u201d  One specific example given was of the teen using insulting language toward a classmate who then punched the teen in the face. I don\u2019t know what children are taught now, but I was brought up to believe that it is wrong to respond to words with blows. But\u00a0a relative\u00a0of the teen who punched the Autistic\u00a0teen for saying the wrong thing said they were proud of their nephew for punching the teen. Even the school principal and the president of the school board claimed no bullying was happening. I\u2019d like to know what happened before the Autistic teen called others names. I have a good guess. I used to get bullied and bullied and bullied until I couldn\u2019t take it any more and lashed out. Then I was blamed for everything that had happened, even though my behavior was a reaction, not a cause. And since I was not as subtle as my more mature classmates, I was always the one who got caught misbehaving. I was always the one blamed for bad behavior. Quite often, I got punished for defending myself while the bullies were treated as if they were the victims. I suggest that\u2019s what was happening in the Iowa case as well. Bullying is just another example of why we need to fight so hard for autism acceptance. Children take their cues from teachers and parents. Look at how the Iowa parents and even the school principal\u00a0responded to the bullying situation \u2014 they said the Autistic teen deserved to be bullied. And the parents and principal were very aware that the teen was Autistic. Yes, we need awareness of autism but awareness alone is just not enough. Awareness left that young man out in the cold, blamed for the abuse others heaped on him. Acceptance means teaching that Autistic people do have feelings, do have empathy (even if we don\u2019t always express it in ways that non-autistic people are capable of understanding), that we do have value, and that we are full members of the human race, deserving of dignity and accommodation. Acceptance means teaching others that when we don\u2019t understand what is going on, the proper thing to do is to help us, not to bully us. Acceptance means teaching principals and teachers how to understand bullying dynamics so that they can see more of what is going on, not just the desperate reactions of a badly bullied child with less social skills of subterfuge than their \u201cmore socially sophisticated\u201d tormentors. (I wonder why it is that the people who have more social skills are the bullies while the people who have fewer are the victims? Perhaps our idea of what social skills actually are is unhealthily skewed?) We need to all work together to build a bully-free world for everyone. We need to understand bullying and have compassion for all involved (yes, that means the bullies, too. We cannot allow them to continue bullying others. But people become bullies from a place of pain and lack inside themselves and part of ending bullying is recognizing that pain and lack and helping the bullies become happier people, too.) Until Autistic people are accepted, bullying will continue and it will be justified by those who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. People must be aware of autism and aware that Autistic people are different from non-autistic people in significant ways. And people must accept that Autistic people are trying their best and meet us with love, understanding, and acceptance, helping to mentor us in the confusing social ways of the culture that surrounds us. Until we have full autism acceptance, there will always be people who see our vulnerabilities and think we are extra \u201cfun\u201d to torment and there will always be people in positions of power who do not see the whole picture and say that we deserved the abuse and brought it on ourselves. When we can move from ignorance to awareness to acceptance, we can move from violence and bullying to understanding, friendship, and love.\u00a0A world of autism acceptance is a world I am eager to work toward every day. Please, let\u2019s all work toward that beautiful goal. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/survey-finds-63-of-children-with-autism-bullied/", "http://healthland.time.com/2012/09/05/why-autistic-kids-make-easy-targets-for-school-bullies/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iYT8p2i_nU"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/02/b-is-for-bullying/", "title": "B is for\u00a0Bullying"},

The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . D is for Depression (and Anxiety) No one can agree on how prevalent depression and anxiety are among Autistic children and adults. But, so far, everyone from professionals to parents to Autistic people ourselves agrees that Autistic people are much harder hit by depression and anxiety than the general population. Many studies show rates of depression as high as 50% to 60%.\u00a0One alarming study found Autistic children had 28 times as much suicidal ideation when compared to non-Autistic children. The studies of our depression and anxiety are still in their infancy at the moment. Researchers complain that it is harder to even determine if we are depressed at all because our facial expressions and methods of emoting are so different from the non-autistic population that a separate diagnostic criteria need to be developed. Many of us \u201clook depressed\u201d all the time to those who are not familiar with our expressions. Many of us can move from feeling fine to clinical depression without it showing on our faces (instead, observers might notice weight gain or loss, changes in patterns of activity, etc.) Additionally, Autistics who have not yet developed reliable means of communication are not able to describe their mood to others. Communicative Autistics with alexithymia may not even be aware of our moods sufficiently to clearly say if we are depressed or not. One thing I am not seeing addressed enough (in my opinion) is the question of whether our increased tendency toward depression and anxiety is a biological\u00a0\u201cco-morbid trait\u201d of autism or whether most of our mental health challenges are situational. Of course scientists aren\u2019t allowed to speculate in public until they have conducted the sorts of studies that would tend to back up or refute their speculations, but looking through the scientific literature, I feel as if few people are ready to even begin examining any \u201cbiological vs. situational\u201d questions yet. This is troubling, because I feel it is very important to know whether an autistic neurology and biology are behind the higher rate of mood disorders or whether (as I strongly suspect) the bulk of depression and anxiety among Autistic children and adults could be alleviated through social understanding and acceptance. I think the causes are ultimately a mix of biological and situational but I see clear evidence that situational depression dominates. If you stop to think about all the reasons an Autistic person could be depressed, it\u2019s obvious that we live in a depressing world! The fact that we aren\u2019t all depressed is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the persistence of Autistic people. To start with, we live in an uncertain world. That is something that increases everyone\u2019s anxiety, but Autistic people have special needs for order, predictability, and a sense of control in our lives that goes beyond the level of these needs in most allistic (that is, not autistic) people. Since anxiety is closely linked with depression, lowering anxiety levels will lower depression levels. For example, I have a friend whose Autistic daughter becomes very anxious when someone uses the stove. I\u2019m not sure what the source of her anxiety is. It seems to be linked to stirring things in pots, so maybe there is a sensitivity to the sound of the spoon scraping the pot? Or maybe something else happened one day while her mother was stirring something on the stove and the two events became linked in her mind. On a certain level, though, it doesn\u2019t matter why the daughter becomes distressed by cooking. All that matters is that her anxiety goes through the roof when she sees someone cooking. Her mother\u2019s solution? Simple: stop using the stove. Okay, maybe that\u2019s not so simple, but\u00a0Mom has found other ways to\u00a0cook food and keep the family fed and she says it is worth the extra effort because her daughter is so much less anxious and depressed now that she has a\u00a0greater sense of\u00a0certainty about the kitchen. People make comments like, \u201cyou\u2019ll get tired of accommodating her!\u201d but her\u00a0mother sees so\u00a0much benefit in eliminating a huge source of stress from her daughter\u2019s life and is glad to be able to do something so small, in the grand scheme of things, in order to help her daughter grow up feeling more secure and happy. Maybe someday the \u201cstove phobia\u201d will pass. Maybe not. What matters is that a little girl feels calmer and happier and has more room in her life for learning and loving. Another depressing reality Autistic people live with is social isolation. The internet has helped bring many Autistic people together and that sense of community and shared culture helps a lot, but the Autistic community cannot be everywhere that Autistics are. When I go out in pubic alone, I am one Autistic surrounded by a sea of mostly allistic people, most of whom have very little understanding of autism. Our experience of social isolation begins very early in life. Speaking for myself, my levels of stress, anxiety, and depression were relatively minimal until I started school. There were stressful issues at home (My brother was diagnosed with cancer when I was five (I think. Maybe when I was four?)\u00a0and died about a month before my seventh birthday.) but when I started pre-school at age 4, I was not really aware of the intense events on the horizon in my home life. I remember being very excited about school. I remember waking up on the day of my 4th birthday, running into the dining room, and jumping happily up into my mother\u2019s arms. \u201cDo you know what today is?\u201d she asked me. \u201cMy birthday!\u201d \u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d \u201cI get to go to school now!\u201d She laughed (I guess she was looking for a different answer?) and said, \u201cnot yet, but soon. You\u2019re old enough now, but we have to wait until the school year starts.\u201d But school did not quite live up to my dreams. I was excited about school because I loved reading (I had picked the skill up from watching television shows like  Sesame Street  and  Electric Company  and from following along on the page when my parents read stories to us.) and because my brother already went to school and I wanted to do every single thing he did. When I got to school, I found there was no reading (I would have to wait two years for reading instruction and by then my reading level was so advanced I found  Fun With Dick and Jane  to be a tedious bore) and the other children were loud, chaotic, and generally unpleasant. I spent a lot of time hiding under the table. While I was self-isolating, it didn\u2019t make the social isolation any less painful. I wanted friends. I still want friends! And I still self-isolate when I am overwhelmed. Too often, I hear people say that Autistics don\u2019t want friends. Given the infinite diversity of human expression, I\u2019m sure there are some Autistics who don\u2019t want friends. But I believe most of us do want friends and people too often misinterpret our reaction to being overwhelmed as a sign that we don\u2019t want friends at all. Autism acceptance has a role here. When we understand, or are aware of, this sensory overwhelm that causes Autistic people to pull away from others, it might seem like the answer is to do something to \u201cfix\u201d the Autistic so they can tolerate lots of noise and movement and chaos and thus have friends. A whole lifetime could go wasted while trying to change the core neurological wiring that goes into sensory defensiveness. But with autism acceptance \u2014 the stance that we are different, even disabled, but not broken and should be accepted and loved for who we are rather than for dreams of who we might be changed into \u2014 a more immediate solution is to arrange social situations where Autistic people can spend time with others one-on-one or in very small groups in quieter, calmer environments. I am middle-aged but still that same overwhelmed child is inside me. I would far rather spend time with one or two people in a quiet room or a beautiful natural setting than go to a party or try to socialize in a noisy coffee house. In addition to overwhelm, there is stigma to deal with. Some people find the mannerisms of Autistic people off-putting, whether they know the person is autistic or not.\u00a0 Some of the ways we pursue friendships are annoying or frightening to others who don\u2019t understand and think we are harassing or stalking them. Social customs dictate that people avoid or abuse us in those situations instead of speaking openly and honestly to us about how our behavior makes them feel. Autism acceptance increases the chances that people choose to communicate to us about the things we are doing that cause them to feel uncomfortable instead of just\u00a0abandoning us or taking legal action against us while we are left to wonder what it was that we did wrong. Low self-esteem, anger, shame, depression \u2014 these are very normal reactions to social scenarios\u00a0in which we are genuinely trying to develop friendships and repeatedly get \u201cslapped away\u201d with little or no explanation. Bullying, as discussed a couple of days ago, is a huge problem for Autistic\u00a0people of all ages and\u00a0is another source of social isolation. If the bullies are powerful, not only do they make life a torment for\u00a0an Autistic person, but they can make it less likely that others will reach out in friendship\u00a0to\u00a0an Autistic person, for fear of also becoming a target of the bully. I think most kids who stand by and watch bullying without doing anything about it are just too relieved that they are not the bully\u2019s chosen victim. Others might also feel annoyed or threatened by the Autistic person\u2019s words and behavior that they don\u2019t understand and choose to stand by passively because they feel the Autistic person deserves the torment, even if they, themselves, are unwilling to administer the social punishments. Being bullied is very socially isolating. I have never felt so alone and unloved as I have during those times when I was being bullied and onlookers were either joining in or standing passively, doing nothing to help or support me. A study conducted in England found that only 1/3 of Autistic people reported feeling adequately supported by others. It is very depressing to have life difficulties and feel like no one, or too few people, are rooting for you to succeed. It is small wonder that some studies have found a 60% depression rate in Autistic people if roughly 60% of Autistics feel they have no one on their side to help them through a difficult, challenging, and often frightening world. Another British study found that\u00a0over 50% of parents believe their child is not in a school environment that suits their needs. And yet another found as many as 1/5 of Autistic children have been excluded from school at some\u00a0point. That study resonated with me because I was expelled from school due to being an \u201cunmanageable behavior problem\u201d that the administration would prefer someone else be burdened with. Too many Autistics grow up believing that they are the root of all their\u00a0problems. Too many are explicitly told that they are bringing their problems on themselves. I was told that I was to blame for the bullying I experienced. It\u2019s a harsh message, whether delivered explicitly or implicitly. It\u2019s\u00a0a depressing burden to grow up\u00a0hearing what a depressing burden one is. Awareness is important but it is not enough. All awareness by itself accomplishes is that it gives people an excuse. Without acceptance and accommodation, becoming aware of someone\u2019s autism just leaves bullies saying, \u201csee? I knew there was something defective about you.\u201d And not just childhood bullies. I left a community a year or two ago because I saw someone being bullied and I stood up for them. The bully said, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re Autistic and having a melt down. You don\u2019t get social things, so you can\u2019t possibly know what\u2019s really going on here.\u201d That is awareness without acceptance. That is autism being used as a bludgeon against the Autistic. That bully\u2019s \u201cautistic awareness\u201d was even harder on me than if they had known nothing at all of autism. But we do need increased awareness of autism! So that means we really need increased acceptance of autism. The two go hand-in-hand: without awareness, there can be no acceptance. But without acceptance, awareness does immeasurable harm to Autistic people. A final depressing point to touch upon is unemployment. Most people derive a sense of self-esteem through feeling productive and useful. A British study found that 61% of unemployed Autistics say they want to work but only 15% of Autistics are actually employed. Once again a big factor is stigma against autism and lack of acceptance and accommodation of Autistic workers. Of course unemployed Autistics are prone to depression. They are more likely to feel dissatisfied with life, more likely to experience social isolation, and more likely to live in poverty. And again the data match up: if 85% of Autistics are unemployed and 61% of them want to work, that means roughly 52% of Autistics want to work but are unable to find or keep employment.\u00a0 So why would it be surprising to see studies finding a 50% to 60% depression rate among Autistics in light of those figures? There is not an epidemic of autism but there is definitely an epidemic of depression and anxiety among Autistic people. There is strong evidence that much of this depression is situational and there is even stronger evidence that increasing autism acceptance will help to remedy much of\u00a0what makes life so difficult for Autistic people.\u00a0Yes, there are challenges and impairments within each Autistic person, but far greater than those are the stumbling blocks we find outside ourselves, every time we interact with\u00a0members of society at large. The more that we are able to help people to see the great value of Autistic people \u2014 and not merely value tied to academic performance or career skills, but inherent value, human dignity, and worth \u2014 the further along the road we will have travelled toward healing the depression and anxiety that\u00a0so many Autistic people live with and suffer through every day.

{"date": "2015/11/10", "body": "I have many heroes, living and dead. These are people who are role models to me, people who have changed my life for the better and motivate me to work to change others\u2019 lives for the better in return. Paul K. Longmore is one of those people who have paved the way for me to have a fuller and more fulfilling life. Longmore worked to make the world a better place for disabled people and his work has had a direct influence on my life. One reason I work so hard to make the world better for other disabled people is so that I can pay forward the great debt I owe Paul K. Longmore. I learned about Longmore\u2019s work shortly after I self-published my first book,  No You Don\u2019t: Essays from an Unstrange Mind . I had worked hard to write my collection of memoir-flavored essays about my lived experience of autism and my hopes for the children currently growing up Autistic. Not only did I write, revise, and edit all the writing, but I laid out the typesetting for the print version, designed the cover, and created the Kindle version. I spent many hours in front of a computer tweaking images by a pixel here or a pixel there and shuffling words around to prevent awkward widows and orphans (isolated bits of words at the top or bottom of a page, disrupting the visual flow of pages.) The book released very successfully, considering what a small fish I am, and I dutifully reported my income from it. Social Security rules for earnings\u00a0while living on SSI are designed to help disabled people transition from living on benefits to being self-supporting. A small initial amount is exempt and then SSI is reduced fifty cents for every dollar earned. So I expected my checks to be reduced by a small amount, but imagine my shock when\u00a0my checks were slashed so dramatically that I couldn\u2019t pay my rent any more. (I had already spent the royalties I\u2019d received in that first burst of sales on life necessities, assuming that I would still get nearly a full SSI check later.) When I contacted the Social Security Administration (SSA) about the problem, it turned out that they were considering my income under the rules for \u201cunearned income.\u201d These rules are more draconian: one\u2019s check is reduced dollar-for-dollar. This is why I never bothered to go get utility assistance: if an agency gives me money to pay my winter heating bill, that money is unearned income and my SSI check would be reduced by the exact dollar amount two months later. So all utility assistance does for a person on SSI is shuffle their expenses but it doesn\u2019t actually help them in any way. It took me months to straighten out my money situation with Social Security and I am grateful that my landlord worked with me during that time because otherwise I might have become homeless in the middle of the battle. The SSA was applying the rules for royalties that come from things like mineral rights. If you are on SSI and strike oil on your property and sell that oil to a corporation, the money you are paid is called royalties and it is considered unearned income. I have no problem with that, because selling mineral rights on one\u2019s property doesn\u2019t require a lot of effort on the seller\u2019s part and the oil that is pulled out of their land is worked by someone else. That income pretty much is unearned. But the royalties that come from a creative work of art are different. As I said, I worked hard for a long time to put that book together and I continue to work all the time to market that book. I continue to work, writing more essays and books and promoting them in various ways. The royalties I earn from my book are, indeed, earned. I haven\u2019t yet earned enough royalties to compensate at minimum wage for the hours I put into creating the book. My task was to prove to the SSA that I had earned that money and deserved to have my income considered under the earned rules instead of the unearned rules. And when I set out to do the research to prove my case, that\u2019s when I discovered Paul K. Longmore. Longmore was a history professor and a disability activist. In 1953, at the age of seven, Longmore developed polio and lost the use of his hands as a result. He needed expensive medical care for the rest of his life, due to post-polio syndrome, and so keeping the medical benefits that come with Social Security disability was very important to his survival. Longmore wrote an award-winning book,  The Invention of George Washington , by holding a pen in his mouth and using it to type on a keyboard. It took Longmore ten years to write his book. I do not tell you of his writing process and the length of time it took him to write as some sort of inspiration porn. I tell you because it underlines how much the royalties from his book were  earned  income, not unearned in any sense of the word. Longmore worked hard on his book and it is a highly regarded book in its own right. But the SSA did not share this view and Longmore was suffering as a result. The fact that they took away every penny he earned was bad enough, but he could not accept awards for his book if they included a cash prize and his healthcare coverage was at risk. Longmore\u00a0burned a copy of his book on the steps of the SSA main headquarters in Washington, D.C., an act of protest that he wrote about in an essay included in his collection,  Why I Burned My Book and Other Essays on Disability . Longmore\u2019s protest and subsequent lobbying lead to a\u00a0change in the late Eighties to\u00a0the SSA rules governing earnings from creative works, colloquially known as the Longmore Amendment. This is just the beginning when it comes to learning about Dr. Longmore\u2019s contributions to disability activism and I highly recommend reading his books and learning more about his life. Sadly, Longmore died unexpectedly in 2010 at age 64, but his legacy lives on. He is one of my heroes and I think he will become one of yours as well. Thank you, Dr. Longmore, for fighting for our rights. When I took my information to the SSA \u2014 information about the change in rules and direct citations from the SSA\u2019s own rulebook \u2014 my meeting was almost anti-climactic. My caseworker barely looked at my evidence and changed my earning status with no fight at all, treating me as if I were engaging in overkill by bringing in documentation (despite the way I had been treated earlier without documentation, even to the point of being lectured that SSI is \u201cneed based\u201d as if I shouldn\u2019t even want to have a higher income let alone have a right to work for a higher income and a chance to transition off benefits, becoming self-supporting.) My reception was irritating, but I got over it pretty quickly when I saw the results: I don\u2019t have to report my income month-by-month. Every year, I submit my tax returns and estimate my next year\u2019s earnings. My check is adjusted annually, based on projected earnings. I am free to focus on working hard to build my business of writing, speaking, and trying to help shape a future world that has a place for people like me. I owe much of my continuing success to the work of Paul K. Longmore. I hope my work pays tribute to his memory. He is one of my heroes and role-models. Thank you, Dr. Longmore, for fighting for all of us disabled folk who are trying to build careers and touch the future through our work. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/paul_longmore-face236.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/No-You-Dont-Essays-Unstrange/dp/1493575457/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1446908499&sr=8-1-fkmr0", "http://www.amazon.com/Invention-George-Washington-Paul-Longmore/dp/0813918723/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446911899&sr=8-1&keywords=the+invention+of+george+washington", "http://www.amazon.com/Burned-Essays-Disability-American-Subjects/dp/1592130240/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446907797&sr=8-1&keywords=why+I+burned+my+book"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/paul-k-longmore/", "title": "Paul K.

{"date": "2015/04/06", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . E is for Empathy I know, right? The \u201cempathy question\u201d is one of the biggest enemies to autism acceptance. I read an award-winning philosophical treatise on the nature of autism (that I will not even name here, because it is so awful I don\u2019t want it to get any recognition at all) that claimed that Autistic people do not have empathy and therefore are not fully human. The author said that Autistic people could never develop community, due to this alleged lack of empathy. Moreover, the author made a philosophical argument that Autistic people should not be permitted to vote because our supposed lack of empathy meant we could not truly be citizens in the fullest sense of the word and had no place participating in the decisions of the nation. This isn\u2019t some fringe book \u2014 like I said, this book won awards. And Temple Grandin wrote the foreword to it! I can only hope she was really busy that week and didn\u2019t have the chance to actually read the text because she has said so many other things that do not agree with the message of that book. News reporters tell audiences the \u201ctruth\u201d about our lack of empathy. Every time there is a mass killing, experts are trotted out to speculate about the possibility of the killer being on the autism spectrum (and, in most cases, the killer turns out not to be Autistic)\u00a0. . . because \u201ceveryone knows\u201d about our stunning lack of empathy and who is more likely to kill lots of people than someone with no empathy? Right? This is so very damaging. People who have never met me have said I cannot enter their house simply because they know I am Autistic and they saw a frightening news story about a killer. It is long past time to put the \u201cempathy question\u201d to rest. Here\u2019s the short version of the \u201cempathy answer\u201d for you: of course we have empathy!! It doesn\u2019t look the same as your (non-autistic) empathy, but we have it. Or at least many of us have it. And if we don\u2019t have it, that\u2019s no reason to dehumanize us and make our lives more difficult. Okay, maybe the short answer wasn\u2019t so short after all. Now for the longer version. The first thing to think about when considering the empathy of Autistic people is the definition of empathy.\u00a0 The simplest definition of empathy is \u201cthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.\u201d It looks simple, but right away we can break that into two parts: understanding other people\u2019s feelings and sharing other people\u2019s feelings. We Autistic people can do both of those things but, like many other aspects of everyday life, we sometimes need a little assistance, mentorship, and accommodation. I\u2019m not the first person to break empathy down into two separate processes. Academic/medical fields, such as neuroscience, speak of \u201ccognitive empathy\u201d and \u201caffective empathy.\u201d Cognitive empathy loosely correlates to the \u201cunderstanding\u201d half of the definition above while affective empathy corresponds to the \u201csharing\u201d half. These are two very different mental and emotional skills so, even though they are interrelated (and both have a contribution to the aspects of autism that cause others to misunderstand our capacity for empathy), I need to consider them one at a time. Cognitive empathy means knowing how someone else is feeling. We cannot share their feelings if we cannot see or understand them. There are many reasons why we can have difficulty seeing how someone else is feeling. Some people will bring up an idea called \u201ctheory of mind\u201d and say that we cannot see other people\u2019s emotions because we do not have theory of mind. To have theory of mind is to understand that other people have minds and that those minds contain thoughts, knowledge, ideas, and desires that are different from the thoughts, knowledge, ideas, and desires in our own minds. It is this belief that we have no theory of mind that led\u00a0John Horgan,\u00a0former science writer for Scientific American, to declare in 1999 that \u201cautistics often seem to make no fundamental distinction between humans and inanimate objects, such as tables and chairs.\u201d\u00a0 (thank you,  Melanie Yergeau , for finding that quote.) The idea that we lack theory of mind is a false one that goes back to something called the \u201cSally-Anne Test.\u201d Children were shown a situation in which two dolls, named Sally and Anne, had a marble. Sally puts the marble in a basket and leaves the room. While she is gone, Anne moves the marble from the basket to a box. The children were asked where Sally would look for the marble when she returns to the room. Of course, the answer the researchers are looking for is that Sally will look in the basket. If a child says that Sally will look in the box, they are assuming that Sally has access to the content of the child\u2019s mind and can see things that happened while she was out of the room. The assumption in this case is that the child is lacking in theory of mind. Typically developing children \u201cfail\u201d the Sally-Anne test until around age four or five. Children with Down Syndrome show a similar pattern, easily grasping Sally\u2019s different perspective on things by around age four or five. But in one study, conducted by Doctors Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan M. Leslie, and\u00a0Uta Frith in 1985, \u00a0around 80% of Autistic children were not able to pass the Sally-Anne test, despite having a higher testable IQ than the typically-developing and Down Syndrome age peers used as controls. This single study has been cited again and again and extrapolated to all Autistic people, not just young children. The thing that is forgotten is that autism\u00a0is a developmental  delay , not a developmental  halt . Just because 80% of the children tested by Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith could not pass the Sally-Anne\u00a0Test at that point in their development, it does not follow that they never will or that no other Autistic people will develop theory of mind at some point in their lives. Fewer Autistic teens fail the Sally-Anne Test. Almost all Autistic adults who have means of communication (which is to say, the majority of Autistic adults) are able to easily pass the Sally-Anne test. Theory of mind is not a simple on-off switch but rather a wide range of skills that are developed over time. Children who are born Deaf and not provided with sign language in early life not only struggle with language acquisition later but also fail the Sally-Anne Test. Yet I have had many friends who were born Deaf and not provided sign language until later in life who demonstrated plenty of theory of mind by the time I met them as teens or adults. More recently, researchers have discovered that Autistic children are not failing the Sally-Anne Test so much as the Sally-Anne Test is failing Autistic children.  In 2013, researchers in Queensland, Australia, devised a new test for theory of mind  called the \u201cDot-Midge Test\u201d. It is based on the Sally-Anne Test, but with a significant difference: the test is made into a game in which the child stands the chance of winning a toy. Just as in the Sally-Anne Test, Midge hides the toy, then leaves the room. Dot then moves the toy. The difference is that the child is told that they are in a contest with Dot and Midge.\u00a0 First, the child chooses either Dot or Midge to look for the toy. If they find it, they get to keep it. If they don\u2019t find it, the child gets a turn to look for the toy. Again, if the child finds the toy, the child can keep it but if the child does not find the toy, they don\u2019t get to have it. When Autistic children were given the Sally-Anne Test, with the only motivation being getting the right answer, only 13% passed. But when the children were given the Dot-Midge Test with the motivation being to win a prize, 74% passed \u2014 choosing Midge to go first because the child knew that Midge had a false idea of where the toy would be. Neither of these percentages are in line with random chance \u2014 they are both far enough away from 50% to make it clear that something is inadequate about the Sally-Anne Test (some researchers speculate that the standard \u201creward\u201d in the Sally-Anne Test, i.e. the social reward of being pleasing to the researchers, is not enough reward for the average Autistic child to be willing to work the problem through sufficiently.) It also becomes clear that there is a whole lot more theory of mind going on in the Autistic brain than has previously been credited. So if we have theory of mind after all, why do we struggle so much with seeing people\u2019s emotions? This is an important question. I am saying that we do have empathy but we often don\u2019t realize that there is something to be empathetic about. So it is important to talk about why we miss those social cues. One barrier is the ability to read and interpret facial expressions and body language. I think I have gotten pretty good with that skill, but I have worked at it for 40+ years and I still can\u2019t really do it in real time. I can interpret facial and body language in a video (but not in still photographs) or, because I have high motivation and strong visual memory skills, I can re-play an experience after the fact and figure out what happened. But I am clueless in the moment and that is because I am not really using the same brain circuits that allistic (not autistic) people use when they interpret faial and body language. For allistic people (who do not have some other neurological condition that affects reading body language) figuring out what someone is feeling by looking at them and listening to the tone of their voice is nearly instantaneous. There is no real effort involved. It just \u201chappens.\u201d When I try to interpret what is going on inside someone, it takes a lot of effort. I have to analyze the details of their posture and voice and apply logic and memory of many years of studying many books about body language. It takes so much effort that I just cannot do it in the middle of an interaction with someone. Sometimes I have only realized what was happening on the emotional landscape years after a conversation took place. Many past interactions are still mysteries to me. I have an easier time picking out emotions in movies and television shows because actors are intentionally broadcasting their body language loudly \u2014 the physical version of \u201cspeaking from the diaphragm,\u201d as it were. I have put, and still do put,\u00a0a tremendous amount of effort into learning to read body language and I am still really, really bad at it. And I accept that I always will be. I still work to learn what I can, but I know I will never approach \u201cnormal\u201d levels of interpretation. Ever. In my entire life. And I\u2019m (mostly) okay with that. Brian King, in his excellent book,  Strategies for Building Successful Relationships with People on the Autism Spectrum: Let\u2019s Relate! , talks about the futility of trying to teach body language interpretation to Autistic children: My greatest frustration with the social skills classes of my experience is their insistence on trying to get our kids to make their brains do things that their brains do not do \u2014 recognize nonverbal communication, recognize vocal tone, recognize body posture and body language. If your brain does not pick that stuff up, you cannot make it. People have told me my entire life to look at body language, expression, and look at this, look at that. Guess what? It doesn\u2019t work and I will explain to you the reasons why that is and what you can do about it. King goes on to do just that \u2014 explain the difficulties and give solutions. The best solution for not being able to read body language? Teach the allistic people to make their feelings explicitly known and teach the Autistic people to check-in with others to explicitly ask what they are feeling. You will find that Autistic people have a tremendous amount of empathy when we understand the emotions around us! You cannot claim we have no empathy when there are no accommodations in place to help us understand the emotional content surrounding us. Another issue is alexithymia. Alexithymia is the word for not being able to recognize and put words to internal emotional states. People with alexithymia do have emotions, but we have a difficult time telling the difference between physical conditions, like illness, and emotional conditions with physical manifestations, like sorrow. Anyone can have alexithymia for a variety of reasons (PTSD from emotional trauma is a common cause.) Approximately 10% of the general population has alexithymia but studies indicate that as much as 85% of people with autism have some degree of alexithymia and an estimated 50% of us have severe alexithymia. This is why I so often stress helping Autistic children learn what their emotional states are. All children can benefit from emotional mentoring, but Autistic children are in extra need of this sort of assistance. \u201cIt looks like you didn\u2019t like it when your sister took your toy away. I see your face is red and you are crying. Are you feeling angry? Are you feeling sad?\u201d Conversations like these can help children learn to put names on their emotional states and can help them to recognize the physical symptoms of emotions. This latter is very important \u2014 I am nearly 50 years old and I still don\u2019t know when I am agitated or upset unless I remember to watch for symptoms like rocking back and forth more than usual, tense muscles, a churning sensation in my chest, tears, and so on. I have emotions, but I am not able to see them very clearly and I have to apply logic to understanding my own emotions just as I apply logic to understanding the emotions of others. Our primary difficulties with empathy lie in the realm of cognitive empathy. Help us understand what you are feeling. Help us understand what we are feeling. Help us to see a bigger emotional picture and you will find that we are very empathetic. Some researcher have suggested that, when it comes to affective empathy, not only are we not deficient, but we have more than usual \u2014 sometimes too much! Affective empathy \u2014 the ability to feel \u201cwith\u201d someone \u2014 is strong in us.\u00a0 Henry and Kamila Markram have put forth a concept called the Intense World Theory. \u00a0The idea is that the autistic brain is \u201csupercharged\u201d and, as a result, the world is too intense to bear. Sounds are too loud and painful, lights are too bright, smells are too strong, and feelings are too intense. The more intense the perception of the world, the more the Autistic person pulls away and builds a sort of \u201cbubble\u201d around themselves for protection. While most allistic people are able to \u201cfilter\u201d the world so that it isn\u2019t so overwhelmingly intense, Autistic people get a massive flow of all data simultaneously and need to \u201cshut off\u201d in order to cope with it all. Emotions coming from within can be just as overwhelming as sensory input coming from outside. If we cringe from the strong feelings of others and shut down at the strong feelings in ourselves when confronted with the strong feelings of others, we are not demonstrating a lack of empathy. We are demonstrating extreme sensitivity that should be recognized and respected. When we express empathy or sympathy by taking things to a cerebral level and doing research to try to help you with your struggles, we are not being \u201ccold and clinical,\u201d we are showing our love in a way that is healthy and safe for us. Do not expect us to harm ourselves in order for you to feel as if we care about you. Respect our ways of being, our ways of knowing, our ways of loving. But what I said above? Maybe we don\u2019t have empathy? Well\u2026. maybe we don\u2019t. Maybe what I think is empathy in myself is actually sympathy. I have no objective way of knowing. All I can say is that I do care and I have seen countless other Autistics of all ages and walks of life expressing that they care. Isn\u2019t it enough to care, no matter what that caring actually is (sympathy, empathy, logical conclusions) or how that caring is expressed? I\u2019d like to leave you with  Cynthia\u2019s excellent writing on empathy . I stumbled across\u00a0her blog entry just as I was finishing up writing this one and I immediately knew I wanted everyone to read it as well. She covers some of the same ground I just have and she covers other ground I didn\u2019t walk on in this essay. And she links to another essay about empathy. Don\u2019t stop with mine. Or Cynthia\u2019s. Or the one she linked to. Read more. Learn more. Formulate your own ideas about autism and empathy. If you take away only one idea from me to inform you in that adventure of exploration, let it be that we are human beings with real emotions, real needs for support, and deserving of real respect and dignity. Do not let all that speculation about whether we have or lack empathy cause you to lose your own empathy in considering us. Thank you. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/e1.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "http://aspierhetor.com/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587041", "http://www.amazon.com/Strategies-Building-Successful-Relationships-Spectrum/dp/1849058563/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428356828&sr=8-1&keywords=brian+king+let%27s+relate", "http://musingsofanaspie.com/2013/01/17/the-empathy-conundrum/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/e-is-for-empathy/", "title": "E is for\u00a0Empathy"},
{"date": "2015/11/18", "body": "When I am asked if I am happy, I\u2019m not always able to answer right away. Sometimes I have to sit and think a while, looking inward to see if I can find the answer. \u201cAm I happy? Am I happy? What is happy?\u201d Happiness is a little abstract to me. Sometimes it is pretty obvious to me that I am happy, but just as often I struggle to even understand what happiness is. Competence, on the other hand, is more concrete and much more clear to me. When I have remembered to take the trash out the night before the garbage truck arrives, I feel competent. When I have cooked food without burning it and the resulting meal is healthy, tasty, and satisfying, I feel competent. When I cut my hair and the result looks good (or when someone compliments me on my cut and asks me who my stylist is) I feel competent. When I write an essay that people share with others and people tell me they enjoyed reading it or learned something valuable from it, I feel very competent. When I get up in front of an audience and speak about autism and field questions and feel strong and solid about the answers I am giving and am thanked afterward by others, I feel incredibly competent. Victories, both large and small, can bring a sense of competence. Solving puzzles, reading a mathematical proof and being able to follow the logic all the way through, playing a musical piece without any errors, keeping a relationship healthy and thriving for another year, being able to hike farther on a trail than I did the last time, doing my laundry, not going to sleep with gum in my mouth, mending my clothing, having a non-confusing conversation with someone. And, unlike happiness, I know when I am feeling competent. I often struggle with a mind-body disconnect that leaves me only vaguely aware, at best, what my emotions are. But competence is an emotion that sings out loudly and clearly. And when I feel competent, I know I am feeling happy. Maybe competence is one kind of happiness (I feel sure there must be more to happiness than simply feeling competent.) When I am feeling competent, I am feeling in control, confident, and happy. I have had parents ask me to help me understand why their kid says \u201cno\u201d to everything \u2014 things the child doesn\u2019t want but also things the child wants. I mean, quite literally, everything gets a \u201cno\u201d from the kid. As you can imagine, it\u2019s really frustrating to the parent. There seems to be no solution, nothing to bring that child to \u201cyes.\u201d Even offers of the child\u2019s favorite foods, favorite toys, favorite activities are met with resistance. A child (or adult, for that matter) who is saying \u201cno\u201d to everything, even things that person might really like to have, is a person who is feeling out of control in their situation and trying to cling hold to the only thing in this world\u00a0they are still able to control: their will. Your child is living in a world that is too loud (or not loud enough), that is too bright (or too flat and colorless), that is filled with wild and clashing smells. that is populated by unpredictable people who move startlingly fast and often reach out to touch in painful ways (for some of us, even the gentlest touch can be painful. For some of us,  especially  the gentlest touch can be painful!) As Nick Walker has pointed out in his excellent  definition of autism , the lived experience of autism is \u201cmore intense and chaotic\u201d than the world appears to most non-autistic people. Walker writes that, \u201con both the sensorimotor and cognitive levels, the autistic mind tends to register more information, and the impact of each bit of information tends to be both stronger and less predictable.\u201d As you might imagine, living in a world that is intense, chaotic, and unpredictable is no easy task. Refusing everything is one way to assert some level of order and structure on a world that seems wildly out of control. One approach a parent can take when their child starts saying no to everything like that is to help them experience feelings of competence. When a person feels like the entire world is out of control, they need victories and they need to be in charge of something. This can be difficult to address since typically a person who gets to the point of refusing everything is someone who has a lot of support needs and, as a result, has ended up in a position where just about everything is being done for them or done with minimal, passive input from them. How can you help someone in that position to get more control over their life? One way to help someone who is unhappy with their lack of control and their struggles against a chaotic and unpredictable world is to help them increase their happiness and sense of control by helping them to increase their feelings of competence. You will have to start small, of course, but you can start anywhere and then build up from that point. What makes it tricky is that you will not be able to suggest anything as that will just get a \u201cno\u201d in response. \u00a0As with many things when it comes to raising, mentoring, and educating a child, it has to be led by the child themselves. Start by choosing something that is not harmful or significant for the health and well-being of the person and that they have been fighting to get their way with for a while and give them their \u201cno.\u201d In fact, start by giving them every \u201cno\u201d you can spare. A person who has turned everything into a \u201cno\u201d is in crisis and getting them to feel safer, happier, and more competent is more important than a lot of the daily routine. So they miss a couple of baths and smell bad. So what? For a while, only insist on the absolutes and give them as many chances to take charge of their life as you can possibly give them. Find other ways to\u00a0help them discover more of a sense of competence and control. If they stack some blocks, don\u2019t put them away too quickly. Let them savor their creation. The more you can give them space to take charge of their life and manipulate the physical world around them, the more you can make space for competence. But don\u2019t be surprised if skipping baths and stacking blocks is not enough. Examine their communication abilities. People often get frustrated when their communication abilities are lagging very far behind their communication needs. To move very far past that place where the person is refusing every single thing, you will want to help them find real control in their life and that cannot be found until they can communicate on a level that gets their needs met. Never give up on helping Autistic people who need and want to increase their communication. Try every method. Offer every opportunity. Communication is such a fundamental need (and such a fundamental human right) that it is the cornerstone of competence and happiness. And competence and happiness are the cornerstones of a life well-lived.

{"date": "2015/04/22", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . O is for Overloaded, Overstimulated, and Overwhelmed I couldn\u2019t write this essay until now because, for the last several days, I have been too much of these three things to be able to write about them. There are\u00a0several types of experiences\u00a0that tend to make Autistic folks overloaded, overstimulated, or overwhelmed. As with most things, it\u2019s different from person to person. Some people might respond to one of these triggers; others respond to all of them. Some might seem pretty solid most of the time, others might be always living so close to the anxious edge that it does not take very much at all to push them over. Many of us are both of these extremes, at different times and in different situations. That\u2019s an important thing to remember: when you\u2019re talking about things like \u201cseverity\u201d or \u201cfunctioning levels\u201d, it\u2019s better to just step back and not use that framework at all and instead talk in terms of support needs. We all have support needs and the amount and type of support we need can change from day to day, throughout the day, from minute to minute, from year to year. We are dynamic, not static, and how much support we need, how overloaded we become, how we react to the stresses of life \u2014 these things are constantly changing. Over time, we develop coping abilities, develop new skills, grow up, gain perspective. In the moment, we find or put ourselves into environments with more or less stimulation, have unexpected encounters with other people, weather, animals, the sharp corners of furniture. Life is always changing and we are always changing along with it. I don\u2019t always know how much input I can handle. Think about that for a minute. I\u2019m almost 50 years old. I\u2019ve had decades of life in this body and brain. I\u2019ve carefully studied life and my responses to it. And I still am not always sure whether I can handle something or not. Sometimes, a thing I could handle yesterday is out of my grasp today. Sometimes, a place that is usually good for me is very hard to cope with. Sometimes I\u2019m not even sure what is stressing me out. Sometimes I\u2019m not very good at realizing I\u2019m stressed out and need to take a break. If I, a middle-aged adult, do not always know when I need to take a break, how much more must you be compassionate with a child who has not learned self-regulation skills yet? So, the main triggers I have noticed in myself and others (which is to say these are not necessarily the only triggers of overload and I would welcome discussion of other sources of overload in the comments section) are sensory input, emotions (our own and others\u2019), and demands exceeding our executive function abilities. Sensory input was the one that most recently did me in. I am on a limited data plan when it comes to the internet and my writing process involves being online (pulling up links to include, looking up data to get facts correct, even popping back and forth between writing and other activities on days when I need to break what I\u2019m doing into pieces.) My data plan re-sets mid month and I was low on data so I decided to go out to wifi spots to write. Normally, I have little trouble working in public. I have a few favorite wifi spots, including a nice, quiet little independently-owned coffee shop. What I had forgotten was that it was Friday night. I keep a non-traditional schedule, so \u201cweekend\u201d doesn\u2019t have a lot of personal meaning. I work every day, except when I need to rest. I don\u2019t use a calendar to tell me when to work or rest because it is healthier for me to listen to my body\u2019s cues. Except when I am so intent on doing something that I over-ride my body\u2019s cues, not noticing how much it is screaming for something until it is screaming so loudly I am breaking apart. That\u2019s what happened on Friday. I started out in the coffee house and things were going fine until a large group of loud and high-pitched shrieking people sat right next to me. I put on headphones and started streaming Vivaldi, but the loud shrieks cut through everything and they HURT. Also, I have a condition called vestibular hyperacusis which can best be described as a sort of synaesthesia that translates sound into motion. The more common form of hyperacusis, cochlear hyperacusis, translates certain sounds into pain. Vestibular hyperacusis is pain plus dizziness, disorientation, nausea, etc. When I hear certain high-pitched sounds, it feels as if the floor is sliding away from under me. It\u2019s like being sea sick. And it\u2019s pretty horrible. Then some musicians decided to play. Normally, that\u2019s a good thing. Here\u2019s an example of what I usually hear when musicians start picking up instruments at \u201cmy\u201d coffee house: I like that. It is imperfect, impromptu, and amateur but utterly delightful. This is not what was happening on Friday, though. Four people picked up instruments and started playing four different songs, each getting louder and louder, trying to out-play the other three. It was a horrible cacophony. I turned up the volume on Vivaldi but still couldn\u2019t quite drown the noise out. But I was stubbornly trying to finish writing an essay and I tried to \u201cpower through it.\u201d This is a bad idea. And I know, partly, where it comes from. All my life, I\u2019ve had people say, \u201cit\u2019s not that bad\u201d, \u201cjust tough it out and you will get used to it,\u201d \u201cstop acting like such a baby!\u201d I\u2019ve internalized a lot of the shame and so when I should have just packed things up and gone home, I tried to power through it instead. I stayed until the coffee house closed and I got a lot of work done, despite the pain. But I wasn\u2019t finished. I should have just gone home, but instead I went to a 24-hour McDonald\u2019s (still unaware that it was Friday night) to try to finish. A busload of pre-teens came in, hyper from some activity, and started playing Ping-Pong across the restaurant. Again, the noise was horrible and now I had balls whizzing past me, inches from my face. I stubbornly kept writing and finished my work and went home. And slept for days. I slept all of Saturday and most of Sunday. Monday afternoon, I woke up long enough to re-schedule\u00a0an appointment\u00a0to Tuesday. Tuesday I made the appointment but spent the rest of the day before and after sleeping. Today, Wednesday, I slept twelve hours and I finally feel \u201cright\u201d enough to accomplish things again. Like writing this essay. Spending Friday evening fighting against excessive and overloading sensory input cost me about four days of . . . . of life, really. This is why \u201cjust tough it out\u201d is such a bad idea. If I had listened to my body and listened to the advice I am always giving to other people, I would have gone home (or noticed it was Friday and .not gone out in the first place.) I stubbornly wanted to get some work done but by trying to force my way through it, I lost several days of productivity. The root of the problem was that I was not treating myself the way I ask people to treat the Autistics in their lives. I should have removed myself from the stress, but I didn\u2019t. Pay attention to sensory input and how it might be stressing out the Autistic people in your life (including yourself.)\u00a0 The grocery store is a really common place for meltdowns and it\u2019s easy to see why: flickering fluorescent lights, bright colors shouting in chaotic ways, words everywhere you look, (other) children crying, people milling around (motion is one of my sensory sensitivities and it makes it hard to be in a crowded place because not only are there sounds and smells and touches but everything around me is moving in unpredictable ways!), painful and garbled announcements on overhead speakers, and in the warehouse groceries there is echoing sound and the shrill beeping of forklifts backing up. Is it any surprise that the grocery store is one of the biggest challenges for Autistic people as well as for the mothers of young Autistics? It\u2019s a place we usually have to go if we want to eat but\u00a0can be\u00a0a sensory nightmare to be there. Emotions are overloading and overwhelming. I laughed at my great-grandmother\u2019s funeral and it (understandably) made people in my family very upset. But I loved Grandma Mary deeply. She was my favorite family member. She was the one who always accepted me, even when no one else could. She taught me what unconditional love looks like. I\u2019m feeling very emotional right now, just remembering her and feeling the loss. Just about every day of my life, I wish she were still alive. But I laughed at her funeral because I was so emotionally overloaded and overwhelmed. My cousin did her best to rescue me. She grabbed my hand and dragged me away saying, \u201cexcuse us, she\u2019s really choked up!\u201d to try to cover the giggles I was struggling to suppress. She pulled me after her into the bathroom and let me laugh in private. Laughter is contagious, so pretty soon she was laughing along with me, even though I know she deeply loved Grandma Mary, too. I am so grateful to my cousin for pulling me out of that situation \u2014 I rarely get such beautiful and compassionate support. And I am consoled by the knowledge that Grandma Mary would have loved and accepted me, even seeing me laugh at her funeral. She was always on my side and she knew I loved her. I wish I hadn\u2019t pissed my family off so much. But I guess by that point they were used to seeing just about anything from me and just added it to the tally of strangeness. Another emotionally overwhelming situation was when I tried to get lunch in the food court at my university during finals week. I had an exam coming up in 90 minutes and figured I ought to put food in me first. So I already had a huge stress overload as anyone who has ever survived a finals week would know. I went to a food vendor and asked for \u201cFire and Rice\u201d, a favorite meal. I mentioned that I wanted the sriracha added\u00a0during cooking, not after,\u00a0because it tasted better that way. The cook said okay. Still, I watched him with an eagle eye because I had lots of experience with my food not being prepared the way I asked. He did not add sriracha. He quickly scooped everything into a bowl and I said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t add sriracha.\u201d He said, \u201cI can put some in now if you want.\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s better when it\u2019s added during cooking.\u201d He said, \u201cI did add it. You weren\u2019t watching.\u201d I was confronted with a dilemma. I was sure he hadn\u2019t added it because I was carefully watching for him to. But what if he did add it and I asked him to put more and then the food was overseasoned and unpleasant to eat? Was he lying to me? I hate being lied to! Was he playing me for a fool? Had he really done something while I was watching for him to do it and I didn\u2019t see? I didn\u2019t know what to do and I lost control. I figure the people seeing me melt down figured I was some kind of spoiled brat. Or maybe they were used to seeing this kind of behavior during finals week? I started to leave and a woman approached me timidly, as if she were frightened of me, trying to calm me down and get my needs met. I ended up running away to a hiding place in the bathroom where I sobbed and hit myself for an hour until I was calm enough to go take my exam. It\u2019s a small thing. Someone made my food wrong and possibly lied to me about it. But it was too much emotion on top of the high level of emotion I was already walking around with. (Everyone around me was stressed and emotional because of finals week and I am like a sponge, soaking in other people\u2019s emotions as well. One thing I love about my boyfriend is how calm he remains in the face of just about anything. I tease him about it sometimes, but in truth I love it because it is so much easier for me to remain calm when the people around me are calm.) Some ways to try to mitigate emotional overload include staying calm, even during a meltdown (I know, it\u2019s not easy. But the less you react emotionally to an Autistic person\u2019s emotional distress, the easier it will be for them to recover from emotional overstimulation), and helping the Autistic children in your life to learn to identify and name their own emotions. I find that the more I am able to recognize my emotional states (and it\u2019s still not easy for me) the better I am at calming myself and, if needed and possible, removing myself from emotionally stressful situations. It\u2019s a work in progress. I will probably be working on self-regulation skills for the rest of my life. Executive function overload is also pretty common. One thing I\u2019ve noticed that sets other people off but I seem to handle reasonably well (although I do it much more slowly than I observe non-Autistic people doing it) is filling out forms. I have watched people completely disintegrate over a job application or a medical form. It\u2019s a strange thing, but I do understand and relate to it \u2014 someone who\u00a0knows what should be\u00a0put in the form boxes and who can read and write just falls apart at putting all that together. There\u2019s a . . . stuckness. It\u2019s part of why I am slow at filling out forms (dysgraphia \u2013 difficulty with handwriting \u2013 is the\u00a0other part of why\u00a0forms are\u00a0extra tedious for me.) If someone you know has a hard time with forms, don\u2019t shame them. Don\u2019t tell them to suck it up because they have to learn some day. Help them! Help them with the form and, if you can, along the way talk about what you are doing to help them learn form-management skills. Another overwhelming, executive-function related experience is housework and self-care. Every day, we are supposed to shower, brush our teeth, style our hair, clean our homes. It is overwhelming because there are so many tasks with so many steps. And if they go undone, there are even more tasks; it piles up. The worse it gets, the harder it is to start doing something about it. I keep checklists, broken down into the smallest bites, and it helps. But the moment things get away from me, the checklists don\u2019t work any more. When things get too chaotic, you can\u2019t fix thing A because thing B is in the way but you can\u2019t fix thing B because thing A is in the way. Result: overwhelm, overload, breakdown. Where it can get confusing is that the reactions to overload can be so different. Crying, meltdown, anger, self-injury, shutdown, long sleeps, overeating, undereating. Almost any kind of stress reaction you can imagine and some that never occurred to you. What makes it harder? The biggest challenge for me is when people blame me or mock me for struggling to cope. I\u2019ve been told, \u201cyou just want to be upset.\u201d No. No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to be upset at all. Being upset is horrible and stressful and exhausting. Being upset is what happens when a limit gets reached and I can\u2019t pull back from the edge any more. Just like a person who needs to vomit and is stuck in public has no choice but to vomit in front of everyone, an Autistic who has reached overload and is stuck in public has no choice but to stress out in front of everyone. It\u2019s embarrassing. Humiliating. Traumatic. I never went back to that food court the rest of the time I was a student at that university. I couldn\u2019t bear to revisit the scene of my trauma, the place of my shame. The loss of control is frightening. The loss of dignity is appalling. When a person pushes me to overload, especially when they over-ride my protests to do so, I experience a massive loss of trust and disassociate myself from that person. When someone tells you that they can\u2019t handle something, your instinct may be to be a cheerleader and push them into it. \u201cOf course you can! I\u2019ll be right by your side the whole time!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t limit yourself with can\u2019t!\u201d \u201cThe only disability is a bad attitude!\u201d There are all kinds of cheery platitudes meant to push people past their comfort zone. Sometimes that comfort zone is there for a very real reason and it\u2019s important to respect that. Don\u2019t lead with \u201cof course you can!\u201d Lead with, \u201ccan you tell me what makes it hard for you?\u201d Psychologists often get it all wrong. They try to apply psychology to episodes of overwhelm and meltdowns when what is primarily occurring is neurology. Yes, a psychological component can develop \u2014\u00a0going through multiple stressful breakdowns will leave a psychological mark on a person \u2014 but overload, overstimulation, overwhelm, meltdown, shutdown are manifestations of\u00a0neurology, of having a nervous system that is wired differently and has a pattern of over-sensitivities and under-sensitivities\u00a0that diverge from the expected. In saying this, I don\u2019t intend to present a neurology/psychology schism because it\u2019s all connected. I have more to say about this later,\u00a0under a different letter of the alphabet that is yet to come. Psychologists are trained to be alarmed by \u201cself-isolation.\u201d They often see a patient who presents with symptoms of depression (whether actual or mis-read. Sometimes our normal ways of being look like depression when they are not. Sometimes our depression does not look like depression. We talked about this\u00a0before, earlier in the alphabet.) and they believe that the depression is caused by the self-isolation so they urge the person to get out more, \u201cput yourself out there,\u201d be more socially active. The problem with this is that some of us have chosen self-isolation because we are trying to avoid overload, overstimulation, and\u00a0overwhelm. I love people. I think I may actually be a hidden extravert \u2014 hidden by my tendency toward sensory overload.\u00a0I can\u2019t \u201cput myself out there\u201d more than I do. Paradoxically, when I try to follow that sort of advice from a therapist, I become  more  depressed as a result. It is okay to help us find our limits if we don\u2019t know what they are. It is okay to help us grow past our limits in manageable bites that leave us in sufficient control. But it is imperative to respect our limits when we communicate them to you. We live in these bodies and we learn, over time, how much they can handle. If the amount we can cope with is less than you think is normal or acceptable, it is not your job to try to force us \u201cout of our shells.\u201d We aren\u2019t in shells. We are practicing self-care. Respect that. Do not force us and do not shame us for having different limits than others. This is a very basic aspect of autism acceptance \u2014 accept our limits and follow our lead in moving past them. We live in a culture that teaches \u201cno limits\u201d but there really are limits. If you would not expect a person born into a biologically male body to become impregnated and carry a child in their non-existent womb, if you would not expect a human body to sprout wings and fly away, then you understand that there really are limits. Don\u2019t ridicule or pressure others whose limits are not what you think they should be. Help us to grow in ways that don\u2019t cause us to fling ourselves to the floor or fall limply passive or scream and hurt ourselves. Help us to grow in ways that are not stressful and damaging. Research has shown that repeated stressful stimulation changes the brain in damaging ways. Do not damage us. Help us to find the ways to stay calm and focused. Help us to test our limits gently and with self-compassion. Respect us and do not seek to overload us \u2014 it is not the way to help us grow. \u201cGet over it,\u201d should never be your motto for us. Please,\u00a0help us learn to protect ourselves and respect our \u201cno.\u201d Slow down. Listen to us. It may be horrible for you to have to be around us when we are overloaded, overstimulated, and overwhelmed, but I assure you it is infinitely more horrible for us to experience overload, overstimulation and overwhelm. Don\u2019t be angry. Don\u2019t blame us. Have compassion for our struggles and respect for everything we do to help ourselves. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/o1.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/22/o-is-for-overloaded-overstimulated-and-overwhelmed/", "title": "O is for Overloaded, Overstimulated, and\u00a0Overwhelmed"},
{"date": "2015/11/24", "body": "Today, November 24th, is N24 Awareness Day, a day set aside for raising awareness of non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Syndrome, a rare and serious circadian rhythm disorder that anyone can have, but that is more common among Autistic people and much, much more common among totally Blind people. This year, we have a theme: Think Zebras. In medical school, doctors are told,\u00a0\u201cif you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras,\u201d meaning think of a common cause for the symptom picture that is presenting, not a rare cause. Rare conditions are meant to be diagnosed through a process of elimination, treating them as if they were common conditions and only looking further if the common treatment does not relieve the symptoms of what was presumed to be a common ailment, then the doctor can venture closer to thinking of zebras. N24, especially in people who are not Blind, is an extreme zebra. We really don\u2019t know how many sighted people have N24, but the National Institute of Health (NIH) has only studied two people with N24. Ever. Today is a day to bring more awareness of N24 to doctors and to the general public. It may be much more common than we realized. I travel around the country and often have occasion to mention N24, especially since  an article about it (featuring me) came out in Scientific American Mind last month . I have been shocked by how many people I have met who have strong signs of N24 or know someone with strong signs of it. It is the same story each time: the thrill of recognition, the surprise to learn that others have it a well, the strength that comes from\u00a0a name, from knowing where to turn for more answers. But I don\u2019t just have a zebra (N24), I also have a giraffe (autism) and the two together get up to quite a bit of mischief. Because I have learned that when a person has a giraffe, their zebra often becomes invisible. So many of the symptoms are dismissed as being just an unusual part of the giraffe. It can be really hard to get serious attention for a horse, even, let alone a zebra. So if you can\u2019t sleep well? Autism. Your stomach hurts? Autism. Your joints are loose and floppy and dislocate easily? Definitely autism. It\u2019s like trying to get treated for depression while elderly. Because of the pre-existing giraffe, the zebra is not merely mistaken for a horse but becomes invisible altogether. So if you or the Autistic you love (or the Autistic you treat as a patient) complains of some health issue, resist the temptation to discount it as part of autism and look more closely. Don\u2019t let the zebras get away!

{"date": "2015/11/10", "body": "The answer should be obvious, right? Never. Never is it okay to chain your child to a bed and leave him alone, crying out for someone to give him water. This is what happened in Australia where  a mother chained her 16-year-old Autistic son to the bed  and left him there alone while she went to the store. If you are upset for that young man, good! You should be! I\u2019m upset on his behalf but I\u2019m also upset and disturbed that, once again, I witness the trend of empathizing with the abusive parent and virtually ignoring everything about the child. The Facebook administrator for Autism Awareness Australia  gave mere lip service  to the suffering of the young man and focused most of the spotlight on the mother: A horrific story\u2026..for everyone involved. Whilst no parent should do this to their child, we can only imagine the desperate situation this woman must have found herself in. \n This is a time for compassion not condemnation. This mother must have felt so isolated, let\u2019s not isolate her further. \n This is yet another case of the appalling lack of services across Australia. Surely we can do better. \n We will be appearing on \u00a0 Sunrise \u00a0 on Channel 7 at 7.15am to discuss. This was the opening volley in what has turned out to be a war of words between, on one side, Autistic adults and parents\u00a0who feel compassion toward their\u00a0Autistic children and, on the other side, parents who probably love their Autistic children very much but feel that it is more important to protect the mother in this case. One can\u2019t help wondering if they feel so strongly about protecting the mother for fear that they, too, will one day be caught chaining their child up\u2026.or worse. Some of the people defending the mother\u2019s actions pointed out that the news article said that the teen had run out of the house naked on several occasions. I am stunned that anyone would consider that a valid defense for chaining a teen to a bed and leaving him alone without water. As activist Kassiane S. of  Radical Neurodivergence Speaking  pointed out in the Facebook discussion, \u201cThere was an Autistic girl in the united states whose parents chained her to a bed, because just like these parents they were abusive wastes of carbon. Her name was Calista Springer. notice the past tense. Calista Springer died in a house fire, because her abusive waste of carbon parents CHAINED HER TO AN EFFING BED and then the house caught fire.\u201d The case of Calista Springer  is a concrete example of why it is so heinous to chain an Autistic teen \u2026 hell, to chain  anyone  \u2026 to a bed and leave them there helpless. Calista paid the ultimate price for the abuse she was put through. Chaining a person to a bed is abuse. Chaining a person to a bed can kill them. If a person dies because they were chained to a bed, the person who locked them there is guilty of manslaughter but should be tried for murder in my opinion. The Springers were charged with felony murder, torture, and first-degree child abuse and convicted of the latter two charges while the murder charge was dropped. Calista was held to her bed in the Springer\u2019s Michigan home with a dog\u2019s choke chain wrapped around her waist and the door to her room was locked with a deadbolt on the outside when the house\u00a0caught on fire from a malfunctioning vacuum cleaner while only Calista and her mother were home. Mrs. Springer escaped the house but left Calista trapped where she died from smoke inhalation on February 27, 2008. Mr. and Mrs. Springer were sentenced to 35 to 65 years and 27 to 65 years respectively. That is how serious the crime of chaining up a child and leaving them helpless is. That is how serious this recent Australian case is. Yet Autistic adults were chided to stop \u201cconducting a court of public opinion\u201d and wait until \u201call the facts are in.\u201d Could there be any facts that justify chaining a teenager to his bed and leaving his alone and thirsty? It frightens me that any parents would feel it is more important to be gentle with a mother who would commit such an act against her own child than it is to be concerned about the well-being and ongoing welfare of the young man to whom such things were done. And to defend these actions by pointing out that the young man ran outside naked? Yes, that is a problem but it is a very small problem compared to the massive human rights violation of unlawful\u00a0imprisonment. Nearly thirty years ago, my friend\u2019s son used to run outside with no clothes on. He did it often. If you turned your back for a moment, he had stripped off his clothes and made a dash for it. I tried to help his mother, but even two adults weren\u2019t enough to keep him clothed. Should his mother have chained him to the bed, vulnerable to dying in a fire? No, of course not! She would have been deeply offended if anyone had seriously suggested it. As a result, her son grew up and now he works as a forest firefighter. Calista Springer perished in flames; the Australian teen was vulnerable to perishing in flames; my friend\u2019s son saves many lives by extinguishing flames. The difference? My\u00a0friend\u2019s son is not Autistic. And you know what? That shouldn\u2019t make one bit of difference! In a truly just world, in a world of autism acceptance and understanding, in a world where people regard all others with respect and afford them the dignity all humans deserve, being Autistic would not be a death sentence. Being Autistic should not mean that other people \u2014 people with children much like you \u2014 are eager to justify your torture and defend your jailer by pointing out that you took off your clothes. We, as a society, pat ourselves on the back for institutional reforms. We talk about the bad old days when mental hospitals put patients in cages and chains. We convince ourselves that these are the good new days when human rights are respected. But opening the institutions to the light of scrutiny and the fresh air of public concern has not stopped the violations. It has only shifted the location of these infringements to the homes and classrooms of some of our\u00a0 society\u2019s most vulnerable members. Autistic children and adults are chained in bedrooms, locked in basements, left to languish and starve to death in attics. Autistic schoolchildren are locked in cupboards, sealed in\u00a0duffel bags, handcuffed by the police for kicking a trash can. Have we made progress since Willowbrook? Yes. But the progress we have made is miniscule in comparison to the distance we still need to cover. We have emptied the snake pit but we have not eradicated the snakes. They have slithered out into every corner of society and we must name and acknowledge abuse and murder when we see it. When we  erase Autistic people from their own murders , we are feeding the snakes. When  teachers can abuse Autistic students without consequences , we are feeding the snakes. When people feel the need to  defend the murderers by saying the victims made them \u201csnap,\u201d  we are feeding the snakes. We do not have the right to pat ourselves on the back for closing down the snake pits when we continue to feed the snakes. So . . . when is it okay to chain your child to a bed? When they are Autistic? No. When they run outside naked a lot? No. When they have strong reactions to things or people in their life that include responses like hitting or biting? No. When you are really tired from/of taking care of them? No. When you don\u2019t have services or support? No. Like I said, it\u2019s obvious \u2026 or at least it should be obvious. It is never okay to chain your child to a bed. There are no facts that could\u00a0be later revealed\u00a0to justify it. There is no exhaustion or lack of services that can rationalize it. It\u2019s just not okay and if\u00a0that wasn\u2019t obvious before, I hope I have helped to make it a little more obvious to you. It is not okay to abuse or kill your children and it is not okay to say that it is \u201cunderstandable\u201d or to erase us from our own stories or to call a murder \u201cunderstandable\u201d or a \u201cmercy killing.\u201d And just in case I was not crystal clear: It is never okay to chain your child to a bed.

{"date": "2015/12/09", "body": "A color photo of Marcus Fiesel. smiling I remember the first time I became aware of it. It\u2019s been nine years now. Marcus would be twelve this year. A neighbor called him \u201can awesome little guy.\u201d He was three years old. He loved  Bob the Builder , flowers, bubbles. His mother was being beaten by her boyfriend and when the police visited, they saw the house was filthy, was infested with fleas, smelled of feces. His mother was so exhausted and depressed that a neighbor saw her openly weeping. Marcus had mysterious cuts and bruises. He was brought home by the police who found him wandering in busy traffic. His mother told the officers that she couldn\u2019t take care of her three children any more. She handed them over to the state. She was trying to do the right thing for her children. She was trying to get them the care they deserved. She was making a smart choice, trying to save them from her abusive boyfriend. Marcus was Autistic. He went to a school for children with disabilities and support needs. He was very active and had been caught crawling out of windows. He was the sort of child that parents call \u201ca handful,\u201d usually as they laugh lovingly . . . if they are not too abused and worn out to be able to laugh any more. His foster parents were poorly chosen. a black and white photo of Marcus Fiesel, smiling. David and Liz Carroll were keeping secrets that would have precluded them from being allowed to serve as foster parents if they were known. David had a medical record that would have excluded him. And the couple had another adult living in the home, Amy Baker. The Carrolls kept her a secret because they feared Lifeway for Youth would not approve of their polyamorous relationship and no longer allow them to be foster parents. In June, David was arrested for domestic violence. The charges were dropped and he never reported the arrest to Lifeway (although he was supposed to.) The relationship between David and Liz was already rocky. David had left Liz because she wanted to be a foster parent and he didn\u2019t. When he returned to Liz, he brought his new girlfriend, Amy, with him and forced Liz to accept an open relationship in exchange for him accepting foster children. Marcus\u2019 mother thought she was doing the right thing when she let go of her children but Marcus ended up going to a home every bit as dangerous and unstable as the one he had left. I would later learn that Marcus was a rare case \u2014 he was not abused and murdered for being Autistic. His foster parents treated all their foster children the same way. Marcus just happened to be the one who died. At the time, I didn\u2019t yet know about the pattern of murders of Autistic children. Marcus was the first child I mourned. He haunts me still. I will always mourn Marcus. David and Liz Carroll used to wrap their foster children up in blankets and duct tape and prop them in a playpen in the closet when they left town. Bradley Leach was in their care at the same time that Marcus Fiesel was. Bradley was wrapped in blankets and tape and left for hours.\u00a0Years later, Bradley has intense nightmares\u00a0in which he relives the trauma. Bradley is ten years old now. It could have been him instead of Marcus. When David and Liz returned home from a weekend out of town, they unwrapped the blankets and found Marcus dead inside. He had overheated\u00a0in the blankets on those hot\u00a0August days. He was gone. I followed the case with anguish. Marcus was Autistic so\u00a0the whole thing really punched me in the gut. That is a metaphor, but it felt like a real punch to me. My friends already knew the pattern. It was new to me. The grief was raw and I had no idea that there was\u00a0more to\u00a0follow. I did not realize that three months later twelve year old Ulysses Stable would have his throat slit by his father. Or that a year later\u00a0two year old Maxwell\u00a0Eyer would be beaten to death by his father. I couldn\u2019t have foreseen teenaged Calista Springer, chained to her bed and left to burn when her family evacuated their burning home. Or another teenager, Courtney Wise, who was starved to death that same month. Or three year old Ethan Scott Kirby beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend, half a year after the deaths of the two girls. Do you feel overwhelmed\u00a0yet by all this violence?\u00a0If you have a hard time reading, know that I am having a harder time writing. Please honor my pain by continuing to read. Please honor these dead children \u2014 and the hundreds more . . . thousands more . . . who were killed. Autistic children. Children like me. Perhaps children like you. Or children like your children. The news stories kept coming and coming. Gassed. Decapitated. Thrown into the sea. Thrown off building ledges. Smothered in blankets. Fed bleach. Buckled into the car and driven into water to drown. And still the murders kept happening, the deaths kept coming, the grief was never-ending. So many lives snuffed out. So many futures ended by the very people who were meant to be helping those futures dawn as fruitfully as possible. I can\u2019t count them. Don\u2019t make me count them. There are just too many. Their lifeless bodies pile up in my thoughts. The world feels a strange and hostile place. With each new murder, I forget the love and acceptance I have encountered\u00a0and curl into a ball under a blanket, weeping for another life gone. I die a little each time one of us is killed. I am diminished, the snuffing of their lives chipping another piece from me until I fear there will be nothing left. I have learned over the years that I must never read the comment sections on these news stories. Inevitably, predictably, the justifications come. People comment on the news stories, saying we should not judge the parents who murder their children. They say we cannot possibly know how difficult it is to raise an Autistic child. \u201cWalk in their shoes,\u201d the commenters say, \u201cand then you will understand.\u201d I do not want to walk in the shoes of murderers. I do not want to ever understand how a parent can take their child\u2019s life. But is anyone willing to walk in our shoes? Does anyone want to think about what it would be like to have a particular neurotype and see people like you being murdered by their own parents? Does anyone want to think about how hard it would be to go through those stretches where a murder of someone like you is reported every month, often more frequently? Can you possibly walk in the shoes we wear when we make the mistake of reading those comment sections only\u00a0 to find dozens of people agreeing that folks like us are such a terrible burden that it\u2019s understandable that our own parents would want to kill us? These are not easy shoes to walk in. They are too small \u2014 they are always too small and they pinch and bind and cut into our feet so deeply that we bleed. The blood runs down inside the shoes where you can\u2019t see it and\u00a0people see the limping and tell us not\u00a0to be such drama queens. How are we supposed to react to\u00a0these murders? What would be the\u00a0acceptable, calm, well-measured response to the killings? How would you respond if you kept seeing a pattern of people like you being killed by the people they should have been able to trust more than anyone in the world? Because it is a pattern. I couldn\u2019t see it all those years ago when I first mourned Marcus. But I\u2019ve watched the subsequent killings, year after year and the patterns become clear. And I die a little bit more each time one of us is killed. -=- This post has been an entry in the  Walk in  Our  Shoes flash blog . \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/marcus.jpg", "https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fiesel.jpg", "http://walkin-our-shoes.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/12/09/i-die-a-little-each-time-one-of-us-is-killed/", "title": "I Die a Little Each Time One of Us Is\u00a0Killed"},

{"date": "2015/12/05", "body": "How do you like these apples?   Just as apples can be different yet all be apples, people can be different yet all be fully human. You can\u2019t support someone\u2019s differences by pretending they don\u2019t exist. You\u2019ve heard someone say this before, right? \u201cOh, well, autism is a spectrum and I think that means that, really, everyone\u2019s a little bit autistic.\u201d Now, I can see why someone might say that. I said something in my first book,  No You Don\u2019t: Essays from an Unstrange Mind , that might seem to support that idea: \u201cAnd if you aren\u2019t Autistic, don\u2019t be surprised if you recognize pieces of yourself in here, too. Because autism is a difference of intensity and frequency but above all, it is a slice of the human condition. If you are human, you will recognize yourself in some of the things I write.\u201d This passage does not say that everyone is a little autistic. It says that Autistics are human beings. As my book says a couple of pages later, we are not \u201ca different species, an alien creature, a changeling, a robot, a freak of nature.\u201d We are human beings and so much of what we experience is fundamental to the human condition. Our autistic nervous system affects how we experience our humanity \u2014 our experience is often heightened in intensity and colored by our different perspectives on life. But it is humanity we are experiencing because we are fully human. The converse of \u201call Autistics are human\u201d\u00a0\u2014 \u201call humans are Autistics\u201d \u2014 is not implied and does not hold. When I say all Autistics are fully human (which, in case you were doubting, we are!) I am in no way implying that all humans are autistic . . . not even a little bit. People see that Autistics are human and that we often experience very intense versions of basic human experiences \u2014 anxiety, for example. We often carry a lot of anxiety and we get stressed out and we meltdown from high stress. Since everyone has felt anxious at some point and everyone has felt overloaded with stress and everyone has \u201clost their shit\u201d at one point or another, some people get mixed up and decide that sharing such a common experience as a stress and anxiety meltdown means that they are \u201ca little autistic\u201d too. But that is not true and it is a diminishing thing to say, particularly to Autistic people. If everyone were a little bit autistic, Salvation Army bell ringers would be illegal. If everyone were a little bit autistic, nothing ever would have strobe lights. Ever. Fluorescent lights, sirens,\u00a0shirt tags, sock seams\u00a0\u2014 these wouldn\u2019t exist. There would be a strong social taboo against dragging a chair across the floor and making that horrible scraping sound with it. Perfume and cologne would be outlawed as hazardous substances and every school and workplace would have a quiet zone for recuperation. How we handled turn-taking would not involve long lines of people standing scrunched up close to each other. In short, if everybody were a little autistic, our whole society would look a great deal different than it does. Experiencing a taste of what we live with does not make someone autistic, not even a little bit. It would be like me saying that, because I sometimes lose the ability to speak and need to type in order to communicate, I completely understand the lived experience of being an Autistic who never communicates with their voice. I can guess at the experience, but I do not live it. I have intermittent mutism and that does not make me \u201ca little non-speaking\u201d any more than someone who hates standing in lines or even someone who lives with daily anxiety is automatically \u201ca little autistic.\u201d The struggles I face are not the struggles\u00a0others who have never spoken experience. The struggles non-autistic people face may have some\u00a0surface similarities to\u00a0struggles Autistics live with but that does not make\u00a0someone \u201ca little bit autistic.\u201d The only way I know to communicate how dismissive it is to say something like \u201cwe are all a little autistic\u201d is to shift the whole idea into the context of some other disabilities: \u201cSometimes I am looking for something and it\u2019s right in front of me and I just kept missing it even when I was looking right at it. We\u2019re all a little Blind, aren\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cThe other day, I was sitting funny and my foot fell asleep. When I stood up, I almost fell down from the pins and needles. I guess we\u2019re all a little paralyzed, huh?\u201d Those are ridiculous things to say. But so often I hear people saying analogous things, and not just about autism. How about, \u201cI have to keep my house so clean and everything put away. I am so OCD!\u201d Or \u201cI am completely addicted to Sudoku puzzles!\u201d Have you heard, \u201cI can\u2019t make up my mind. I just keep going back and forth I\u2019m so schizophrenic.\u201d Or, just as bad, the words are applied to something inanimate: \u201cRain, then sun, then rain, then sun. The weather is so bipolar today!\u201d Don\u2019t do this! When you use someone else\u2019s disability as an adjective for your quirks or otherwise reduce it to a one-dimensional descriptor,\u00a0you are making light of their entire life. And when you say everyone is a little bit autistic, you are trivializing what it actually means to be Autistic. I understand that some people have good intentions. They want to highlight the humanity of Autistics. Be careful \u2014 this is how person-first language arose: through an overzealous urge to bludgeon others with a disabled person\u2019s humanity for fear that no one could see it otherwise. Others may be saying they are a little autistic in order to show solidarity with people they view as \u201cfighting the good fight.\u201d I\u2019d like to show solidarity with People of Color but I would never dream of saying we\u2019re all a little bit Asian or everyone is Native American inside or I\u2019m a little Black. So don\u2019t try to appropriate my disability just to show solidarity with me. I will appreciate your support just fine if you just try to pay attention and be sensitive. You can\u2019t support my differences by pretending they don\u2019t exist. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/apples_small.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/No-You-Dont-Essays-Unstrange/dp/1493575457/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1449331219&sr=8-1&keywords=no+you+don%27t+essays+from+an+unstrange+mind"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/12/05/everyones-a-little-autistic/", "title": "Is Everyone \u201ca Little Autistic\u201d?"},
{"date": "2015/06/24", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . I didn\u2019t quite make it in April. I moved in May. I\u2019m finishing the alphabet in June. The ABCs of Autism Acceptance series has been picked up by  Autonomous Press  and will be published in book form, with additional material, in June 2016. Watch for it! U is for Unity \u201cThe point in history a which we stand is full of promise and danger. The world will either move toward unity and widely shared prosperity \u2013 or it will move apart.\u201d \u2013 Franklin D. Roosevelt Which direction have we moved since Roosevelt\u2019s warning? I look around me and see a world that is struggling to move toward unity but which still has a long way to go toward that goal. Compared with that point in history at which Roosevelt was speaking, we have made much progress in unity among people who are racially diverse, who adhere to diverse religions or no religion, who have different genders. We have passed ADA and work daily to enforce it. We have taken steps to address class and income diversity. Yet we see racial conflict daily and the United States is still\u00a0a place where white people benefit, mostly unconsciously, from institutionalized racism. We still see battles between adherents of different religions, mistrust and discrimination against people based on religion \u2014 particularly discrimination directed toward Muslim Americans, mistrust and fear directed toward atheists (an academic study of public opinion found that more people would trust a known rapist than would trust a known atheist),\u00a0employment glass ceilings for women and those of minority genders, ableism and abuse of disabled people both in institutions and homes, sheltered workshops where disabled people are paid pennies for their work, and the income gap is wider than it is been at any time since the Great Depression. Autism acceptance demands joining the struggle toward unity. When I call for unity, I\u2019m not saying that everyone should be the same as everyone else. I am talking about the kind of unity composer Felix Mendelssohn spoke of when he said, \u201cthe essence of beauty is unity in variety,\u201d or the unity of George Herbert Mead\u2019s \u00a0declaration that \u201csociety is unity in diversity.\u201d I am calling for an understanding of our interconnectedness coupled with a respect for human diversity in all spheres of our being, including, of course, neurodiversity. In my experience, Autistic people and our allies\u00a0are too often isolated from the larger disability community. Ari Ne\u2019eman, co-founder of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) and the first Autistic person to serve on the National Council on Disability spoke of this separation in  a roundtable discussion in 2012 , saying: I think we have a tremendous amount to learn from the larger disability world, and I fear this is something that autism does not do a very good job of. No one who had absorbed the lessons of  Willowbrook  and  Pennhurst  would think it was a good idea to build special \u201cGated Communities\u201d to house autistic adults and others with intellectual and developmental disabilities. No one who knows the history of the  Jerry Lewis telethon  and the objections made by people with muscular dystrophy to being portrayed as pitiful, \u201chalf-people\u201d by its star would ever conceive of something like the \u201c I Am Autism \u201d  video . No one who knew the names  Ed Roberts ,  Judy Heumann  or  Justin Dart  and the history of all they accomplished for people with disabilities would ever doubt the meaning and importance of self-advocacy by and for us, instead of on our behalf. Yet, these are not things we think about or have even heard of in the autism world. Things are slowly changing since Ne\u2019eman made these observations, but still so much of the world of autism is isolated. Mainly it is Autistic academics and activists who are venturing beyond our borders, but the larger Autistic/autism community is opening to wider unity all the time.\u00a0We are forging close alliance with others with developmental disabilities, particularly\u00a0people with Down Syndrome and Cerebral Palsy, but our connections don\u2019t stop there. The larger disability community has battled an internal schism for years and the time is ripe for Autistic activists to join the fight against internal ableism. For so many years, many of\u00a0those with mobility disabilities and other physical disabilities have said things like, \u201cmy body is impaired but my mind is strong and good.\u201d This is a very understandable thing to say, but it created a climate unfriendly to those with neurological and psychiatric disabilities. The larger disability community is strongly challenging those attitudes now, though, and as a result there is increased unity among people of diverse disabilities, increased solidarity, increased ability for all of us to work together for the rights of all of us. It is time\u00a0for Autistics and our friends, families, and allies to join the larger fight. It is time for us to turn our attention outward and work to help others as we allow them to help us. We are all connected through the shared experience of disability. Our disabilities are different \u2014 just as each Autistic person has their own, individual experience of autism \u2014 but the stigma and social barriers we face are strikingly similar. Autistic people and the rest of the disability community have much to offer each other. But\u00a0I think many Autistic people and their supporters shy away from working within the larger disability community because of fear of that word, \u201cdisabled.\u201d\u00a0That fear\u00a0points to an internal division within the Autistic/autism community\u00a0that needs to be mended as well. Within the Autistic community, there is a schism not terribly different from the brain/body schism the larger disability community is working to heal. Within our community, there are those who insist on only portraying autism\u2019s strengths, who fear words like \u201cdisability,\u201d who cling to the label \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d\u00a0which is no longer a diagnostic category and is in the process of fading into the past as a piece of medical and autistic history, not unlike other terms such as \u201c dementia praecox ,\u201d \u201cmanic-depression,\u201d or \u201c sexual inversion .\u201d Now that all forms of autism have been united under a single label, the main purpose (other than historical) of the word \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d is to draw an \u201cus vs. them\u201d distinction within the neurotribe of autism. It is a \u201c dog whistle \u201d that\u00a0speaks a code of \u201c functioning labels \u201d and \u00a0 supremacy . It is a way to say, \u201cdon\u2019t mistake us for those  people who wear adult diapers and a head-restraining device .\u201d It is a way to maintain division within the community. And division will not move us closer to unity. And Autism Acceptance demands a call for unity. Autistic people who say \u201cdifferent, not disabled\u201d need to stop and think about the message they are putting forth. Because of their fear of being considered less-than, because of their fear of taking on the stigma\u00a0fellow Autistics \u00a0live with every day, because they are hovering at the fringes of activism and advocacy, trying to \u201c pass \u201d as non-autistic and focus only on Autistic strengths while often diminishing or dismissing Autistic needs, they are actively working to increase division in the community. Those who don\u2019t have the privilege of passing, even for a short time, are left out of their description of Autism. In insisting that autism is not a disability, they drain the compassion of those who would otherwise want to assist and accommodate us. In insisting that autism is not a disability, they help make the overall movement of autistic advocacy and self-advocacy look like a game or a collection of lies \u2014 anyone who knows or is an Autistic person who cannot pass and requires accommodation can see right through that game and can see the harm it does to the larger Autistic community. Autism is a difference AND a disability. Disability does not mean \u201cincapable of anything.\u201d It does not mean \u201cless than.\u201d It simply means having some condition that contributes to some limits in a person, both inherently (such as not being able to speak or not being able to recognize faces) and socially (such as being passed over for jobs because of a cultural lack of belief in the competence of a particular category of people.) When Autistic people face challenges such as difficulty in face-to-face conversations and social limitations such as only 15% of people diagnosed Autistic having full-time jobs at the level of which they are capable of working, autism is undeniably a disability. Arguing against the disability of autism is arguing against a united\u00a0voice that advocates for the needs of all of us. Arguing against autism as a disability is arguing against our unity. It is not just unity within and unity with the larger disability community that we are called to support. We need to\u00a0seek unity with all marginalized people, all people who face oppression. We need to seek unity\u00a0with People of Color, with people of all genders, especially transgender, non-gender, intersex, and other minority gendered people. We need to seek unity with everyone who suffers discrimination for who they are. It is in this way that we fight against a society that holds up a monolithic notion of \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d that is oppressive to everyone, but especially to those who fall outside society\u2019s\u00a0\u201ccircle of virtue.\u201d It is only through seeking unity that we can protect other vulnerable and marginalized people and, in fairness,\u00a0hope for them to protect us. Many people in our own neurotribe are multiply marginalized, so\u00a0supporting the rights and needs of\u00a0impoverished people, People of Color, people of diverse gender expressions and so forth, we are supporting and protecting our own Autistic siblings as well as reaching out to the larger community and working toward a realization of that interconnectedness\u00a0all humans\u00a0share. Seeking unity with all people helps build that just and prosperous society Roosevelt dreamed of. Seeking unity makes us all part of the solution, not part of the problem. It is worth paraphrasing Martin Niem\u00f6ller\u2019s famous poem about Word War II Germany and persecution under the Nazi regime: First they oppressed the\u00a0People of Color \nand I did not speak out \nbecause I was white. \nThen they oppressed the Transgender People \nand I did not speak out \nbecause I identify with the sex I was assigned at birth. \nThen they\u00a0oppressed the Psychiatrically Disabled \nand I did not speak out \nbecause I was not diagnosed with a mental illness. \nThen they oppressed those Autistics Who Needed Round the Clock Care \nand I did not speak out \nbecause I was able to live independently. \nThen they came for me \nand there was no one left \nto speak out for me. This is our lesson, this is our mission, this is our clarion call: unity. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/u.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autpress.com/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-mnookin/autism-roundtable-crossdi_b_1232699.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook_State_School", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennhurst_State_School_and_Hospital", "http://www.abilitymagazine.com/news_jerrylewis.html", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/2009/09/horrific-autism-speaks-i-am-autism-ad-transcript/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mycxSJ3-_Q", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Roberts_(activist)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Heumann", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Whitlock_Dart,_Jr.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia_praecox", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_inversion_(sexology)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics", "http://www.snagglebox.com/article/autism-functioning", "http://www.autistichoya.com/2013/05/what-is-shiny-aspie.html", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123527833", "http://musingsofanaspie.com/2013/10/24/the-myth-of-passing/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/06/24/u-is-for-unity/", "title": "U is for\u00a0Unity"},
{"date": "2015/09/03", "body": "We were discussing early diagnosis/identification and early intervention/therapy over on the Facebook forum for this blog and a reader, Megen Porter, made a deeply insightful comment: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like early identification is important so you can intervene on yourself as a parent.\u201d What a brilliant way to put it, Megen! Thank you! The standard meaning of the phrase early intervention is to jump in with hours and hours of therapy to try to get an Autistic child to be \u201cindistinguishable from peers\u201d as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. This means extinguishing Autistic behaviors, even absolutely harmless ones that are beneficial to the Autistic person but embarrassing or off-putting to onlookers, the classic example of which is hand flapping. But Megen put a lovely spin on things by pointing out that it is the parents who need the early intervention. When autism can be recognized and identified early, the parents have a golden opportunity to begin working to understand the child they actually have. They can now learn about autistic neurology and stop interpreting their child through the wrong lens. Their child will be happier, healthier, and feel more love and acceptance for who they truly are once their parents\u2019 fear and confusion has cleared away. Parents can avoid shaming their child for being different and can come to understand that their job is not to try to shape their child like a lump of wet clay but to celebrate who their child is and work from there. Of course there will be some kinds of\u00a0specialized education. All children get education at home and at school, and identifying children who are neurodivergent in various ways means that those children can get more targeted education that works with their brain, not against it. Autistic children might need extra mentoring in coping with processing sensory input. All children need to learn how to self-soothe \u2014 none are born knowing that. Autistic children often need extra mentoring in that area. Later, it might be extra important that an Autistic child gets academic directions in a written form in addition to or instead of a spoken form. Or an Autistic child might need help with finding a method of communication that works well for that child since speaking isn\u2019t always the optimal choice. These kinds of interventions are very important. But the most important early intervention \u2014 and the earlier the better! \u2014 is for the parents. Let\u2019s all work to help parents of newly-identified Autistic children with their early intervention program. What can you do to help? When someone tells you that their child was just diagnosed, don\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Say, \u201cthat\u2019s great! Now you know what is going on. I\u2019m so glad you have that information.\u201d If you\u2019re a hugger and they\u2019re a hug-liking person, add a hug in there. Be friendly, encouraging, upbeat. If they are telling you this because your child is Autistic, there are other things you can say as well. Talk about the ways that it was helpful to learn about your child\u2019s autism. The newly-aware parent is probably feeling overwhelmed with all kinds of emotions. Emphasize what is good about getting the diagnosis to help that parent get a good start on this new phase of their life. Remind them that their child is still the beautiful, magical, wonderful child he or she has always been. Let them know that the only thing that has changed is that there is more information now, to help them understand their child better. We should all be as supportive of one another as we possibly can \u2014 parents, children, adult Autistics, professionals, everyone. But let\u2019s all try to be extra supportive of the newly-aware parents among us. If you are the parent of Autistic children, don\u2019t white-wash your life but do spend a little extra time talking about the good things. Spend a little extra time talking about great solutions you found that made your child\u2019s life better and, by extension, the whole family happier. Remind the newly-aware parent that *all* parenting is challenging. This is especially important, because parents whose children are not Autistic cannot say something like that. A parent who does not have an Autistic child is offensive if they remind others that all parenting is challenging because they are not speaking from the same set of experiences, but if you are parenting an Autistic child, please do take the time, when it feels appropriate to you, to remind others that all parenting is challenging because it help to put the struggles of families with Autistic members into perspective. Too often I see *everything* blamed on autism. Other families say \u201cit is hard to transition from one grade of school to the next,\u201d or \u201cthat first day of kindergarten is so hard because so many kids get upset when they realize they\u2019ve been left there without mom and dad,\u201d or \u201cthe hormonal changes of pre-teen and teen years can be so chaotic!\u201d Remind that newly-aware parent that they get to say those things, too. Of course it is different with autism because we Autistic people experience and think about the world differently, so we add our own individual flavor to every challenge of growing up and living life. But we are not off in our own world; we live in the same world as the rest of you. We are struggling with the same things everyone is: learning, growing, changing. Our life stories are unique, but just because everything we experience and do is \u201cautism colored\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that everything about our lives that is challenging for those around us is \u201call the fault of autism.\u201d\u00a0Gently help\u00a0that newly-aware parent to realize that blaming autism for everything difficult is the same as saying, \u201cmy child\u2019s worldview sucks.\u201d Gently remind them that children are not very good at separating the ideas of \u201cmy brain is different and that is a horrible thing\u201d from \u201cI am a horrible thing.\u201d And, honestly, I think the kids got it right. Any time I try to set my autism on one side and heap all my troubles over there with it and set \u201cme\u201d on the other side and heap all my joys there, I get a massive cognitive dissonance headache. It can take a long time to get there, but help those newly-aware parents learn that autism is not something their child has; it is something their child is. Help them shift their perspective so that they don\u2019t fall into the trap of hating autism and loving their child because that\u2019s a Gordion knot that gets harder to cut through the longer it is being knotted together. If you try to stick a sword into that, you\u2019re inevitably going to cut your child because it is impossible to find the place where autism ends and the child begins. Because that place isn\u2019t there. There is a reason the medical books call autism \u201cpervasive.\u201d It is in every part of a person \u2014 there is no part of me that is not Autistic. My brain is an autistic brain and everything I know, see, taste, hear, think, remember, hope, wish, feel, and do comes from that autistic brain. Help the newly-aware parents understand that if they love their child (and you know they do!) they are loving an Autistic child and that\u2019s a good thing. Early intervention is so crucial for future success. The faster we can get to those newly-aware parents, the more quickly we can soothe their fears, lead them to acceptance, help them to see the joy that they are inheriting from their children every day. Sure, it will be hard \u2014 all parenting is. Yes, there are things they can do to increase their child\u2019s chances of success. But they need to be canny and learn as quickly as possible that not every professional has their child\u2019s best interests at heart. They can be choosy and only take those therapies and lessons that help their child to grow strong and healthy. If we can get to those newly-aware parents as quickly as possible, we can save their\u00a0children a lot of suffering and the parents a lot of\u00a0grief and guilt. As Megen said, \u201cearly identification is so important!\u201d And it is because we have the best chance\u00a0when we can all help newly-aware parents with the early intervention they need so badly in order to thrive and to help their children thrive.

Yes, there have been abusive Autistic people and Autistic people who have a difficult time controlling anger.\u00a0 But\u00a0violence is\u00a0less common among us and we are so vulnerable and, in some cases, so na\u00efve that we can be easy targets for predators and abusers. In fact, I\u2019ve discovered that there are some predators who single us out intentionally, because we are Autistic and thus easier to manipulate, more likely to have a weak personal support system to protect us, and more likely to have gone through compliance training that teaches us to accept abuse as a\u00a0normal part of life. Now, I know I\u2019ve already talked about bullying, but when I talk about violence and victimization, I\u2019m talking about something more sinister. There are predators out there who seek out disabled children and adults specifically.  A free booklet  discusses \u201cdisability trolls\u201d\u2013 people who have sexual fetishes for disabilities and make fake profiles to try to get close to people in wheelchairs, amputees, and other physically disabled people. What makes things less clear when it comes to Autism is that there are some predators who specifically seek out Autistic people and others who seem to have a radar for vulnerability so a large percentage of the people they prey on are Autistic, but more as a coincidence, due to Autistic people having a tendency toward more vulnerability than the general population. A study by Sobsey and Doe  (1991)\u00a0 found that not only are people with disabilities sexually abused more often than the general population, but that the abuse tends to be repeated again and again, chronically. Sobsey and Doe found that 49% of\u00a0people with intellectual disability will experience sexual abuse or assault 10 or more times in their lives.  Sullivan and Knutson  (2000) found that people who are multiply disabled (for example autism and epilepsy, autism and intellectual disability, autism and psychiatric disability, etc.) are at greater risk of sexual assault and abuse. The types of disabilities most likely to be abused, according to Sullivan and Knutson, were those with intellectual disabilities, communication disabilities, and behavioral disabilities \u2014 all three are labels that are frequently attached to Autistic people. In short, disabled people are well over three times more likely to be assaulted and abused than the general population and Autistic people, particularly Autistic women,\u00a0are among the most assaulted and abused of all disabled people. Sobsey and Doe found that 83% of their study sample of women with developmental disabilities\u00a0had\u00a0been\u00a0sexually assaulted at least once in their lives. And the victimization is not just sexual. A 1992  study  of\u00a0disabled people using a third-party payment system (disability benefits being sent to someone other than the disabled person themselves, typically a caregiver or financial manager) and found that 20% of the third-party recipients were victims of crimes ranging from larceny to murder and\u00a0\u201cslave trading,\u201d a practice where disabled people are bought and sold from payee to payee, getting little or no actual care and being valued only for their benefit check.\u00a0 Additionally, the victimization of disabled people is greatly downplayed. It is often reported in the system and in the media as \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d\u00a0 instead of as the actual crimes that occurred, such as rape, assault, or murder. Crimes against disabled people often go unreported altogether due to being committed by people upon whom the disabled person depends for survival. As bad as the situation appears \u2014 and the appearance is quite bad enough \u2014 the reality is much, much worse. Those who have read my previous book,  No You Don\u2019t , or the  title essay  from the collection know that I have had a long history of victimization spanning decades. At this point in my life, I have learned most of the ways predators enlist victims and am, thankfully, able to avoid the kinds of abuse and exploitation that marred my childhood, teens, twenties, thirties, and parts of my forties. But I am still vulnerable and I had a run-in with a predator just a few years ago.\u00a0 I am skeptical, a quick learner, and a reflective thinker, but I have some difficulty with generalizing knowledge. My classic example from my life is that I have known for many years not to accept a package from a stranger in an airport or bus station but I didn\u2019t generalize that to \u201cdon\u2019t take a package from a stranger anywhere\u201d and I didn\u2019t realize a classmate in my university class counted as a stranger \u2014 after all, I saw her in class three times a week, even though I never spoke with her, so how could she be a stranger? But I accepted a mystery gift she gave me, claiming it was from someone else I had never heard of before. It turned out to be a humiliating joke that I opened in front of everyone and immediately regretted. I think this is one factor in the repeated victimization of those of us with developmental disabilities. While difficulty generalizing situations is not universal among us, I\u2019m not the only one who struggles with it. It makes it harder for me to learn how to avoid being victimized because if the approach happens in a different way or a different place or even something simple is changed like the gender or age of the predator I can fall for the same thing all over again, feeling foolish afterward when I make the connection and realize that I missed seeing something that I had already learned before. There are many other factors to re-victimization. A few of them include: not being able to figure out how to break out of a repeated \u201cscript,\u201d being too afraid of offending or making someone angry to resist, lacking strong boundaries (often due to the abuses of ABA \u201ctherapy\u201d), being lonely and having little social experience to raise skepticism about offers of instant friendship. My predator from a few years ago was hard for me to spot, in part because I have grown accustomed to predators who want sexual attention from me or who want my money (meager though it is.) This predator was harder to spot because they were looking for something else. I\u2019m not entirely sure what they were seeking, but it involved attention, validation, admiration, and control over others. When they made their first overture to me \u2014 offering to mail me a present \u2014 they seemed safe and trustworthy because we had 62 mutual friends on Facebook. The huge overlap of our friends\u2019 lists made them seem legitimate and a trusted member of the autism/Autistic community. I had never noticed the person before so I don\u2019t know how long they had been in community, but it is easy to slip in to the Autistic community on Facebook since many people follow the same policy of accepting a friend request from anyone who has at least a few friends in common. (I no longer follow that practice, having been burned by my predator. I now will not accept a friend request from someone unless I have at least talked to them a little. And I periodically \u201cpurge\u201d my friend list of the people who \u201cfriended and forgot\u201d because they rapidly become an unknown stranger on my friend list if they don\u2019t interact with me.) It took me a while to figure out what I had gotten into with this predator. They seemed so safe in the beginning. But sending me a gift meant they knew my address. They quickly wormed their way into my life and started trying to plan it for me. It was all \u201cdangling carrots\u201d sort of control \u2014 every time they learned about something I wanted or wanted to do, they would say they could help me get or do it and then start manipulating me with all their offers of presents and \u201chelp.\u201d Before I knew it, I was caught up in a big plan that included coming out to where I lived and throwing all my stuff into a moving van and taking me to live with them and their spouse (who they spoke disparagingly of and who they also manipulated and controlled.) They had high demands of my time and energy. They wanted me to video Skype with them for hours every day. I protested, because it was taking up all my time and energy and leaving nothing for me. I couldn\u2019t get housework done, I couldn\u2019t write, I couldn\u2019t just rest and stare at the wall \u2014 a favorite pastime of mine, similar to running a defrag program on a hard drive. I became frazzled and stressed. They wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. They grew more and more demanding. Just as I was about to pull away from them, they started saying they thought they might be Autistic, too. They wanted my help and advice. They pulled me back in. Their demands got larger \u2014 I was going to move in with them and go into business with them. I could see that they wanted me because a diagnosed Autistic person would add an air of legitimacy to their business. They were using me as an object, not treating me as a human being. It all came to a head when my electricity got shut off temporarily due to a clerical error and a lost payment. I was relaxing in the dark. I was stressed. I was naked. There was a knock at the door. I ignored it, as I always do when I\u2019m not expecting anyone. They said they were the police and I froze in fear. They broke down my door \u2014 it turned out that my predator had gotten frustrated at not being able to reach me for a Skype visit and sent the police to my door for a welfare check. I don\u2019t want to go into all the results of that welfare check, but I will leave you to just imagine how it went. How would you expect the police to respond when sent to an apartment by a frantic sounding person telling all sorts of wild tales? What would you expect their response to be when they knocked, heard movement, broke the door, and found a naked person, incapable of speech, sitting in the darkness in an apartment with no utilities? It did not go well. That gave me the courage to break off the interactions with my predator. I was fortunate that the victimization never went past the level of emotional manipulation, but if they had swooped me up and moved me to their home, who knows what would have happened once I was isolated and under their control? And \u201cswoop\u201d is the right word here \u2014 the entire \u201crelationship\u201d went from innocent-seeming gift to police breaking down my door in less than two weeks. It all moved so fast and was so overwhelming. I was always several steps behind in understanding what was happening. They took advantage of my Autistic traits and used them against me to corral me into a completely untenable position. Autism acceptance means presuming competence, but it also means building a community that helps Autistic people defend ourselves against predators. The standard education children get about \u201cstranger danger\u201d is not enough. So many times, the predator is not a stranger or they are very skilled at convincing their target that they are not really a  stranger . Predators try to overwhelm us by moving things along fast. Autistic people need to know that it\u2019s okay to slow down, to take our time, to think things through. People who demand instant answers and instant actions from us should be questioned. If they are truly on our side, they will accept a slow response. Demanding that we keep up their fast pace is a \u201cred flag\u201d that can help warn us that a person might not have our best interests at heart. We need to learn how to locate mentors in the community who we can turn to for sound advice. A mentor could be a parent, a teacher, a trusted therapist, a friend \u2014 anyone who has a proven track record of helping us to make decisions that are good for us and come from our own choices. If a new person comes into your life and wants your address, your phone number, wants to make grand plans to uproot your life, wants to push you to a more intimate friendship than you are ready for \u2014 anything that makes you uncomfortable \u2014 it is good to be able to talk it through with a mentor. It can be a dangerous world and we Autistics are vulnerable. There are people who know that and seek us out to use, exploit, manipulate, and more. We need to be careful and autism acceptance recognizes the risks while working to protect our autonomy and dignity. A person can be competent yet operating under incomplete information. Presume competence, but help us steer a safe course when we ask for advice. Help us steer our own course \u2014 don\u2019t choose for us. But help us see the potential obstacles and\u00a0learn how to avoid them. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/v.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autpress.com/", "http://www.not-me.org/creepyisascreepydoes.pdf", "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01102395#page-1", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11075694", "http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/28/6/655.short", "http://www.amazon.com/No-You-Dont-Essays-Unstrange/dp/1493575457/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1439490925&sr=8-5&keywords=no+you+don%27t"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/v-is-for-vulnerable-to-violence-and-victimization/", "title": "V is for Vulnerable to Violence and\u00a0Victimization"},
{"date": "2015/09/14", "body": "That subject line got your attention, didn\u2019t it? Nope, I\u2019m not talking about being Autistic. Autism isn\u2019t a disease and what\u2019s depressing and socially-isolating about it is the way others choose to react to it. I\u2019m just fine with being Autistic. But if you want to cure something, could you cure celiac disease? Now that\u2019s a depressing and socially-isolating disease. If you could cure my hypernychthemeral syndrome while you\u2019re at it, that would be just grand. See, I\u2019m staying with a very lovely family and I\u2019ve barely had any human contact in days (And I want to make it clear that none of my current struggles are their fault! They have been nothing but wonderful, gracious, loving, generous\u00a0hosts!!) \u00a0because whenever I live indoors, the hypernychthemeral syndrome (also known as Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Syndrome or Non-24) kicks in and sets my sleep-wake times spinning around the clock. I showed up on my typical outdoor schedule: sleeping around midnight and waking before nine. That\u2019s what my body naturally does when I live outside and stay away from light other than the sun or some firelight in the evening. It\u2019s not a perfect schedule, but it\u2019s stable and I\u2019m very grateful that sleeping outdoors lets me stay in one spot on the clock like that. Once I\u2019m sleeping inside a house, with artificial lights in the evenings and walls between me and the sun, that little timekeeper inside my brain, the  suprachiasmatic nucleus  (SCN) doesn\u2019t get enough of the right signals to function properly and my entire body becomes desynchronized, with all my body systems getting more and more separated from the others. Think of it as lots of clocks\u00a0\u2013 in my pancreas, my heart\u2019s timing mechanisms, my blood cells, everywhere in my body \u2013 that aren\u2019t so great at keeping time themselves so they regularly\u00a0talk to my SCN to \u00a0make the little tweaks to their own clocks so we\u2019re all running on the same schedule.\u00a0 When I\u2019m living indoors and the light signals are confusing my brain, the SCN doesn\u2019t know what to tell all those other body clocks\u00a0anymore and they all get farther and farther off course until something breaks. The\u00a0thing that breaks\u00a0is different for different people with Non-24. For me, it\u2019s my metabolism that breaks first. I have diabetes that lays dormant when my SCN is getting the right signals to keep everyone\u2019s clocks properly set and rages out of control when I get desynchronized. I carry around insulin but only need to use it when I\u2019m living indoors. That\u2019s pretty socially isolating. I have to choose between living outdoors with a small\u00a0pool of people to choose from (Sam\u2019s Club has estimated that a million Americans live full-time in RVs. Those folks, plus the short-term friendships of recreational part-time campers, are my community as a person who has to live outdoors to preserve my circadian rhythms and health) or living indoors with rapidly-declining health in order to be close to the people I had already chosen and the people who have chosen me. I\u2019m the only Autistic person I know who currently lives outdoors, so I get kind of lonely out there for more\u00a0people who are\u00a0more like me. And, as it is, I\u2019m indoors and socially isolated right now anyway because the Non-24 currently has me going to sleep at seven am and waking at one pm \u2014 off-kilter and not even fully rested. I am groggy from sleep as the family comes home from their day\u2019s activities and by the time I\u2019m fully awake and really ready to socialize, they\u2019re all heading off to bed. At least I\u2019m spending\u00a0those long and empty\u00a0nights quietly finishing the draft of my upcoming book,\u00a0 The ABCs of Autism Acceptance , so that\u2019s a good thing. And, fortunately, I\u2019m not stuck at this point on the clock. My body will continue to drift later and later. I have estimated that I should be sleeping around five pm and waking around midnight when AutCom comes around. That\u2019s good, because I have lots of work to do there and I will be awake during the time\u00a0work needs to be done. But it\u2019s still socially isolating because I will be falling asleep when the socializing starts and waking up to wander around, ghost-like and alone, in the small hours of the morning. Depressing and socially isolating, that\u2019s life with Non-24. And life with celiac is no better. I spent the last few days feeling pretty awful. I thought I was being so good about avoiding gluten, but I learned something new about celiac this week. I\u2019ve been doing food solo for years, so it was pretty easy to avoid getting \u201cglutened\u201d accidentally. I run a tight ship and I know what my body can handle. There are even some foods that are officially gluten-free but still give me nasty symptoms as if they did have gluten in them (I\u2019m talking about you, Spam!) and I\u2019ve learned to avoid those, too. It was so wonderful to join in family meals here. Having eaten alone for so long, I didn\u2019t really understand all that literary and religious symbolism about sharing food. It all sounds nice. I know how to draw upon the metaphors in my writing. But I didn\u2019t really feel emotionally connected to those ideas until I started on this nomadic journey back in May and began to have opportunities to \u201cbreak bread\u201d (so to speak) with others. My celiac didn\u2019t flare up at my cousin\u2019s houses or my parents\u2019 house. Others in the family are gluten-free, too, so there\u2019s a lot of familiarity among family members with the way I need to eat. But gluten-free eating is a new thing to the wonderful folks I\u2019ve been staying with. They\u2019ve really worked hard to learn what I can eat and cannot eat and I love them for that. But I got sick anyway and had to do some googling. I learned that I can\u2019t eat from cast iron or Teflon-coated pans that have cooked gluten-containing foods. I learned that a grill doesn\u2019t burn off the gluten stuck to it. And, most depressing of all, I learned that if someone dips mayonnaise out of a jar, spreads it on bread, then dips the knife back in, the whole jar is no longer safe for me to eat from. I\u2019m not eating with the family any more. That makes me sad. And all that celiac anxiety is set on high right now. After I get gluten-sick, I get really weird about food. \u201cFood is dangerous. Food is toxic,\u201d my thoughts roll around, obsessing about food and dishes and utensils and crumbs in the bottom of silverware drawers and who might have touched what with what. I have food-related nightmares. I alternate between not eating until I get light-headed and rummaging around for something sealed and safe. I miss family meals together. I am feeling depressed and socially isolated. And all my stomach-soothing medications are gone, so I\u2019m doubly afraid to eat until I can go to the store again because I have run out of the stuff I need to help me out if I get sick again. Depressing and socially isolating. The next time you feel tempted to pity me or someone else because we are Autistic, remember this: being Autistic makes me happy. Having celiac and Non-24 makes me feel depressed and socially isolated. There are a lot of people out there who try to scare you by describing autism as some sort of life-ending tragedy. Autism Speaks is the biggest culprit but they are by far not the only ones out there talking about us as if we are empty shells of depressing nothingness. I am here to tell you that there are tragically depressing diseases that need cures and autism is not one of them. If you want to cure something, find the cure for celiac so I can enjoy emotionally bonding food sharing with others without fear and the very real risk of illness. If you want to cure something so you can improve the quality of people\u2019s lives and help them to be better able to connect with others and be self-supporting, cure Non-24. Non-24 and celiac are huge burdens in my life. I can\u2019t feel safe eating with others. I can only remain healthy if I sleep outdoors for the rest of my life. If you want to cure something, I\u2019d be very grateful if you started with those. But if you really want to help Autistic people, we don\u2019t need a cure. We need supports. We need accommodations. We need acceptance. We have a lot of unmet needs and a \u201ccure\u201d for the way our brains are wired is not one of them. The only way you can \u201ccure\u201d the way a person\u2019s brain is wired is to get rid of the person. That\u2019s not something I want to happen to me or to any of the Autistic people I love. Understand us. Help us the ways we need to be helped. Ask us what we want, what we dream of, what we hope for, what our goals are. Don\u2019t rush in to \u201chelp\u201d without knowing what we want and need. It\u2019s not helpful to force things on us that are contrary to our own best interests. Don\u2019t assume you know what our best interests are. Outside of things like not letting people run into busy traffic or stick forks in the electrical outlets, \u201cfor your own good,\u201d is not for you to decide. So, yeah, I have two depressing and socially isolating diseases and neither of them is autism. The things I really need help with \u00a0\u2014 food and sleep \u2014 aren\u2019t\u00a0in any way connected to the notion of \u201ccuring\u201d autism.\u00a0So listen to the Autistics around you as they communicate their needs,\u00a0whether\u00a0with\u00a0words or\u00a0in some other language. Don\u2019t assume you know what we need. Help us meet\u00a0our goals, not yours.

{"date": "2015/11/01", "body": "It\u2019s the first of November again and that means it\u2019s Autistics Speaking Day. Autistics Speaking Day has been happening every year since 2010, steadily gaining attention and this year I heard a criticism leveled at the annual event. A parent of an Autistic child declared that the event is mis-named and should be called \u201cAutistics Speaking for Themselves Day\u201d because she wanted to make it clear that those of us who are able to write about our Autistic lives and experiences are not like her child. She presumes that her child will not grow up to be someone who can write about their life and apparently presumes that none of us were ever like her child when we were very young, too. I\u2019ve  written before  about the insult and injury of assuming that adults with various competencies are not in any way similar to children still learning basic skills. Today I want to talk about who I write for. It\u2019s an important question \u2014 the mother who complained about Autistics Speaking Day wants to make sure everyone knows that we are not speaking for her child. I do speak for her child. I speak for all the children. Let me unpack that a little bit. Of course I speak for myself. We all can only speak for ourselves and I am careful to try to remind readers that I am giving my perspective, based mostly on my experience, though also seasoned with the experiences others have shared with me as well as the scientific research I read. My words are drawn from many sources but in the end it is only my own lived experience of my own Autistic self that I can ever share as a true insider. I can never be inside someone else\u2019s Autistic self. I sometimes gripe about the title of the book  Inside Asperger\u2019s Looking Out  because the author is not Autistic and cannot write about Asperger\u2019s from the inside. Hoopmann writes, \u201cNot having Asperger\u2019s, this book took a lot of research and I listened to hours and hours of Youtube videos by Aspies, and joined online Asperger sites to get their insights.\u201d\u00a0While I admire her industry and dedication, the author had no right to title her book \u201cInside Asperger\u2019s.\u201d That is a type of \u201cspeaking for\u201d others that I find offensive. For example, while I strive to support the needs and issues of Autistic People of Color I would never say I have the inside story about being Autistic and a Person of Color. So what do I mean when I say I am speaking for others? There are different definitions of the phrase \u201cspeak for.\u201d One definition, according to the American Heritage Dictionary, is \u201cto serve as an official delegate of; represent.\u201d I can\u2019t do that. I cannot presume to be any sort of official delegate for others, particularly children I have never met. And there is no way that I speak in any official capacity for People of Color when I try to draw attention to issues they have already declared to be important to them. When I say I speak for someone else, I mean I am trying to help them achieve their own goals and trying to avoid talking over them. I am trying to help amplify their voice. In some cases, I\u2019m trying to make people aware that they even have a voice and should be listened to. I am not speaking \u201cfor\u201d others, meaning \u201cin place of\u201d others \u2014 as in \u201capplesauce can be substituted\u00a0 for  eggs in your baking.\u201d I cannot speak for children that way and neither can their parents, their doctors, or their teachers. I am not a substitute or proxy for anyone. I am speaking \u201cfor\u201d others, meaning \u201con behalf of\u201d others \u2014 as in \u201cmany\u00a0Autistic children don\u2019t have the language skills yet to tell you what they are experiencing, so I am telling you what my childhood felt like. I did not have the language skills to explain these things when I was a child, either, so I am telling them now as memories,\u00a0 for  those who are currently experiencing similar things in their lives.\u201d I am not inside their heads. I cannot know exactly what they are thinking and feeling. But I can explain how I felt and maybe it will help family to get a possible glimpse inside what a child\u2019s inner life  might  look like. I speak for the Autistic children. I am speaking \u201cfor\u201d others, meaning \u201cin favor of \u201d others. I speak for truth. I speak for beauty. I speak for my fellow Autistics. I promote them to others as valuable, worthy human beings. I am in favor of them being respected and treated with dignity. I support them. I try to encourage them. I speak  for  them, every chance I get. I chastise those who speak against them. I speak for the Autistic children. I am speaking \u201cfor\u201d others, meaning \u201ctoward a recipient or beneficiary of an action.\u201d I speak for others who need to hear the message of their beauty. I speak for others who need to be reminded of their deep, intrinsic value. I bring inspiration and validation to people. It is them I am speaking  for . I speak for the Autistic children. I am saddened when a parent seems to feel threatened by my speaking for their child. Don\u2019t they want another ally on their child\u2019s side (and, by extension, on the parent\u2019s side as well)? Don\u2019t they want someone from the same neurominority as their child to help them gain more insight into what it is like to live a life \u201cdifferently brained\u201d? Couldn\u2019t I help them avoid my\u00a0pitfalls by sharing them? Can\u2019t I\u00a0help give parents insight into\u00a0one of the many ways a child can turn out after being someone who crawled on the floor and hid under tables and bit others and generally made their teachers dream of retirement?\u00a0I have so much to offer and, if nothing else at all, I am an adult who will not judge a parent unworthy if their child is Autistic . . . because I am not judging the child as unworthy, either! I am an adult who cares, who has a special fondness for your child before ever having met them. I am an adult who wants to help. I am an adult who wants to be a supportive force for good in your life. I just don\u2019t understand why so many parents reject that. Don\u2019t be angry that I am speaking on Autistics Speaking Day (and every day.) Don\u2019t demand that I never speak for your child. I am only speaking a message of love, acceptance, support, and validation. What parent doesn\u2019t want those things for their child? I am speaking for your child. I beg of you to embrace that, on your child\u2019s behalf. Together we can speak for your child and recruit even more voices along the way \u2014 including, when they\u2019re ready, your children themselves! We will get the world to listen to us! Yes, I speak for myself. But my real satisfaction comes from speaking for the Autistic children. I love them and want them to have every good thing in this world. They will only attain that if we all speak for the children. Every day we have the opportunity to change someone\u2019s life for the better, forever. I speak for the children and I will not stop so long as we live in a world that doesn\u2019t listen yet.

{"date": "2015/12/16", "body": "Today is (or perhaps was. I am late today, as usual) a group writing day for Autistic Wish List (#AutisticWishList), sponsored by #BoycottAutismSpeaks. Mainly, people were encouraged to use Twitter but, as you may have noticed, I have a hard time confining my words to 140 character bites. The idea of Autistic Wish List is to share our holiday wish list of what we want from autism advocacy organizations (such as, but presumably not limited to,\u00a0Autism Speaks.) It is a holiday wish list filled with year-round requests. So, what I want from autism advocacy organizations this holiday season, in no particular order: Nothing About Us Without Us!  Many advocacy organizations have few or no Autistic people in their leadership. Advocacy organizations for the Blind are filled with and led by\u00a0Blind people. Advocacy organizations for the Deaf are filled with and led by Deaf people. Organizations that advocate for disabled people need to be filled with and led by people with that disability or group of disabilities. Who knows most what we need? Who knows most\u00a0about the lived experience of autism? Who can communicate with our voice? Quite obviously, the answer to those questions is us. Some autism advocacy organizations were started by Autistics. Some are opening their doors more and more to Autistics, including in leadership positions. Some are woefully lacking in Autistic voices. This holiday season, I wish for Autistic voices to be the loudest in all matters that affect our lives. Awareness of and real support for Autistic adults!  Autism does not end at age 18 or 22 or any arbitrary age. An autistic brain does not suddenly become a neurotypical brain after a certain number of years. Autistic children grow up to be Autistic adults.\u00a0 No amount of talk about \u201ctsunamis\u201d or \u201cepidemics\u201d can change the fact that there are anywhere from 2 million to 4 million Autistic adults\u00a0in the United States alone. Autism advocacy organizations need to start talking about us, too \u2014 and not as the \u201ccoming crisis.\u201d We are already here, we have always\u00a0been here, and the crisis\u00a0has been in full swing for a very long time. Autistic adults have a much higher rate of poverty and unemployment than the general population and I can only think of a couple of autism advocacy organizations that are even talking about that fact, let alone doing anything to mitigate it. And the ones who are talking about it can\u2019t be blamed for not making much of a dent in the situation because they are small, grassroots organizations that don\u2019t have the millions of dollars of funding that larger organizations hoover out of local communities without giving back. I want to see real employment assistance for Autistics, not just sheltered workshops or an assumption that we are all well-suited for computer programming work. I want to see studies on the number of homeless Autistics, followed by real action to remedy the nightmare for those suffering in unrelenting poverty. And I want autism advocacy organizations to acknowledge that this is a bare start which must be followed up with efforts to assist Autistics who are struggling with barriers to healthcare access, exploitation, violence (sexual, domestic, and otherwise), lack of accommodations in the workplace and university settings, bullying from neighbors and colleagues, and so much more. Acknowledge more than Autistics and Parents of Autistics \u2014 some people are in both those categories at once!  Too often, I see a silencing of the voices of Autistic parents.\u00a0(Remember, the autistic community is the community of those who are #ActuallyAutistic \u2014 those who are personal stakeholders in autism issues because they are the ones living actually autistic lives. The autism community is the community of everyone for whom autism is an important issue: parents of Autistics, Autistics themselves, teachers, doctors, therapist, legislators \u2014 everyone who is a general stakeholder in autism issues, either because they are\u00a0Autistic themselves or because someone Autistic (or many Autistic people) is/are important in\u00a0their life in some way.) So often, when someone says they are an Autistic parent, people hear \u201cautism parent\u201d and assume their child is Autistic but they are not. Hear this now: there is no such thing as an \u201cautism parent.\u201d If your child is Autistic, you are not an \u201cautism mom\u201d or an \u201cautism dad.\u201d You are parenting a child, not autism. You are the mother or father of an Autistic child (or a child with autism if you can\u2019t bear identity-first language.) I\u2019m sorry it takes more words to say it that way, but when you call yourself an\u00a0\u201cautism mom\u201d not only are you saying something that linguistically means you are raising autism, not a person, but you are appropriating a piece of your child\u2019s identity for yourself. What\u2019s more, you are muddying the waters for Autistic parents who are getting very little recognition and support \u2014 how can they find one another when the search engines are filled with autism parents? Autistic parents  need  that recognition and support because their path is twice as difficult. They need support as parents and they need support as Autistics. Too often, as soon as the parents and others who were supporting them learn that they, themselves, are also Autistic, that support vanishes along with any respect for their dignity as parents or even human beings. Autism advocacy organizations need to acknowledge the large number of parents who are #ActuallyAutistic and cherish them as valuable resources \u2014 adult Autistics with parenting experience. What a goldmine that is! What a tragically untapped resource. Stop calling us burdens, lepers, and worse!  If we are burdens, then  every  child is a burden. We are not broken, we are not missing. We are right here and need love and acceptance right now. The hyperbolic rhetoric of crisis and fear must stop. It is dehumanizing (both to us and to those with Hansen\u2019s Disease (what used to be called leprosy.) Our parents are not saints for taking care of us; they are parents, doing what parents do. No child is a guarantee of anything and a loving parent\u2019s job is to accept the child they were given and mentor that child to be the best they can be while remaining true to themselves, not struggling to become a clone of their parent or fulfill any other unattainable dream set forth more for the parent\u2019s ego stroking than for the child\u2019s benefit. The rhetoric of fear leads vulnerable parents down a dark and dangerous path that, for some, has led to murder or murder-suicide. The rhetoric of fear leads parents to despair. The rhetoric of fear causes children to suffer. The rhetoric of fear costs adults jobs and relationships. It is time to jettison this sort of doom talk . . . this sort of hate speech, if I may. For what else could I call a habitual way of talking about autism and Autistic people that ends in suffering and death for those who are discussed in such an objectifying and destructive manner? It is hate speech and it belongs absolutely nowhere in the fund-raising or awareness-stirring toolbox of responsible, ethical autism advocacy organizations. Value Autistic lives . . . ALL Autistic lives!  Autism advocacy organizations must stop playing divisive politics. I watch different segments of the Autistic population thrown under the bus repeatedly and it must stop. It is never okay to say that Autistics who speak are just fine but those who don\u2019t speak require therapy \u201cfor their own good.\u201d It is never okay to count us all in order to declare large numbers of Autistics for funding purposes yet turn around and tell a segment of us that we are not allowed to have a voice because we aren\u2019t the ones you are fighting for \u2014 if you count us, you  must  listen to us. It is never okay to say that autistic genetics are important to society because some of us can build or create or design things and thus we must \u201cput up with\u201d those who will never be productive. Autistic genetics are important to society because biodiversity \u2014 neurodiversity in this case \u2014 is important for the genetic health of any species. We are important because we exist and we should be valued because we are human. Would you dismiss the value of a neurotypical person who spent their life working at McDonald\u2019s and loving their family? What? But they will never design an Eiffel Tower or win a Pulitzer Prize! Why should you value them? . . . what\u2019s that you say? Oh, yes. That is exactly why you must also value us, regardless of our productive output. You must value and protect all Autistic lives just as you value and protect all other human lives. How we move, how we communicate, what we communicate, what we do or don\u2019t produce in the marketplace of things and ideas \u2014 do not base your respect\u00a0for us on things like these. Value us because we are human beings. Stop ignoring Autistic People of Color!  Autism is not all children, not all male, and not all white. But when I was doing research for my upcoming book,  The ABCs of Autism Acceptance , I had a very difficult time researching issues of Autistic People of Color. I found a little bit about Black Autistics, even less about Latin@ and Hispanic Autistics, and pretty much nothing about any other Autistic People of Color. Most autism advocacy organizations aren\u2019t talking about People of Color, there are very few People of Color, Autistic or otherwise, in leadership roles in organizations, and there isn\u2019t much to encourage People of Color to get involved. One terrific exception is the Autism Womens Network (AWN), which has several women of Color in leadership roles and which is working toward releasing an anthology of voices of Autistic People of Color. Other organizations would do well to follow AWN\u2019s lead here. There is so much more I could add to my holiday wish list, but I\u2019ve offered a big bite for autism advocacy organizations to chew on for this year. We can work on meeting more goals in next year\u2019s holiday wish list. So listen up, autism advocacy organizations (especially Autism Speaks!) and get rid of the puzzle pieces and dehumanizing references, stop silencing our voices, stop pitting us against each other, stop sucking all the resources out of local communities without returning value. Respect our humanity. It seems so little to ask. Yet the fact that I must ask for these things shows the massive scale of the struggle we are facing. I hope I get even just one thing from my list this holiday season. I would rejoice to get every item listed here, but could I at least just get one? Don\u2019t make me beg for our rights and dignity \u2014 can\u2019t you see the irony of that? Have a little holiday spirit and good will toward Autistics, please.

{"date": "2015/12/14", "body": "It is often said that Autistic people cannot multi-task. I have noticed that I am unable to multi-task in many of the more popular ways, a prime example being having a group conversation, especially one that breaks up into more than one sub-conversation.  However, I can do things like touch typing notes while looking at slides or pages I\u2019m note-taking from while simultaneously taking other notes from a power point at the front of the lecture room (though I could not tell you a single word the lecturer said. That has nothing to do with multi-tasking, though. I never could hear lectures no matter what else I was or wasn\u2019t doing. In elementary school I realized (after dared by the teacher to come to the chalkboard and do so) that I could write the same sentence forward in Spanish with my right hand and backwards in English with my left hand, simultaneously \u2014 slowly, but all my handwriting is slow so the speed doesn\u2019t really count here. My cousin once walked in on me getting some work done in her kitchen one morning, right hand typing one thing on my laptop and left hand typing something different on my iPad and she helped me to realize that my work style is somewhat unusual. I have met many other Autistics who could engage in interesting combinations of multi-tasking.\u00a0I\u2019m also reminded of a scene from  Mozart and the Whale , a movie based on\u00a0Mary and\u00a0Jerry Newport\u2019s book of the same name about their relationship, in which \u00a0Isabelle (Radha Mitchell\u2019s portrayal of a fictionalized Mary) is shown painting a picture with her left hand (upon which a bird is perched) and composing music with her right hand. In another scene, she says that she wants Donald (Joshua Hartnett\u2019s version of Jerry) to hear her paintings and see her music. The implication seems to be that her multi-tasking comes from a synesthetic \u00a0place in her brain where the painting and the composing are facets of the same task. I am beginning to suspect that it is not at all true that Autistics cannot multi-task or  always  multi-task very poorly. I am beginning to suspect that we have gained that reputation only due to neurotypical forms of multi-tasking being privileged as \u201cnormal\u201d while many Autistic forms of multi-tasking are \u201cothered\u201d as freakish or savant splinter abilities. I do not think it is freakish or wrong to work on two computers at once. I find it a very useful way to work. I might have notes on one computer from which I am writing on the other. Or I might be consulting a to-do list on one while I execute it on the other. Sometimes I\u2019m writing on one computer while researching aspects of what I\u2019m writing on the other. And I know I\u2019m not the only Autistic who uses more than one computer simultaneously. I\u2019ve watched Autistics of all ages regularly using multiple computers together, often much more proficiently than I. So my strong\u00a0suspicion is that Autistic people can and do multi-task, often quite well. But our means and methods of multi-tasking are quite different and the tasks\u00a0we are able to multi-task on are so different from neurotypical multi-tasking that we have been described by many, if not most, researchers and writers as being unable to multi-task at all. Obviously, some of us are better at some kinds of multi-tasking than others (for example, not all of us are able to integrate our sensory inputs and multi-task among them sufficiently rapidly to safely operate a motor vehicle.) But I would argue that everyone has difficulty with some types of multi-tasking that come easily to most others. And I know from observation that many Autistics multi-task delightfully in some areas while not at all in others. Elmindreda unintentionally backs up my hypothesis with an article discussing  the sensory issues underlying an apparent lack of multi-tasking ability  when it comes to a one-on-one conversation in a caf\u00e9. As explained, the difficulty is not due to a lack of multi-tasking ability but rather to so many of the aspects of a chat over coffee being things that come automatically to neurotypicals but Autistics must actively work for. With so much cognitive overhead being taken up by these tasks that are not automated in us, we appear to lack multi-tasking when in reality we actually are multi-tasking as hard as we can, just to keep up. As Camus said, \u201cNobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.\u201d \u00a0Eileen Parker  writes about being poor with multi-tasking  but the actual description of what is happening looks more like autistic inertia \u2014 trouble figuring out how to get tasks started \u2014 than a trouble with multi-tasking. Half her to-do list cannot be done, the other half is too unrelated. Plus she admits that she keeps adding things to the list before she\u2019s even decided what to do about the things already written down. Multi-tasking, as I understand it, is less about making a pie and going to the post office at the same time as it is about making a pie and a roast and some vegetables and some rolls at the same time, arranging them to all be finished at the proper time for a coordinated, hot meal. I can do this latter type of multi-tasking but I usually have to look over the tasks first and perhaps even make a timeline showing when each action in the kitchen must occur. Making a pie and going to the post office would either require me to be in two places at once or to make a pie and then go to the post office while it is baking, being careful to get back to remove the pie from the oven before it burns. While this requires timely coordination, it\u2019s not the sort of thing I tend to consider when talking about true multi-tasking \u2014 that is, switching among two or more tasks seamlessly enough to present the illusion of doing both at once.  I can seamlessly switch between knitting lace and reading the sub-titles on a foreign film because both are things that require my eyes and brain and the knitting also requires my hands. I am sitting in one place, mainly only needing to shift my eyes and thoughts back and forth. Although the author of  Life with the Quirky Boys  points out that it\u2019s because I\u2019m a very experienced knitter: \u201cI can\u2019t watch TV and knit at the same time because I have to watch my hands to get the stitches right and then I lose track of what\u2019s happening on the show. But I have friends whose hands fly through without a thought and they can simultaneously follow the most intricately plotted show with no problem. Knitting is a rote activity for them.\u201d\u00a0Cleaning up old papers and baking a pie are not very related at all. One could alternate aspects of the tasks, but actual multi-tasking is not very likely to occur. Piroflip\u00a0on  Wrong Planet  can multi-task: \u201cI used to fly radio controlled model helicopters; a skill that requires very precise multi-tasking. Although not an expert I did learn to fly very quickly whereas many struggle for years to learn the basics. Flying a model heli is like trying to balance one egg on top of another egg in each hand.\u201d User Alexptrans pointed out another interesting example of multi-tasking that many Autistics are quite capable of: \u201cWhat about playing two different melodies in counterpoint, one with your right hand and the other with your left?\u201d But perhaps flying a model helicopter or playing an intricate piece of music are not actually examples of multi-tasking since they are whole tasks in themselves? These examples of multi-tasking may be like the multi-tasking involved in knitting lace and not as much like the multi-tasking involved in knitting lace while simultaneously reading a foreign film. \u201cMulti-tasking\u201d comes from a particular brain region called the thalamic\u00a0reticular nucleus or TRN. The TRN is like a switchboard that tells the rest of the brain what sensory input to focus on. As you might\u00a0imagine, the TRN is\u00a0quite active when the brain is manifesting what has been called the \u201ccocktail party effect,\u201d which is the ability of some\u00a0brains to hear one conversation while several other conversations are occurring nearby. I, like many Autistic people, do not have a very well-developed cocktail party effect. My TRN gets overloaded by all the input and\u00a0doesn\u2019t have a good system of filtering to decide which sounds are important and which can be ignored. My brain ignores none of the sounds and, as a result,\u00a0little to no actual meaning makes it from my ears to my comprehension. Francis Crick, best known for his work with DNA, first hypothesized this role for the TRN and\u00a0his theory\u00a0has only very recently been tested in a mouse brain model. These experiments also showed a connection between the TRN and the prefrontal cortex \u2014 when the prefrontal cortex (known for its role in executive function,\u00a0decision making,\u00a0and emotional regulation, among other things) was inactivated, the TRN went haywire, unable to complete its filtering tasks. So the question neuroscientists have now is whether the differences in multi-tasking abilities among Autistics is due to a different prefrontal cortex, a different TRN, or perhaps both. This is a deficit model, however. The researchers are looking at Autistics as having a deficit and non-autistics as being the norm. Their research is aimed toward figuring out how to \u201cfix\u201d us so that we are more like non-autistic people. But what about those of us who demonstrate exceptional multi-tasking abilities (often while simultaneously exhibiting great struggles with the sorts of multi-tasking non-autistic people do automatically)? Why is there no research aimed at discovering what makes us so great at the things we are great at so that others can benefit from understanding our neurology? I don\u2019t so much mind studies of the TRN. I think they can be quite useful. But I long for the day when this sort of research becomes more egalitarian. I yearn for researchers who realize that our divergence is not simply a problem to be solved but also an opportunity from which all of us can benefit. We can all learn from one another. Do not assume that Autistics are only here to learn neurotypical ways of being. Do not assume your ways are always the best. Our interests, talents, and brain structures are intrinsically valuable. Respect our divergence! You have much more to learn from us than you realize.

{"date": "2015/12/29", "body": "Image description: plate 928 from the 1918 edition of Grays Anatomy, depicting a diagrammatic longitudinal section of the cochlea. \u201cWhat does it feel like to have sensory issues? What makes them better or worse?\u201d This is the second installment of a series of posts I\u2019m doing because\u00a0my answer to that question is not short and simple. And, as I opened the first blog post with, this series is not about autism and sensory issues in general. This post and series are about me explaining what I go through. There will be many similarities and many differences between what I experience and what others experience. Part One is largely about my experience of the auditory world . \nPart Two (this post you are reading now) is about the things that make my life easier or more difficult. I\u2019d like to lead with something that I\u2019ve been thinking about in general recently. One thing that makes my auditory disability (and every other aspect of my disabilities)\u00a0more difficult is when presumably well-meaning people say dismissive things about my challenges. For example, a conversation with someone\u00a0kind who cares about me\u00a0might go like this: Friend: \u201cOh, you should check out this thing that is on a street. It\u2019s on a street that\u2019s behind another street and over by where there used to be a street.\u201d (This is a rough approximation for how spoken directions translate inside my brain.) Me: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can write down the address and enter it into my GPS. I can\u2019t follow spoken directions.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s really easy to find, it\u2019s just . . . \u201d \u201cI have topographical agnosia. My GPS is an accommodation for my disability.\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t call yourself disabled.\u201d It\u2019s a hard conversation and gets harder as it goes along. And it\u2019s an example of something that makes my auditory processing more difficult to cope with: When someone tells me I just\u00a0need to concentrate or focus more or even just refuse to be disabled and stop it by force of will (this tends to take the form of, \u201cwell, when I feel that way, I just refuse to let it get me down,\u201d\u00a0or its first cousin, \u201cI could give in to it, but I don\u2019t have a choice. I have to hold things together\u201d (both of these phrases, if you hadn\u2019t noticed already, carry the implication that the disabled person who is limited in their choice of actions by some particular challenge is really just exhibiting the disability colloquially known as \u201ca bad attitude.\u201d))\u00a0I feel like my dismissed\u00a0disability is not being taken seriously, as a real thing that I live with and sometimes work with and sometimes work around and sometimes totally despair about and sometimes see the coolest thing ever about. There\u2019s something else really important for the kind-hearted nay-sayers to keep in mind. They think they are being kind when they dismiss our challenges but often their dismissal puts us in a situation where, in order to advocate for the accommodations we need, we are forced to \u201cdefend our impairment\u201d, often to someone we care about very much. It is never an act of kindness to dismiss someone\u2019s disability because you are pushing them into a corner where often\u00a0the only safe course of action is either to ignore the truncating of one\u2019s reality or push back and in the process re-open\u00a0psychic wounds, leaving the disabled person feeling drained or depressed. So the number one piece of advice I have for someone who might be interested in not making my life more difficult than it already is: don\u2019t try to dismiss my challenges. You\u2019re not doing a kindness when you try to pretend there isn\u2019t actually an elephant in the room. I am disabled and that\u2019s just a part of who I am. And it\u2019s like a friend said to me today, \u201cit\u2019s not you that\u2019s messed up. There are things in the world that hurt you. It\u2019s not something wrong with you. It\u2019s a problem with the world.\u201d That is a response that helped pull me out of a nosedive. Feeling understood and accepted is so important. Having a sensory processing disability can be isolating. Being so noticeably different from others comes with social dynamics. For example, I\u2019ve noticed\u00a0sometimes when I put my hands over my ears, others behaving as if they are interpreting my\u00a0action\u00a0as a rudeness. This is especially clear to me when the painful thing I am guarding against is a Salvation Army bell ringer (I suspect my hands-over-ears is interpreted as some kind of political or economic commentary? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just that those bells hurt me) or a high-pitched shriek of a child.\u00a0 I do not hate children. I love children! But when I crumple in pain from a high-pitched wail, I\u2019m viewed as a child-hater, a selfish person who not only lacks empathy but has no maternal instinct. Life is easier when I feel surrounded by people who understand that my pain is not a comment. Yes, behavior is communication, but all I am communicating with this behavior is that I am in pain. There is no room in my head for any other thought. Any attempt to engage me in communication during the pain is more likely to get someone snapped at than anything. Life is easier when I\u2019m not told to just put up with it or urged to deal with it\u00a0while told I will get used to it with time. When a sudden sound makes me jump in pain, I feel guilty if my jumping upsets someone else and it is reassuring when someone acknowledges that I can\u2019t help reacting to sudden pain. Understanding and acceptance. Everything else in my life is easier when I have understanding and acceptance. The stress of feeling bad about how people around me are reacting to my disability causes my auditory processing difficulties to increase. The more I feel safe \u2014 not just physically, but emotionally as well \u2014 with the people around me, the easier it is for me to navigate the world of sounds and voices. Some of the other things that make my auditory processing issues more prominent and harder to cope with might be obvious: being especially tired, in pain from other sources, depressed, ill. or otherwise under the weather makes my auditory processing so much more difficult. There have been points in my life when I was under so much stress that spoken language \u2014 even with only one person speaking, in a space that is not loud or echoing \u2014 became completely incomprehensible. When my ex-husband was injured at work my boss came to me and\u00a0told me that\u00a0my husband\u00a0was in the hospital. After I heard that, my\u00a0ability to process sound into language and meaning completely dropped out. My boss continued to try to\u00a0talk to me, but all I could say was, \u201cwhat?\u201d and even that from inside a bit of a daze. So what makes auditory processing easier for me? It helps when people let me have an unobstructed view of their mouth while they are speaking to me. People with facial hair need to be patient with me because they will be harder for me to hear. I intentionally didn\u2019t phrase that in terms of lip reading, because my experience of lip reading doesn\u2019t feel to me like I am reading lips. It feels like I am hearing. I regularly forget that I read lips. When I was passing through Aurora, Nebraska this summer, I asked\u00a0a question of a\u00a0worker at the deli counter in a grocery store. He began answering and I was following along well. Then he ducked behind the counter to pick something up, continuing to speak at the same volume as before. When he bent down and I couldn\u2019t see his mouth anymore, all his words immediately shifted from being clear and lucid to being a complete jumble of nonsense. When he stood up again and I could see his lips, the jumble resolved back into clear words: \u201c\u2013 so you should check back on Thursday to see if we have some.\u201d It was a shock to see just how much I rely on lip reading. Since I perceive lip reading as if it were actually hearing, I forget how much I lean on it for comprehension. Don\u2019t fire off a string of questions at me. It takes a lot of processing power for me, because my brain is trying to answer the first question and hear the second question at the same time. Then it\u2019s trying to answer the second question while hearing the third question while not forgetting what the first question was. I don\u2019t know what it sounds like to you when someone asks several questions all at once, but it\u2019s overwhelming to me. Depending on the questions, It can leave me feeling anything from restless to antsy to anxious to have a string of questions asked all at once. It adds static to my auditory channel. Of course I will forgive you when you forget and fire some questions off, because it takes a while to re-learn ways of communicating, but don\u2019t be surprised (and please don\u2019t feel judged by me!) when you see a wave of anxiety come over me at the bit of overwhelm. If you want to show me a TV show or movie, don\u2019t grumble if I ask for the closed captions to be turned on. It helps me to enjoy the experience and come away entertained instead of exhausted from straining to get meaning from the dialogue. Some shows can\u2019t be turned extra loud because the mix between voices and music means that turning it up loud enough for me to clearly hear the voices makes the music painfully loud and unbearable. The next time you\u2019re tempted to say that closed captions ruin a show, remember that some people really need those captions and you are risking making them feel bad about asking for captions or afraid to ask for them in the future. If you are teaching a class, the minimum you can do to help all your students (not just those of us with auditory processing disabilities) is to provide a written outline of your lecture topics. An accommodation I wish I had sought in college would be to be allowed to record lectures and have them transcribed by an assistant. Some professors were easier to understand than others, but it would have been nice to have that accommodation held \u201cin reserve\u201d for those professors I just couldn\u2019t follow. I often ended up skipping lots of lectures because if I couldn\u2019t understand the lecture, I was wasting my time being there. I\u2019d focus on the textbook and sometimes only show up for exams or to hand in papers. Another accommodation I find helpful from those very close to me is to ask me to repeat back what they told me when saying something really important. I can\u2019t always know when I miss something important \u2026. because if I missed it, I missed it. If someone is giving me information that I can tell is important, I will repeat it back on my own. Because words so often get garbled for me and because of the extreme difference in outcomes one can attain when including or omitting small words like\u00a0\u201cnot\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d it\u2019s crucial that I be prompted to repeat back important information. I noticed that some commenters expressed similar experiences to those I wrote about last week. I\u2019d be especially interested to hear comments throughout this series and not just from people who resonate with what I\u2019ve written. I invite others to write about their sensory experiences, much as I am writing about mine in this series. Whether you write about your experiences in comments on this post or whether you write your own posts (and I hope you will share links to them in the comment section here, please!) I want to get others talking about making sense of sensory experiences in their lives as well. We are all different. We have strong similarities. It appears that some kind of sensory non-mainstream-ness is definitional to autism. The more of us willing to share our experiences and insights, the more we can work to build larger understandings\u00a0and better acceptance and accommodation for everyone. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/cochlear-nerve.png"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/12/29/making-sense-of-sensory-part-two/", "title": "Making Sense of Sensory \u2013 Part\u00a0Two"},
{"date": "2015/11/02", "body": "Welcome to November,  Autistic History Month .\u00a0 How appropriate it is that Steve Silberman\u2019s book,\u00a0 Neurotribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity ,  has just  won the prestigious Samuel Johnson nonfiction prize . Silberman\u2019s ground-breaking book discusses the history of autism, including little-known details of the earliest days of the diagnosis. Silberman ferreted out previously-unknown information that turns contemporary ideas upside down. I had long known that Dr. Asperger and Dr. Kanner were not really describing a different condition \u2014 both labeled the cluster of traits \u201cautism\u201d and both doctors were studying patients from a wide range of autistic expression, from those who need a great deal of support to those \u201clittle professors\u201d who, despite being disabled as well, often fly under the radar. In other words, there is no significant difference between \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d (as described by Dr. Asperger, not necessarily as described in the DSM-IV) and \u201cKanner\u2019s autism.\u201d Silberman discusses this phenomenon in much greater depth than I had previously been aware, however. I knew about Donald Triplett, the first person ever diagnosed by Dr. Kanner. Triplett still lives in the town where he grew up. Although the townspeople are aware of Triplett and shelter him a fair bit, he is also quite independent. This  Atlantic article  mentions that Triplett drives his own car and plays golf. Donald Triplett would seem to match up with Hans Asperger\u2019s description of autism. What Steve Silberman revealed that I had not been aware of before reading his book was that Dr. Asperger was studying patients who required a great deal of support \u2014 much more than indicated by the DSM-IV description of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. In other words,  both  doctors were looking at children from all over the autism spectrum. Both doctors were studying a cohort of children nearly indistinguishable from the cohort the other doctor was studying. Both doctors recognized that the state of being they called \u201cautism\u201d had a wide range of expression. Neither doctor contributed to a compartmentalization of \u201ctypes\u201d of autism. So why is there such division today? Silberman\u2019s book addresses that issue (and so much more. If you haven\u2019t read  Neurotribes  yet, you really must!) I can\u2019t even begin to do Silberman\u2019s recounting justice in this synopsis. Asperger downplayed and hid his subjects who required more support because he was working in Nazi Germany where disabled people were called \u201cballast\u201d and \u201cuseless eaters\u201d and sentenced to death. Fearing for the lives of the patients he had grown quite attached to, Asperger promoted the \u201clittle professor\u201d subjects, emphasizing their intelligence, potential future productivity,\u00a0and usefulness to the Nazi regime. This is why we have come to associate a particular set of traits with the label \u201cAsperger\u2019s Syndrome\u201d to the point where one might sometimes wonder if a race of ubermensch were being described. The greatest surprise of all however, was the connection between Asperger and Kanner. Silberman dug deeply into historical documents in\u00a0one of the greatest academic detective stories I\u2019ve seen in a while. As it turns out, When Asperger\u2019s clinic was bombed and his workers were scattered, many of them went to work for Dr. Kanner in America. Evidence strongly indicates that Dr. Kanner named the condition he was studying \u201cautism\u201d because his employees told him that is what Dr. Asperger had called it. The history of autism is not a path of parallel discovery like Newton and Leibnitz with the calculus. It is a single path of discovery that began with Dr. Asperger and was taken up by Dr. Kanner (who chose to take credit for the discovery of autism rather than share the credit with his overseas colleague.) Kanner, however, emphasized the patients who needed more support. He emphasized them to such an extent, in fact, that the understanding that autism is a spectrum was lost for\u00a0over four decades. Thanks to the hard work and\u00a0award-winning writing of Steve Silberman,\u00a0the historical understanding of the autism spectrum\u00a0is getting new attention. The history of autism\u00a0could revolutionize the future for Autistic people. Thank you, Steven Silberman. Thank you so much.

{"date": "2015/12/22", "body": "Image description: A drawing by Ren\u00e9 Descartes, depicting the dualism of mind and body, used here because it has an old-school science look going down with muscles and eyeballs and dotted lines and numbers so it kind of has an appropriately creepy Borg-like connection to talking about the senses and what they feel like. \u201cWhat does it feel like to have sensory issues? What makes them better or worse?\u201d I have this thing, where I am asked a question and it takes me fifteen, twenty minutes (sometimes more) to answer it, talking the whole way through. In conversation, it\u2019s a bug. In public speaking, it\u2019s a feature. Then I get the question that momentarily silences me \u2014 not because I can\u2019t answer it, but because I can\u2019t answer it in fifteen or twenty minutes unless I write it out first. I write much better than I extemporaneously speak. And I speak better when I\u2019ve written on a topic first. Words are bricks and I have to build ideas with them a few times in writing before the right phrases will find their way out of my mouth later. So this is my first attempt to answer that question. What does it feel like to have sensory issues and what makes them better or worse? These will not be concise essays. I am going to ramble my way through this topic and I invite you to come along for the ride. I\u2019m feeing out the concept of feeling. The concise, polished prose comes later. This series of posts is pure excavation \u2014 digging around in my life and seeing what I can pull up from the grates. The first thing that absolutely must be said on this topic is that I can only talk about my own profile of sensory issues. Sensory issues are like fingerprints \u2014 all fingers have swirls and whorls that look similar but each has their own pattern. Similarly, different people have different sensory needs.\u00a0Writing out my thoughts will only help me get so far in explaining autistic sensory issues \u00a0because it\u2019s not something I could do single-handedly. It will take many Autistic voices to explain sensory issues because we all have them but our swirls and whorls vary from person to person. I once knew a married couple, both Autistic,\u00a0who had conflicting sensory needs.\u00a0He was routinely auditorily understimulated and she was routinely overstimulated. They had to plan their life carefully so that he could get the loud sounds and\u00a0sonic-bodyfeels he needed and she could get the pristine silence she needed. That\u2019s a difficult combination that needs a lot of love\u00a0and patience to accommodate. The next thing I feel strongly about saying is that, even though I\u2019ve been known to use the phrase myself,\u00a0I have hesitations about the\u00a0 phrase \u201csensory issues.\u201d I spend a lot of time in nature and I\u2019ve come to realize that few of my sensory issues are actual sensory issues so much as issues with the way my local culture has shaped\u00a0our environment in this particular corner of early 21st century, North American space-time. Most of my alleged sensory issues are not issues when I am out in the woods or desert or mountains or marsh or wherever I happen to wander. My primary \u201cdifficult senses\u201d \u2013 hearing and vestibular \u2013 give me difficulty nearly everywhere. My other \u201csensory issues\u201d don\u2019t bother me when I\u2019m \u201cout a ways\u201d from cities and towns. There are still noises in nature that are hard for me. Sandhill cranes, for example. Having never met a sandhill crane before this month, I was surprised to learn that their call is\u00a0roughly at a location on the Pain Scale half-way between a store-provided power chair backing up in an echoing warehouse grocery and a passing fire engine siren. Three sandhill cranes were in my cousin\u2019s front yard and began shouting in unison.\u00a0I\u2019ve never felt so injured by bird song before. And vestibular issues are harder for me when walking than when driving. One reason I love to drive is that I feel so graceful. I am much better with controlling the steer of a wheel and the timing of a pedal than I am with controlling my gait. Walking, I feel awkward and fear I might look a little drunk. Driving, I am Peggy Fleming. But, other than stumbling around to escape the noise of sandhill cranes, my senses are not assaulted in nature; they are soothed. Shinrin-yoku \u2014 \u201cforest bathing\u201d \u2014 is a balm to my spirit. The forest is a sensory blanket that loosens my knotted shoulders and opens my lungs to air so satisfying it feels as if I\u2019d been holding my breath for days. Most of my sensory\u00a0\u201cissues\u201d would not be significant enough to notice if I lived in a quieter, slower, less populated piece of space-time. Were I living in human pre-history, I might not be considered to have sensory issues at all. It might be that I would instead be recognized as a person with some senses tuned exquisitely fine and the community might value and support me for those delicately tuned senses. But I live in the here-now, so this is what it feels like to be me: My hearing is the most fine-tuned and the most problematic of my senses. I have heard bats echolocate. Not squeak (I heard that, too) but the actual echolocation sound. I can only hear it in the very lowest range (bats go up to around 100,000 Hz. I can hear up to around 25,000 Hz. Bat echolocation goes down as low as 14,000 Hz.) but I can hear it. Having hearing up to such high pitches meant that it took me years to be taken seriously when I said I couldn\u2019t hear human speech very well. Many people lose hearing in the higher end of their range as a result of time and aging. When I complained that I often couldn\u2019t understand speech, but my hearing tested as better than perfect in the high range, I was sent away with, \u201cmaybe you\u2019re imagining it.\u201d But the difficulty never went away and now I understand it by a name: central auditory processing disorder. I usually shorthand-explain it as \u201ckind of like dyslexia of the ears.\u201d It\u2019s neurological. I have a great ear for music but words get jumbled. Sometimes I shorthand it even more into, \u201cI\u2019m hard of hearing. It helps if you face me when you talk to me.\u201d On top of all that, I have vestibular hyperacusis. This one has a shorthand, too: it\u2019s like a kind of synaesthesia where high-pitched sounds get perceived as motion. SOmetimes it\u2019s a leasant motion but more often it\u2019s a harsh, nauseating jerk. Oh, also those sounds hurt. I used to say \u201cloud sounds hurt,\u201d but years of self-observation have changed that to \u201chigh-pitched loud sounds hurt\u201d because I\u2019ve discovered that I\u2019m fine with loud low-pitched sounds and I especially love listening to bass guitar or deep drums (not high pitched snares) at volumes loud enough to feel in my body as much as hearing in my ears. But I\u2019m supposed to be telling you how it feels to have this combination of hearing/vestibular sensory defensiveness. Squeaking door hinges hurt. Beeping cash registers hurt. Whistling teakettles hurt. That humming sound fluorescent lights make hurts.\u00a0\u00a0Sirens hurt. Doorbells hurt. Forklifts driving in reverse hurt. Garbage trucks backing up hurts. Salvation Army bell ringers hurt. My cell phone hurts. The beep my car makes when I open the door with the lights on or the keys in the ignition hurts. Fryer timers in fast food restaurants hurt. Loud motorcycle engines hurt. Sudden laughter hurts. Intercoms hurt. The world hurts. All sounds happen at all times. You know those games people do where you have to tune in to your auditory surroundings and list off five or ten things you can hear? I don\u2019t like those games because they aren\u2019t fun for me because I\u2019m already tuned in to five or ten or maybe twenty things I can hear all the time. That\u2019s great in the high desert, where I\u2019m hearing the wind in the sagebrush and the crumblerustle of a snake heading down his hole as I pass through his territory. A mockingbird is singing in a scrubby tree and in the distance a marmot is calling a warning about me to his colony. But in town, it\u2019s thirty people talking at the same time, a waterfall of noise sending up an obscuring mist of word cloud. And there are dishes clattering back in the kitchen. And the door opening and closing. And the cash register blinging and churring. Lured in by the promise of all-you-can-eat cocktail prawns, I leave with indigestion from processing all the noise, only a few shrimp eaten. Or it\u2019s ten people talking at the same time\u00a0punctuated by\u00a0an espresso machine shlurbling. Coffee cups are clinking together and music is playing in the background on a stereo\u00a0but a local customer is strumming on a guitar at the same time. Someone is kicking their chair in a rhythmless thump, matching neither the stereo nor the guitar. Slurping. Clicking. Shuffling. And the door opens and closes. A new batch of loud entries and departures and the sound swirls back around on itself again. The combination of all these noises is deafening. It\u2019s hard to be in the coffee house when I\u2019m not drumming. Everything answers to the drum. The drum is the heartbeat at the heart of it all. When I am on the drum and it is pounding through my body and steering all other sounds into its wake like a gravity well pulling comets through the night sky. I feel power. But the drum is also a servant to the music, following where it goes. Endlessly chasing its tail, the drums wrap around the outside and hold everything together, including me. I feel right. I feel whole. I can bear to be inside the coffee house. What it feels like is that you talk too loud and I have to back up from you (two steps if you also have a strong cologne on.)\u00a0 What it feels like is that the world is a noisy and chaotic pace I have to prepare myself to enter. What it feels like is frustration, because I hear too well to feel comfortable and not well enough to connect with the world of people. What it feels like is embarrassment to ask for captions (even though they make the difference between me enjoying the show and me being completely lost or bored or struggling so hard to understand that I\u2019m exhausted for hours afterwards) because I know hearing people hate them so much and I will feel like I\u2019m needy and demanding and putting everyone else out and ruining their enjoyment of the show. It\u2019s better to ruin just my enjoyment than everybody else\u2019s, I think, and make myself small, and smile when others smile and nod when they nod and laugh when they laugh . . . . or just wander out of the room when everyone else is caught up in he show, looking for something else to do. In my next post, I will either talk about my next most intense sense or I will talk about what makes hearing better or worse for me, or maybe I\u2019ll talk about something else entirely. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/descartes_mind_and_body.gif"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/12/22/making-sense-of-sensory-part-one/", "title": "Making Sense of Sensory \u2013 Part\u00a0One"},
{"date": "2016/01/12", "body": "\u201cStructure of the Mammalian Retina\u201d by Santiago Ramon y Cajal, c. 1900 \u201cWhat does it feel like to have sensory issues? What makes them better or worse?\u201d This is the second installment of a series of posts I\u2019m doing because\u00a0my answer to that question is not short and simple. And, as I opened the first blog post with, this series is not about autism and sensory issues in general. This post and series are about me explaining what I go through. There will be many similarities and many differences between what I experience and what others experience. Part One is largely about my experience of the auditory world . \n Part Two is about the things that make my life easier or more difficult , both with respect to hearing and generally concerning how I am treated. It is the case for every one of my senses that anything that increases m stress level also increases my difficulties with sensory processing and overload. \nPart Three (this post you are reading now) is about my experience of the visual world. Vision is possibly my second most important sense when it comes to integration issues. There are a number of things that overwhelm me, visually. I am\u00a0privileged to be able to drive a vehicle safely, but I have many Autistic friends who cannot drive and visual processing is one of the bigger reasons why they can\u2019t do it. (Difficulties with executive function or with rapid decision-making also rank high in the list of reasons why some Autistics cannot drive.) When I am tired and my vision begins disintegrating beyond the usual level, my visual processing is often the first sign that I need to get off the road and find a safe place to rest for a while. I like having this built-in warning system. The most overwhelming visual sensation for me is rapid motion. This doesn\u2019t affect driving a van, even at 70 miles per hour, because the kind of motion that overwhelms me doesn\u2019t happen out on the road (although a storm can cause some visual distress if there are lots of things flying randomly around in the air. At that point, however, I tend to have bigger issues than visual processing to cope with.) There are two major categories of overwhelming motion: things that look like they\u2019re coming at my face and things that mill around in a sort of Brownian manner. In the latter category, I include children. I am great with one kid, great with two kids, tolerable with three kids, completely overwhelmed with four or more kids. Imagine a children\u2019s birthday party \u2014 they\u2019re all gleeful, running from place to place, high on sugar, milling about randomly and at high speeds (usually with accompanying distressing sounds at that point.) Lots of running, playing children remind me of bubbles in a boiling pot. They are random, unpredictable, and I can feel my anxiety levels rising. It has nothing to do with liking or disliking children \u2014 I love them, actually. but all that group\u00a0moving around throws me off-kilter. Another rapid movement that is hard on me are those disco lights that spin around, casting spots of light all over the room. Even though there is a mathematical orderliness to those lights, the effect is random enough to set off my anxiety. I don\u2019t have photosensitive epilepsy, but many of my friends do, as well as my late fianc\u00e9. I\u2019ve met some Autistics who really love chaotic light and sound environments, including Rave parties, but I\u2019ve met far more of us who can\u2019t handle lots of fancy lights well at all. It\u2019s better to err on the side of caution and not use flashing or spinning lights around us, but if you want to throw a party with overwhelming lights, make it clear what the lighting will be like and you may get some of those Autistics who need lots of extra visual stimulation coming to your event. Think of sensory input needs as containers. An average person with a fairly mainstream set of sensory needs would have, say, a big 12-ounce beer glass for senses to collect in. They might get excited and happy when their glass overflows a little or they might find it unpleasant and back away from it, but most days of their lives their sensory inputs are just right to keep their glass sufficiently filled but not over-filled. Someone like my friends who love Raves has a big bucket for sensory input. They want more input than people tend to get on an average day because they are so often walking around feeling like their visual bucket is echoingly empty. They might seek out flashing lights, bright colors, swoopy movements, and other visually stimmy things to fill up their bucket some more. They feel most comfortable when their buckets are filled but not overflowing, similar to the people who only have a beer glass to fill. Someone on the other end of things \u2014 someone who gets visually overwhelmed like me (or much more than me) might just have a little espresso cup or some other very small container.\u00a0The regular level of visual stimulation that makes beer glass people feel comfortable is way too much for someone with a demitasse. Everyday visual stimulation overflows and continues to pour out across the floor, leaving the person feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I don\u2019t quite have a demitasse, but my visual container is definitely smaller than a beer glass. I have, maybe, a juice glass of space for visual sensory. I love bright colors, but I get overwhelmed by too many of them (grocery store shelf.) My brain often interprets things coming toward my face as a threat (typical for many people) but reaches too far and misinterprets things that aren\u2019t coming at my face as if they are. Also, I don\u2019t just flinch from things coming at my face but I get a burst of adrenaline and a long-lingering anxiety afterwards. I can see things clearly to drive, but when I get tired the road starts to look like it is moving backward. I am quick to spot birds and other wild creatures when I\u2019m out in nature but I often find myself on the trail watching for snakes and getting nervous because I am having such a hard time processing sticks and roots and leaves and rocks and other visual ground jumble quickly enough to see if there are snakes or fire ants or ankle-twisting holes in the ground along my path.\u00a0(As a result, I walk a bit slowly in nature, which is not entirely a bad thing.) When I walk\u00a0 into a room, especially a room I am unfamiliar with, I have to pause to let my eyes figure out what\u2019s in the room. Sometimes this frustrates people I\u2019m with as they want to go on in, find their seat, move forward with their day. I am blocking their way because it takes me a while to even figure out what is a seat. What is a table? What is a coat rack? What is a counter? What is a person? I know it sounds terribly stereotypical, but quite often I don\u2019t see people at first and they gradually emerge from the visual chaos of a scene. I have walked right into people. I\u2019ve considered this situation to try to understand why it is that my vision can be so unreliable in some instances yet reliable enough to go birding or drive a vehicle in other cases. I think the big thing with driving is that the roads are so standardized. My brain knows what sort of visual patterns to expect and can sort them out quickly because a road is a road is a road with very little variation from Wyoming to Illinois to Louisiana. A room can have an infinite number of variations that must be sorted out visually. I can see everything there is to see, but I am noticeably slower at it than most people around me. The trade-off is that I seem to see more than most others, once my eyes and brain have had a full conversation about what we\u2019re looking at. Another difference I\u2019ve noticed between my visual processing and that of many others is that I don\u2019t see a lot of optical illusions. Often someone will post a picture and people respond with comments about it spinning wildly and making them nauseated and I look at it but don\u2019t see anything moving at all. Dr. Olga Bogdashina wrote in  Sensory Perceptual Issues in Autism and Asperger\u2019s Syndrome  that Autistic people often have \u201coptical disillusions,\u201d in that many of us are not visually fooled by optical illusions. \u201cFeigenberg (1986) suggests that what we see (feel, hear, etc.) is mostly something we are expecting to see (hear, feel, etc.) The brain does not need to process all the stimuli; it just \u2018fills in the gaps\u2019 and \u2018predicts\u2019 the final picture. That is why we are prone to illusions. The ability of the brain to \u2018see\u2019 before actually seeing is not restricted to vision. The same can be observed with other senses, for example, we can \u2018hear\u2019 or \u2018feel\u2019 what we are expecting to hear or feel.\u201d Bogdashina, Sensory Perceptual Issues, p. 47 It seems to me that this is the benefit to the way I process visual information. I don\u2019t fill in the gaps and predict as much as a non-autistic viewer does. It means it takes me longer to process visual information but it also means that the information that gets processed is somewhat more accurate a representation of what is actually \u201cout there\u201d in front of me as a result. Sure, I can still be fooled. This video, for example, fooled me the way it\u2019s designed to fool everyone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo When you follow the instructions and don\u2019t know what to expect, it will probably fool you, too. Now that I\u2019ve seen the whole video, it doesn\u2019t fool me. It can\u2019t fool me \u2013 because I know. As you can see, my visual issues are not as difficult as y auditory issues, but I still struggle with them. It is the slowness of processing that bothers me the most. I\u2019m sure I miss out on a lot of opportunities because I don\u2019t see them quickly enough. I prefer to be out in the country rather than in a city where things are moving around so much more quickly. I can\u2019t handle crowds of people very well. But I see amazing things that delight me every day. I see things that others pass by with barely a glance and I revel in them. When it comes to my visual processing, I mostly don\u2019t see a problem because the trade-offs are so fulfilling for me. I imagine I might feel differently if my processing issues precluded me from driving a vehicle. I\u2019d love to see a conversation about visual processing in the comments here. Please do consider joining in the discussion and don\u2019t feel that you need to agree with me or have processing like mine in order to participate.

{"date": "2016/01/29", "body": "image description: the movie poster for the film \u201cI Am Legend\u201d with the author in a purple dress superimposed over the protagonist and Fermat the Wonder Cat superimposed over the prodogonist. \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t believe in the word disabled. I feel it has a negative connotation and it\u2019s just not part of my vocabulary. But that\u2019s just me.\u201d <sarcasm> Yes, I can see your point. Disabled is such a negative word and should not be part of my vocabulary, either. I believe in using only positive words in my self-identity so\u2026..what to call myself now? Hmm.. Henry? No, that is a very positive word but it\u2019s already taken. Shoe tree? I like that one a lot, but you know, I think we can go just a little bit more positive. Wait, wait, I think I have it. LEGEND! Now there\u2019s a positive word! I am not \u201cdisabled.\u201d I AM LEGEND! Yes! If you have been cringing every time you see or hear the word \u201cdisabled,\u201d please feel free to refer to me as legend instead. Much more awesome, right? Since I have you here, can I talk a little bit about the word \u201cdisabled\u201d now? We\u2019ve removed it from our vocabularies so you shouldn\u2019t feel threatened about a little chat. It\u2019s an obsolete word now. Archaic. Outdated. So last week. All that negative energy and power has just been whooshed out of it, so let\u2019s talk about this deflated word that can\u2019t hurt us any more. What does it mean to say \u201cI am disabled\u201d? It\u2019s an adjective, like pretty, clumsy, white, clever, and so on. More specifically, it\u2019s an adjective made out of a participle form of a verb: to disable. Present participle adjectives show that something is being done (e.g disabling) and past participle adjectives show that something was done to one (e.g. disabled). So the real question here, is this: if I am disabled, who or what has done the disabling? This is not just grammar and semantics. This is a really important question because so much of the fear and loathing directed toward the identity label \u201cdisabled\u201d stems from a lack of consensus about the answer to this question. When I say \u201cI am disabled,\u201d I do not actually mean that I am disabled BY autism. I am not disabled BY Ehler-Danl\u00f6s Syndrome (EDS). I am not disabled BY hypernychthemeral syndrome (N24). These are all things I experience and things that contribute, each on their own level, to my sense of identity. I am Autistic. I do have EDS and N24. And in the case of EDS and N24, there are very clear impairments that are challenging for me to live with. I have unstable joints that cause pain. I have a disrupted circadian rhythm that causes difficulty in syncing with the rest of the world and frequently leads to exhaustion so chronic it\u2019s hard to function. But what is disabling me are things like ableist attitudes that want to reduce me to a burden or an object suitable for crafting inspiration porn. (Believe me, I find it pretty inspiring to wake up on time but I really don\u2019t want to be pictured in a meme for managing to make it to breakfast on time. Which, in case you were wondering, happens maybe four times a year, at best.) What is disabling me are barriers to access \u2014 social events with too little structure and too much noise; masses of stairs with no elevator or with an elevator that I am told not to use because I am able to walk; evening classes in very brightly lit rooms using red markers on a whiteboard that I am unable to see through my circadian therapy glasses. And attitudes about those access barriers that pile them even higher rather than lower them sufficiently for me to enter the social arena, the workplace, etc. \u201cWell, you look just fine to me. You can stop on the stairs to rest.\u201d \u201cBe grateful that you can walk at all. I\u2019m not here to pamper you.\u201d \u201cThat noise isn\u2019t so bad. Just tune it out. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d \u201cMy blue marker is dry. Take those tinted glasses off and you can read the board, too.\u201d My autism does come with some intrinsic difficulties, but they are nothing compared to the difficulties that come from living in a world that would rather people like me go through therapies designed to help us pretend we are not who we are so that others can be more comfortable being around us. EDS hurts every day but it doesn\u2019t hurt anywhere near as much as it hurts to be excluded by others who diminish my difficulties and grow impatient with me for being slower, doing less, and needing help. N24 can be frustrating and depressing, especially during those times when I\u2019m stuck only awake at night and only asleep in the daytime. I miss the sunshine. But what is even more frustrating and depressing is when my social isolation is compounded by a lack of understanding or even a desire to try to understand. \u201cIf you just got a better alarm clock.\u201d \u201cIf you just tried harder.\u201d \u201cIf you really wanted to be at my birthday party / wedding / barbecue you would have\u00a0gone to bed earlier the night before.\u201d When I say \u201cI am disabled,\u201d I am not saying that I am broken or defective or lacking something. I am not even referring to the impairments I have, real and challenging though they are. When I say \u201cI am disabled,\u201d that is shorthand for \u201cI am disabled by a society that is so caught up in its warped visions of success, beauty, and what makes a human being valuable that it rarely even sees me and when it does see me, it would rather pity me or be falsely and objectifyingly inspired by me than reach over to pull a chair up to the table so I can join in with the rest of the human race.\u201d Fortunately, however, I don\u2019t need to say any of\u00a0that anymore. Because from now on, I am not disabled. I AM LEGEND! (I would close the sarcasm tag, but it seems as pointless as making my bed every time I wake up, knowing I\u2019m just going to lay back down and mess it up again in a few hours.)

{"date": "2015/04/10", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . H is for Healthcare Access Healthcare access is a big topic today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). I see people commenting often, either grateful for ACA and their newfound healthcare access or angry about ACA and their extra costs or lost access. What often gets lost in the shuffle are those groups that did not have good healthcare access before the ACA and have not been significantly helped by the passing of ACA. Autistic people have struggled to get our health needs met for a long time and will be struggling with our healthcare access for some time to come. In the wake of the passage of ACA, our voices are often drowned out by the voices of those who say we need 40 hours per week of ABA therapy. All the attention when it comes to our healthcare gets focused on ABA (Google \u201cautistic health care\u201d or \u201cautism\u00a0ACA\u201d to see what I mean) \u00a0and our genuine medical needs too often get swept under the rug. Too many of our basic health care needs are not getting met and some aspects of autism make our difficulty accessing health care \u201cinvisible\u201d in the public discussions. As I see it, there are three main reasons why we are such an underserved population: bias against the value of Autistic lives, communication issues, healthcare provider ignorance. And the three solutions are acceptance, accommodation, and awareness/education. I think most people reading this don\u2019t need to be convinced that Autistic lives have value. But, just in case, I\u2019ll say this: we are human beings. We have thoughts, feelings, desires. We want to be healthy and live long, full lives (even if our\u00a0life-well-lived doesn\u2019t\u00a0always look the same as your life-well-lived.) We deserve the same respect, dignity, and chance in life as anyone\u00a0else. Doctors don\u2019t always feel that way, though. One example is the case of Mel Baggs who had to fight in 2013\u00a0to get a GJ tube \u2014 without the tube, Mel would die. And the doctors knew that. And they were trying to encourage Mel to just go home and die. Mel\u2019s case because known on the internet and\u00a0people from all over\u00a0the place called the hospital to protest . . . and Mel got the tube and is alive today. Mel wrote, \u201cBut I had to fight for this tube. Even though it was the only way to save my life. I had to fight against people who were certain I was better off dead. And I needed the help of a lot of people on the Internet, to do it. When I did get the tube, it was done without a working anesthetic. And even though the local anesthesia didn\u2019t work on me, even though I was yelling and screaming, they didn\u2019t stop to give me more, they just kept telling me that the Versed meant I wouldn\u2019t remember it later. Yeah right.\u201d \u2013 Mel Baggs,  Feeding tubes and weird ideas (More on failed attempts to provide appropriate\u00a0anesthesia to Autistics in a bit.) Another example is 23-year-old Autistic Paul Corby who was refused a heart transplant. Paul was in great health except for the left ventricular noncompaction in his heart. There is a long waiting list for hearts \u2013 several hundred people die every year while waiting for a heart. But Paul was young, otherwise healthy, and a great candidate for a transplant . . . if only he didn\u2019t have autism. His life was valued so much less than the lives of others that he was not even allowed on the waiting list. Three years later, Paul is still trying to get on a waiting list for a heart. In the meantime, he has written three novels for young adults. Paul just wants to live, to be able to walk up a few steps without losing his breath and becoming exhausted, to continue to write and play video games and to watch his nephews grow up.  His petition  nearly has 300,000 signers but still he is not allowed on a waiting list. These and so many other cases are prime examples of why we need increased autism acceptance. It is wrong for doctors to decide that it is better for someone to die because they have a developmental disability. Yes, there are risks with a feeding tube. Yes, there is a long waiting list for heart transplants. But Mel was willing to take those risks and Paul deserves to be on that list. Transplant lists have triage codes to govern the speed with which people move up the list and it is wrong to not allow Paul on the list at all when he could have at least\u00a0been sitting on a slow track for the last three years. Communication issues are another serious barrier to getting healthcare needs met. In the case of non-speaking Autistics, communication issues often revert to barrier of human value \u2014 those who do not speak are, quite unfairly, valued less by many people than those who do speak. But those of us who speak are often confronted with\u00a0communication barriers as well. Communication barriers include things like rushed appointments in which we are not given sufficient time to process language or in which we are \u201cpunished\u201d for \u201cwaiting so long to bring that up\u201d when we had been struggling for the whole visit to get the important words out. Communication barriers include things like not being able to focus because of fluorescent lights or not being able to hear the doctor\u2019s words because of clanging medical equipment. We can\u2019t communicate symptoms well if our doctors ask the wrong questions and we have sensory wiring that doesn\u2019t always allow us to know where our pain is or even that we do have pain. Sometimes doctors rush through instructions that are only given orally with no room for processing or remembering the information and no written record to help us recall what we were told. This is usually followed up with, \u201cany questions?\u201d\u2018 and an overwhelmed and overstimulated Autistic often just says, \u201cno,\u201d because there is not the time and mental space to process everything and make the question words. Communication barriers can be invisible to doctors because we are so compliant that we say everything is good when it isn\u2019t or because we come across as so intelligent that it seems impossible that we could also have significant deficits. Communication barriers can even be invisible to ourselves if we are so overwhelmed that we aren\u2019t even able to know what we don\u2019t know. Accommodations are the best answer to these sorts of barriers. One accommodation I use is a little digital voice recorder. I ask permission to record the consultation, saying, \u201cmy memory is like a sieve. This is just so I will remember what we talked about, okay?\u201d I have not yet had a doctor refuse to allow me to record our visit. Later, I transcribe the recording into a text document because written language is so much easier for me to process than spoken language. I add the transcript to my personal medical file and I can quickly and easily see how long I was supposed to soak a body part for or what I was supposed to eat or not eat with those pills, etc. I also try to come into an appointment with printed out notes or a bullet list whenever possible. Some doctors seem put off by my bringing notes, but it is the only way I can be sure that my needs will be met in such an overwhelming environment. Cynthia Kim has written a great essay  outlining some of the accommodations that will help Autistic people get better access to health care. Many of her points spill over into my third topic: educating healthcare providers about the ways that Autistic people are unusual in a medical setting. I already mentioned one of those: our unusual responses to pain. Our nervous systems do not respond the way the nervous systems of allistic (non-autistic) people respond. Sometimes a tiny splinter or a gentle bump causes unbearable pain. Sometimes a broken bone doesn\u2019t even register with us. We are both hypersensitive and hyposensitive to pain and one person can be both hyper-and hypo-sensitive, depending on the setting, the injury, what else we are currently coping with processing at the time. Health care professionals need to be very aware that not presenting with pain as a symptom does not necessarily rule out a diagnosis that normally requires pain to be present. And they need to be aware that when we express extreme pain from something that seems like it shouldn\u2019t hurt, we are not being \u201cbig babies\u201d we are in genuine pain from a nervous system that is often quite unpredictable and gives us genuine and often intolerable pain in situations that someone else might judge \u201cnot painful.\u201d On top of that, we are sometimes awake during anesthesia. We\u00a0sometimes remember clearly what transpired during \u201ctwilight sleep.\u201d We\u00a0sometimes under-respond to local anesthesia and are traumatized twice \u2013 once by the pain and a second time by health care professionals\u2019 response to our pain. I went without dental care for years because of a dentist who told me to stop screaming. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to scare the children, do you?\u201d he said. \u201cBut  I\u2019m  scared!!!\u201d I said. He was pulling out one of my back molars \u2014 the ones that have the curved roots and have to be pulled out in several different directions, like a corkscrew. My mouth was not numb. It hurt tremendously (and I have a pretty high pain threshold \u2014 I gave birth to an eleven-pound baby with no medication and got up afterward and walked out of the room by myself.) I was scared, I was in pain, and instead of comforting me or discussing further pain or anxiety management options, the dentist chose to shame and humiliate me for an honest and uncontrollable reaction to the situation. I was not afraid of dentistry before that visit. After that visit, I could not even go to the dentist for a routine check-up or teeth cleaning. Health care providers fail to realize what severe trauma they can cause or what a huge negative impact they can have on a patient\u2019s overall health. And, once again, it is hard to find useful information about autism and dental anesthesia because parent concerns \u2014 fear that anesthesia will cause or worsen autism \u2014 drown out the actual needs of actually Autistic people. Education is the answer here. Health care professionals need to be aware of atypical responses to anesthesia and other medications. They need to be aware of issues like touch sensitivity and be educated about the importance of letting Autistic people of all ages know exactly what is going to happen beforehand. Many of us are easily startled. Many of us do not show extreme fear in ways that untrained people are able to recognize. Many of us can have overwhelming levels of panic or pain that medical professionals are unprepared to deal with. Lynn Soraya has an excellent essay\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Psychology Today Web Site \u00a0about the difficulty of dealing with health care professionals who do not understand autism. Be sure to check out the pages she links to at the end of her essay (one of which, Cynthia Kim\u2019s, I have already linked in this essay.) So many of us have stories that range from very annoying to outright horror stories about being treated poorly by health care professionals who do not understand our needs or our presentation. Once again, autism awareness is not sufficient \u2014 it can make people feel good about \u201cdoing something to help\u201d but it doesn\u2019t actually help. When it comes to our health care needs, Autistic people need better education of healthcare providers, accommodations in the health care setting, and above all we need autism acceptance because we will never get our health needs met until we are fully recognized as deserving of respect and dignity and are\u00a0widely understood as being valuable\u00a0\u2014 not for what we can do, but for who we are: your brothers and sisters, fellow human beings. Until society is willing to own us as \u201cone of us\u201d instead of a frightening and dehumanized \u201cthem,\u201d we will continue to struggle and fight for the basic level of health care so many other people take for granted. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/h1.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "https://ballastexistenz.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/feeding-tubes-and-weird-ideas/", "https://www.change.org/p/help-my-autistic-son-get-a-life-saving-heart-transplant", "http://autismwomensnetwork.org/accessible-health-care-for-autistic-adults/", "https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/aspergers-diary/201406/barriers-effective-medical-care-autistic-adults"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/h-is-for-healthcare-access/", "title": "H is for Healthcare\u00a0Access"},
{"date": "2015/04/16", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . K is for Kids (But Probably Not the Ones You Thought) No, I don\u2019t mean all those Autistic kids. I mean Autistic people becoming parents \u2013 having kids of their own. Sometimes Autistics have Autistic kids, sometimes not. Either way, Autistics who become\u00a0adults are nearly invisible and Autistics who become parents are even more invisible\u00a0than that. Autistic parents have a hard time finding each other. they have a hard time finding information about their own situation \u2014 Google \u201cautistic parent\u201d and most of what you will end up with are links to information about being a non-autistic person with Autistic kids. Lots of Autistic parents are keeping a low profile or even \u201cin the closet\u201d if they are able to pass as non-autistic folks at all. There is a realistic fear of having one\u2019s kids taken away by a society and a government that believes Autistic people are not competent parents. Other Autistic parents struggle with people\u2019s attitudes \u2014 lots of people are very interested to hear about parenting Autistic children . . . until they realize that the information is coming from an Autistic adult. I would think people would be more, not less, interested in hearing what an Autistic person has to say about raising Autistic kids, but it turns out that, too often, that\u2019s not the case at all. Since I am not parenting kids, I want to turn to the voices of those who are. My dear friend Lei Wiley-Mydyske has a lot to say about what it\u2019s like to be an Autistic adult parenting an Autistic kid. The way that people talk over and through Autistic people is doubled when they are talking to an Autistic parent of an Autistic kid. \u201cThey told me that I don\u2019t know how his brain works like they do,  because they are  behaviorists and professionals who know about special education   and I am just a radical whose brain is flawed just like his. \u201d  Lei writes . (Pease follow the links and read every word she has written about how Autistic parents are silenced!) She is his parent. She is actually Autistic. And she is discounted as the person who knows the least about what he needs, because the school has autism awareness with no autism acceptance. Being Autistic so often means being shut out of our own lives. People want to listen to what everyone else has to say about autism but get dismissive or angry when actually Autistic people want to join the dialogue that is about . . . . US! Can you imagine a world where only men are permitted to discuss women\u2019s issues? What if only whites were allowed to talk about black issues? But we do live in a world where (unless you\u2019re Temple Grandin) no one wants to hear what Autistics have to say about autism. We live in a\u00a0world where the loudest voice about autism\u00a0\u2014 Autism Speaks \u2014 actively works to silence the voices of actually Autistic people. What? You didn\u2019t know about that? The Autistic community got Google to change hate speech in their search engine and Autism Speaks  reported it as something Google did, not something Autistic activists got Google to do . Autism Speaks made a documentary about AAC and focused only on the parents and caretakers,  shutting out and denigrating the voices of people who actually use AAC to communicate . Autism Speaks quoted\u00a0an Autistic \u00a0who protests them,  twisting her words to make it appear as if she supports Autism Speaks and persistently refused to remove her words for years . But as upsetting as it is that Autism Speaks does this to us, it is even more upsetting that the large organization is just echoing the way a majority of the general population respond to us. Look at the parenting blogs of non-autistic parents of Autistic kids and you will see that they have tens of thousands of followers. Look at the equally well-written blogs of Autistic parents of Autistic kids and you will see hundreds of followers, maybe a few thousand. There are a few Autistic authors with a high readership, but the bloggers talking about parenting Autistic children from the perspective of being an Autistic parent? Whatever the digital equivalent is of crickets chirping, that\u2019s what\u2019s surrounding their words. Huffington Post ran a series of personal essays titled \u201cAutism in our Family\u201d and all the essays were written by non-autistic family members of Autistic people. Lei Wiley-Mydyske wrote and asked them why they had no Autistic voices and Huffington Post invited her to submit an essay. She wrote about being an Autistic adult raising an Autistic child and Huffington Post turned it down. Now, while I think it\u2019s well-written, it could have been turned down for not being up to HuffPo\u2019s preferred level of writing quality. But I would have thought that the fact that it was an essay about raising an Autistic child while Autistic one\u2019s self would make the essay valuable enough for HuffPo to be willing to work with the author to help make the essay meet their publishing criteria. But that\u2019s not what happened. And, once again, an actually Autistic voice went unheard. Although you can hear it now. Lei published her essay in its entirety on her blog. \u201cEvery day, my son and I face discrimination and stigmatization for being openly Autistic. For all the \u201cawareness\u201d that is so popular now, there is very little understanding and even less in the way of\u00a0authentic inclusion. We both need a lot of support in this world, and getting that support without being\u00a0faced with a lot of hostility and resentment is difficult.\u201d \u2013 from  Autism and Activism in Our Family Cynthia Kim is another cherished friend who is also a\u00a0well-written Autistic parent. Not only is she\u00a0a parent and actually Autistic herself, she interviewed many other Autistic mothers for a three-part article about parenting on the spectrum. \u201cIf you Google \u201cautism\u201d and \u201cmother,\u201d you\u2019ll find hundreds of references to mothers of autistic children for every mention of mothers who are autistic. It would be easy to assume\u2013as perhaps many people have for a long time\u2013that autistic mothers simply don\u2019t exist. But if you dig a little deeper, you\u2019ll find that not only do we exist, we have a unique experience of what it means to be a parent.\u201d \u2013 from part one,  Motherhood: Autistic Parenting \u201cIn reality, there are already many autistic parents. Yet we seem to be largely invisible when it comes to autism-related supports. Services are available for autistic children and for parents of autistic children and for autistic adults who live with their parents or in supported living arrangements. But supports for autistic parents, regardless of their children\u2019s neurology, are mostly absent from the landscape.\u201d \u2013 from part two,  Motherhood: Autistic Parenting and Supports That Make a Difference \u201cHowever, as an autistic parent, we have a secret weapon\u2013one that can make our autistic children\u2019s lives less challenging than our own have been. Kim echoed the sentiments of many autistic moms, explaining how she and her autistic son have a special bond: \u201cWe love and accept each other enough to be ourselves. I am able to help him put words to things he doesn\u2019t yet understand. I am able to help him figure out sensory issues that bother him and help him find solutions that work for him. I\u2019m a problem solver and I work at something \u2019til all the kinks are worked out.\u201d \u201cAcceptance and understanding were common themes when autistic mothers talked about their parenting strengths. \u201cIt has been a huge benefit to have a shared neurology with my son,\u201d says Puddy. Not only is she able to read his stress signals and coping levels, helping him to prevent escalations in his behavior, she says that \u201che finds great comfort in the fact that I can understand his need for routines and stimming that others see as odd.\u201d\u201d \u2013 from part three,  Autistic Motherhood: Honoring Our Personal Choices K is for Kids and that\u2019s a realistic part of so many Autistic people\u2019s lives. Autism awareness knows nothing of the many mothers and fathers out there who are actually Autistic themselves. Because autism awareness is so entangled with a rhetoric of tragedy, the very idea of Autistic parents would be shocking: what if they passed their genetics on and had Autistic children?! From an autism awareness perspective, the thought is horrifying. But autism acceptance recognizes that there are already hundreds, probably thousands, of actually Autistic people quietly parenting, invisible to society, struggling and celebrating. It is time to move past awareness and accept the Autistic parents among us, offering encouragement and support. And listening to them. After all, as much as I do love and respect my friends who are non-autistic parents of Autistic children, who can you turn to for the truly insider view of raising Autistic children?

{"date": "2015/04/10", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . I is for Identity-first Language I know of several groups of people out there who want to be referred to by what\u2019s called person-first language. For example, \u201cpeople with narcolepsy\u201d is so common that it has a well-known abbreviation: PWN. I have watched discussions in diabetes forums in which people either don\u2019t care what they are called or insist very strongly that they should be called \u201cpeople with diabetes'\u201d\u00a0 and never \u201cdiabetics.\u201d People who feel strongly about person-first language tend to explain their stance by saying that they don\u2019t want to be identified with their disease. The disease is difficult and challenging and they don\u2019t feel like it is a part of who they are, but rather a tacked-on difficulty they cope with. It doesn\u2019t describe them, it doesn\u2019t define them, and they would be the same person with or without the condition \u2014 it is a surface-level layer that could be peeled away without removing anything significant about the person underneath. And not only do I respect those groups\u2019 choice of person-first language, but I agree with them. I don\u2019t have narcolepsy but I have another serious sleep-related disability (hypernychthemeral syndrome a.k.a. Non-24) and while it doesn\u2019t bother me at all if someone refers to me as \u201can N24\u201d rather than \u201ca person with N24\u201d it is not a deep-rooted part of who I am. If a miracle cure could remove my N24, I would be the same person I was before, just with a much healthier sleep pattern. It\u2019s not a part of who I am. But autism is different. Autism is a pervasive developmental disability \u2014 it is pervasive, it pervades every part of my being. Autism is not a layer over top of a non-autistic person. Autism is a word to describe a different type of brain, with different wiring. Autism is a brain that is different in both structure and function. And as an amateur neurobiologist, I believe that my brain is who I am. Someone else might have religious views and say that their soul is who they are, but even they will likely admit that the material vehicle of that soul is seated in the brain. The brain is where thoughts come from. It is where the control panel is for the excretion of the biological chemicals that cause emotions to be experienced. When we see, hear, smell, feel, taste, it is our brain that tells us what we are sensing. Every part of the body comes back to the brain. So I cannot be separated from my autism. I\u2019ve met people in the diabetes community who hate the phrase \u201cmy diabetes\u201d and refuse to use it because they don\u2019t want to claim the disease as theirs but rather view it as an unwanted invader in their body. If I tried to say that about MY autism, I would be calling my own brain a foreign body that I want to eject. That sounds like the basis for a horror movie to me. It is MY brain! It has MY thoughts and MY feelings in it. It is filled with MY memories. I need MY brain. And MY brain is an autistic brain. It is MY autism. Mine. So to call me a \u201cperson with autism\u201d is, at best, disturbing to me. I strive to temper my reaction because I know that people have good intentions. But the good intentions do not make an offensive statement innocuous. It is still offensive to me when people say things like \u201cfight autism\u201d (you want to fight my brain? Why do you hate me?) or call me a \u201cperson with autism\u201d (why not call me a \u201cperson with a brain\u201d?\u00a0 To me it is the same thing.) One of the hallmarks of person-first language, as you may have noticed from the examples I used, is that it is a way to separate a person from something that is considered unworthy, unwanted, ugly, or undesirable. Narcolepsy is a difficult and challenging condition and the only positive I\u2019ve noticed about it is the way it brings people together in a loving community that cares for one another. (I really do love the narcolepsy community! PWN are among my very best friends!) Diabetes is a similar case \u2013 there is nothing good about having a malfunctioning pancreas\u00a0or metabolism\u00a0and it makes sense to want to use language that separates that dysfunction from one\u2019s core identity. But autism is not the same. It brings both challenges and rewards. My sensory challenges make the world a very painful place to live in, but they also bring an exquisite sensitivity that causes music to bring me to tears of ecstasy. I process spoken words more slowly than people around me but I process numbers and symbolic logic much more quickly. I have a hard time figuring out what emotions people are speaking with their face, tone of voice, body positioning but I develop strong and deep and loyal bonds to other people. I have difficulty regulating many of my body functions such as heat and cold or being overwhelmed by too much motion, light, sounds, etc. but I have access to a\u00a0deep, deep, deep joy by manipulating movement, light, sounds, etc. on my own. Note that those are my personal pattern of weaknesses and strengths. Each Autistic person has their own balance sheet of challenges and joys \u2014 they don\u2019t all look just like mine. But this is the thing: we each have challenges and strengths. Autism isn\u2019t all negative. It isn\u2019t all challenge. And because autism is about the entire brain and how it is wired (as well as genetic factors and co-morbid conditions that we have a greater chance of manifesting \u2014 my sleep disorder being one of those conditions) it is not a thing that can be peeled away from us. If it were possible to re-wire our brains and re-code our genetics, the challenges might be removed but the delights would go along with them. We would lose the disabling parts of autism but we would lose the joy of autism along with them. It\u2019s all tangled together into one big crazy quilt of identity \u2014 it is all a significant and rooted part of who we are. Without autism, we would not be who we are. And this is why so many of us (although not everyone) ask that identity-first language be used to refer to us. That is why you meet so many Autistic adults and teens and children who ask to be called \u201cAutistic,\u201d not \u201cpeople with autism.\u201d Because it really is a part of our identity, every bit as much as (or more than!) our gender, our nationality, our hair and eye color, our career if we have one, our major at school if we attend. It is as deeply rooted a part of our identity as being a human being. It is simply who we are. And some of us also choose to capitalize the A in Autistic as a statement of identity as well.  Lydia Brown sums it up well when zie says , \u201cI capitalize the word \u201cAutistic\u201d as if it were a proper adjective, for the same reason the Deaf and Blind communities capitalize the respective adjectives \u201cDeaf\u201d and \u201cBlind.\u201d We do it for the same reason Black people often capitalize that word. We capitalize it as a proper adjective or noun to represent our community and our identity.\u201d Please think about what I have written here the next time you are tempted to say that you love your child but hate autism. Will your child hear the difference? So many of us are hurt by those kinds of statements. Don\u2019t set your child up to hate who she is at her very core. Think about the language you use. I will leave you with an essay by Jim Sinclair that is currently over 15 years old and is a vital piece of our community\u2019s\u00a0treasured and living history:  Why I Dislike Person-First Language . \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/i1.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autistichoya.com/p/introduction-to-autism-faqs-of-autism.html", "http://autismmythbusters.com/general-public/autistic-vs-people-with-autism/jim-sinclair-why-i-dislike-person-first-language/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/i-is-for-identity-first-language/", "title": "I is for Identity-first\u00a0Language"},

The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . L is for Love Love. Those who say we have no empathy claim we are not capable of it. But we already established back at letter E that Autistic empathy doesn\u2019t always look just like non-autistic empathy so who can marvel when I suggest that Autistic love has its own flavor as well? If you doubt that we can love, know that the only thing that has sustained me sufficiently to write thousands of words exploring autism acceptance this month is love. We are half-way through the month and I am still seeing a high number of advertisements for Autism Speaks, complete with the tragedy language. Imagine that: a whole month each year is set aside to make everyone aware of what a burden you are, how much better the world will be when there are no longer people like you in it. What could sustain me through a month of that? Love. I am writing because I love Autistic people and because I want to do what I can to increase acceptance. Yes, I promise you we can love. There are many days when love is the only thing that sustains me. Beth Ryan writes of her Autistic daughter, \u201cShe lavishes love and affection those close to her. She loves. \u00a0She loves. \u00a0She loves. Don\u2019t tell me she doesn\u2019t love. She LOVES. Think Autistic people are incapable of loving? \u00a0That says more about you than it does about the people you\u2019re mis-characterizing.\u201d \u2013 from  ability to love: presume competence But that is not my favorite quote from Beth about love. She makes it abundantly clear that it is selfish to demand that Autistic people express love in ways identical to the ways non-autistic people express love when she writes, \u201cI often hear things like, \u201cIt is so sad that Autistic children can\u2019t tell their parents that they love them.\u201d Actually, more often I hear parents say, \u201cI want my child to be able to tell me that he loves me.\u201d When I think about Evie\u2019s communication, that\u2019s just about the furthest thing from my mind. I want to hear that her tummy hurts. I want to hear that she wants a glass of water. I want to hear that she is hungry. I want to hear the things that make her happy, scared, sad, angry, frustrated, tired. I mean \u201chear\u201d figuratively, not literally. I do not care if she speaks or points to a picture or clicks an icon on her ipad or types. I want communication for Evie. I want to stop guessing at what she needs and thinks so that I can answer her needs.\u201d \u2013 from  the words i want to hear Let that sink in for a moment. Could it be that the people who say that we Autistics don\u2019t know how to love . . . could it be that  they  are the ones who need more lessons in loving? Beth gets it. Beth sees that her daughter loves and Beth sees that being there when her child needs her is more loving than wringing her hands because she has to see her daughter\u2019s love, as it is lived out in each moment of her life, instead of getting those three words from her child? And this is what autism acceptance looks like: it looks like Beth, seeing her daughter\u2019s love and caring more about meeting her daughter\u2019s needs than about getting verbal confirmation of what she already knows to the core of her being: that her daughter is filled with love. Because we are. We are filed with love. See how K says it, \u201cThe way I love? It is deep. Autism is deep love. People write it off as special interest or obsession, but even if it\u2019s not something I can excel at, I can excel at loving what I love, loving what I do, loving who I love. Autism is being able to be consumed by love and interest, it is giving 100% because it is an insult to the thing one loves to give any less. Autism is going big or going home.\u201d \u2013 from  What autism really is I wish I could say that anyone who is loved by an Autistic person deeply knows that they are loved, but sadly I still see that some people are unsure of the love, even in the middle of receiving it. I\u2019ve even watched video footage of more than one mother saying they just don\u2019t know if their child is even aware of them or knows who they are . . . while their child is clearly showing love toward their mother, even in the middle of her doubts. It is a sad thing to see. Do not doubt it. We do love! Researchers doubt it. And they come up with strange theories about why we don\u2019t love. For example, some researchers depleted the oxytocin and serotonin in mice (in MICE!) and saw that they didn\u2019t want to socialize any more, so they said that we don\u2019t get neurochemical rewards from interacting with others. Because some mice didn\u2019t like having the oxytocin and serotonin depleted in their brains. Seriously? Seriously?? \u201c\u201cPeople with autism-spectrum disorders may not experience the normal reward the rest of us all get from being with our friends,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Robert Malenka, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University said in a statement, \u201cFor them, social interactions can be downright painful.\u201d\u201d \u2013 from  What the \u2018Love Hormone\u2019 Has to Do With Autism Yes, social interactions can be painful. But it has nothing to do with mice. And I\u2019m pretty sure it has nothing to do with oxytocin. People smell funny. They are loud. They move quickly in unpredictable ways that raise my anxiety levels. They randomly touch me, often for no clear reason, and almost always without asking first. They make fun of me. They get angry. They say, \u201cwhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d They say, \u201caw poor widdle baby is crying again!\u201d And not in a comforting way; they laugh at me as they say it. They want to socialize in places with loud espresso machines. Or glaring fluorescent lights. They want to go to the mall and they laugh if they\u2019re told the mall is scary. But scientists don\u2019t know any of this. They think they can learn more about how and whether we love by altering mice than by interacting with us. Who was it that finds interactions painful? Put down the mice and talk to us! We do love. And even those of us who don\u2019t use our voices, even those of us who don\u2019t use words at all, can tell you more about love than your hormonally-challenged mice will. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/l1.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "http://loveexplosions.net/2014/11/05/ability-to-love-presume-competence/", "http://loveexplosions.net/2013/04/11/the-words-i-want-to-hear/", "http://thisisautismflashblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/what-autism-really-is.html", "http://healthland.time.com/2013/09/12/what-the-love-hormone-has-to-do-with-autism/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/l-is-for-love/", "title": "L is for\u00a0Love"},

The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . J is for Joke. \u00a0 \u00a0 I am not a joke. \u00a0 Autism awareness means more people know about us and can make mean jokes about us. I have seen and heard lots of people making fun of us. They wouldn\u2019t do that if they weren\u2019t aware of us. They also wouldn\u2019t do it if they accepted us. This is why I will never work for autism awareness or disability awareness without acceptance automatically attached to it. Autism awareness is just awareness and leaves us exposed and vulnerable to mocking and abuse. Autism acceptance automatically includes autism awareness \u2014 because you can\u2019t accept something without being aware of it \u2014 but autism acceptance goes a step further. Autism acceptance says not only that autism is real and everywhere around you, in roughly 1% of the population, but that Autistic people have value and should be treated with dignity, accommodation, and acceptance and not as a burden, a thing to fear, or a joke. \u00a0 I was treated as a joke on Saturday because I do not move and talk the same way most people do. No one should be treated as a joke for being different. I was doing nothing wrong. I was trying to buy parts for a project I am building. I was hurting no one. Disability acceptance in general and autism acceptance specifically are movements that strive to teach others to be kind and understanding when they encounter those who look, sound, move, communicate, and live in ways that are different. I know I am not the only one who gets treated poorly for looking and sounding different. All the time, my friends are mentioning the ways they are treated for looking different, moving differently, using a wheelchair or an assistance animal. \u00a0 I used to date a man with muscular dystrophy and when we would go out dancing, I would see people behind him pointing, laughing, imitating the way he danced. It made me angry and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t want to tell him. I didn\u2019t want to ruin our evening out. I couldn\u2019t believe people would do that right in front of me, knowing I was with him. They hid their jokes from him but they didn\u2019t bother to hide them from me. I never understood why people thought it was okay to make fun of my date right in front of me like that. \u00a0 Saturday it was my turn to be mocked and the bullies didn\u2019t bother to try to hide it from me. I was in a home improvement store, having a conversation with an employee about the materials I needed for my project, when two other employees approached, pushing carts of supplies. One of them turned to me and said, \u201cis that a new dance you invented?\u201d Then both of them did an exaggerated imitation of the way my body was moving while I was talking and they both laughed loudly. I was too shocked to respond. Did they think I would share their joke? Or were they really that cruel? It felt like being back in middle school again. I was horrified. \u00a0 I tried to complete my shopping, but I felt humiliated and I felt shame because I was crying in public. I usually have a handkerchief but I\u2019d forgotten to carry one that day so I ended up blowing my nose on my gloves.\u00a0I put the materials I had intended to buy\u00a0back on the\u00a0shelves\u00a0and left. I had to sit in my car and calm down before I could safely drive the few blocks to a competitor\u2019s home improvement store where I was treated with kindness and acceptance. I was feeling particularly emotionally fragile, but everyone\u00a0in the second store\u00a0was kind to me and one of the employees who helped me was visibly disabled, making me feel like I was in a store that respects and values disabled people as employees and as customers. Being treated better at the second store helped restore some of my dignity, but still I didn\u2019t sleep that night. I lay in bed, unable to chase away memories of being mocked for being different, unable to chase away tears of sorrow and shame. \u00a0 Those men have probably long forgotten the \u201cweird girl\u201d they laughed at. I am still living with the emotional and physical consequences of the experience. I spent years trapped in schools full of bullies. There is a sort of complex\u00a0PTSD that emerges from a childhood of being daily trapped in an environment of physical and emotional torment. Today I am exhausted, nauseated, and haunted by memories I had thought I\u2019d put behind me. For them it was a moment\u2019s amusement. For me it is days of recovery. \u00a0 There were so many other J words on my list to choose from today and \u201cjoke\u201d was not originally one of them. But at the last minute, I knew that this was my word today. I have been treated as a joke since childhood. No one should be treated as a joke! It is not okay to mock disabled people. Autism acceptance includes teaching people that we are not different on purpose and we do not deserve to be mocked for our differences. Making fun of us for the ways we don\u2019t fit in will not teach us to fit in. It will only make us feel sad or angry and excluded. In those without a strong sense of self, it will make us feel bad and wrong about who we are. The world has enough pain and suffering in it already. Choose to bring light and happiness into the world. Choose to make others feel better about who they are, not worse. Do not make cruel jokes about the people around you. Choose acceptance.

{"date": "2016/01/31", "body": "Workers in a sheltered workshop I started traveling after two decades living in high desert. When I hit Nebraska, the humidity was stifling. By the end of June, sweltering in Missouri, I was firmly reacquainted with mosquitoes, a pest I\u2019d been blissfully separated from for years. I needed a way to open my van windows for ventilation without being attacked by biting and stinging insects. \nI found a product that would be perfect for my needs \u2014 custom-sized pieces of tent screen with magnets along the edges to hold them to the outside of vehicles, covering the windows. A brilliant idea! An idea, it turns out, that I am now crafting on my own (which means mine will be rainbow colored hand crafted art, of course) but would have rather just purchased. In fact, I put a pair of them into my online shopping cart but before I could buy them, I noticed the words on the website declaring that the company was proud to be making these products in a sheltered workshop. \nI will not support sheltered workshops. Not only did I not buy the screens, I emailed the company and opened a dialogue with the owner: I was about to buy a pair of these \u2013 amazing product and exactly what I need \u2013 when I read this on your site: \u201cManufactured locally in partnership with a Missouri  Sheltered   Workshop .\u201d \n \nDoes that mean the people who make these aren\u2019t paid minimum wage for their work? I can\u2019t buy these if the people making them are being exploited. What are the conditions in this  sheltered   workshop ? Is it like the Salvation Army  sheltered   workshops  where people work all day for just a few dollars? \n \nI need to know what my money would be supporting if I bought a set of these. They are so awesome, but I can\u2019t commit until I know. \nThe business owner got back to me quickly and, of course, defended the company\u2019s choice of sheltered workshop labor: \n We are very proud to be utilizing the services of a local  Sheltered   Workshop , which by definition means \u201ca private non-profit, state, or local government institution that provides employment opportunities for individuals who are developmentally, physically, or mentally impaired, to prepare for gainful work in the general economy.\u201d How effective these institutions are has been a long debate but one must look at it on a more personal level to see the value\u2026.what if I were mentally challenged, or my child, to where I could not hold a job in the \u2018normal\u2019 workplace? I know I would certainly appreciate the opportunity to be made to feel productive, earning a paycheck would be a bonus;) \n It is a very nice facility located just outside of Springfield Missouri. They conduct work studies every year to reevaluate the time it takes them to do all the things required to manufacture our product, sewing, cutting fabric, counting magnets, processing orders and creating the labels for shipping, then we are invoiced according to the guidelines set by the Department of Labor. You can rest assured you will be helping a good cause whenever you buy [our product]. \n \n So I wrote back: \n \n Thank you for your prompt and courteous reply. \n I don\u2019t have to imagine what it would be like to be disabled and unemployable. I am developmentally disabled and after years of struggle to try to keep a job and periods of homelessness due to being unable to support myself, I now live on social security disability. I am fortunate to be able to drive and I live in a minivan which I have made into a cozy home for myself and my cat. (Thus my interest in window screens.) It is the highest quality of living I have ever found on my fixed income. \n Vocational rehabilitation was unable to assist me in employment and several times I have been pushed toward a  sheltered   workshop  as my \u201conly option,\u201d sometimes with hints that I would lose my disability payments which I rely on to survive if I did not show that I was willing to try to work by taking one of these very low paying jobs. With proper supports, I am employable, but the existence of  sheltered   workshops  meant there\u00a0were not programs available to support me in employment that pays minimum wage or higher. \n It is not about pride in feeling productive and the \u201cbonus\u201d of a very small paycheck (I could make more money selling my blood than working in a  sheltered   workshop  and, for a time, I did sell my blood to make ends meet.) It is about government programs that bully people into working in places that are legally allowed to pay pennies for the labor \u2014 like the  workshop  that makes your products, I\u2019m sure, based on the wording of your response. That cheap labor\u00a0keeps your costs down and increases your profit margin so of course companies\u00a0think\u00a0 sheltered   workshops  are a fine thing. \n Although  sheltered   workshops  are promoted as transitional work, studies have shown that moving disabled people straight into supported employment has better outcomes: more workers are able to achieve and maintain\u00a0supported employment in the long run when moved straight into it than when  sheltered   workshops  are used as a stepping stone. Supported employment costs the state less, workers have higher pay, and workers are more successfully integrated into the community rather than segregated. The main reason  sheltered   workshops  have not already been abolished is that companies who benefit from employing workers paid sub minimum wages have lobbied to keep the  workshops  in place, arguing that they are needed because \u201cno one else will employ these people\u201d (despite studies showing otherwise.) \n I can\u2019t applaud American workers getting paid $1/hour. Disability activists have been lobbying to abolish  sheltered   workshops  for years now and as much as I need window screens, I can\u2019t abandon my strongly held political and ethical beliefs that the workers who make my screens be paid at least minimum wage for their time. I will continue to sleep with my windows rolled up while I\u00a0look for\u00a0something else to protect me from the mosquitoes up here in northwestern Missouri where I am currently camped. \n Thank you for your time and honesty. \n \n I wasn\u2019t surprised that the business owner did not like my response. But she was very polite, much to her credit. \n You obviously know from first hand experience what would be the ideal alternative then, other than what our government has designed. We actually were trying to use the services of \u201cprofessional seamstresses\u201d but the job was too mundane or repetitive, so we went through one after another, after another. We were thinking we might need to look at China for production, as much as we did NOT want to promote their welfare, when someone suggested we look into the  Sheltered   Workshops  to see if they might be interested in the tasks needed to produce [our product.] We felt it was a win win, keeping the dollars here, keeping them in our own state, and helping the disabled. I wish you well in your travels and hope you find a solution that will work for your needs. \n As I pointed out to her, our government does not always have the best ideas or our highest interests in mind. I had gleaned her political stance from the way her business page was worded, so I turned to a voice I discerned she would trust enough to listen to: Ronald Reagan. \u201cThe most terrifying words in the English language are: I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d Once I reminded her that her own political stance is one that does not thoughtlessly trust the government but always looks toward the greater good, she seemed to be more receptive to my words. We ended the conversation on a high note, with her agreeing with my statement, which she called well-spoken: \u201cIf you want to help the disabled, support self-advocacy and integration in the community with supports. Don\u2019t assume the government has the best interests of the most vulnerable members of the population at heart. It rarely does. The almighty dollar is king and justice is only served when it is expedient to commerce.\u201d The company still uses sheltered workshops, but hopefully I\u2019ve given the owner something to think about. She was right: I do know the \u201cideal alternative\u201d and it is expedient to commerce as well. What is holding us back from improving the labor situation for disabled people are misplaced emotions and feel-good legislation. The ideal alternative to sheltered workshops is supported employment in the community.  Supported employment costs the government less  and has a  net benefit for consumers . Supported employment is better for teaching work skills and endurance. Supported employment integrates disabled workers into the larger community rather than keeping them isolated away from the rest of society. The business owner with whom I corresponded said that they offer people \u201cthe opportunity to be made to feel productive,\u201d and that if she or her child were disabled, \u201cearning a paycheck would be a bonus.\u201d The work I do \u2014 writing, presenting and also the craftwork I do, making jewelry and hats, the art I draw for t-shirts or book covers, the music I compose and record \u2014 is such satisfying work that I would still do it if no one else valued it enough to pay for it. In fact, it is work I did do without pay for several years before I began to see income from it. The fulfilling nature of the work and the joy of building my own business have sustained me through times of extremely sub-minimum wage income from it. But that has been my choice. Vocational Rehabilitation has often been at a loss as to what to do with me. Or about me. Rarely for me. I have gotten the subtly threatening letters and phone calls that hope I will interpret them as commands rather than suggestions. I have experienced the efforts meant to herd me into a sheltered workshop, banking on me being so afraid of losing my disability benefits that I will hand my life over to someone else to do with as they will. I have faced the pressure to take an extremely low-paying job \u201ccutting fabric and counting magnets\u201d to mass-produce someone else\u2019s design in a legal sweatshop. If I had a parent like the business owner with whom I communicated, I would have gotten pressure at home to yield to the coerced labor as well. Think for a moment about the protests against companies like Nike. Sensitive, compassionate, progressive Americans decided it was unethical to purchase products made by people with so few options they were a captive workforce for the pennies per day wages they earned in the repetitive, mind-numbing work required to create designer shoe and clothes for people who paid thousands of times the labor cost in order to own elite brands. But somehow all of that is okay when the people being exploited are disabled Americans instead of impoverished citizens of a developing nation. Worse, people in developing nations who work in sweatshops are often the wealthiest members of their society while disabled Americans who work in sheltered workshops are among the poorest in theirs. Even worse, sweatshop conditions at sheltered workshops\u00a0are defended on the grounds that they are beneficial for the exploited workers, a sort of occupational therapy that will allegedly lead to higher self esteem and a sense of connection with a community one is not privileged to participate in beyond the exploitation one receives at its hands. How is this even still legal, let alone right? This is not work that is so fulfilling one would continue to do it for free. This is not work that gives a sense of ownership. This is glorified minimum wage labor that is being paid at rates so far below minimum wage that undocumented migrant farm workers make more money per hour than many sheltered workshop participants. The thing I find most confusing about sheltered workshops is that there aren\u2019t more people angry about how our system is treating some of\u00a0the most vulnerable members of our society. Supported work within the community teaches people how to get, keep, and flourish in jobs. Supported work within the community helps disabled people to be more active in and in touch with other people \u2014 all kinds of other people, not just other disabled people and the professionals employed to supervise them. And if the work is some of that boring, repetitive work that many of us do or have done but\u00a0few people\u00a0really enjoy, it\u2019s okay because the worker is getting a fair wage (or as fair as wages ever get in America) and not being coerced into doing it for pennies because it is supposed to be good for them or a great place to learn. And, by the way, sheltered workshops are not a great place to learn how work works. Over the last half decade or so, federal policy makers\u00a0have been\u00a0moving away from the sheltered workshop model (so why are there still so many sheltered workshops out there?!), largely for the simple reason that it does not work. In a 2011 speech, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Samuel R. Bagenstos said, \u201cwhen individuals with disabilities spend years\u2014 indeed, decades\u2014in congregate programs doing so-called jobs like these, yet do not learn any real vocational skills, we should not lightly conclude that it is the disability that is the problem. Rather, the programs\u2019 failure to teach any significant, job-market-relevant skills leaves their clients stuck. As a recent review of the literature concludes, \u2018the ineffectiveness of sheltered workshops for helping individuals progress to competitive employment is well established.'\u201d Bagenstos works in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. He knows the score here. So why are so many communities and people still clinging to sheltered workshops? It\u2019s time for a change. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.ncd.gov/publications/2012/August232012", "http://www.worksupport.com/documents/economics_jvr.pdf"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2016/01/31/why-sheltered-workshops-need-to-end/", "title": "Why Sheltered Workshops Need to\u00a0End"},
{"date": "2015/04/17", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . M is for Murder I have been dreading M. I don\u2019t want to write this. I have to write this. This is one of the most important letters in the autism acceptance alphabet because this is the very worst outcome of autism awareness without autism acceptance. This is the grim truth about what happens when we are portrayed as pointless burdens who crumble marriages, bankrupt families, and destroy the lives of everyone around us. When parents learn about their child\u2019s diagnosis of autism and turn to others for help, they need hope and they need realism. They need to hear from people who have been living the life they are just beginning to realize they are also living and they need to hear from those voices that, yes, it is hard. But all parenting is hard. They need to hear that all parenting also has joy and satisfaction and they need to hear that they will find that joy and satisfaction, too. They need to find a community that is supportive when parents need to vent about how difficult it is but also a community that does not condone hate speech toward innocent children. Sadly, what too many parents find is a community filled with gloom and doom and endless complaint. They too often\u00a0find themselves in a community of people who portray themselves as martyrs and victims and their beautiful children as abusers and punishments. Some parents manage to rise above the negativity. In\u00a0 What I Wish I\u2019d Been Made Aware\u00a0of When My Daughter Was Diagnosed With Autism , Ariane writes, \u201cDisregard any organization that describes autism and your child as tragic, an epidemic, a burden or any other word generally reserved for warfare. \u00a0If you read or hear something that causes you to feel fear, walk away, it is most likely inaccurate and intended to make you afraid. \u00a0None of us are able to help our children when we are terrified. \u00a0Fear can cause us to make decisions we will later regret.\u201d This is the voice of experience. Ariane\u00a0is a strong ally to her Autistic daughter, Emma, and to the entire Autistic community, but she has written about the regrets she has over past beliefs that came from a place of fear. Emma\u2019s family was living in fear because their first exposure to autism consisted of doctors, organizations, and a community of parents who were also filled with fear instead of acceptance. Emma\u2019s parents, Ariane and Richard,\u00a0were afraid, but they also saw so much in their daughter and when they finally met Autistic adults, they were eager to learn from us. Emma\u2019s family are not the sort of people to get mired in feelings of victimhood. I know a little bit of the family\u2019s history and I have a huge amount of respect for everyone in the family \u2014 they have all been through so much,\u00a0long before Emma was born,\u00a0and they are strong survivors. They are the kind of people who find their way out of shadows of fear. Too many other people get stuck in those shadows and the children suffer as a result. Sometimes parents (or other guardians) are s frightened and stuck that\u00a0 they kill their children. The parents are so filled with despair and grief that they decide it would be better if their child were dead. Sometimes those parents also try to commit suicide along with their child. Some succeed, but most times, those suicide attempts are half-hearted and unsuccessful, mere gestures. Sometimes the parents don\u2019t intentionally murder their children. Sometimes they kill them accidentally through the application of brutal \u201ctreatments\u201d such as chelation or bleach enemas. I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re asking yourself right now how any parent could give their child a bleach enema. The answer? Fear. Love is stronger than fear, but fear can hide love too well for the power to take effect. The reason I am writing about autism acceptance \u2014 the reason our whole community is making such a lot of noise about acceptance \u2014\u00a0is because awareness without acceptance is deadly. Literally deadly. Awareness without acceptance is fear. Fear of autism hurts Autistics. A culture of fear leads to murder. We haven\u2019t got complete records of how many Autistics get killed by their parents of caretakers, but the  2015 Day of Mourning vigil website  says that over 70 people with disabilities have been murdered by their parents or caretakers in the last 5 years. That\u2019s more than one per month. The first murdered Autistic I became aware of was\u00a0Marcus Fiesel, killed at age 4 in 2006. Marcus loved flowers and Bob the Builder. Everyone who knew him said he was a sweet and lovable boy. His mother was\u00a0having a hard time keeping the household together, so Marcus was in foster care. His foster parents wanted to go out of town so they put tape on Marcus\u2019s mouth and wrists and rolled him up\u00a0in a carpet and locked him in a closet while they\u00a0left town for the weekend. Marcus died from overheating and suffocation. As devastating and depressing as it was to read about the murder of Marcus Fiesel, in the decade since then, I have watched  person after person  murdered. It\u00a0is easy\u00a0for me to believe that the killings happen more\u00a0often than once a month because I see the news stories every month, sometimes two in a month. There are a few isolated killings that get a strong public reaction of outrage toward the killer\u00a0\u2014 the most recent was when London\u00a0McCabe\u2019s mother threw him off a bridge to drown. But more often, the reaction I see in the comments under news stories are horrifying to me. People defend the killers. They say that it is \u201cunderstandable\u201d that they \u201csnapped\u201d because we are such \u201cburdens.\u201d The ableism is thick and I have learned to avert my eyes from the comment sections under these news stories because it is so angering and distressing to see so many people justifying the murder of people like me. Emily Willingham wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s become typical, again and again, for parents who murder their autistic children to get some kind of a \u201cpass\u201d from the commentariat and the news media because, well, autism is such a challenge\u201d That\u2019s in part because some autism organizations and members of the news media have successfully presented autism as a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201ckidnapper\u201d instead of as the developmental condition that it is. So in the public mind, an allegedly overwhelmed mother with \u201c no supports\u201d should certainly be pitied and not judged harshly for killing the \u201cmonster.\u201d\u201d \u2013 from  If a Parent Murders an Autistic Child, Who Is to Blame? Shannon Des Rocha Rosa wrote, \u201cOur autistic children\u2019s lives are no less valuable than other children\u2019s lives. But they are often harder, especially when parents focus on normalizing or curing autism, rather than supporting and understanding children who depend on them. [\u2026] We need to, must do better by our autistic children. We must do our best to support and understand them and their autism, and stop torturing them by trying to turn them into the non-autistic child they will never be. Specifically, if you cannot accept your child\u2019s autism for their sake, then please \u2014 do it so your role as a parent will be easier. If that\u2019s what it takes to stop someone from killing their autistic child, so be it.\u201d \u2013 from  We Cannot Excuse Parents Who Kill Autistic Children Michelle Sutton wrote, \u201cThe reason people feel sorry for me when they find out my kids are autistic is that they don\u2019t know anything about autism except that it makes them hard to live with. They know this because the media tells them. \u201cAnd this is what I\u2019m talking about when I say \u201cautism awareness\u201d doesn\u2019t help autistic people, and that the media has no place blaming autistic children for their own murders. \u201cSo instead of listening to the facts being spoken by autistic people and their allies, people listen to the media tell them that autistic people are violent and difficult to live with. So society moves down the slippery slope of assumption until it reaches the point where vilifying children based on a diagnosis is acceptable.\u201d \u2013 from  Autism, Stigma and Murder And this is why we need autism acceptance. Autism awareness kills. Autism awareness stigmatizes. Autism awareness blames Autistic people for the crimes others commit against us. Autism acceptance welcomes us to be part of the big human family: respected, valued, protected. We need to build a world where parents learning about their child\u2019s diagnosis are welcomed into a community of love and support, not of fear. We need to build a world where a huge organization cannot vacuum up all the available donation money by telling us that Autistic children are \u201clike lepers\u201d and their parents are \u201clike Saint Francis of Assisi.\u201d We need to build a world where it is unthinkable for people to side with a murderer and blame their victim for being such a \u201chorrible burden\u201d that killing them was \u201cunderstandable.\u201d We need to build a world of autism acceptance.

{"date": "2015/04/19", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . N is for No Means No As adults we talk about things like rape prevention and use the slogan \u201cNo Means No.\u201d That is to say,\u00a0respecting someone else\u2019s \u201cno,\u201d at any time, for any reason,\u00a0is the rational, adult, ethical thing to do. There are a lot of strong and powerful words being put out about respecting other people\u2019s boundaries and autonomy. A strange thing about \u201cno means no\u201d is that it only applies to adults. The more vulnerable members of our society \u2014 children \u2014 are rarely allowed to own their \u201cno.\u201d And then somehow we expect them to morph overnight from people who have spent nearly two decades having their boundaries violated by people more powerful than them (adults) to people who are eager to respect other people\u2019s boundaries, even the boundaries of those who are weaker than them (often women, thus the rape prevention connection of this slogan.) And, for the moment here, I am not talking about just Autistic children. This is something we do to all children, regardless of neurology. Now, you\u2019re probably saying that sometimes children need to have their boundaries violated and I will not argue that with you. For example, we have to teach children that there are big, fast-moving, deadly cars to pay attention to and not run in front of. This is a perennial facet of parenting \u2014 in other generations there were Roman soldiers to not piss off or hungry saber-toothed tigers and dire wolves to not look like lunch in front of. Another example is life-saving/changing medical treatment. Kids don\u2019t want surgery or chemotherapy or orthodontic braces but parents who choose their child\u2019s health over their boundaries are making a loving choice. Hopefully, there is lots of talking about outcomes and the boundaries are violated in as gentle and informative a way as possible. There are some boundaries in childhood that are pretty much inevitably going to get dismissed for a particular life-and-death sort of purpose and that\u2019s okay. Difficult for everyone involved, but okay. I am very happy that my parents pushed me into getting my teeth aligned by discussing the results with me and offering encouragement and support to continue when the procedures were more painful. But there are thousands of minor boundary transgressions made against children all the time. For example, my father \u2014 who, I should mention, loves me dearly and was a wonderful daddy \u2014 used to answer my request for a chocolate bar by saying, \u201cyou don\u2019t want a chocolate bar.\u201d Not \u201cI am not going to buy you a chocolate bar,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have the money for a chocolate bar,\u201d or \u201cI want to see you eat something healthier, so I\u2019m not getting you a chocolate bar,\u201d or \u201cchocolate is for birthdays, Christmas, and Easter, so you\u2019ll just have to wait for the next holiday.\u201d No, he told me I didn\u2019t  want  a chocolate bar. This was very confusing to me \u2014 I had thought I wanted a chocolate bar. I still felt very much like I wanted a chocolate bar, despite being told I didn\u2019t. Were my wants true? It was baffling to me and a minor boundary transgression (telling me I didn\u2019t feel the way it was obvious that I did feel) that subtly chipped away at my sense of self and autonomy. I\u2019m a very concrete thinker. It never occurred to me that \u201cyou don\u2019t want that\u201d was just an expression of speech for my father. It was something far less subtle to me. Wanting a chocolate bar and not getting it was bad enough. Being told that I didn\u2019t even know myself well enough to understand what I wanted was diminishing in ways I\u2019m only now beginning to understand, decades later. Small statements have big consequences, especially when you stack a mountain of thousands of small statements day after day. But even these sorts of boundary transgressions are minor compared to the level of compliance that is so often expected from Autistic children. Too often, in the name of therapy or early intervention, Autistic children are subject to a systematic demolishing of their sense of autonomy and their right to say \u201cno\u201d and be heard. Autistic children are treated in ways that most people would be horrified were non-autistic children treated the same way. \u201cTouch your nose.\u201d \u201cTouch your nose\u201d \u201cTouch your nose.\u201d The therapist takes the child\u2019s hand and forces it to the child\u2019s nose while saying once again, \u201ctouch your nose.\u201d Then, \u201cgood girl! Here\u2019s a gummy bear!\u201d A pause, then, \u201ctouch your nose.\u201d \u201cTouch your nose.\u00a0\u201d\u00a0\u201cTouch your nose.\u201d It is a technique I have seen used to train bears to do tricks. It is a method used to train dogs and horses to perform on command. It is a common behavioral modification program for Autistic children. A bear demonstrates the \u201ctouch nose, get a gummy bear\u201d technique. Now, there\u2019s nothing  inherently  wrong with asking someone to touch their nose. I am ten years older than my sister and when she was a little toddler, one of our favorite games was for me (or Mom) to say, \u201cwhere are your ears?\u201d She would grin and touch them. \u201cWhere is your nose?\u201d Again, a smile and a touch. We\u2019d go through all the objects \u2014 her toes, her teddy bear, the blue ball, the red ball. She didn\u2019t need gummy bears because she loved the game and the attention. She was eager to show off that she knew all these things. But even if she needed an incentive to show us things, that\u2019s still not horrible. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with giving someone candy or stickers for showing that they know the letter S or where their nose is. Where the touch nose sort of training goes horribly wrong is when we forget that No Means No. Autistic children don\u2019t have as many resources for saying no, so they say it in ways that get labelled as \u201cnon-compliance.\u201d They turn their head away. They get up from the table and walk away (or try to!) They cry. They scream. They hit. They bite. And then they get labelled: violent and non-compliant. But what were those children supposed to do? No means no, right? For everybody, right? Or maybe only for non-autistic adults? Children don\u2019t get to say no? Children who can\u2019t shape the sounds of \u201cno\u201d with their mouths don\u2019t get to say no? There are people who say that \u201ctouch your nose and get a gummy bear\u201d is very important. There are people who say that a child must go through hundreds of repetitions of touching their nose or they will never have a chance in life. There are people who say a child must spend 40 hours a week sitting at that table, touching their nose over and over. And there are people who say that the cries and hitting are just \u201cmanipulation\u201d and should be ignored. The protests have to be worked through and the nose has to be touched. And touched. And touched. How is it manipulation to try to assert one\u2019s self? How is using any method available to say \u201cno\u201d a manipulation? How can I hear people saying these things and not think of \u201cno means no\u201d and how grossly it\u2019s being violated? Sexual abuse is high among those of us with intellectual or developmental disabilities.  The Arc reports several studies  that found frighteningly high rates of sexual abuse against children and adults with intellectual disabilities, ranging from 1/4 to 1/2 of disabled people being the target of serious abuse.  A study published in the journal  Child Abuse and Neglect  found that nearly 1/5 of Autistic children had been abused sexually or physically. This is not a population that should be taught that their no doesn\u2019t mean no. This is a population that needs to be taught to own their no, defend their boundaries. Look at it this way: is it better to push and push a child, while ignoring their boundaries and attempts to say no, so that they can perform a task on command but are primed for victimization? Or is it better to work within the child\u2019s own learning time table, working to help them develop without forcing them\u00a0or ignoring their clear statements that their limits have been reached, ending up with someone who accomplishes things at a later age than others and has a strong sense of self, refusing to allow others to violate their boundaries? I see a lot of parents struggling hard to get their child \u201cindistinguishable from his peers\u201d or \u201cschool ready\u201d at the \u201cright\u201d age.\u00a0 It is worthy to want to help your child. It is important to work to help your child achieve her full potential. But it is crucial to teach your child to say no and be heard. It is vital to respect your child\u2019s autonomy and not sacrifice their safety for your learning goals. Children develop. Even children with developmental disabilities develop \u2014 just on our own schedules.\u00a0  A study of children who were not speaking by age 4  found that over half of them spoke fluently as adults. When you add in the adults who were not speaking fluently but could communicate well using short phrases, the number of non-speaking children who grew up to be speaking adults went up to 70%. \u201cBut that won\u2019t be my child!\u201d I\u2019ve heard parents retort. \u201cThe definition of autism has been broadened too far. Those children are high-functioning. They aren\u2019t like my child! My child has REAL autism! My child has Kanner\u2019s autism, not Asperger\u2019s!\u201d The first person ever diagnosed with autism by Dr. Kanner drives a car and plays golf today. Oh, he\u2019s still Autistic. Read the linked article and you\u2019ll see that he\u2019s very Autistic. But he lives in a community with lots of support and accommodations. And love. Donald Triplett is very loved and respected in his community. Forget \u201cindistinguishable from peers\u201d and focus on building a world of Triplett-friendly communities. Stop interpreting outbursts as \u201cemotional manipulation\u201d and start looking for the root causes. And teach your children \u2014 all your children \u2014 what boundaries are and how to say \u201cno\u201d and make it stick. No means no. That is a basic truth of a respectful society. Do not teach your child that they are outsiders to that social contract. Thoreau taught it, Martin Luther King Jr. taught it, and you can teach it: when demands for compliance become unreasonable, it is a fundamental human right to say \u201cno.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/n1.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "http://www.thearc.org/page.aspx?pid=2457", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16293306", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/e1128", "http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/autisms-first-child/308227/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/n-is-for-no-means-no/", "title": "N is for No Means\u00a0No"},

The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . P is for Poverty I\u2019ve (mostly) come to terms with my own poverty, but I worry about many of my fellow Autistic adults who are (often quite literally) starving and I worry about the children \u2013 what, if anything, will be there for them when they grow up? Autism . . . well, disability of all types, actually . . . and poverty go hand in hand. That is not to say that every Autistic adult or every disabled adult lives in poverty. But\u00a0a large percentage\u00a0of us do. At a time when poverty and unemployment are declining among the general population, both are on the rise among the disabled population. The  U.S. Census Bureau\u00a0  reported that in 2013 the U.S. poverty rate fell to 14.5% but the poverty rate for disabled people rose to 28.8 percent. The overall unemployment rate dropped to 6% but for disabled people it was over twice as high at 12.8%. Seventy percent of the general U.S. population over the age of 16 are participating in the workforce while only 20% of the disabled population over age 16 are participating. Bear in mind that \u201cdisabled people over the age of 16\u201d is a category comprising some 29 million people \u2014\u00a09%\u00a0of the total U.S. population. No one knows how many Autistic people there are in the United\u00a0States, but a reasonable estimate (based\u00a0on the 1-in-68 statistic) is 4.6 million, roughly 3.5 million of whom would be over the age of 18 (based on the age skew of the general population.) For those three and a half million American Autistic adults, as well as their counterparts world-wide, the statistics are even more harsh. Transitioning is more difficult for Autistic young adults than young adults with other disabilities. The  National Longitudinal Transition Study-2  found that, when comparing adults aged 21 to 25, only 17% of Autistic young adults have lived independently, compared to 34% of young adults with intellectual disability. In the UK, The National Autistic Society (NAS)  reports  that only 15% of Autistic adults are employed full-time and as many as one-third of adult Autistics have neither employment nor access to benefits. The Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI)  reports  on Norwegian studies that find \u201cmildly affected\u201d (SFARI appears to dislike that phrase as much as I do)\u00a0Autistic people having just as much difficulty with employment as people elsewhere on the autism spectrum. Shattuck and his team did a  literature review  of services for adults on the autism spectrum and found (not surprisingly) a meager amount of data available. Job support was rated highly as \u201cevidence-based\u201d but I was concerned about the strong emphasis on training Autistic adults to perform as costume mascots in front of retail stores. It\u2019s a valid job, yes, and I\u2019ve met some people who do seem to love it. But isn\u2019t there anything else\u00a0for Autistic adults? Even those with university degrees too often\u00a0remain unemployed. Or work\u00a0part-time and cannot support themselves on their income. When efforts are made to help us get higher-paying jobs, so often everything seems to be centered around computer work. I\u2019ve listened to many of my fellow Autistics complain that job assistance keeps pushing them toward computer and tech jobs despite their dyscalculia or other learning disabilities that make them unsuited for math and tech work. Moreover, many people seem not to realize that the computer industry has shifted\u00a0over the course of\u00a0the last twenty years or so. There was a time when computer work was a great choice for the socially disabled because there was a high need for skilled workers and few people with the skills to fill those jobs. Workers lacking in social skills were able to land secure, high-paying employment despite going\u00a0down socially\u00a0worse than a lead balloon in job interviews. But that time has passed. So many people train for the computer industries these days that competition for positions is high and jobs primarily go to those who are socially competent, who interview well, who have strong people skills. Still, the mythology lingers \u2014 have no social skills? Go work with computers! It\u2019s a damaging mythology because it can lead people to feel they don\u2019t need to work on interview skills or office socio-political competence because their tech skills will carry the day. And career counselors still try to funnel Autistic people into the computer industry without realizing that many of us will need just as much workplace support there as in any other occupation. (And without realizing that a significant portion of employable Autistics are more suited for work that uses other skills \u2014 with words, images, music, animals, etc.) I read a  very interesting paper  written by two Autistic people,\u00a0Rachel Silverman and James Williams, about employment and self-sufficiency issues. One of their suggestions was to join the \u201cautism industry\u201d: \u201cFirst, they develop a book, artwork, jewelry, photography, or other salable product.\u00a0\u00a0Then they can rent space as exhibitors at autism and disability conferences for free or low cost.\u00a0\u00a0They can sell their products at these conferences and earn income in this fashion.\u201d This is an intriguing concept and one I seem to be pursuing, myself, though I haven\u2019t been to a conference (yet?) But is there room for three million workers in the \u201cautism industry\u201d? I honestly don\u2019t know. Maybe. Maybe not. Professionals rarely listen to us, but parents in increasing numbers are thirsty for our perspective. I do encourage all Autistics to make their voice heard (or seen. All communication styles included!) because a richer, fuller understanding of autism depends on a rich, full number of Autistic voices fostering that understanding in all its complexity and diversity. Temple Grandin leans in the other direction , advising people not to\u00a0become \u201cprofessional autistics,\u201d but rather to follow her footsteps of holding a \u201creal job\u201d and advocating for autistics on the side. If only we could all achieve her level of professional success! Beyond that complaint, I am wondering where all those \u201cfree or low cost\u201d conference opportunities are. Every time one of my Autistic colleagues is\u00a0invited to present at a disability or autism conference, they have to throw a fundraising campaign to try to get the money together to attend. Is the \u201cautism industry\u201d an option for talented, underemployed Autistics if the cost of attending conferences is a nearly insurmountable barrier? Another valuable point in the paper by Silverman and Williams is that so much energy is going toward making Autistics employable and very little is going toward helping Autistics secure disability benefits. I understand the huge emotional investment in wanting to help us all get jobs and I don\u2019t want to cut back on those efforts at all. It is very important to help Autistic people get and keep employment. But Silverman and Williams point out that we aren\u2019t all employable. Some of us have energy levels too low to sustain full-time employment. Some have health issues severe enough to result in a large number of missed work days. Additionally, many of our health needs (for example, special diets for people with celiac, a condition that occurs more frequently in the Autistic population than the general population) are expensive enough that a living wage for a non-disabled person is not a living wage for some of us. When the data indicates that a third of Autistic adults have no job  and  no disability benefits, it is clear that an unacceptable number of us are falling through the cracks . . . and those \u201ccracks\u201d are actually gaping chasms. I feel very strongly that there should be more assistance for Autistic adults who need disability benefits but are having a hard time with the paperwork and documentation. Additionally, homelessness makes it harder to get disability benefits. I applied for SSI (U.S. disability welfare benefits for those who have not worked enough to get the income-based SSDI (a federal insurance program for disability)) several times before I finally got it \u2014 not because I was being turned down, but because I was too homeless and struggling to keep up with the application process. I\u2019d get an address, apply, lose the address and be too busy trying to keep myself fed and safe to even think about how to follow up on the application and so it would lapse. When I finally got enough stability to follow through on the process, I was awarded SSI in less than 2 months from initial application \u2014 apparently, my case was what one might call a \u201cshoo in.\u201d But when I couldn\u2019t keep a mailing address for two months, even a case as straightforward as mine was stymied. Helping Autistic adults to get disability benefits isn\u2019t glamorous. It is hard to feel like one is doing good work when the focus has always been so strongly directed toward getting disabled people into the workforce. I think there should still be a strong focus on supporting Autistic people in employment goals. But it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s time to admit that some Autistics \u2014 even some\u00a0highly educated Autistics \u2014 are not going to be able to work. We need more legitimate work-at-home opportunities, more support and assistance in finding and keeping online employment, a more individualized approach to vocational assistance,\u00a0and a lot of help in getting disability benefits for those who aren\u2019t able to work full-time or at all. I spent a lot of time living in the streets and eating at soup kitchens and from dumpsters before I was able to get on SSI. I want people to understand how easy it is for Autistic adults to end up homeless. I\u2019ve also had plenty of Autistic friends who were living in sub-standard conditions \u2014 for example, without running water or heat. I\u2019ve been in that position myself, too. Our poverty levels are more than twice those of the general population and we are a very vulnerable population, comprised of many people who do not know how to ask for help with homework or cooking, let alone help with income, housing, healthcare, and survival. There needs to be more autism-accepting, non-judgmental assistance we can turn to. There need to be people trained in helping us get and keep employment and helping us get disability benefits. Too many of us are homeless, hungry, and without adequate medical care (both due to the barriers described earlier under \u201c H is for Healthcare Access \u201d\u00a0and due to the economic barriers that still exist, even after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in the United States and the existence of universal healthcare in other places such as the UK and Canada.) Yes, some of us are doing very well. But we aren\u2019t all Silicon Valley workers. We aren\u2019t all Temple Grandin\u00a0or John Elder Robison. And many of us are living with aging parents who don\u2019t have the resources to set their adult children up for life after they are gone. We need help and we need it now. So many articles talk about children aging out of the system and having nothing to turn to, as if it is a new crisis. The crisis is not new. We have always been here. Watch the film  Wretches and Jabberers   to see\u00a0one example of an intelligent and powerful Autistic man who\u00a0personally lobbies\u00a0with politicians, yet is homeless. There are Autistics of all ages \u2014 and I mean all, including people in their 70s and 80s \u2014 who have been living in crushing poverty for decades. It has been a silent crisis for too long. We need help now. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/p1.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autismacceptanceday.blogspot.com/", "http://www.census.gov/people/disabilityemptab/", "http://aut.sagepub.com/content/18/5/562", "http://www.aspie-editorial.com/2011/01/22/employment-nas-dont-write-me-off-campaignautistic-people-condemned-to-poverty/", "http://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/news/2011/people-with-milder-forms-of-autism-struggle-as-adults", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538849/", "http://www.jamesmw.com/employment.htm", "http://www.marinscope.com/sausalito_marin_scope/news/article_84ed5651-c4bf-5cc8-a930-8f9e3df9a257.html", "http://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/04/26/p-is-for-poverty/", "title": "P is for\u00a0Poverty"},
{"date": "2015/06/12", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . I didn\u2019t quite make it in April. I moved in May. I\u2019m finishing the alphabet in June. The ABCs of Autism Acceptance series has been picked up by  Autonomous Press  and will be published in book form, with additional material, in June 2016. Watch for it! T is for Toe-walking, Trauma, and Truth-telling This is not quite the grab-bag of topics it might appear at first. There are connections among these three things. Toe-walking is a very common trait among those with developmental disabilities, particularly autism. While walking around on tip-toes all or most of the time can also indicate other conditions such as cerebral palsy or congenitally tight Achilles tendons, it\u2019s become associated most with autism. All children walk on tip toes sometimes. Most children stop doing it much or at all somewhere between the ages of 2 and 5.\u00a0Autistic children tend to keep toe-walking a lot. Plenty of adults still toe-walk and I used to be one of them, but I trained myself to stop doing it over the course of the last ten years because I am trying to cope with the physical damage caused by 40 years of toe-walking. Toe walking has always seemed natural to me. I remember being reprimanded often in my pre-teen years whenever I was seen toe-walking. I honestly tried to stop doing it, but as soon as my attention wandered away from my feet, I\u2019d be right back up on my toes again. I remember my mother taking me to a doctor to discuss the options. He talked about surgery or putting casts on my feet.\u00a0My mother felt\u00a0those options were\u00a0too extreme (and I tend to agree with her) and tried to just help train me not to do it anymore \u2014 a task that sounds easier than it actually was, because toe-walking was comfortable for me and so it was a deeply persistent trait. What I\u2019m about to say may not be popular. I\u2019m not so happy about it myself, to be honest. But many times I see people who support autism acceptance (which, as you know, I deeply support as well!) saying things like, \u201cwhy do people get so upset about toe-walking? Let people be their Autistic selves!\u201d If you\u2019re talking about hand-flapping, I agree. Lack of eye contact, I\u2019m fine with. Twirling around, jumping up and down, all kinds of stims are totally fine and should not be suppressed. They are part of who an Autistic person is. But toe-walking is a bit different. I put it more in the category of things like head-banging. Head-banging is not safe. It can lead to permanent brain injury. When someone is banging their head against hard things (and I speak as someone who has done this plenty, myself) it is important to help them find a different way to express their emotions and fill their needs. It is important to find out why they bang their head (are they trying to communicate something? Does their head hurt and they\u2019re trying to relieve or express the pain? Are they frustrated or feeling overwhelmed by emotions and banging their head soothes them?) and try to help the person find a different way,\u00a0a safer way,\u00a0to fill the need that head-banging was filling. Likewise, I have learned that toe-walking up to middle-age is dangerous. My tendons have shortened and I get injured more easily. In fact, I have been nursing a foot injury for well over half a year now. I sleep with foot braces that hold my feet in a position that helps stretch my Achilles tendons. I limp a lot. I am in pain nearly constantly. It is because decades of toe-walking will re-shape your feet in many detrimental ways. Because of those changes and the injuries I\u2019ve sustained, I\u2019m sometimes forced to take a few steps on tip-toe as I \u201cwarm up\u201d and stretch out the tendons for flat-footed walking or else I couldn\u2019t walk at all. So here\u2019s the first connection: toe-walking can cause lasting trauma. But in addition to the physical trauma I have from decades of toe-walking, I also live with the psychological trauma of being repeatedly corrected for toe-walking. It\u2019s a tricky thing. All the times I was told to stop toe-walking made an impression on me and kind of melted in with all the other times I was corrected for all the other things that were either beyond my control or so deeply ingrained that I often felt that I was spending every ounce of my focus on remembering not to do the countless things I was always being told not to do. It was overwhelming! I don\u2019t have an easy answer to how to help steer an Autistic person without making them feel traumatized by feeling like they are always being told that they are doing everything wrong, but here\u2019s a good place to start: don\u2019t try to \u201cfix\u201d everything. Hand-flapping? Not a problem. Work on educating the rest of the world that hand-flapping is a harmless motion that some people engage in for various reasons. Don\u2019t try to normalize the person; normalize hand-flapping. My boyfriend hand-flaps sometimes in a loving imitation of me when I\u2019m excited. I find it charming. He is not put off by the ways I move and it is a dear way for him to show how \u201cnormal\u201d he finds it. This is one of the problems with therapies that seek to make us \u201cindistinguishable from our peers.\u201d If you try to stop us from doing anything that looks Autistic, you will be constantly picking at us to stop almost everything we do and we will feel overwhelmed and traumatized. So pick your battles. Hand-flapping is fine. Focus on things like not hitting siblings, keeping body waste inside diapers or toilets, not biting others, not banging one\u2019s head against hard things . . . and toe-walking. Don\u2019t worry about it at a pre-school age. Every pre-schooler toe-walks some amount, often a lot. But gradually work on flat-footed walking. If your child is receptive to verbal reasoning, explain to them what will happen if they spend too much time on tip-toes. It\u2019s not too different from what happens to women who wear\u00a0very high heels a lot (although it can be more damaging. Imagine if women started wearing high heels every single day at, oh, age seven or so, when their feet are still forming and growing), so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find some information and other first-hand accounts of the long-term damage toe-walking over the course of many years can cause. Already you see the connections: toe-walking is a body-truth and trauma can be caused both by decades of toe-walking and by trying to correct toe-walking too vehemently (especially while trying to \u201ccorrect\u201d everything else, most of which does not need correcting.) Trauma is a big deal for autism acceptance. I believe that many of us Autistics are more easily traumatized by some things than other people are. I also think that many of us Autistics have had to endure things that are more traumatizing than a childhood (or adulthood) ought to be. And I think trauma often puts us at odds with ourselves when it comes to truth-telling. There is a myth that Autistics are incapable of lying. It\u2019s wrong. We can lie. Many of us aren\u2019t very good at it. I hate lying for several reasons but one of the biggest reasons I hate it is because I\u2019m just so darned bad at it. It\u2019s stressful to try to keep up with a lie. It\u2019s stressful to get caught out when lying. It\u2019s stressful to feel bad because I\u2019d rather not be lying. Chavisory commented on my blog that one reason she loves the story of Donald Triplett, the first person diagnosed with autism, telling others how many bricks were in the fa\u00e7ade of a building is because he admitted later in an Atlantic Monthly article that he had lied and made up the number. She loves how that busts the stereotype of Autistics as being incapable of lying. Triplett knew that the people asking wouldn\u2019t check to see if he was right and because they were so interested in seeing if he knew (and he was so eager to win their admiration) he lied and made up a number. And got away with it. Autistics can lie. We are more likely to tell the truth, even if it\u2019s an uncomfortable or angering truth. But we can lie. Trauma can rob us of the choice to tell the truth. For example, if we are traumatized enough about a particular aspect of our behavior, we may resort to lying in order to avoid getting reprimanded yet again. But, for many of us, lying is traumatizing in itself. So trauma can re-traumatize again and again by forcing us to lie. Truth-telling and trauma are linked. If you always get shouted at or even hit for doing something that you can\u2019t help doing, you start to get sneaky and learn ways to hide it. Or lie about it. And pretty soon, you start feeling like your whole life is a lie and all you are doing is trying to maneuver around the trauma spots and not get caught. This is not just Autistics. Anyone forced to live a lie can come to feel traumatized by the constant requirement of pretense. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a gay teen trying to hide their identity from judgmental parents who might kick them out of the house, or a Black person who has to be constantly aware of how they move, look, speak, walk, and so on in order to not be accused of shoplifting or worse, or an Autistic struggling to not flap their hands, pretend to maintain eye contact (but not too much eye contact!), and speak in ways that other people expect them to. Living a lie is stressful and traumatizing. Encourage the Autistic people in your life to be truth-tellers \u2014 not by threatening punishment if they lie, but rather by setting up an environment where it is okay to be who they really are\u00a0and where even dangerous actions like toe-walking and head-banging are met first with an attempt to understand why they need those actions, then by helping to find alternatives and lovingly mentoring the Autistic to be the best, safest, healthiest,\u00a0most free, and truest\u00a0Autistic they can be.\u00a0 Recognize how easy it is to traumatize someone by outlawing everything that is natural to them and don\u2019t compound trauma by pushing them so hard to be someone they aren\u2019t that they are forced to lie about things, especially things that are so much a part of who they naturally are. Autism acceptance means helping, mentoring, guiding, but never trying to re-shape an Autistic person for no good reason beyond the comfort of others. If you accept Autistic people, you will accept that we often move differently, communicate differently, and think differently. Autism acceptance does not mean just letting us \u201cgo wild.\u201d We need mentoring just like anyone else. Autism acceptance means working to understand why we do things and carefully judging before you try to change our behavior: do you want to change it to help us be healthier and happier? Or do you want to change it because you think other people will not accept us the way we are? If you think people will not accept us because we look, think, and communicate differently, do not\u00a0 try to make us into people we aren\u2019t. If you think we will not be accepted, you must work to change the world into one that can accept people regardless of neurology, color of skin, religion, or any other of the myriad things that contribute to the glorious diversity of human beings. Do not traumatize us in the name of helping us fit in. Do not try to make us smaller; work to make the world\u2019s heart bigger.

R is for Relationships This is such a huge topic, it would take an entire book to do it justice, but there are some very important highlights I need to hit when speaking of autism acceptance and relationships. One of the questions parents of Autistic children ask most is \u201cwill my child ever be able to have a relationship?\u201d In darker moments, its not even a question but rather a lament. \u201cMy poor, poor child! Autism has robbed them! They will never marry or have children!\u201d But what parents often don\u2019t realize is that they\u2019re not quite asking the right question. Too often, books about sex and relationship for parents of Autistics and for Autistic people ourselves make a basket of assumptions that can be very harmful to all developing young people but especially to young Autistic people who so often need extra mentorship and guidance in life. Double Rainbow , a column of autism and sexuality, written by\u00a0Caroline Narby\u00a0and hosted by Bitch Media has addressed these assumptions multiple times.\u00a0 Narby writes, \u201cThe aim of this blog is to explore and interrogate popular representations of autistic sexuality and gender performance from a queer, autistic perspective\u201d and goes on to say (speaking of a presentation in which autistic sexuality was presented as only being acceptable if it is mainstream with respect to gender and sexuality), \u201cThere must have been young adults who are gay and/or genderqueer or trans*, or who are unsure of and are exploring their identities. The message they received was not that they are not alone and are worthy of love, but that they are undesirable. I know from first-hand experience that autistic youth are often already emotionally vulnerable. To be told that you are  doubly  broken, doubly unlovable and undesirable, because you are both autistic and queer, is devastating.\u201d This is the big mistake I see so often in sex education targeted to Autistic people or our parents. The assumption is that everyone is heterosexual, everyone presents as the gender that matches the sex organs they were born with, and everyone wants to be in a sexual and romantic relationship. (Or, sometimes, the erasure goes the other way and the book or speaker seems to believe that all Autistic people are completely asexual and aromantic.) These kinds of stereotyped assumptions (that we\u2019re all cis-het (in other words, not trans and not queer) or all asexual) are very damaging to anyone who is taking those first steps into the world of adult relationships. In my own case, I had the standard sex education that assumes everyone is cis-het (I was in middle and high school in the late 1970s and early 1980s) and I felt frightened and ashamed to try to talk to someone about the thoughts and feelings I had that were not part of that model. When I finally found an adult I could talk to (a local co-ordinator for PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays)), she was wonderfully helpful, but made the assumption that I was a lesbian. Since no one told me about non-binary gender and sexuality, I accepted what she wrote to me (I was too shy to call so I wrote a letter to her) and worked hard to fit in with my lesbian identity, unaware that there were other ways of being a sexual person. As it turns out, I am pansexual. If you don\u2019t know what that word means, think of bisexual \u2014 a concept you\u2019re probably at least somewhat familiar with \u2014 and now think about what bisexuality looks like when there are more than two genders to choose from. Since I now understand that gender is not strictly a binary (there are cis-females, cis-males, trans-women, trans-men, intersex folks, genderqueer folks, third gender folks, and all kinds of other flavors I don\u2019t have time or space to go into here) I can\u2019t really call myself bisexual because that word implies that there are only two choices. There is a saying that, \u201ca bisexual person sees a\u00a0lovely woman across the bar, walks up and finds out they are actually a lovely man, and it\u2019s okay.\u201d I like to say that a pansexual person sees a hot person across the bar and maybe they are a man and maybe they are a woman and maybe they are something else entirely but it doesn\u2019t matter, because they are lovely. Because I am often quite literal-minded and because I accepted that the adults around me knew the truth and could teach it to me, my struggle to be \u201ca good lesbian\u201d was just as difficult and shame-inducing as my struggle to be \u201ca good straight girl.\u201d Neither one was working for me and I didn\u2019t understand why for a long time. Of course this can happen to anyone, Autistic or not, but we are extra-vulnerable to these sorts of difficulties in understanding our identity. We need an atmosphere of openness when we are making those first steps of self-discovery. Now . . . I realize that I\u2019m talking about things that are complex and sometimes subtle \u2014\u00a0from the perspective of people who aren\u2019t Autistic. It can be intimidating to try to figure out how to introduce all this complexity when you\u2019re terrified just to talk about sex at all with your Autistic child. Or maybe you are nervous because right now you\u2019re working on helping your child learn that touching their genitals is something they can\u2019t do in the grocery store. Or at church. Take a breath and remember the joke: \u201chow do you eat an elephant?\u201d \u201cone bite at a time.\u201d Deal with whatever you and your child are dealing with right at this moment. But try to work on opening up your language and your mind to the thought that your child might be gay. Or bisexual. Or pansexual. Or asexual. Or transgendered. Or . . . Let your child set the cues as far as gendered clothing. I see a lot of sex advice for Autistic young women that tries to convince us to put on make up or shave our legs or wear a dress instead of jeans and a sweatshirt. Some of us like to do those things. Some of us LOVE to do those things. And some of the Autistics who love to shave their legs and wear a dress and make up were born into a body with a penis. Focus on good grooming and let your child teach you what their sense of fashion is. Don\u2019t try to force an Autistic young person to dress a particular way. We often learn \u2014 either through difficult therapies or just through living a life where too often we are told how wrong we are \u2014 to be extra-compliant and that can extend to trying to please others by dressing, speaking, and behaving in a way that feels completely unnatural to us. So often, we grow up feeling we have no choice but to comply and conform. Be aware of this and try not to unconsciously (or consciously!) force your child into a sex and gender mold that is not\u00a0a good fit for them. And all that \u201cmy child will never get married and have children\u201d angst?\u00a0 I can understand why that upsets you, but you need to work on privately getting past that. Talk to your partner, if you have any, about those fears. Talk to a therapist or a close friend. Don\u2019t write it in any place, public or private, that your child is likely to see some day. (And don\u2019t think that just because your child doesn\u2019t speak or interact with others right now that they will never read and understand things. You can\u2019t guess your child\u2019s life trajectory and you might come to learn that every thing you said in front of them, thinking they didn\u2019t understand, went straight into their memory.) Because what if your child grows up to be an asexual adult? Or a childfree-by-choice adult? How will your child feel about your misery over the thought that they will never marry or have children if it turns out that they really don\u2019t want to marry or have children? Do you think your child will feel accepted for who they truly are? Everyone raising children needs to learn about different forms of sexual expression (or non-expression by choice.)\u00a0 Did you know that someone can be asexual but not aromantic? Some people who are asexual still want a loving and emotionally bonded relationship. Some do not. Some people fall in love with more than one person at the same time and choose to have relationships that are honest and open and not monogamous. It is important for every parent to learn about sex, gender, relationships, and love so that they are prepared to support their beloved child no matter what road of life that child grows up to travel. If you believe in autism acceptance, along with neurodiversity, you need to accept sexuality and gender diversity. Autistic people end up non-cis and/or non-het at the same rate as the general population . . . possibly more often. Just as autism is a core piece of who we are, sexuality and gender are deep and pervasive. To accept one and not the other is just as damaging as accepting neither. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/r.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://bitchmagazine.org/post/double-rainbow-navigating-autism-gender-and-sexuality-feminism"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/r-is-for-relationships/", "title": "R is for\u00a0Relationships"},
{"date": "2015/06/18", "body": "I have been wanting to write a letter to myself as a child for a while now and Autistic Pride Day seemed like the perfect day to do it. As I thought about what I would say to myself if I could reach back in time, I realized that there is not one single \u201cme as a child.\u201d So this is a letter to many of my past selves over time. I have tried to write in ways I would have understood at different ages. If I could only give one message to myself at any age, it would be this, \u201cstop taking the blame for the bad things other people do to you.\u201d I was so hard on myself. Why? Because others were hard on me. How ridiculous is that? Over and over, I punished myself for what other people did to me. So I got punished twice. I want to apologize to myself for making everything even harder than it had to be. And I want to forgive myself, too. I was just trying to survive a difficult life with the \u201ctools\u201d I had. Dear Sparrow at three-years-old: You are such a good girl! I love it when you are happy and singing. I see how hard you try to always do the right thing. Always remember that I love you and that you are such a good girl. Dear Sparrow at seven-years-old: I am so sorry about how school has turned out for you. I remember when you were four years old and so excited on your birthday because you were finally old enough to go to school. Going to school was almost all you could think about. And then it happened and it didn\u2019t live up to your expectations at all. The teachers are teaching things you already know and the other students don\u2019t treat you well. Sometimes the teacher doesn\u2019t treat you very good, either. I will tell you a secret: those other students are treating you badly because they don\u2019t understand you and that scares them. I will tell you another secret: don\u2019t tell the other students that you know that! Whenever you know something that helps you put up with how hard life is, don\u2019t share that with the people who are making your life hard because they will just make fun of it and find ways to take that away from you. Knowing that they are treating you mean because they don\u2019t understand and are afraid is like having a secret shield to protect you from feeling as bad when they are mean. Don\u2019t let them know you have that shield. Sometimes people you trust are telling you that the bullying you are getting is your own fault and that if you could act more like the other kids, they wouldn\u2019t bully you. Don\u2019t believe that it is your fault! It is not your fault that you are being bullied by others; it is their fault that they are bullies! There are things you don\u2019t understand and what do you do? You try to learn more. You don\u2019t turn into a meanie about it. So you know that the other kids could stop being bullies if they wanted to, but they are choosing the lazy way of staying afraid and not learning about you. Isn\u2019t that sad for them? This is your secret shield to help you stay strong when they get mean. Never tell them, but just know inside yourself that they are being mean because they are too lazy to learn a better way to be. It\u2019s okay to feel sorry for them. Feel sorry for them in secret. It\u2019s part of your shield. Yes, you really are different from the other students. That doesn\u2019t make you wrong. It doesn\u2019t mean you should try to change who you are. There is nothing wrong with being different and hopefully some day those other students will learn that. Right now, I want you to learn it. Being different doesn\u2019t make the bullying your fault. Being different is not \u201cbringing it all on yourself.\u201d And those people who say you \u201cinsist on being different\u201d or are trying to \u201cshow off\u201d are wrong You are different because you were bon that way. Never be ashamed of being different. Be proud of who you are! Just pay attention to the things you have control over. Try to be a good person. Try to do your school work as well as you can. And remember your secret shield and stay strong behind it. Dear Sparrow at twelve-years-old: Your life is changing so much! Everything is going to be different in middle school. Try to talk to an adult you trust\u00a0about the things that are hard for you. Tell them how much it hurts to write with a pen or pencil. They \u2018know that your handwriting is really bad but they don\u2019t know that it causes you pain to write. You haven\u2019t told them because you didn\u2019t realize that the way writing feels to you is not the way it feels to everybody. Tell them that it hurts. And if they don\u2019t hear you or don\u2019t understand, tell them again. You have a condition called dysgraphia and that\u2019s why you have been having a hard time getting your school work done. If your parents and teachers can understand that you have a handwriting disability, they can get you help. Or maybe they will start letting you type your school work like you\u2019ve been asking to do for so long. They just have to understand that it hurts and they can\u2019t understand until you tell them. Middle school is going to be harder so you need to get ready for it. You need an IEP plan. You can\u2019t be expected to know what that is, but if you tell your parents and teachers about the things that are hard for you and try to tell as much detail as you can, they can work for you and get a plan in place so that you can get help with the hard things, like handwriting. Tell them how the other students treat you. It\u2019s just going to get harder for you next year, so you need to make sure the adults understand right now what is happening. No adult is with you in every class, every minute, so you have to tell them about the things they weren\u2019t there to see. They don\u2019t know what is happening when they aren\u2019t around. You have such a bright future waiting for you and an adult life where you will not be stuck all day with people who treat you badly. You will have a life where you can make choices for yourself and the more you are able to get help right now with the things that are hard for you, the brighter your future is going to be. Stay strong. Remember your secret shields. Get trusted adults to help you with the things that are hard. Love, Sparrow There are things I would like to say to myself at fifteen-years-old, but it starts getting too intense and too personal at that point for me to feel ready to share with others. If I were to give enough advice and encouragement to myself before that point, maybe my teen years wouldn\u2019t be so hard anyway. Who knows what my adult years would look like? At 48 years old, I\u2019ve finally managed to carve out a life that makes me happy. It doesn\u2019t look very much like the American Dream. But it suits me well. If I could send these letters, and so many more, back in time to my younger self, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have had to wait this long to figure out where I fit in this world. But there is no time machine hidden inside a mailbox. This is my life and I am happy with where I\u2019ve ended up. Would I have wished for other things? Yes. Yes, the life I wanted is so different from the life I have. But I\u2019ve found a happy place in this life and I\u2019m grateful.\u00a0I can\u2019t really send letters to my younger self, but I can write them. And she\u2019s still here, inside me. She\u2019s reading these letters. She\u2019s healing every day. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.redbubble.com/people/sparrowrose/portfolio"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/autistic-pride-day-2015-letter-to-myself-as-a-child/", "title": "Autistic Pride Day 2015 \u2013 Letter to Myself as a\u00a0Child"},
{"date": "2015/06/10", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . I didn\u2019t quite make it in April. I moved in May. I\u2019m finishing the alphabet in June. Great news! The ABCs of Autism Acceptance series has been picked up by  Autonomous Press  and will be published in book form, with additional material, in June 2016! Watch for it! S is for Stop Saying Savant Syndrome and Splinter Skills When you see an Autistic person who is very talented at something, are you tempted to call them a savant? Don\u2019t. I realize you mean to compliment them but the word is loaded and  ableist . You may already realize that talking about splinter skills is ableist (or, if you aren\u2019t deeply involved in the medical aspects of autism, you might not be familiar with the term.)\u00a0 I\u2019m going to unpack them both, showing why these are words you should never use to describe people\u2019s abilities. Let\u2019s start with \u201csavant.\u201d Joseph Straus, a professor at CUNY, examines the history of the term \u201csavant\u201d in  a paper published in Disability Studies Quarterly . As Straus points out, the original term was \u201c idiot savant \u201d and it was generally applied to people who were intellectually disabled yet could perform in one area brilliantly. Sometimes that area was math, sometimes music,\u00a0sometimes art. The point of the label was to highlight the juxtaposition of \u201cextreme incompetence\u201d and \u201cextreme competence.\u201d Not only were the term and the ideas behind it offensive and ableist, it was a way of stating what society finds valuable or worthless about a person. The brilliant musicianship, for example,\u00a0was valuable because people liked to hear the music and would pay money to listen. The \u201cidiot\u201d nature of the rest of the person\u2019s life was\u00a0considered worthless. As Strauss points out, the idea of the \u201cautistic savant\u201d is fairly new and can largely be attributed to the popularity of the Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise\u00a0film,\u00a0 Rain Man , in which \u00a0Hoffman plays Raymond Babbitt, an Autistic adult. Hoffman\u2019s character was modelled after two people \u2013 Kim Peek, a non-autistic \u201csavant\u201d, and William Sackter, a non-autistic man with a learning disability who was institutionalized (the state said he would be a \u201cburden on society\u201d otherwise) in the Faribault State School for the Feeble-Minded and Epileptic after his father died of Spanish Flu. Sackter, who was portrayed by actor Mickey Rooney in a film about his life,  Bill,  was tested after 44 years of institutionalization, and found to have an I.Q. in the normal range. He had been a victim of the over-institutionalization of \u201cproblem people\u201d that was rampant in the 1920s. Bear in mind, the largest outrage is not that\u00a0Sackter was not actually \u201cfeeble-minded.\u201d The largest outrage is that  anyone  was locked away in such a state school. People who complain of over-diagnosis of children today are forgetting that so many of today\u2019s mainstreamed children with IEPs and classroom aides would have been invisible behind the walls of an institution in the past. Chances are, Sackter had something like\u00a0dyslexia or ADHD. Do not mourn alleged overdiagnosis; rejoice at de-institutionalization. Hoffman\u2019s portrayal of autism, modelled after two non-autistic people, set the tone for decades. Public understanding of what autism looks like has, until recently, largely been centered around Hoffman\u2019s portrayal. The \u201cRain Man\u201d concept of adult autism still lingers, though it has largely been replaced with a blend of Temple Grandin and the fictional character Sheldon Cooper from television\u2019s  Big Bang Theory . Raymond Babbitt was institutionalized, exhibited repetitive speech, needed supervision and assistance, and could count things at a very high level. In one scene, a server in a restaurant drops a box of toothpicks on the floor and Raymond instantly counts them. At first, his count is believed to be in error but when the server reveals that\u00a04 toothpicks were left in the box, everyone is amazed. As you can see in the clip, Raymond has also memorized the phone book, halfway through the Gs,\u00a0after his brother, Charlie, gave it to him in frustration, telling him \u201chere, read this!\u201d Charlie notices Raymond\u2019s impressive memory and counting skills and teaches him to illegally count cards so that he can take him to Vegas and win lots of money. Charlie doesn\u2019t really like Raymond. He is frustrated with Raymond\u2019s echolalia, with his need for structure in little things like what brand of underwear he wears or whether the maple syrup is on the table before or after the pancakes. But Charlie does value Raymond\u2019s ability to count and remember because it can be monetized. And this is where the notion of an \u201cautistic savant\u201d is dehumanizing. Have you ever heard someone called a savant because they collect bus transfers (as I used to do in my early teen years) and know every detail about the transfers and the use of them? Or what about someone who has memorized every detail of every episode of Dr. Who, all the way back to 1963? No, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve never heard those folks called savants and there\u2019s a reason. \u201cSavant\u201d is code for \u201ccan do something society finds useful.\u201d That\u2019s why people called savants do things like make music or art or count fast, memorize well, calculate very large numbers accurately and so on. To say that someone is a savant is to say several things: \n that they are incompetent in every area of their life except one \n that they have value that is contingent on their heightened skill in that one area \n that others who are judged incompetent and do not have a \u201csavant\u201d skill are not valuable \n that this person is a \u201cfreak,\u201d a social outsider, an Other \n When someone can do a thing that you find amazing, do not discount their competence in other areas of life. They may need guidance or assistance from friends and other helpers. That does not mean that they are incompetent. If you value their ability to multiply five digit numbers in their head and devalue the rest of their life because they are unable to work or because they need accommodations or assistance, you are setting yourself up to miss the very real humanity and joy of knowing that person. You are commodifying their mathematical abilities and dismissing their personhood. You are reducing them to a biological adding machine. People have inherent value and should not be valued solely on whether they are \u201cuseful\u201d or not. Nazi Germany called disabled people \u201cNutlos Esser\u201d (useless eaters) and said they lived a \u201cballast existence,\u201d holding the rest of the country back with their needs for extra care and their lack of useful productivity. As a result, disabled people were the first to die. The  Aktion T4  program was a trial run for the larger exterminations of Jews, Romany, Homosexuals, Polish, etc. This is what happens to disabled people who are valued only for what they can produce. You may be tempted to invoke  Godwin\u2019s Law \u00a0and say I am going too far in speaking of Nazi death camps when I talk about why the term \u201csavant\u201d is dangerous. Don\u2019t forget that the Nazis did not invent eugenics \u2014 it was an American export. Don\u2019t forget that disabled women and women of color were being involuntarily sterilized in the United States\u00a0 as recently as the 1970s. Don\u2019t forget that Kissinger\u2019s National Security Study Memorandum 200, written in 1974, described \u201coverpopulation\u201d in less developed countries\u00a0as a security threat, saying that U.S. policy should include, \u201cpay[ing] women in the LDCs to have abortions as a method of family planning or to pay persons to perform abortions or to solicit persons to undergo abortions.\u201d In other words, \u201csoft\u201d genocide of poor, non-white people. Poor women all over the world,  including in the United States , are offered money to be sterilized. I was offered $300 to be sterilized in 1991, solely because I was on food stamps. I turned the offer down. This is a world where the poor are blamed and punished for their poverty. Politicians campaign on a platform of taking food stamps away from \u201cthose who refuse to work,\u201d despite the fact that at least 40% of food stamp households do have at least one\u00a0working member and 75% of food stamp households have children. Sixteen percent of food stamp households include a disabled person and 9% include seniors. [ source ] If this doesn\u2019t help clarify why it is dangerous to predicate people\u2019s value on their usefulness, I don\u2019t know what else to say. Promoting the idea of the autistic savant harms Autistic people. I know someone who endured a person throwing toothpicks at their feet and asking them how many there were. Seriously. The idea that some Autistics are \u201csavants\u201d impairs many people\u2019s ability to see us as human beings. Yes\u00a0many of us are really, really good at some things. That is not because Autistics are savants but rather because the Autistic mind latches on to things it loves and savors them thoroughly. Some Autistics love animals. Some love Thomas the Tank Engine. Some love industrial deep fryers. Some love the work of Neil Gaimon. Some love languages. Some love flags. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not \u201csavant syndrome.\u201d It\u2019s people who are hard-wired to really get into the things they love. Focusing on the things we love gives us immense joy. If you have never gotten really deeply into something, so far that you were eating, breathing, and dreaming about it, you will not understand this joy. You don\u2019t have to be Autistic to experience it, but it helps. \u201cIt\u2019s that the experience is so  rich . It\u2019s textured, vibrant, and layered. It exudes joy. It is a hug machine for my brain. It makes my heart pump faster and my mouth twitch back into a smile every few minutes. I feel like I\u2019m sparkling. Every inch of me is totally engaged in and powered up by the obsession. Things are clear. \n \u201cIt is beautiful. It is perfect.\u201d \n \u2013  Julia Bascom This is not a separate competence in a desert of incompetence. This is an Autistic way of being. It is whole and to call it \u201csavant syndrome\u201d is to cut us into little pieces so you can say that you approve of this piece but that piece has just got to go. And that is exactly what the phrase \u201csplinter skills\u201d does. It cuts us into little pieces, into splinters. It says \u201cthis part of you is good but those parts of you are bad.\u201d It splinters us into fragments of worth and worthlessness. It declares us incomplete people, less than fully human, splintered. How would you like it if your ability to bake amazing brownies were called a splinter skill \u2014 you are judged incompetent, except when it comes to brownies. You can solve partial differential equations? Great splinter skill. Too bad you don\u2019t know how to change the oil in your car or you would be a real person. Ariane, the mother of Emma, a fabulously Autistic young woman,  writes , \u201cIf we did the same thing to those who are born without Autism, if we talked about our non-Autistic neurology as a deficit and identified all the ways in which it would cause us problems and difficulty, would we not despair when our non-autistic child was born as well? \u00a0Take your own life as an example and imagine that when you were born you were seen as a great disappointment. \u00a0Think about how each time you did something well it was dismissed as a \u201csplinter skill\u201d and was seen as yet another example of all that was \u201cwrong\u201d with you.\u201d Mayer Shevin, who just  passed away last year , wrote an iconic poem,  The Language of Us/Them . In it, he writes, \u201cWe have talents /\u00a0 They have splinter skills,\u201d highlighting how differently ability is viewed among the Autistic compared to the general population. And if you were wondering how you should refer to Autistic people with talent, now that you know that \u201csavant\u201d and \u201csplinter\u201d are unacceptable words, there it is. We have talents. We have abilities. Speak of our skills as skills, not as freakish anomalies. Discuss what we can do the way you would discuss what any other human being can do. Whether it is Roadrunner cartoons or astrophysics, call it a talent, a skill, an aptitude. And celebrate it, whether it is a marketable skill or not. Because these are the things that bring the most joy into our lives. To discover what an Autistic loves, listen to what we know. To value an Autistic person, value who we are, not who we could be or what we could make of ourselves. It really is that simple. Be with us as we are. Know us without agenda and value us without a price tag. If you do this, you will surely come to love us. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/s.jpg", "http://www.a-to-zchallenge.com/", "http://autpress.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism", "http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/3407/3640", "https://books.google.com/books?id=-0sEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106&dq=life+magazine+savants&source=bl&ots=r1uGlQQkSa&sig=HFwkRPgD79ekVYRAvGnM101DOrk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBGoVChMI7OXC_KuExgIVxA2SCh1yuQBu#v=onepage&q&f=false", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_T4", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Prevention", "http://www.snaptohealth.org/snap/snap-frequently-asked-questions/", "http://www.amazon.com/The-Obsessive-Autism-Julia-Bascom/dp/1849057265", "http://emmashopebook.com/2013/03/20/splinter-skills-and-other-words-we-use/", "http://obits.syracuse.com/obituaries/syracuse/obituary.aspx?pid=172453103", "http://www.nursefriendly.com/nursing/inspiration/the.language.of.us.them.mayer.shevin.htm"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/06/10/s-is-for-stop-saying-savant-syndrome-and-splinter-skills/", "title": "S is for Stop Saying Savant Syndrome and Splinter\u00a0Skills"},
{"date": "2015/05/31", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . (Edited to add \u2013 I didn\u2019t quite make it in April. I moved in May. I\u2019m finishing the alphabet in June.) Q is for Quiet Hands Getting Loud Quiet Hands. If you\u2019re Autistic, you are probably familiar with the phrase. It\u2019s the admonition to stop fidgeting, stop flapping, stop moving, stop what\u2019s called \u201cstimming\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cself-stimulatory behaviors.\u201d But \u201cquiet hands\u201d is not autism acceptance. It is part of the goal of so many autism therapies: to make an Autistic person \u201cindistinguishable from their peers.\u201d People who try to accomplish this with Autistic people believe they\u2019re doing them a favor because they think that if we can just figure out how to look at act like everyone else around us who isn\u2019t Autistic, we will be \u201ccured\u201d and be able to have the same kind of \u201cnormal life\u201d that other people have. But when I look around at myself and my fellow adults Autistics and hear their stories, it seems to me that this \u201cindistinguishable from peers\u201d goal is one that only a tiny fraction of Autistic people are able to accomplish. Beyond the relative unattainability of \u201cindistinguishable,\u201d the stress of trying to reach that goal can do long-term damage to a person\u2019s body and to their self-esteem. The dirty truth about \u201cquiet hands\u201d and other attempts to train the autism out of us is that these sorts of therapies \u2014 teaching us to look others in the eye, stop fidgeting, stop rocking, stop doing anything that \u201clooks too autistic\u201d \u2014 is that these therapies are not really meant to help us. They are meant to make others feel more comfortable around us and to allow others to try to forget that we are Autistic. Teaching us that we need to stop looking \u201ctoo autistic\u201d if we want to be treated with dignity and have a happy and productive life teaches us that who we are is wrong and ugly and unacceptable. And if we don\u2019t succeed in looking \u201cnormal enough\u201d we have been taught to try to hide our autism, so our boss, co-workers, classmates, etc. don\u2019t understand why we are unusual. We are more likely to be bullied, shunned, and fired from our jobs if people don\u2019t realize that there is nothing \u201cweird\u201d or wrong about us; we\u2019re just Autistic. People are more likely to be willing to work alongside someone they know is Autistic than someone who is just \u201cnebulously weird.\u201d I lost jobs for being too strange, creepy, etc. when it wasn\u2019t known that I am Autistic. Trying to teach Autistic people that the only route to success is to learn to fake being someone they aren\u2019t is setting most of them up for failure. And the stress is long-lasting and can lead to health and functioning difficulties down the road. An excellent essay by Mel Baggs talks about the breaking point that people can face later in life after too many years of struggling through the stress and difficulty of \u201cfaking normal.\u201d In  the section on burnout , Mel explains very clearly how years of \u201cfaking normal\u201d can lead to a breakdown: Burnout, long-term shutdown, or whatever you want to call it, happens generally when you have been doing much more than you should be doing. Most people have a level to which they are capable of functioning without burnout, a level to which they are capable of functioning for emergency purposes only, and a level to which they simply cannot function. In autistic people in current societies, that first level is much narrower. Simply functioning at a minimally acceptable level to non-autistic people or for survival, can push us into the zone that in a non-autistic person would be reserved for emergencies. Prolonged functioning in emergency mode can result in loss of skills and burnout. \n With some diseases with long-term effects (and I am not suggesting that autism is a disease), it is the people who tried to ignore the long-term effects and \u201cact normal\u201d who often burn out, probably because they are drawing on emergency reserves to do so. There is a high chance that autistic people who attempt to ignore the fact that they are autistic and act like non-autistic people are subject to the same kind of burnout, or even autistic people who push themselves too hard in general without trying to look normal. \n The danger here may be obvious: It may be the people most capable of passing for normal, the most obvious \u201csuccess stories\u201d in the eyes of non-autistic people (some of whom became so adept at passing that they were never considered autistic in the first place), who are the most likely to burn out the hardest and suddenly need to either act in very conspicuously autistic ways or die. If that sounds overly dramatic to you, it means that you still don\u2019t get it. You still don\u2019t really understand what it means to have a whole industry of therapy centered around making people do and say pointless and unnatural things so that they can look and sound like everyone else. Is there something about you that is different? Would you appreciate being told that you should spend your life dying your hair to hide the beautiful ginger shade you were born with? Have you ever recoiled in horror after learning that right handedness was so valued that left-handed children used to suffer having the bones in their hand broken so that they had no choice but to become right handed? Surely there\u2019s something about you that you have been pressured to hide and change? Dig into those memories to connect with what it means to be told that you were born wrong and need to spend the rest of your life pretending it wasn\u2019t so. Teaching  Quiet Hands  isn\u2019t harmless. It teaches us that we are mistakes. It silences a big part of our voice. It seeks to shape our bodies in the image of some unrealistic ideal. And, for many of us, it reduces our ability to function. I am a big fan of RPM, facilitated communication, typing or pointing at a letter board to communicate. I love to read the words of those who communicate with their hands. And one thing I have noticed many of those folks saying is that they can only communicate if they are allowed time to stim in between typing. Some flap their hands. Some twirl things like a special string. Some drop to the floor and roll back and forth. These kinds of motions \u2014 these very beautiful Autistic motions \u2014 help us to stay centered, to stay focused, to regulate huge emotions, to give needed input to nervous systems that do not function in the same way as most people around us. When you force Autistic people to stop moving in the ways our bodies are made to move, you take away more than the appearances that are so uncomfortable for you to see. You very often clip our wings. You take away our ability to self-regulate. You might complain that we scream or cry too much but haven\u2019t noticed that we scream and cry less when we are allowed to live our truth on all levels. You may complain about how we complete a task \u2014 or how we are unable to complete a task \u2014 but you haven\u2019t noticed that we can do many things much better when we are able to do them in the ways that feel natural to us and when we are allowed to take those small breaks to do the things that make us feel better and more connected. We make sounds. We make faces. We move our loud hands. We move our bodies. We spin in circles, roll on the floor, sigh, stretch, wave our arms, fidget with jewelry. Whatever it is that we do, we don\u2019t do it to annoy you. In some cases we can stop doing those things but the cost is too high for you to justify asking us to stop. Our quiet hands get loud and if you believe in autism acceptance you need to embrace our loud hands and understand why it is that our bodies need to sing.

{"date": "2015/04/07", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . F is for Facilitated Communication I\u2019m cheating a little bit today. I want to talk about\u00a0more than just traditional Facilitated\u00a0Communication, but I wanted to reserve C (communication) for Color and A (alternate communication) for Acceptance. Plus, I have seen facilitated communication getting a really bad rap in a lot of places so I especially wanted to put it front and center for an opportunity to focus on why facilitated communication is important and necessary and why people should stop giving it, and the people who use it and similar methods of supported typing, such a hard time. Facilitated communication is often condemned as a fraud, with detractors claiming that the facilitator is using Autistic people (and other people with movement disorders) as a puppet. For example, in 1994 the American Psychological Association (APA) released a  resolution  denying the efficacy of facilitated communication. Yet methods of supported typing are still very popular. Why? Because there are many people out there with movement and focus difficulties who are actually communicating their own words and thoughts but need assistance and accommodation to do so. Critics\u00a0claim that people using facilitated communication could not communicate so well because they could not have taught themselves to read and write, but I taught myself to read, beginning\u00a0at age 2, so it is easy for me to believe that others are self-taught as well. I am intelligent, but I am not a different species \u2014 I am a human being and the things I have done are accessible to other human beings as well. Are some cases of facilitated communication or supported typing \u201cpuppet shows\u201d? I think it\u2019s unlikely, but I haven\u2019t seen every single case so I just can\u2019t say it never happens.\u00a0I have watched a lot of facilitated communication and I am friends with people who communicate through facilitated communication or related methods and I am not one bit skeptical. I know I am talking to my friends, not to the people who help them with body pressure, helping them to stay upright and mobile, or helping them to stay focused on the task they want to accomplish. Before I go any further, I want you to watch some\u00a0videos of different sorts of supported typing\u00a0for yourself. This is Tim Chan from Australia, facilitated by his mother, Sarah. He began with wrist support (a method demonstrated about halfway through the video clip) and, over time, has progressed to only needing a supportive hand on his shoulder. The goal of many people who use supported typing is to eventually transition to being able to type without a facilitator at all. Today, Tim Chan types independently, without physical support. Notice that part of the support Tim is getting is the help in staying on task. That can be very important for Autistic people and does not at all indicate that the facilitator is controlling him. He clearly wants to communicate \u2014 even when he goes to roll on the floor, he gets up again right away when another question is asked. I really understand his distractability because I am the same way. I have more focus which allows me to do things like safely drive a car, but my support needs are low enough and my motor skills are high enough that the knowledge of the seriousness and danger of what I am doing are enough to keep me focused when driving or using a sharp knife or any other similar activity. I know one person who began communicating\u00a0using an accommodated form of typing who may be able to drive a car when she gets old enough because she can do trapeze work now \u2014 work which requires a lot of focus and coordination. When I am writing, or cooking, or drawing, or eating, I frequently get distracted and wander off. It is hard to stay on task. Obviously, I do stay enough on task to complete essays and art and to keep myself fed well enough to function (most of the time.) I need less support in my everyday life than many other Autistics. Tim needs that support to help him stay focused and not walk off in the middle of a sentence. It is clear to me that Tim appreciates the support in focusing because I do not see signs that he is becoming agitated or being forced to do something against his will. Next is the trailer from the excellent film  Wretches and Jabberers . In this clip you can see Larry and Tracey typing with support, and speaking \u2014 mainly by typing what they want to say and then reading their own words. I would like everyone to see this film! It is so clear that the Autistic people in the movie who type to communicate are the ones who are making the words, not the facilitators who support them. Supported typing is not some kind of P. T. Barnum circus trick and it is disrespectful and dehumanizing to say that Autistics who need a lot of life support could not have thoughts to communicate or suggest that those thoughts can only be believed if someone who needs a great deal of support in other aspects of their life does not need support around communication issues. Facilitated Communication, which began as an assistive method of communication for people with cerebral palsy,\u00a0was first developed in Australia in the 1970s by Rosemary Crossley. Building on that foundation, Soma Mukhopadhyay developed the Rapid Prompting Method (RPM) in the 1990s, first to help her son, Tito (who now types independently), and later to help many other Autistic people to communicate. This is a video explaining RPM and showing the use of a letter board for typing. And here are my friends, Emma and Ariane. First Ariane reads something Emma has written, and then we get to watch Emma\u2019s process of communication, using Soma\u2019s RPM method. (Emma can now type and write independently.) So, now that you\u2019ve seen what these sorts of assisted typing look like, I hope you are not so skeptical about their legitimacy. Why do other people have a problem with assisted communication? One reason is probably because they have seen something more overbearing. I have heard of facilitated communication that is literally hand-over-hand like some of the life skills training, such as brushing one\u2019s teeth. I think if I had ever seen that method used for communication I would be skeptical, too. Some people are skeptical because they find it too difficult to presume competence when someone\u2019s body moves in ways they do not value. They can accept Stephen Hawking\u2019s intelligence because he was not always so physically incapacitated but they struggle to accept the intelligence and competence of someone whose body was always\u00a0moving in scattered and unusual ways. In\u00a0 an interview , my friend Amy Sequenzia explains why she needs the support to type. \u201cTyping, for me, is not a simple thing. I need to focus and try to make my body and my brain work together. Sometimes I can\u2019t do that. Sometimes I need a lot of physical support, sometimes I need very little. I can type a few words independently, although this does not happen very often, yet. I always need emotional support and encouragement.\u201d (If you\u2019d like to read more of Amy\u2019s thoughts and experiences,  here is another interview with her .) Some people don\u2019t see why a person would need support. As Kim Wombles wrote in her  review  of  Wretches and Jabberers , \u201cCan someone explain why a man who has the fine motor skills \u00a0to paint needs someone holding onto him to type?\u201d She was speaking of the artist Larry Bissonette, who does now type independently. It seems obvious to me that making coffee, painting, and communicating through typing are three different skills and being competent or even highly skilled in one does not necessarily mean a person is going to be equally skilled in all three tasks.\u00a0 Obviously, Larry needed the support and encouragement of supported typing to help him as he developed greater communication skills. I can draw, but my handwriting is nearly completely illegible. I am able to produce very readable handwriting if I \u201cdraw\u201d it, but that takes so much longer than most people allot for handwriting that I am unable to\u00a0succeed on\u00a0hand-written exams and I had to switch to a different major from mathematics because I could not finish math exams in time \u2014 I would know the answers to all the problems, but would have to write my work very slowly to avoid copying errors and, as a result, when time was called I had only worked through half the problems. The same argument about support could be made for me. I can make coffee and I can draw \u2014 why do I require support and accommodations when it comes to handwriting? The simple answer: because I have a handwriting disability; dysgraphia. My difficulties with fine motor control do show up in my drawings, but because I am able to take as long as I need to complete a drawing (I take lots of breaks because holding a pen is very painful for me) and because people seem to see a \u201cprimitive art\u201d charm\u00a0in my wobbly lines, the dysgraphia is not as impairing when I am drawing a giraffe as it is when I am required to write a grocery list, a letter, or an exam. I like to give people some sort of litmus test for considering controversial things in the world of autism and here is my suggestion about supported typing, RPM, and facilitated communication: when you look at people who type independently now, did their \u201cvoice\u201d change significantly from how they wrote when someone was holding their arm or shoulder? If your child is learning to communicate in a supported manner, do they seem happier and calmer? Does it look like they are getting more of their needs met? The most important gauge of truth when it comes to communication is \u201cwhere the rubber meets the road.\u201d Is the supported typing or other controversial communication method making the person\u2019s life better? If the answer appears to be yes, stick with it and see where it goes. Ignore the naysayers and focus on what is helping you, your children, your family. There is plenty of evidence to use to gauge whether real communication is occurring. In the case of those folks who now write and type independently, it is clear that they have been the ones communicating all along. In the case of other folks who still need support, I feel it is best to presume that real communication is occurring there as well. Too many times, someone has been written off as \u201cnot being in there\u201d only to later prove that they were, indeed, \u201cin there\u201d and were not so happy about being written off like that. The least harmful assumption is always that someone really is \u201cin there\u201d and that communication that seems to be coming from them is really their communication. But even before someone develops independent typing (if ever. It is not a tragedy if they require support in communication for the rest of their life) there are strong indicators that real communication is taking place. Watch for those signs and, in the meantime, trust that you really are connecting with the person you seem to be connecting with. I am convinced that supported typing is valid. You may not yet be convinced as well, but if you love someone Autistic who is learning to communicate with support and assistance, you owe it to your loved one to trust their communication and to listen in love.

{"date": "2015/04/09", "body": "This is an entry for the  Blogging from A to Z Challenge . The entire month of April (except for Sundays) I will be blogging through the alphabet on autism-related topics to celebrate  Autism Acceptance Month . G is for Giraffe If you ask most people what the symbol of autism is, they will say it is the puzzle piece. Or they will talk about Light It Up Blue. Maybe they think the blue puzzle piece is the symbol or maybe the interlocking field of puzzle pieces in red, yellow, and two shades of blue. The problem with all those symbols is that they were chosen by people who were not Autistic. A bigger problem with those symbols is that many Autistic people are offended by them. G is for Giraffe because the giraffe is one of the symbols of autism that was chosen by Autistic people ourselves. Today I\u2019m going to talk about some of our symbols \u2013 the giraffe, the infinity symbol (sometimes portrayed as a m\u00f6bius infinity symbol),\u00a0the spectrum rainbow, \u00c2\u00fb, and the color red. I will also take time to explain why the puzzle piece and the color blue are not our symbols. The giraffe is a beautiful symbol because it comes from Autistics speaking up against a\u00a0song with defamatory language. Therefore it is a symbol of Autistic power. The giraffe comes from Autistic people staying calm while being compared to lamps and animals and turning something so ridiculous into a big joke \u2014 using laughter to battle ignorance and non-acceptance like the heroes of the Harry Potter series of novels fought their fears with the  Riddikulus  charm. Therefore it is a symbol of Autistic joy. The giraffe was rapidly adopted by a large number of Autistics, almost overnight. Therefore, it is a symbol of Autistic community. If you\u2019d like to learn the story of the giraffe as an Autistic symbol, you can read the whole backstory on the\u00a0Giraffe Party blog:  On the Origins of \u201cGiraffe Party\u201d For a brief moment, the dandelion was our symbol but therapists and corporations quickly stepped in and took that symbol and subverted it for their goals, including, in at least one case, adding in the divisiveness that the dandelion symbolized \u201chigh functioning\u201d autistics. If a symbol is not for all of us, it is not our symbol. If a symbol requires \u201cfunctioning labels,\u201d it is not our symbol. Symbols of Autistic culture must always represent solidarity among us because Autistic culture values acceptance and inclusion. If you ever see someone trying to take our giraffe away like our dandelion was, please step in, say something, stop them. The giraffe connects us all and must never be used as a symbol of dividing our community. Another symbol that unites us is the infinity symbol, often shown as a ribbon or even as a m\u00f6bius ribbon (a ribbon with a single twist, becoming a model for a single-sided object in three-dimensional space because it has no front or back.) And, yes, it too has been taken and subverted in unpleasant ways, but still belongs more to us than to those who have taken it and made it out of a puzzle-piece ribbon or made designs that put the infinity symbol and blue puzzle pieces together in piece of jewelry that donate profits to Autism Speaks. The infinity symbol can be depicted in different colors, but it began with a rainbow spectrum of colors to symbolize the great diversity in the Autistic community. Many people use the rainbow infinity symbol to represent the larger neurodiversity community as well \u2014 neurodiversity being about the full range of neurotypes, not just the autism spectrum. I would appreciate some help with the history of the spectrum infinity symbol. The first place I remember seeing it was in the logo for AFF ( Aspies for Freedom  \u2013 a group that accepted and sought to\u00a0unite all people on the spectrum, despite the name of the organization.) in 2004. The symbol has been widely adopted and grown much larger than AFF in the years since the founding of that group.\u00a0 AFF also established Autistic Pride Day (June 18th) which is still observed by many people in the Autistic community as a day that\u00a0we can\u00a0celebrate without the emotional difficulties so many of us experience in the month of April. If I have it wrong and the infinity symbol goes farther back in our community\u2019s history, please leave a comment to let everybody know! \u00c2\u00fb is the symbol of the Autistic Union. The A and U stand for autism but many folks have also adopted the color gold because Au is the chemical symbol for the element gold. Because of this, there are some folks saying \u201cLight It Up Gold\u201d (instead of Blue, the Autism Speaks color.) \u00c2\u00fb was started in Australia but is a world-wide phenomenon (not an organization because no one is in charge of \u00c2\u00fb \u2013 it belongs to everyone who accepts the  ten principles .) \u00c2\u00fb was started as something to add to one\u2019s Facebook name to indicate solidarity with the principles of \u00c2\u00fb but, like many symbols of our culture, \u00c2\u00fb has become something larger than just a Facebook identity. Finally, the color red was chosen this year as a bright and visible alternative to the Autism Speaks color, blue. The campaign is called  Walk in Red  and includes wearing red and blogging/tweeting/writing/celebrating Autism Acceptance. Not only is blue undesirable because it is the color of Autism Speaks, but blue is not inclusive, since Autism Speaks chose the color blue (from Rosco filters) to represent boys, automatically excluding women and girls: \u201cThe first question we wanted to ask was \u2013 why blue? What does the color blue have to do with the autism spectrum? The answer is that Autism Spectrum Disorders are almost 5 times more common among boys (1 in 54) than among girls (1 in 252). So, the color blue represents the boys diagnosed with autism.\u201d \u2013  Rosco\u2019s comments about being the official shade of blue for Autism Speaks. As for the puzzle piece? From the beginning, it was meant to symbolize something missing from Autistic people. That is offensive. We are not missing or lacking parts.  Autisticook has written about the history of the puzzle piece symbol . And you can read more reactions to the puzzle piece symbol at  Unpuzzled . I\u2019d love to see a discussion in the comments section of other symbols of Autistic culture I may have missed.

{"date": "2013/09/30", "body": "Okay, I\u2019ve had a nice rest and I launched my new book (so exciting!) so it\u2019s time to get back to the DSM-5. I know I\u2019m skipping around a little bit, but I want to go through the commentary section about Development and Course of Autism next. This section has seven paragraphs and I\u2019m going to take them one by one. So here\u2019s the first paragraph in that section: The age and pattern of onset also should be noted for autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms are typically recognized during the second year of life (12-24 months of age) but may be seen earlier than 12 months if developmental delays are severe, or noted later than 24 months if symptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description might include information about early developmental delays or any losses of social or language skills. In cases where skills have been lost, parents of caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills. Typically, this would occur between 12 and 24 months of age\u00a0 and is distinguished from the rare instances of developmental regression occurring after at least 2 years of normal development (previously described as childhood disintegrative disorder). First sentence: yes, age and pattern of onset are important. Age is crucial, since autism is a congenital condition (in other words, something you\u2019re born with.) As we talked about here before, though, autism often goes unnoticed in earliest life. The commentary attributes that to the severity or subtlety of the delays and symptoms, but for those from my generation there is another element to that. My symptoms were quite noticeable. I spent most of my childhood in therapy. It was quite obvious that *something* was going on. If I had been born 40 years later than I was, I surely would have been diagnosed Autistic in childhood. But many in my age group were not recognized, even when our symptoms were not subtle, because there wasn\u2019t as much knowledge back in the Sixties and Seventies as there is today. Yes, obviously some people got diagnosed properly back then \u2014 for example, Temple Grandin or Daryl Hannah. But most of us were just confusing to our parents and the professionals who examined us. This is because the understanding of how autism manifests was more limited back then, not the full spectrum we have today. For some examples, see this  British article from 1966  or this  53 minute documentary from 2003 about parenting a child with autism in the 1950s and 1960s . (The documentary needs a trigger warning to Autistics\u00a0for talk of a child being \u201cgone\u201d or \u201clost\u201d after signs of regressive autism appeared. And also a trigger warning to parents of Autistics for accusations of parents as causing their child\u2019s autism.) Half-way through the 2003 documentary, we meet a clearly Autistic adult whose mother says that the doctors refused to diagnose him back then because the family was African-American and not upper-middle class and highly educated. Fascinating. The way you see autism depicted in the 1960s will be very familiar to you but you will also recognize that it\u2019s only one aspect of what we understand autism to be today. The documentary will also show why people of my generation did sometimes get diagnosed but their parents rejected the diagnosis \u2014 since autism was blamed on the parents back then, particularly a \u201cRefrigerator Mother.\u201d So, often, a person my age who was struggling and was diagnosed with autism ended up removed and brought to a new therapist in a sort of \u201cdiagnosis shopping\u201d enacted by parents who couldn\u2019t bear to accept the blame that was so unfairly being leveled at them for their child\u2019s difficulties. Something else interesting to notice with the Refrigerator Mother documentary: the children were all very similar but the adults they grew up to be are so different. I find that fascinating and I think it indicates how much more study we need into autism across the life span so that we can understand outcomes better and maybe even eventually predict outcomes. The rest of the paragraph: I have talked to parents who claimed they knew \u201csomething was up\u201d with their child (who later turned out to be Autistic) from the day the child was born. But most children aren\u2019t spotted until they are a couple of years old. Some slip through the cracks a little longer but almost all of us displayed clear symptoms by the time we were school age. One last thing to note: the commentary says that it is rare to appear to regress after age two, but it does happen. I have noticed that the loss of skills, ability to cope, and functioning can happen at any age. All those who regress show signs of autism from the beginning, but some people go through a so-called regression as children, some at puberty, some in mid-life, often due to the stress and burn-out associated with a life-time of struggling to \u201cfake it\u201d as much as possible. The goal of normalization seems great on first glance \u2014 the goal of making an Autistic person \u201cindistinguishable from their peers.\u201d But what more and more people are starting to realize is that normalization comes at a price. It takes a great deal of effort to keep up\u00a0a fa\u00e7ade of normality and it wears on a person over time. I have lost some of the function and coping I used to have in my twenties because of the exhaustion and burn-out of trying to \u201chold it together\u201d all these years. I have struggled to try to \u201clook normal\u201d in public for so long now that it\u2019s a habit. I work to suppress my more unusual behaviors and only let loose when I am alone and can rock, pace, tic, spin, and otherwise stim as much as my body needs me to. Trying to hold it together is hard work and I have depleted myself over the years. I find it very difficult to go out in public at all and hard to stay out in public for long stretches of times. To some, I might appear to have become slightly \u201cmore autistic\u201d than I used to be and it might even be seen as a regression, but the skill, coping, and energy losses are solely due to the great toll that attempts at appearing normal have on me. I think many of the cases of what is called \u201clate regression\u201d are just as likely to be cases of \u201cburn out\u201d where a person had tried to function like everyone else and finally couldn\u2019t hold the act any longer. So there\u2019s the first paragraph of the development section! I\u2019ll be back next time with a discussion surrounding the contents of the second paragraph of that section. There is still a lot of DSM-5 material to work through, so I think this blog series will be going on for quite a while. With that in mind, I hope you all are still enjoying it! I know I\u2019m enjoying thinking and writing about these things. Thank you for reading and thank you in advance for any comments.

Paragraph 2 in the Development and Course section of the commentary in the autism spectrum disorder entry of the DSM-5: The behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder first become evident in early childhood, with some cases presenting a lack of interest in social interaction in the first year of life. Some children with autism spectrum disorder experience developmental plateaus or regression, with a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or use of language, often during the first 2 years of life. Such losses are rare in other disorders and may be a useful \u201cred flag\u201d for autism spectrum disorder. Much more unusual and warranting more extensive medical investigation are losses of skill beyond social communication (e.g., loss of self-care, toileting, motor skills) or those occurring after the second birthday (see also Rett syndrome in the section \u201cDifferential Diagnosis\u201d for this disorder). I think this paragraph is especially interesting because there has been a lot of debate in the autism community about whether regression actually occurs or whether something else is going on, for example, a developmental delay causing slower progress that only starts getting noticed when a significant number of milestones are missed. I also think some people have a lot invested in the \u201cregression vs. slower development\u201d argument because of how it feeds into the vaccine argument. Regression is often seen as evidence to support the vaccines-cause-autism theory because the typical age of regression and the age of lots of vaccines and boosters tend to coincide, making lots of parents feel that their child was just fine until s/he got the vaccines. But with the DSM-5 declaring that regression is a genuine thing that actually occurs, it weakens the vaccine argument because so many of those children who appeared to be having an abnormal regression when they got their shots turn out to have been having a normal (for autism) regression that just happened to be at the same time as the shots. For a long time, I was undecided as to where I stood on the issue of autistic regression as far as whether it was something that actually occurred or something that appeared to occur because a child was developing slowly and it took a number of months before the divergence of the Autistic child\u2019s development was noticeable in comparison to the non-autistic children\u2019s development trajectory. (I never accepted the vaccine theory, even before Wakefield was discovered to have lied about his data and lost his license to practice medicine as a result of it.) What convinced me that regression is a real thing was getting to know two different Autistic people who have fallen into the category described in the last sentence of this paragraph: regression after age two. Both people I know had significant autistic regression in their teen years (and both were repeatedly accused of being frauds because regression after age two is so rare. So I am glad to see the DSM-5 acknowledging that late regression can, indeed, occur and hope this helps my friends when they are criticized for not being able to do as adults many of the things they could do as pre-teens.) There is scientific evidence of late autistic regression before the DSM-5 and it is probably some of that research that informed the committee that made the decisions for the ASD entry and commentary in the DSM-5. The big one I always come back to is  a 2000 article by Lorna Wing and Amitta Shah in  The British Journal of Psychiatry .  The article is titled \u201cCatatonia in autistic spectrum disorders\u201d and it discusses a phenomenon the authors observed \u2014 a small percentage of Autistics develop increased catatonic behavior and apparent loss of skills around age 10 to 19. Some of those who fit this profile were previously diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, indicating that the change in observed behavior can be quite large in these cases. The two people I know who fit this profile (and fit it uncannily well, I should add) do not like the word \u201cregression\u201d to describe their observable changes. I agree with their reasons for displeasure with the term, but will continue to use it for this blog entry because it is the word used in the DSM-5 and I don\u2019t want to cause confusion by changing terms. But do be aware that many Autistics find it painful to be described\u00a0in those terms. And never assume that an Autistic doesn\u2019t hear what you say around them. There have been cases of Autistics who\u00a0were uncommunicative until they were in their 30s and were accidentally left near a typewriter, at which point they revealed that they could communicate, that they had somehow picked up written language with it never being taught to them, that they had heard and remembered everything that had been said to or about them, and that a lot of\u00a0the assumptions people were making about them were very damaging. So assume that everything you say is heard and understood and try to remember that some ways of referring to people hurt. Calling an Autistic\u2019s change in observed behavior \u201cregression\u201d can make a person feel like their growth is not recognized, only their deficits. And it can carry undertones of a message that the individual is not what they should be or what was desired from them. These may seem small nits to pick, but if you are the one who is being misinterpreted and talked about right in front of you all the time,\u00a0issues like the words\u00a0and concepts that are being used to describe you are huge. At any rate, back to the idea of regression in later life. Because I know two people who have experienced this, I was already well-placed to accept what the DSM-5 has to say about the existence of regression. If I know people who \u201cregressed\u201d in their late teens, why shouldn\u2019t I believe that\u00a0some autistics \u201cregress\u201d at age two or so? The development of an Autistic person is not a linear progression and our severity levels, as mentioned earlier, can be quite fluid. So I fully accept this paragraph of the Development and Course section of the ASD discussion in the DSM-5 and I am pleased to see a mention of later regression. While the discussion doesn\u2019t make it clear that this later regression can\u00a0occur in one\u2019s teens (or in one\u2019s thirties or forties, I should add. I have seen Autistics lose skills temporarily in the wake of a life tragedy in their middle age years) It does explain that this loss of skills can happen after age two and that\u2019s going to be very beneficial for the many Autistics who don\u2019t precisely fit the standard narrative. To take this from a theoretical level to a personal level, I have lost skills at different times in my life. Regular readers will already know that I, like many other Autistics I know, sometimes lose the skill of speech (although I am still able to write or use ASL during times when I am unvoiced.) That is my most frequent encounter with shifting skill levels, but I do have times when I stim more and times when I stim less. I have times when I forget how to cook or even forget how to stay on task enough to eat. I frequently forget how to get from point A to point B (a state worsened by my topographical agnosia in which familiar places can look foreign, especially if I am approaching them from a direction I usually don\u2019t.) I have times when my self-regulation of emotion skills drop out. I have times when it is practically impossible for me to understand human speech and other times when I have problems with understanding spoken language but the problems are small. I also, though I do not have and have never experienced catatonia as described in the Wing and Shah article, have days where my sense of balance is completely obliterated and I fall down several times in the course of living a normal day (and other days when my balance is strong enough to do yoga asanas.) My skills are uneven and they can come and go and I\u2019m not always aware of the triggers. I\u2019d like to see a discussion in the comments of \u201cregression\u201d, both temporary and apparently permanent. Did your kid \u201cregress\u201d? What age and how? (And I\u2019m sorry for any pain you feel from watching your child experience those changes. As much as we don\u2019t like being described as \u201cregressing\u201d I am aware of how stressful and painful it can be for a parent to watch us go through these things and similar things Autistics regularly experience.) Have you \u201cregressed\u201d in your autism? How do you feel about it? I think this is an important topic and I\u2019m glad to see the DSM-5 team opening the discussion of autistic regression. Thank you for reading and I\u2019m looking forward to any discussions that crop up in the comments for this entry.

Autism has only been a diagnosis for about seven decades, but so much has happened in those years. We have been the target of Nazi eugenicists, we have been revered as saints and demonized as changelings \u2014 impostors left by the elves or the gypsies while the real child was spirited away in the night. We have been \u201ctreated\u201d to unspeakable therapies administered by people who thought they were helping us as well as by people who thought there was no human \u201cin there\u201d \u00a0to help. We have been plot points and two-dimensional characters in scores of movies and television shows (and had a few really great movies made about us as well). Our mothers have been blamed for causing our existence by not loving us properly. Genetics have been blamed. Vaccines have been blamed. Vitamin D, air pollution, noise pollution, so many purported causes that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised one day to see a headline announcing that breathing causes autism. We have had our heroes and celebrities: some \u2014 like Temple Grandin, John Elder Robison, Daryl Hannah, Dan Ackroyd \u2014 \u00a0well-known to the mainstream. Others \u2014 Judy Singer, Laura Tisoncek, Michelle Dawson, \u00a0Jim Sinclair \u2014 mostly only known to our community. We had a contestant on America\u2019s Next Top Model (Heather Kuzmich), a contestant on American Idol (James Durbin), a contestant on The Amazing Race (Zev Glassenberg), and a contestant for Miss America (Miss Montana, Alexis Wineman). We have our symbols, like the rainbow spectrum infinity symbol, and others have created symbols for us that displease many of us, like the puzzle piece, often depicted as a gaping hole in a child\u2019s head, meant to symbolize that we are lacking some basic element of humanity. We have our books \u2014 Loud Hands, Aspergirls, Pretending to be Normal \u2014 and they have theirs \u2014 The Ethics of Autism, The Empty Fortress, Defying Autism. We have our tragedies: The Judge Rotenberg Center, Alex Spourdalakis, Melissa Stoddard, Daniel Corby, Jori Lirette . . . oh,  so many more names , so many more lives cut short. Too many to name here. And we have our victories: The closing of Willowbrook, the passage of the ADA, the appointment of Ari Ne\u2019eman to the National Council on Disability . . . In light of all this history, history I\u2019ve only barely begun to touch upon here, it is fitting that the month of November is now  Autistic History Month .\u00a0 This new celebration was announced to mixed responses. Some were elated (\u201cWHEN is this world going to give credit where credit is due? Autism is inherently so human. It is time people recognize it every where.\u201d) and some were baffled (\u201cAutistic \u201cHistory\u201d? That doesn\u2019t make sense. Autism hasn\u2019t been a recognized diagnosis long enough to have any real \u2018history.\u2019 We definitely need more Autism Awareness, but I\u2019m not sure using a term that will make people think we\u2019re some sort of ethnic group is going to accomplish that.\u00a0 I would also avoid terms like \u201cAutistic Pride.\u201d You want to humanize people with autism, not set them apart as a fringe group.\u201d). A 17-year-old autistic man asked:\u00a0\u201cI have a question: What exactly is there about Autistic History? I try to think about it but can\u2019t think about anything off the top of my head.\u201d And this is exactly why we need Autistic History Month: our own people do not know their history. Can you imagine an African-American teenager who didn\u2019t know who Martin Luther King was? Or what Jim Crow laws were? Or anything about the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation? What about a Jewish teenager who knew nothing about Dachau, Anne Frank, or the founding of modern Israel? Would you be sad to hear about Deaf teenagers who didn\u2019t know who Helen Keller was? Had never heard of Galludet University? A Blind teenager who had never heard the story of Louis Braille? But there are so many Autistic teenagers who have no idea who Bruno Bettelheim was or how much pain his theories brought to countless families for decades. They don\u2019t know who Judy Singer is or what word she has contributed to our language, to the culture of Autistic people and all other non-neurotypical people. They have no idea what makes some of us call Robert Kennedy one of our allies. They question the very idea that there could be such a thing as Autistic history; certainly they question the idea that there is enough history to be worth declaring an entire month of celebration. Some, as you see from the quote above, even question the value of an Autistic History Month. But this is an important part of Autistics Speaking. This is our history. We are a people. No, we are not connected by ethnic or religious bonds like some groups who have a history month. But we are connected. We are a neurotribe. We have a way of being that is very similar among us, even those of us who have never met another Autistic person in their life. We have a culture. We have a history and it is time to speak up about it! I am speaking about our history today for Autistics Speaking Day and I will continue to speak all month, sharing the vibrant tapestry of our history. I will not be silenced by those who try to shame me into silence because they feel it is inappropriate to talk about our history. I cannot even fathom the notion that it should be inappropriate to talk about Autistic history!! I will speak! And I will keep speaking until I have helped to create a world in which Autistic people know our history. Will you add your voice? We need to remember and share our history; it is an important part of who we are. \u201cIf you know your history, \nThen you would know where you coming from, \nThen you wouldn\u2019t have to ask me, \nWho the \u2018eck do I think I am.\u201d I am AUTISTIC, and I am proud of the history of my people.

{"date": "2013/10/26", "body": "After a pause to blog about other things, I\u2019m back with some more examination of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism and related discussion points. I\u2019m still working my way through the Development and Course section, which has seven paragraphs. Today, I look at paragraph four: Deafness may be suspected but is typically ruled out. During the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors and the absence of typical play become more apparent. Since many typically developing young children have strong preferences and enjoy repetition (e.g., eating the same foods, watching the same video multiple times), distinguishing restricted and repetitive behaviors that are diagnostic of autism spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The clinical distinction is based on the type, frequency, and intensity of the behavior (e.g., a child who daily lines up objects for hours and is very distressed if any item is moved). The reference to deafness is based on our reputation for not responding to our name when it is called out. I think the most common reason for this is that we can get so focused in on what we\u2019re thinking about or looking at that we close off the senses we aren\u2019t using. Or, if we\u2019re using our hearing to focus in on something, it\u2019s hard for something else to break through to us. We tend not to have the same kind of sensory filters that non-autistic people have, so many of us don\u2019t have the \u201ccocktail party effect\u201d \u00a0that makes voices stand out to us against a background of other sounds. I have seen  research that tries to claim that human voices are \u201cless important\u201d \u00a0to us than other sounds , but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a completely accurate interpretation for how we respond (or don\u2019t respond) to voices. The article I linked to claims we aren\u2019t \u201cmotivated\u201d by human voices. I think they are mixing up cause and effect and the truth is more likely that we aren\u2019t as \u201cmotivated\u201d by voices because we don\u2019t hear them as well. On top of everything I mentioned in the previous paragraph, many of us also have some amount of CAPD (central auditory processing disorder) which seems to most strongly affect cognition in the range of human voices. I know that I can listen to music with a finely-tuned musician\u2019s ear and hear every little nuance of sound but someone speaking can get very garbled very quickly. I\u2019m not so good with telephones but can usually do well in a one-on-one conversation on Skype with a headset because the sound quality is better and always coming straight into my ears. In the open environment of a room, my hearing ability quickly degrades, especially if there are multiple people speaking at once or a noisy environment like\u00a0 a restaurant with lots of piped in music, dishes rattling, etc. I have surprised people when I have been sitting in a restaurant and started pointing out sounds to them \u2014 naming the song playing over the speakers above (\u201cI didn\u2019t even hear music at all!\u201d) the sizzle of the grill in the kitchen (\u201coh! I hear it now that you point it out. But it\u2019s so faint! How did you hear that?\u201d) \u2014 yet I struggle to understand the speech of my dining companion sitting right next to me. I have no auditory filters \u2014 I hear EVERYTHING, all at once \u2014 and I have CAPD, so speech gets mixed up. (Think of CAPD as being something similar to having dyslexia of the ear.) So, yeah, I probably have less neurological \u201cpleasure reward\u201d from voices, too. Even though I love the rich, chocolate sound of my boyfriend\u2019s voice. Even though I can often identify people by their voice alone (a nice compensation for being blind to faces.) I\u2019m not less motivated by voices, I just have a really hard time hearing and understanding the darned things! So I suspect the actual issue with appearing deaf and\u00a0not responding to hearing our name called is simply that we really don\u2019t hear it. Some people seem to have a hard time understanding how our sensory perceptions work. It\u2019s hard to fault them for that, since that \u201d how\u201d \u00a0is actually a very individual thing. There are some commonalities, yes, but the overall pattern of hyper-sensitivities, hypo-sensitivities, changing sensitivities? That is excruciatingly individual. Every single thing I ever say about how my senses take in and interpret the world? There are Autistic people just like that and there are Autistic people not like that at all. Take me as a general guidepost but not a perfectly representative map. Again, we see a mention that autistic behaviors can become more apparent in the second year of life. This is significant because it correlates with some vaccination times and could cause confusion in people who believe that autism is caused by vaccinations. The amount of change can be really dramatic, though. Some Autistic kids gradually reveal their autism as they grow and don\u2019t make milestones on the same timetable as their age peers. Other Autistic kids really do change a lot, though. I\u2019ve seen the video and photographic evidence: before age two (or so) the child is speaking, smiling, laughing. After age two (or so), the child no longer speaks, no longer smiles, and exhibits a marked loss of emotional affect. Science still has a lot of exploration to do before it begins to understand the development and course of autism. When I look back at my childhood photos, I see myself laughing and smiling at age one and two but mostly deadpan, sullen, mournful afterwards. In my case it\u2019s really hard to determine what\u2019s what, though. I definitely became less bubbly when I started school because of the stress of it. The further along I got in school, the more stressful it became and the more my default affect became that of a dog that\u2019s been kicked one too many times. I also had a brother who spent most of my childhood dying and completed the task just before I turned seven. So it\u2019s impossible to look at my childhood facial expressions and determine what might be a sign of autism and what is just a general sign of a miserable childhood. I find it interesting that now that I am an adult, I frequently get asked what I\u2019m angry about or what\u2019s wrong when I\u2019m feeling calm and peaceful and happy. I am definitely a sufferer of \u201c Bitchy Resting Face .\u201d\u00a0Either my face developed the habit of looking unhappy all the time (except when I\u2019m laughing or when I\u2019m paying attention to making my face look pleasant) as a result of years of suffering or I really do have affect issues and my default, relaxed, no-affect face looks gloomy to others who are so accustomed to all faces having stories written on them that they are still trying to read mine even when it\u2019s just a blank page. Or I could just have, you know, Bitchy Resting Face. Another point the DSM-5 makes is that many of the repetitive practices of autism are common to all small children. This is an echo of what I (and many others) are often saying: that autism is not so alien. The things we do are mostly things all people do. We just do them more often and with more intensity. My sister is not autistic. When she was about two years old, she memorized every commercial on television. She is quite bright so she only needed to hear them once to have them completely memorized. She would gallop through the house on all fours, pretending to be a horse, singing commercial jingles at the top of her lungs. If you said something that had two or three of the words of a song from a commercial in a row, she\u2019d start singing the whole jingle. My sister was deeply obsessed with television commercials and repeated them all day long. But for a two-year-old, that is normal behavior. I used to know an Autistic boy who behaved the same way at age twelve. He memorized commercials and entire television and movie scripts. Almost everything he ever said was a line from a movie. The technical term is echolalia, but when you read about echolalia, so much of the literature claims that the people engaging in it are not making sense and are just randomly speaking nonsense. In my experience with \u201cKyle,\u201d \u00a0that was not the case at all. Kyle was always communicating when he repeated movie scripts. If you looked past the fact that someone else had written the words he was using, you could clearly see that they were his words \u2014 he had made them his own. And he was always matching quoted phrases to the situations he was in.\u00a0For example, if you were serving him at Thanksgiving and asked him if he preferred\u00a0breast meat or dark meat he might answer by quoting Freddy Krueger from the horror film, \u201cFreddy vs. Jason\u201d:\u00a0 \u201cHow sweet! Dark meat!\u201d (In the creepy Freddy voice and everything!) Not everything Kyle said was so easy to interpret as that, but every quote he\u00a0recited had meaning for\u00a0him, regardless of whether those of us around him could accurately interpret it\u00a0or not.\u00a0All I can say about researchers and other professionals who claim that repetitive movie quoting is random and pointless is \u201cwhat we have here is failure to communicate \u2014 some men you just can\u2019t reach.\u201d \u00a0And, in case I\u2019m not being clear the failure is on the part of the professionals. The \u201cecholalic\u201d is doing just fine . . . for anyone who is willing to really listen and presume competence and communication. So there\u2019s my take on paragraph four. I\u2019ll be back with the next paragraph and on through the rest of the DSM-5 entry. I\u00a0will probably be\u00a0be returning to this DSM-5 topic (with interstitial side-tracks on other topics, including the upcoming  Autistics Speaking Day  and  Autistic History Month  essays) throughout the rest of the year because there\u2019s so much in there and it\u2019s so fascinating to me. I hope these ramblings are helpful to you, too.

{"date": "2013/10/08", "body": "I\u2019ve really been enjoying writing this series. It\u2019s given all of us a chance to look more closely at what\u2019s in the DSM-5, it\u2019s given me a chance to explore related themes that are very important and interesting to me, and it\u2019s given others a chance to process some of the things going on in their own lives. I encourage everyone to look back at the comment sections of previous entries in this series where there are some great discussions of diagnostic issues and issues related to living with autism or helping a loved one with their experience of living with autism. The last entry has an especially interesting discussion in which a reader shared her concerns for her dear son who has gained and lost speech skills twice now. I would love to see more people enter that conversation with words of support or shared information or similar experiences. I love it when all of you come together and help each other. It makes me feel really good to facilitate a place where those kinds of conversations and connections can occur! Today I\u2019m going to look at the third paragraph in the Development and Course section of the Autism Spectrum Disorder discussion section of the DSM-5: First symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed language development, often accompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g., pulling individuals by the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns (e.g., carrying toys around but never playing with them), and unusual communication patterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name). When I look at descriptions like this, my first instinct is to think back on my own childhood. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a first response for my readers who are also Autistic (and maybe some who aren\u2019t) and I\u2019m assuming that parents of Autistic children immediately think about their own child\u2019s early development when they read a paragraph like that one. Most of my symptoms didn\u2019t really get noticeable until I went to pre-school because at school there were a lot of other children to compare me to. Also, school was much louder, more chaotic, more crowded, and generally more disturbing to me than life at home. But while things didn\u2019t really get serious for me until I was four, there were earlier signs. I did have social interest \u2014 I doted on my older brother. I don\u2019t remember unusual social interactions in my early years but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything because I\u2019m often told that something I did or said was strange or disturbing\u00a0now as an adult when I had not realized that I was doing or saying anything out of the ordinary at all. So I\u2019m not sure whether I would recognize unusual social interactions from my early childhood. I remember a lot of what, looking back, were very unusual social interactions from age 4 on, but I don\u2019t have a lot of context for understanding earlier behavior. (However, the description does say \u201coften,\u201d not \u201calways.\u201d Similarly, it says \u201cfrequently\u201d with respect to delayed language development, but we know that the former diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s that has now been rolled together with PDD-NOS and other former diagnoses into the single category of ASD was noted for having no noticeable language delay.) I did have odd play patterns, but only odd in retrospect. They seemed normal to me \u2014 after all, why would I engage in play that *I* found odd. I lined my dolls up a lot. I did name them all, but I couldn\u2019t remember their names so at one point I wrote their names on slips of paper and attached each name to its corresponding doll so I could remember what I had named them. (Naming one\u2019s dolls seemed very important to me because that was always the first question an adult asked when they saw one of my doll\u2019s: \u201cwhat\u2019s her name?\u201d so I was trying very hard to be able to have the right answer. I was very concerned with having the right answer for every question.) After my diagnosis, I spent a lot of time looking back over my childhood, initially with the hope that I could find enough evidence to disprove the autism diagnosis. I didn\u2019t want to be autistic and I fought hard against the diagnosis for a long time before I accepted it. One of the things I hit on was the thought that I had, indeed, been engaging in imaginative play so I couldn\u2019t possible be autistic. After I thought about it for a few more years, I finally understood that what I had thought was imaginative actually wasn\u2019t. My prime example for imaginative play was that I build an \u201cisland home\u201d in my play corner. I built a hut by attaching a sheet to a bookcase and to a toy chest so it angled down like a lean-to. I hauled some baskets in there. My father gave me a beautiful abalone shell that I added to the set. But what was I actually doing? I was making a life-sized diorama. I had read Scott O\u2019Dell\u2019s award-winning book,  The Island of the Blue Dolphin , and was captivated by the story of an island girl who had to survive alone after her village moved to the mainland, accidentally leaving her behind. I reconstructed Karana\u2019s home from items around the house. I tried to emulate as many elements from the story as I could. I would sit in my \u201cwhalebone hut\u201d and think about things that happened in the book. But I never made new adventures for Karana. I never imagined new things. My \u201cimaginative play\u201d was entirely imagined by Mr. O\u2019Dell. My daydreams were the same. I loved the show  Gilligan\u2019s Island  and I would imagine episodes I had watched, inserting myself into the story. Today, there\u2019s a name for a character like that. People who write fanfic (fan fiction: stories set in a pre-existing fictional universe) who include themselves (or a thinly-veiled version of themselves) into stories are said to be creating \u201cMary Sues.\u201d I was the queen of the Mary Sues as a child! People might well have wondered what I was thinking about when I sat, quietly daydreaming. I had many different thoughts, but a common daydream themes were Mary Sues: me on  Gilligan\u2019s Island . Me on  Bewitched . Me on  Lost in Space . I never made new stories \u2014 they were always established episodes I had actually seen. My presence never changed the plot or the outcome. I was simply inserted into a pre-existing story, whole cloth. It took me a long time to understand what \u201cimpaired imagination\u201d meant or to accept that I do actually have a different type of imagination from most people. I bristled at the idea that my imagination could be impaired. I am one of the most creative people I know. I knit, crochet, write, compose music, sew. I follow patterns or tutorials and I create new things. I see ways to rearrange things into new configurations that are different, not merely derivative. I do have a much more difficult time writing fiction than non-fiction (not something shared by my fellow Autistics. I know several Autistics who write terrific fiction.)\u00a0But I really didn\u2019t like thinking of myself as someone \u201clacking imagination\u201d at all. I have since learned that, while I may not be \u201clacking\u201d something (I am whole and complete!) I do have a different sort of imagination than people who have more mainstream neurologies. The breakthrough for me in understanding the differences in my imagination came when I was learning more about alexithymia (which is a label for a cluster of different but related states, all sharing the trait of having difficulty identifying one\u2019s own emotions.) I found an  imagination self-test  when reading about alexithymia and took it. It looks at two types of imagination, spontaneous and constructed, and analyzes whether the test-taker has both or predominantly one or the other. I got an extremely low numerical score, indicating that my type of imagination is almost entirely constructed, not spontaneous. That answered a lot of questions for me . . . but only about me, not about autism in general, because it turned out that many of my fellow Autistics got different scores. I have not yet figured out if my low score and my moderate alexithymia are a correlation \u2014 I haven\u2019t had a chance to compare others\u2019 scores on the imagination test to their levels of alexithymia. When I googled just not to find the test again, I discovered that my friend, Cynthia, wrote  a blog entry about taking the imagination test  on a different web site that gives statistics for tests based on how many people have taken them and whether the takers are Autistics or not. Her thoughts on the test are quite interesting (and I was excited to see that she used to daydream about  Lost in Space , too!) and I recommend taking a look at her blog entry on the topic of autism and imagination and the alexithymia imagination test. I hope no one is disappointed that I explored this paragraph from the DSM-5 solely in relation to my own life experience as an Autistic. I really didn\u2019t have much to say about the paragraph otherwise (and it\u2019s been a tiring couple of days so I may have missed something obvious I could have talked about.) I\u2019d love to see comments and discussions of this paragraph in light of how *you* or *your children* fit or don\u2019t fit into the traits described. When I start writing on one of these snippets from the DSM-5, I\u2019m never sure where it\u2019s going to go. This one went to reminiscing about my own life. I also never can predict where comments and discussions are going to go, so if this entry moves you to talk about something entirely different, please feel free to share that, too! As always, everyone\u2019s comments will be approved (although sometimes there\u2019s a time lag) except for anything that is attacking or abusive. You don\u2019t have to agree with me or with anyone here, but you do have to play nice. Thanks! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://oaq.blogspot.com/", "http://musingsofanaspie.com/2013/02/12/two-factor-imagination-scale-tfis-test/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/dsm-5-and-autism-development-and-course-part-3/", "title": "DSM-5 and Autism: Development and Course part\u00a03"},
{"date": "2014/01/13", "body": "I am a person who tries my hardest to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. I realize I have a strong streak of suspicion in me, so I aim for the best possible view of others and attempt to judge them innocent until proven guilty. Lately, the organization named Autism Speaks has worked really hard to provide me with that proof. Exhibit A:\u00a0 The\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCall to Action\u201d by Suzanne wright  (the co-founder of Autism Speaks) that\u00a0said that I\u00a0 and those like me are unspeakable horrors to our families who live in despair and depletion, ill and broken,\u00a0because we are so awful to cope with. Exhibit B: the latest documentary film from Autism Speaks, titled,  \u201cSounding the Alarm.\u201d  For an organization that tries to claim they are not alarmist, that is a pretty fishy film title, right? Those of you who have followed my blog for a while know that I was an incredibly difficult child to raise. I\u2019ll be honest: I pretty much did deplete my mother (although she has bounced back quite beautifully these days.) And you know I\u2019ve had a hard life, with bullying, abuse, poverty, homelessness, and chronic unemployment. But you know what else? I would estimate that 90% of my difficulties in life were not caused by being born Autistic \u2014 they were caused by other people not coping well with who I am. People who don\u2019t like the way I move, the way I speak, the things that catch my interest end up pushing me and bullying me and excluding me in ways that make my life miserable. Most of the \u201ctragedy\u201d of my life was completely avoidable if everyone around me had been encouraged to be a little more open-minded\u00a0and discover the incredibly loyal friend or the hard-working and dedicated employee behind the quirky behavior and different way of viewing the world. You see, my life only becomes a tragedy when someone else chooses to frame it that way. And that is objectifying toward me and people like me and I will explain to you why I feel that way. Human beings \u2014 at least those living in industrial \u201cWestern\u201d culture \u2014 have basically two ways to view lives. There\u00a0are lives, plain and simple. These are what they are living, what their friends and family are living. Regular lives\u00a0have ups and downs\u00a0and long, welcome stretches of \u201cboring\u201d everyday stuff. There is no overarching framework because they aren\u2019t stories; they are lives. Stories are the other way to view lives. We view imaginary lives that way all the time when we watch television and movies.\u00a0We also frame certain people\u2019s lives as stories when we write about real people in books or magazines. Stories\u00a0do not have long stretches of everyday \u201cboring\u201d regularity, because stories are about heroes and villains \u2014 stories are drama and drama is shaped by our theatrical forms that\u00a0box everything up as Comedy or Tragedy. You\u2019ve seen the masks, right? The iconic symbol of the theater with one mask laughing in hilarity and the other weeping openly. This is how we frame stories and this is why people who want to box me\u00a0up and objectify my life\u00a0so often strip all the complexity out of my \u201cstory\u201d and try to fit it into comedy (\u201clook at that ridiculous ******!!\u201d) or tragedy (\u201cPoor thing, she\u2019s so pitiful. It\u2019s inspirational to me that she even gets up every morning and goes on living day after day!\u201d) People who want my life to be a story and not just a life are required to objectify me and amputate most of my actual life to get the essence of me into that little box they need to put me in so they can make their point. Autism Speaks\u2019 point is that autism is evil, Autistic people are a tragedy, families of Autistic people are broken on the wheel of autism . . . oh, and give us lots of money. They try to claim that I can\u2019t be upset about the things they say because they aren\u2019t talking about me, they\u2019re talking about \u201cthose Autistics.\u201d You know, the cardboard cut-out caricatures of Ultimate Tragedy that never mature beyond infancy and thus grow up to be Useless Eaters and Burdens to Us All. I am \u201ctoo high functioning\u201d (meaning I continued to grow and develop and change throughout the course of my life and am now able to type words and lift a spoon to my mouth unassisted) and I am not who they\u00a0mean. Well, if they aren\u2019t talking about me, they need to stop counting me in order to make their massive \u201ctsunami\u201d declarations of millions and millions of us who\u00a0are struggling and suffering\u00a0(unless you give lots of money to Autism Speaks, of course.\u00a0That will somehow magically stop our suffering . . . . well, no, it won\u2019t. So they need\u00a0you to\u00a0give them some more money. Don\u2019t stop yet! There are still MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of Autistics out there! Tragedy! Alarm! Crisis! Pandemic! . . .\u00a0keep that money coming.)\u00a0 If there are so many millions of us, then they *ARE* counting me and people like me so how dare they say I have no right to be distressed by their rhetoric about ME? Would you like to know how *I* read the story of my life? Sure, there are hard times. I struggle a lot. But I also accomplish and achieve a lot. I would like less struggle. I would like a\u00a0LOT less struggle. But I would not like no struggle at all, because having something to push against adds to my strength. I want to have some challenges so that I can have some accomplishments. I want to have some difficulties so that I can have some growth. As Robert Browning said, \u201ca man\u2019s reach should exceed his grasp\u201d. I would like my grasp to come a lot closer to my reach (wouldn\u2019t we all?) but I want there to always be something just brushing my fingertips, tempting me to press on. I never want to fulfill all my dreams, unless I grow new dreams in the meantime. I want there to always be someplace new to go, something new to strive for. I would like those things to be new skills, new arts, new travels and people. Right now, some of those ungrasped things are more fundamental. Right now, some of those ungrasped things are unmet needs, not unlived dreams. There are hard times and things I would like to improve, but that doesn\u2019t make my life a tragedy. If I had to define my life in one word, it would not be \u201ctragedy.\u201d It would be \u201cjoy.\u201d I have an abundance of joy in my life. I have always had joy in my life, even during the hard times. I believe I could be left sitting in a garbage heap and manage to find something beautiful there. Suzanne Wright painted her picture of what our lives are. Let me paint a few vignettes of\u00a0my own, one, single, Autistic life: It is summer and I am walking. The brush is scrubby and dry and tiny black-and-white checkered lizards bake in the sun on flat rocks. Raptors wheel high in the sky, nearly invisible against the glare of the sun. The trail I\u2019m on dips lower, into a grove of evergreens, and suddenly I am wrapped in the sound of scores of little birds, singing in the trees. A swarm of dragonflies seemingly materialize from nowhere and I stop walking, transfixed by the beauty of the sun glinting rainbow sparks from their diaphanous wings as they circle lazily around my head. I am tucked away in a dusty corner of the library, reading. What am I reading? It must be a comic book of some sort, because I read intently, then suddenly burst into laughter, nodding my head and shaking my hands with excitement and happiness. Then I go back to intently reading with furrowed brow before bursting again into childlike laughter. Curious to see what is causing such reactions in me, you draw nearer to discover that I am reading a collection of dozens of mathematical proofs of the Pythagorean theorem.\u00a0 That beautiful moment when all the pieces fall into place is so glorious and profound to me that I am helpless to do anything but laugh with delight when I get to that point in each mathematical proof. I\u00a0have a new musical instrument and I am exploring the sounds it makes. I am comparing it to every other type of instrument I have played before \u2014 and there are many \u2014 to see how it is similar and how it is different. Within five minutes, I play my first simple song. Within five days, I am playing as if I have\u00a0been working\u00a0with that instrument for months. I do the same things with languages \u2014 writing letters and poetry in grammatically correct\u00a0Swedish\u00a0three hours after I opened the parcel containing a Swedish-English dictionary and began studying the sentence structure of the language. I do the same thing with anything that is based on patterns because I am a pattern thinker. I do not think in words. I do not think in pictures. I think in\u00a0symbols and patterns. Any process or thing that succumbs naturally to pattern thinking is an easy delight for my pattern-seeking mind and heart. I am exhausted, so I lay down to listen to music and maybe sleep for a\u00a0couple of hours. My cat gets excited to see me recline because I am creating his favorite place in the whole world \u2014 I am becoming\u00a0his cat mattress. He runs to me and climbs on top and we adjust ourselves to find the spot of maximum comfort for both of us, the\u00a0two of us so in tune with one another that words are unnecessary. We go beyond communication; we commune. I wrap my arms around him and bury my face in his kitten-soft fur and he purrs and wraps\u00a0his\u00a0paws around my head. We lay there together, two souls breathing as one, rejuvenating each other with\u00a0the priceless love and trust\u00a0that connects our gentle spirits. This is my life. This is not\u00a0a tragedy. I am not a statistic. I am not a pawn to be used to\u00a0manipulate you into giving money to a charity that gives\u00a0about 4% of its income to actually helping Autistic people and our families and gives\u00a044% of its income to researching ways to wipe me and my kind off the face of the Earth. (And another 22% to fundraising efforts that paint us as a tragedy so that they can bring in more money to find more ways to create a world where people like me are extinct.) My life is not a tragedy. My life is far too complex \u2014 and far too beautiful \u2014 to ever be mistaken for a tragedy. This is why Autism Speaks does not speak for me. I am Autistic\u00a0and I can speak for myself. (And on those days when I can\u2019t, I can write for myself. And on the days when I can\u2019t even do that, I\u2019m still not a tragic pawn to be moved\u00a0across the board of someone else\u2019s political and financial agenda.) I am not a horror. I am not a destructive force. I am not a tsunami or an epidemic. I am a human being, living my complex, messy, sometimes boring, sometimes gloriously beautiful, everyday life. My life is not a tragedy. I am a human being and we are too complex to be reduced to such abject objects. See us . . . really see us. We are priceless beyond measure. We are not tragic. Please do not assist any person or organization in attempting to reduce our beautiful and complex lives to little more than a theatrical stage show. Our lives are not tragedies.

{"date": "2014/01/28", "body": "(trigger warning: everything that was ever trigger-y about being Autistic in a world that doesn\u2019t want us here.) I\u2019m pretty much always taking some of the free courses on Coursera. I don\u2019t always do everything required for a certificate (I\u2019ve come close several times and I have one certificate for a Brown University class \u201cThe Fiction of Relationship\u201d) but I watch a lot of lecture videos and think about ideas presented. I just watched a lecture for a Rutgers University class called \u201cSoul Beliefs: Causes and Consequences\u201d and when the professor began speaking about tribes, I took extra interest in what he was saying. He was talking about both traditional tribes and modern tribe-like social structures, particularly religions (the title of the lecture was \u201cfunctions of religions\u201d.) But he pointed out that a tribe can be members of the Elk Club, a street gang, or participants in any sort of subculture that exhibits a shared culture and set of values. As he discussed how one becomes a member of a tribe, I couldn\u2019t help applying his words to my\u00a0neurotribe of Autistic people, particularly Autistic activists I know online. He said, \u201cthe first step in learning to become a member of a tribe is imitation. It is through imitation and instruction that we absorb the\u00a0values and worldviews of the tribe.\u201d That makes Autistic culture unusual\u00a0when compared to other \u201csocial tribes\u201d that exist today, because we come into\u00a0Autistic community already in possession of at least 80% of Autistic culture (possibly because so much of it is neurological and deeply-rooted, not artificial or constructed.) We come into Autistic community with very similar mannerisms, preferences, and worldviews, even though\u00a0many of us never met another Autistic person during our formative years . . . \u00a0and those of us who did were often intentionally kept separated from other Autists because many professionals believe it is not good to let us \u201cmingle\u201d because we will \u201cpick up bad habits from one another.\u201d (What? Like the annoying habit of realizing there are other people like us and thus maybe\u00a0we\u2019re not so \u201cwrong\u201d\u00a0as we\u2019ve been led to believe we are?) There is some imitation and instruction that occurs when Autistics come together. For example, I\u2019m told that many gatherings of Autistic adults use the Deaf applause\u00a0hand-movement instead of clapping hands because so many of us find the high-pitched palm-striking noises of traditional Western applause painful to hear.\u00a0While it is such an obvious solution that I\u2019m sure it must have come about by parallel means, it did require some people to suggest it and other people to adopt it as a good idea. It was the third item on his list of ways people learn how to be a member of a tribe that helped me understand more about why \u2014\u00a0beyond the effects of our shared clusters of neurologically-based traits \u2014\u00a0so much of Autistic culture almost seems to have arisen before Autistics came together to build community. The third item on his list was initiation. Some initiations are mild: learn a few words or steps, maybe eat a live goldfish. Some initiations are brutal: street gangs beat their members in and university fraternity members sometimes die from the harshness of the initiatory rites. Autistic initiation is one of the most brutal tribal initiations out there. And, again, we are different from the other tribes. We do not conduct our own initiations. The initiation into Autistic culture comes from growing up Autistic.\u00a0Some of us were\u00a0 abused  by  peers . Some of us were  abused  by  parents . Some of us were  abused  by  teachers . Some were  abused  by  therapists .\u00a0Many of us notice\u00a0when people are \u201c staring at us like we are\u00a0garbage .\u201d We hear the words others call us. We hear the threats. We can read the  letters  neighbors send to our parents. And when we reached an age where we knew the name of our diagnosis and had access to the news, we saw that other people like us are killed. By  police .\u00a0By  parents \u00a0. . .\u00a0 and people  sympathize  with the  killers  more than the  victims . It\u2019s a  radical act  to tell people  not to kill us . And this is the initiation into our tribe.

{"date": "2014/04/20", "body": "There\u2019s something that kind-hearted and well-meaning people say that can hurt. Well\u2026 there are lots of things like that, but today I want to talk about the anti-label statements. It goes something like this: \u201cLet\u2019s go around the circle and introduce ourselves.\u201d \u201cHi, my name is Sparrow. I\u2019m a writer, artist, musician, and astrologer. I live in an apartment with my cat, Fermat, and I am Autistic.\u201d \u201cOh, Sparrow, I don\u2019t think you should call yourself autistic. Labels are for soup cans, not people! You\u2019re such a sweet, intelligent young lady. You don\u2019t need to use that label on yourself any more. We all accept you here. You\u2019re just like us and seem totally normal to us. Don\u2019t label yourself.\u201d image: a bowl of alphabet soup with the word \u201cAutistic\u201d floating in it. The person who says that is trying to be progressive and enlightened and kind and accepting. It is so hard to tell them that they are hurting me because their words so obviously come from a place of love. But those words also come from a place of fear and misunderstanding, so it is only by explaining why it hurts me to tell me not to label myself that I can help others to perfect that love they are trying to express. In my opinion, labels are valuable tools. Labels help us to find other people with whom we resonate. How many dating sites would people bother with if you couldn\u2019t use labels to tell\u00a0prospective dates that you identify as: male, female,\u00a0(on more enlightened sites, there are more gender options), Jewish, Neopagan, Christian, atheist, agnostic, Muslim, Buddhist, etc. African-American, White, Asian, Native American, etc. smoker, non-smoker, and so on. Those labels are crucial if people are to find dates with the sort of people who \u201cring their bell\u201d and try to form intimate partnerships with them. Imagine trying to find a date on a site where all the people were just randomly jumbled together. Labels help us to find groups with which we click. I wouldn\u2019t be studying Morse code right now if I weren\u2019t able to label myself as a ham operator and find other people who also call themselves hams. I would have missed out on a lot of great friendships if people from the Rainbow Family refused to use labels and didn\u2019t call themselves Rainbows. People use labels all the time when they are seeking groups with which to associate. Labels help us to understand ourselves better. Yes, they are a sort of heuristic \u2014 a short-hand and reductionist way to identify things that doesn\u2019t encapsulate the entirety of who and what a person is \u2014 but they are so useful. A woman who notices her stomach getting bigger and bigger is comforted by remembering that she is pregnant. Pregnant is a label. When I get frustrated that I have to slowly reason out people\u2019s words and actions and cannot interpret them immediately and on-the-fly, it comforts me to remember that I am Autistic. Autistic is a label. We\u2019ve all heard someone say \u2014 either joking or seriously \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s because I\u2019m a man,\u201d or\u00a0\u201cI feel this way because I am transitioning,\u201d or\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s because I\u2019m a woman,\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s because I\u2019m still a kid,\u201d or \u201ccome on, I\u2019m a grown-up!\u201d or any variety of these. Man, trans, woman, kid, grown-up\u00a0\u2014 all labels. And all useful. Abandoning labels is well-intentioned \u2014 it tries to seek to avoid harming others. But it can cause more harm than good. I view the drive to abandon labels as a close relative to person-first language. Both seek to assert one\u2019s humanity in the face of something considered dehumanizingly horrible. We don\u2019t find people insisting on person-first language for conditions considered positive or neutral, like being an artist, musician, male or female, etc. People only get cranky about the \u201cperson living with Thingness\u201d construction when\u00a0being a Thing\u00a0is thought to be something terrible. Likewise, people who say that people shouldn\u2019t be labeled (\u201clabels are for soup cans, not people\u201d) have no problem with labels like \u201cman,\u201d \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201cartist,\u201d \u201cmusician,\u201d \u201cwriter,\u201d \u201castrologer,\u201d\u00a0\u201cNobel Prize Winning Physicist,\u201d and so on. They only pull out their anti-label rhetoric when they are cringing about the particular label a person has been given or has given to themselves. Now, when that label is a genuine pejorative someone else is using to restrict or hurt\u00a0a person, it\u2019s great to fight labels. Many people reading this have fought hard to wipe out the R-word and I love you all for that! But when someone has embraced their label and is proud of it and feels that it conveys important information about their identity \u2014 like \u201cAutistic,\u201d for example \u2014 it is a painful squashing of their identity to refuse to accept their label. In some ways, it\u2019s even worse than person-first language. Person-first language says \u201cI want to separate you and your autism and put you first to remind people that you are a human being because autism is such a terrible thing that they might forget you are human if I don\u2019t linguistically separate it from you.\u201d Anti-labeling says, \u201cI want to deny the existence of your autism altogether. It is inherently dehumanizing so I want to use language to pretend it out of existence entirely.\u201d If someone is being bullied with labels, it is great to step in and stop it. But when someone trusts you enough to share a core piece of their identity with you, it is a slap in the face to tell them that labels are for soup cans, not people. When you say something like that, you are trying to keep the soup and throw the can in the trash. I am Autistic and if you try to throw that in the trash with the soup cans, you are throwing me in the trash and it hurts. Enjoy my soup (I think it\u2019s tomato-basil soup. I hope you like it.) and learn to accept my label without cringing because I love my label. Autistic is who and what I am. Yes, it is a heuristic \u2014 I am so much more than that word. But if you reject that word, you are rejecting me.

You are wrong; your children are listening. Your children know what the world thinks about autism. Your children understand. They hear. They see. You may think that\u2019s not true because they don\u2019t look at the source of the voice. You may think that\u2019s not true because their bodies don\u2019t take the positions that you associate with reading. You might think they don\u2019t know. They do. Your children are listening. What are they hearing? What are they hearing from you? It is hard to be Autistic in this world. It is so hard that I step into it for a while, then pull back again like someone who\u2019s made the mistake of leaning against a hot wood stove. When I am in the Autistic community, I hear things every day \u2013 beatings, killings, torture, death. It\u2019s too much to take. So I pull away but autism is everywhere now. Autism awareness \u2014 usually completely divorced from autism acceptance \u2014 means that there is no place for me to go where I am not followed by the words. I cover my ears, I hide in my home, I shrink my social contact smaller and smaller and smaller until it is a needle-sharp single point and still the words follow me in. I hear how pitiful I am. I hear how frightening I am. I hear that I will pick up a gun and kill everyone. I hear that I am incapable of doing anything\u00a0productive. I hear that I am a burden to the taxpayers.\u00a0I hear that warehousing people like me in our own separate community, away from the rest of the world, would be a kindness to us. I pick up the latest medical journal to read about my health struggles\u00a0and learn that I cost society $1.4 million.(1) I turn on the news and hear someone talking about my lack of empathy and how dangerous it makes me. So I change the channel and I hear about autism on a comedy, a drama, a\u00a0commercial \u2014 I hear myself portrayed as a joke or a sadness or a tragedy or someone pitiable. \u00a0All over the internet, people are talking about the great tragedy, the epidemic, the tsunami. People with few other opinions about science discuss my allegedly poisoned brain with confidence, debating whether I was damaged by the air pollution, the GMOs, vaccines, lack of vitamin D, my father\u2019s advanced age. People speak reverently about a future time when people like me are never born any more. The whole world is talking about people like me. I hear it all the time. I hear it even\u00a0when I try really hard to get away from it. And your children are listening to it, too. When the world talks about us like this, how do we find the path to feel good about who we are? How do we find the motivation to keep working to try to find our way in a world that so clearly doesn\u2019t want us here? How do we learn to fit in with people who make it clear every day that they think we are broken, wrong, undesirable? How do we keep from feeling hated, pitied, feared, despised, and like we should never have been born in the first place? How do we keep from adopting those feelings about ourselves and turning the hatred inward? Your children are listening. The world tells them every day that they are unworthy. What do you tell them? Do you love that poem about accidentally traveling to Holland? Maybe you even printed it out and taped it to your refrigerator to remind you every day that Holland has tulips and windmills and isn\u2019t so bad after all? Go read that poem again and step out of your struggle to be okay with Holland when you wanted to go to Italy. Step out of it and think about being Holland. Read it as if you are Holland and weren\u2019t wanted and are mourned and are second-best and put-up-with. Read it and then pull it off your refrigerator and put it in the trash. Your child read that poem. They never said a word to you about it, but they read it and thought about it and they knew it was about them. They knew that they are Holland and you wanted Italy. Your children are listening. Stop thinking about how hard all of this is for you and think about how hard it is for your children. You have the difficult struggle of raising a disabled child. Your child has the life-long struggle of feeling like they never should have been born. You may think that parenting an Autistic\u00a0child is about learning to work with meltdowns, fighting for IEP accommodations, figuring out which interventions are the best, going in front of a judge to keep your\u00a0young adult child legally a\u00a0minor so that you can continue to protect and nurture them, funding a long-term plan to care for your child after you are gone. All these things are important, yes. Very important. Many of you have children who will need\u00a0life-long assistance and it is up to you to make sure that is put in place in ways that ensure the best possible quality of life for your child. You are filled with love and fear. Your\u00a0obstacles are huge. The challenges are hard. But when you\u00a0put your head down to push forward in that struggle, don\u2019t let the never-ending fight\u00a0block your view of one excruciatingly\u00a0important thing: your children are listening. They know. The emotional legacy you leave your children is every bit as important as leaving them well taken care of. Your child needs\u00a0you to help build their spirit. Your child needs you to teach them how to live\u00a0happy and\u00a0with a strong sense of self in a world that wishes they weren\u2019t here.\u00a0Whether you like it or not, your child is listening. Whether you believe it or not, your child is listening. If you don\u2019t do something active \u2014 every single day \u2014 to make sure your child knows they are good and right and\u00a0fully human and deserve to be here, your child will only hear the sorrow and fear and pity. Your child will only hear that they are not wanted on this\u00a0Earth. Your child will only hear\u00a0what a burden they are. A burden, a disease, poisoned, broken, dangerous, expensive \u2026 less than worthless. Less than useless. An active plague upon others, a tsunami, an epidemic.

Last night, I watched a 40 minute documentary about Autistic adult, Laura Nagle. I highly recommend this documentary to all of you: Vectors of Autism: A Documentary About Laura Nagle Laura is 57 years old and quick to call herself a \u201closer\u201d \u2014 but with a wry smile on her face. It is clear when she says that, that she sees that self-label as complex. In society\u2019s eyes, she both is and is not a loser. She lives in poverty, but she has the respect and admiration of townspeople who recognize her abilities and have invited her to help design buildings and other structures in town. In Laura\u2019s eyes, the label seems even more complex. Watching the documentary, I sensed that Laura knows she is not a loser, yet struggles at times with negative feelings about the things she has\u00a0a harder time with. For example, like many of us, she struggles with basic housekeeping. But she said that the only thing worse than living in a \u201cpig sty\u201d is to have a pig sty in your mind when you punish yourself by feeling bad about what you can\u2019t do. \u00a0 Laura is brilliant. She is a whiz with math, architecture, engines, airplanes. She is funny and clever. I got the feeling that she is a very loved member of her community.

{"date": "2014/04/25", "body": "(Thank you so much,  Ariane Zurcher , for bringing this graphic to everyone\u2019s attention.) Dear Brookdale Healthcare / Dreamtree School for Children with Autism: I am writing to you because some troubling and problematic information on your website was called to my attention today. On your page, located at: http://www.brookdalecare.co.uk/what-is-autism  \n/ \n https://www.facebook.com/thedreamtreeschool/photos/a.746685522010866.1073741843.281260781886678/785176704828414/?type=1&stream_ref=10 \n You have a graphic describing the autistic triad of impairments and additional difficulties. While much of the wording in the graphic is problematic, I would like to focus on one line in particular because it is potentially deadly. The graphic says: \u201cappears to enjoy being held/restrained, or cannot bear to be touched.\u201d I believe this piece of misinformation originated with the fact that many Autistic people enjoy deep pressure such as can be obtained from full-body hugs, weighted blankets, or the therapeutic squeezing device created by Dr. Temple Grandin. Many Autistic people find that deep body pressure stimulates our nervous systems in a way that leads to a pervasive sense of calm and well-being. In fact, it is not unusual for an Autistic individual to simultaneously be very averse to being touched and very responsive to certain types of deep pressure. But I said the graphic was not merely incorrect but potentially deadly and I would like to explain why I made such a seemingly incendiary statement. Many people who work with Autistic children will look at a graphic like this, see the wording \u201cappears to enjoy being held/restrained\u201d and interpret that to mean that it is appropriate to use tie-down restraints on Autistic people or tackle and hold them down physically. Restraints have killed Autistic people in the past. Thousands of Autistics have been injured and dozens have died from being held down or tied down. Please watch this six-and-a-half minute long film clip from ABC News, discussing the dangers of restraints, including a brief interview with Sheila Foster, a mother whose son was killed by being restrained. http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/death-school-parents-protest-dangerous-discipline-autistic-disabled/story?id=17702216 Even otherwise healthy people can suffocate and die just from being held down, due to a phenomenon known as \u201cpostural asphyxiation.\u201d It is negligent and irresponsible to promote a graphic that advises that Autistic people seem to enjoy being restrained. Please remove that graphic from your site and please educate your organization and those you advise as to the dangers of restraints and the importance of seeking other methods of dealing with unwanted behaviors that do not cause the unnecessary suffering and potential lethal risks of restraints. Thank you, \nSparrow Rose Jones \nDoctoral candidate and Autistic adult to contact Brookdale:  http://www.brookdalecare.co.uk/contact-us \nto contact The Dream Tree School:  http://www.thedreamtreeschool.co.za/contact.html Edited to add: Brookdale school replied almost immediately: Dear Sparrow Rose Jones Thank you very much for your e-mail detailing your concerns and fears around the wording on the Additional Difficulties section on the Triad of Impairments diagram on our website. You are completely correct, no one \u201cenjoys restraint\u201d and should be viewed as the very last option, only to be used by trained professionals to prevent an individual from hurting themselves. Indeed any form of restraint shows a failure in preventing the initial confusion / fear (or whatever the motivating point may be) from escalating to the point of crisis someone would need to get to, to require the last resort of restraint. All Brookdale care staff are recruited having identified a core ethos of person focused care within them, we then train them to have a real understanding of what it is to live ASC (some of this training is delivered by those living with Autism) and in Securicare, none pain holds and breakaway techniques. I appreciate the wording on this standard Triad diagram could be clearer. The sentence \u201cAppears to enjoy being held/ restrained,\u201d is trying to explain in lay terms, those living with ASC who are hyposensitive, who on occasions feel benefit in it items such as a weighted blanket. I am sorry if this web page gave you concerns. When training to explain \u201cAutism\u201d in broad terms it can fail to describe accurately the real people we both support. As you are very aware, if you have met one person living with ASC, you have met one person, as we are all individuals with strengths, weaknesses, fears and hope, if with live with the added pressure of ASC or not. Thank you again for taking the time to write to us. Kind regards, Robert Myers My response to Robert Myers: Dear Robert Myers, It is good that we agree on the undesirability of restraint as a first-line practice. It is also good that we agree that the wording on the graphic is unclear. I appreciate that you are sorry if the page gave me concern, but I am unclear as to your choice of action from this point forward. It is clear to me that the graphic, as is, does not belong on the web site of an institution that care about Autistic people and strives to treat them in the most compassionate and professional manner possible. You appear to be aware that restraint can kill, thus your reassurances about the high quality of the training of your staff. If every effort is made to avoid ending up in a situation where restraint is required, then it is obvious that you share my belief that there is a world of difference between \u201cweighted blankets\u201d and \u201crestraint.\u201d Why then do I not see any assurance in your letter that the graphic will be removed from your web site or revised? The graphic is concerning and, as it is currently written, it is deeply offensive. It needs to be removed or changed so that people are not led to believe that it is acceptable to restrain members of a vulnerable population against their will because of a mistaken belief that it will be enjoyable to Autistic individuals. Are you able to offer me your reassurance that something will be done about this troubling and dangerous graphic? Thank you, Sparrow Rose Jones Dear Sparrow Rose Jones In response to your original e-mail, I have attached above an amended diagram, removing all reference to restraint. This will go \u201clive\u201d on our website in the next 4 hours. Thank you again for your feedback and I hope our swift response to your request can help to quell any concerns it may have created. Kind regards, R Dear Robert Myers, Thank you so much! I am very pleased by your response and will be sure to tell all my friends and colleagues about the positive change. It is obvious that you care deeply about Autistic people and I wish you all the best in your work to help, mentor, and educate Autistic people and our families.

{"date": "2014/08/13", "body": "I wasn\u2019t going to write about Robin Williams. My mind dances away when I even think about him too much right now. I open my Facebook feed, see post after  post about Robin Williams, and close Facebook again. It\u2019s too much to think about. You see, not so long ago, a dear friend of mine hanged himself. I had known Tom for decades. He saved my life once. Well, more than once in many different ways, but one time specifically and obviously. He saw me through so many hard times and so much homelessness. He was hysterically funny, when he wasn\u2019t deeply depressed. He was kind and generous and always ready to make me laugh when I was down. He was a solid constant in my life . . . until he wasn\u2019t. And he was bipolar. So when another funny, brilliant, generous-hearted, larger-than-life bipolar man hanged himself so soon after, when I still haven\u2019t recovered from losing Tom. Well, my mind dances away when I think about it too much. But this morning, my friend posted, \u201cIf anyone blogs about Robin Williams and the posthumous erasure of his Bipolar dx something he openly shared, and the harm done in having the wrong conversation by doing so, please tag me so I can post and signal boost.\u201d And I realized I have to write about Robin Williams. Because my friend is right \u2014 Robin Williams had bipolar and had been honest about it for years and I have not seen a single blog post or\u00a0Facebook status,\u00a0and  only very few\u00a0news reports  that  mention that fact . It has been effectively\u00a0erased. And so, as the world mourns the loss of one of the most loved celebrities, dazed that someone who made others so happy could be so depressed, everyone is talking about depression, the devastation it brings, the statistics (1 in 5 people will experience severe depression at some point in their life), and what to do to help a depressed or suicidal friend. This talk is important and these things are true. But as my friend put it, it is the wrong conversation. And it is time for people to step forward and start having the right conversation. Robin Williams  spoke openly about his depression and suicidal thoughts as far back as 2010 , but now so many people are saying they didn\u2019t even realize he was depressed. The media is teaching us about depression but almost\u00a0no one has been speaking of his actual diagnosis of bipolar. I said something about\u00a0bipolar less than an hour after the first announcement of his death and got bitched at for saying it. Why is it so wrong to talk about Robin Williams and bipolar? Why is his bipolar being called depression by almost everyone? It is due to levels of stigma. It is similar to something we have seen in the autistic community. I\u2019ve been told (by well-meaning people) that I shouldn\u2019t call myself Autistic; I should call myself Asperger\u2019s (even though I\u2019m not)\u00a0because there\u2019s less stigma attached to it (although since Adam Lanza, that\u2019s not so true anymore.) I think that\u2019s like what\u2019s happening here, with Robin Williams. Depression is hard for people to understand. The suicide of a man who made the world laugh is even harder \u2014 because we still live in a world where people mistakenly believe a depressed person could just pull himself up by his own bootstraps. And who had longer, stouter bootstraps than Robin Williams? But bipolar is still subject to so much stigma that people can\u2019t bear to associate it with Robin Williams. Depression is slowly coming to be understood, gradually becoming more accepted, bit by bit getting to be something that people feel safe talking about openly. But bipolar is still mysterious, frightening, mythologized. If you don\u2019t believe me, just watch a few episodes of the ABC series  Black Box . It is not my place to speak about the lived experience of bipolar. But I lived with and loved Tom and his roommate, Carl, both bipolar, and I learned that with the pain come incredible gifts \u2014 brilliance, passion, fire, creativity. All things Robin Williams had in abundance. I am not able to write the last word about bipolar, but I felt compelled to write these first words, in the\u00a0hope that I encourage others to talk about the brilliance and beauty of bipolar and the fire that burns so brightly it can singe or kill. It is so important that so many people are talking about suicide and depression right now, in the wake of Robin Williams\u2019 suicide. But now it\u2019s time to slice through the layers of stigma and talk about bipolar, too. \u00a0 http://angeliceve.blogspot.com/2014/08/robin-williams-was-my-bipolar-comrade.html http://nicocoer.tumblr.com/post/94491921228/robin-williams-had-been-out-about-having-bipolar ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/robinwilliamsmagnum.jpg", "http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/five-celebrities-besides-robin-williams-with-bipolar-disorder-23601/", "http://www.ketknbc.com/news/robin-williams-suffered-from-bipolar-disorder-and", "http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/remembering_robin_williams", "http://angeliceve.blogspot.com/2014/08/robin-williams-was-my-bipolar-comrade.html", "http://nicocoer.tumblr.com/post/94491921228/robin-williams-had-been-out-about-having-bipolar"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2014/08/13/levels-of-stigma/", "title": "Levels of Stigma"},

In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, disabled children and adults are being abused and killed. A month doesn\u2019t go by without a major news story about an Autistic person being killed \u2014 sometimes by police who weren\u2019t trained in how to interact safely with Autistic people in law enforcement situations but more often by the person\u2019s own parents or caregivers. It is tragic, depressing, frightening, angering. And it is part of a disturbing trend in which people see Autistic people and other disabled people as somehow less than human. This is the most troubling of all \u2014 those dramatic stories of abuse and murder are the bloody tip of a massive iceberg and there are days when I feel crushed beneath all that ice of hatred and dehumanization. But what I really want to talk about today is what happened to my friend, Lei Wiley-Mydske. Lei is a beautiful Autistic woman, mother of an equally beautiful Autistic child and the founder of the  Ed Wiley Autism Acceptance Lending Library  in Washington state (I plan to tell you more about this outstanding library project in a future post, so stay tuned!) To explain how it is that many people decided that language matters more than people \u2014 at least so long as those people are Autistic people \u2014 I have to backtrack a little bit. All of this started with one of those major news stories of abuse.  On July 21st, the Washington Post reported that a couple in Rockville Maryland had been charged with abusing their 22-year-old twin sons.  The young men are Autistic and the couple chose to keep them\u00a0locked in a smelly, soiled, bare tile basement. The men were removed from their parents\u2019 custody and the couple were charged with abuse and false imprisonment of vulnerable adults. Five days later, the Washington Post ran another article. The\u00a0lead paragraph reads, \u201cAdult twins with autism locked in a barren basement room every night. No lights. No bed. Their parents charged with abuse.\u201d Yet the newspaper\u00a0had the gall\u00a0to run this article with the headline:  Coping with adult children\u2019s autism, parents may face \u2018least bad\u2019 decisions , implying that it was a \u201cleast bad\u201d decision to keep human beings locked up in conditions so awful that if the twins had been dogs instead of Autistic humans there would have been an outcry and no one would have dared to support the couple\u2019s choice. The article does quote\u00a0the father\u00a0of an Autistic adult saying that we can\u2019t condone their choice, but that statement is lost in a sea of hand-wringing\u00a0and justifications. This is where my brave and beautiful friend Lei enters the story.  She wrote this wonderful letter to the editor that was published\u00a0on August 1st in the\u00a0Washington Post : Where\u2019s the Empathy for Autistic Children? \n Regarding the July 27 Metro article \u201cAutism in adults is a challenge for parents\u201d: \n As both a parent to an autistic child and an autistic adult, I am horrified by The Post\u2019s inability to even entertain the humanity of autistic people. Locking up children in their homes is abuse. It is not a \u201cleast bad\u201d decision. If those children were typically developing, would we even be defending the parents? \n Autistic people have the same rights as anyone else. The fact that I needed to type that sentence in 2014 is incredibly disturbing to me. \n When your reaction to this type of abuse is to defend abusers and not victims, something is wrong with you. When we defend abusers of disabled people, we make it easier for such abuse to happen again. I don\u2019t care how difficult it is to put up with me, I do not deserve to be locked in a basement without any of my basic needs being met. That is torture, not a \u201cleast bad\u201d decision. \n I can\u2019t think of one situation where abusive treatment would be justified. \n Where is the empathy for us? The Post seems to be missing that a lot of the time. \n Lei Wiley-Mydske, \nStanwood, Wash. This is a beautiful and heart-felt letter.\u00a0Almost all\u00a0of the responses to it on the Washington Post site\u00a0were deeply supportive. But Lei is also on facebook and \u201cfindable\u201d because of her work with the Lending Library and many of the direct responses she got were equally deeply disturbing. On the surface, perhaps, the responses seem polite and innocent. All of us who choose to identify as \u201cAutistic\u201d rather than \u201cpeople with autism\u201d get these comments at some point.\u00a0What I\u2019m referring to is the insistence that we are wrong if we do not use Person-First Language. I\u2019ve written about Person-First Language before. If I could only send you to one link to help you understand why so many of us choose to use the label Autistic instead of Person with autism, I would send you to Lydia\u2019s wonderful essay and collection of links:  The Significance of Semantics: Person-First Language: Why It Matters . It\u2019s long, though, so I\u2019ll just boil it down to this:\u00a0autism is not\u00a0some extra thing we carry around outside of our true selves. Autism is pervasive and there is no part of me that is not Autistic. I don\u2019t have a core of non-Autistic me that is surrounded by a shell of autism. As the saying goes, it\u2019s turtles all the\u00a0way down. To say that people must call me a \u201cperson with autism\u201d in order to remember that I am actually a genuine, real, human, PERSON despite also being\u00a0autistic is to say that YOU do not see me as a person and YOU do not believe that others will remember that I am a person unless you are using language to constantly remind everyone of that\u00a0fact. I find that deeply offensive. I am obviously a\u00a0person and anyone who insists that I must refer to myself with person-first language is only telling me that THEY do not see me as a person and want me to remind them of it over and\u00a0over. And this is exactly what the people did who approached my\u00a0dear friend, Lei, and told her that it was great that she was published in the newspaper but she should have used person-first language when she talked about herself and other Autistic people. Those people were effectively patting her on the head in a patronizing manner and saying, \u201cgood job person with autism, but you used the wrong words, honey.\u201d That is infuriating!! An Autistic woman bravely stood out from the crowd to say that abuse is abuse and it is never\u00a0a \u201cleast bad\u201d decision to abuse human beings and she was told that her message didn\u2019t matter because she said it wrong. Do we really have to walk around saying \u201cperson, person, person. I am a person. I am a human being. Oh, and by the way, other\u00a0people are also people and would you please remember that we are human and not abuse and kill us? person, person, person.\u201d?\u00a0 Humans\u00a0who are not disabled are not expected to go around reminding everyone that they are people. Why must we? What the hell is wrong with the world? You people who refuse to acknowledge our personhood unless we talk about it the way you think we should: what the hell is wrong with you? Next time someone tells you that they are hurt and angry about the way the world talks about them and people like them, if you feel tempted to tell them that they told you with the wrong words . . . just shut up and listen. Because if you tell someone that they\u00a0are only allowed to complain about how they are being spoken of if they complain in the words that\u00a0you think\u00a0they should use, guess what? You are exactly the problem. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/silencing-languages.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/EdWileyAutismAcceptance", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/rockville-md-couple-charged-with-abusing-twin-22-year-old-autistic-sons/2014/07/21/2f23b6c8-113c-11e4-9285-4243a40ddc97_story.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/2014/07/26/73e3cb4c-1414-11e4-9285-4243a40ddc97_story.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/wheres-the-empathy-for-autistic-children/2014/08/01/882ec816-171d-11e4-88f7-96ed767bb747_story.html", "http://www.autistichoya.com/2011/08/significance-of-semantics-person-first.html"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2014/08/06/when-language-matters-more-than-people/", "title": "When Language Matters More Than\u00a0People"},

{"date": "2014/09/04", "body": "The title of this post is a famous saying, many of you will already be familiar with. The saying comes from an Australian educator, Rosemary Crossley, the developer of Facilitated Communication Training, or FC for short.\u00a0 FC is a method of helping people with difficulty in planning movements, such as those with autism or cerebral palsy, to gain sufficient control of their bodies to be able to point out letters and spell words. FC is controversial, but I really wish it weren\u2019t. There are some small studies that claim to find that Autistics using FC are not really communicating but being used, like a puppet, by the facilitator. I have several friends who use FC to communicate and I have zero doubt that I am really communicating with my friend. I do not believe that a facilitator can manipulate anyone that skillfully using the methods of FC. I was pleased to see  a much larger study showing that FC is valid communication on the part of the person rather than their facilitator\u00a0 because that is something I already knew, without needing a study, but it\u2019s reassuring when science can back up our observations. FC can be difficult to test because there are aspects of the Autistic neurology that can make some of us not perform well on standard tests, but many of the participants in the study linked above were\u00a0shown\u00a0a word while their facilitator was out of the room and then were able to type that word when the facilitator returned with no knowledge of what word was going to be typed. FC came to America and has helped many Autistics be able to communicate with others in a way that everyone could understand. This is a great gift and should be supported! I sometimes feel that therapists place too much emphasis on acquiring speech and almost no emphasis on acquiring means of communication. To my mind, the most crucial first thing to do when trying to help an Autistic person is to open up lines of communication. Some of us speak late and some never speak or never acquire speech that is good for communication purposes. Don\u2019t waste one minute! Open up communication first! It can be sign language, independent typing, pointing to letters on a card or board, facilitated communication, graphic systems like PECS or Bliss, the Rapid Prompting Method (RPM), or whatever works. That\u2019s the important thing \u2014 use what works! Communication is more important than speech. The connection of communication is worth using any method that works. In the case of autism, we have a developmental delay that causes us to hit milestones later than our age peers. Speaking may come later (or not at all) but the need for communication begins at birth. Not being able to speak is not the same as not having anything to say! A friend came to me yesterday and said that she had a t-shirt with that quote on it and needed to get a replacement because it was starting to develop holes and show other signs of wear and age. I Googled and found another t-shirt but she didn\u2019t want to buy from the seller for ethical reasons (which I support) so I made some designs for her. I made five designs that can be put on adult or children\u2019s t-shirts. A couple of them are also available as stickers or greeting cards. I am sharing them here, in case someone else wants a t-shirt with this quote as well. I love this quote because it challenges assumptions and it reminds us all that ideas and communication are the important part. Using speech to accomplish these goals is great if it\u2019s attainable. But if a person is not able to speak, we can\u2019t just dismiss them as not having anything worth communicating! \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22facilitated+communication%22+and+cardinal", "http://www.redbubble.com/people/sparrowrose/works/12585151-not-being-able-to-speak-light-on-dark", "http://www.redbubble.com/people/sparrowrose/works/12585066-not-being-able-to-speak-dark-on-light", "http://www.redbubble.com/people/sparrowrose/works/12585356-not-being-able-to-speak-sunflower", "http://www.redbubble.com/people/sparrowrose/works/12585631-not-being-able-to-speak-rainbow-tie-dye", "http://www.redbubble.com/people/sparrowrose/works/12586041-not-being-able-to-speak-neon-rainbow"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2014/09/04/not-being-able-to-speak-is-not-the-same-as-not-having-anything-to-say/", "title": "Not being able to speak is not the same as not having anything to\u00a0say"},
{"date": "2013/07/07", "body": "I am taking some of the free classes offered by  Coursera . I am currently taking a social work class on the Social Context of Mental Health and Illness, which is fascinating. I\u2019m taking an Introduction to Epigenetics class that is challenging but I scored 100% on my first exam. I recently finished auditing a class on Medical Neuroscience and I\u2019m currently auditing a class on Audio Engineering for which I will be building a ten-watt practice amplifier to study electronics and sound waves. I\u2019m starting a series of courses from Berklee School of Music on composition and recording later this month. I am taking these classes because I am fascinated by the subject matters and because the things I learn will help me to understand my life better (especially classes in neuroscience, health, genetics, etc. since I am Autistic and these are useful things to understand if I want to understand the physical reality of my neurotype.) The music classes will help me to become a better musician and sound engineer. I think Coursera is a great resource for people who love to learn and want to broaden their horizons but do not do so well in traditional classrooms for whatever reasons. Taking Coursera classes is transforming my life and here is a\u00a0Coursera blog\u00a0article about another Autistic person\u00a0who is blossoming through taking Coursera classes as well:  Not Impossible: The Story of Daniel, a 17 Year Old with Severe Autism & His 6 Completed Coursera Courses -=- I am also currently\u00a0taking a literature class, taught by\u00a0Professor Weinstein\u00a0from Brown University, that attracted me with the title \u201cThe Fiction of Relationship.\u201d I think it is pretty obvious why an Autistic would find that title appealing. I am nearly half-way through that class and I wanted to share my most recent assignment here because I found myself writing about autism and I thought others might like to read what I wrote. The assignment was to make a short piece of creative writing (short story, poem) based on Kafka\u2019s stories with a 150-200 word rationale for how it relates to the fiction of relationship in the story and in real life. -=- Autism As Metamorphosis: A Poem \u201cWhen you stop speaking, you\u2019re one step away from no longer being a human.\u201d \n\u2013 Professor Weinstein, Kafka Group Discussion, 20 minutes. Gregor Samsa awoke as an insect. He was thrown out with the garbage, barely noticed by his family. Maxwell Eyer was born autistic. His father ignored the little broken body after he beat his son to death. Who stole the child, can you tell me? Did vaccines build this shell, this hardened carapace? Or was it faeries who crept away in the night, leaving the changeling in his place? Gregor Samsa never asked why as his father shattered his delicate exoskeleton. Jori Lirette did not ask why as his father removed his estranged head from his foreign body. The insect cannot speak. Inside, Gregor loved, Gregor mourned, Gregor starved, Gregor dreamed. The autistic flaps his hands, he spins in circles. If he cannot say, \u201cI hurt,\u201d if he cannot say, \u201cDaddy, I love you,\u201d is he human? Inside he loves, he mourns, he starves, he dreams. Gabriel Britt\u2019s father saw little more than the insect as he suffocated his six-year-old son to death. James Joseph Cummings Jr, William Lash III, Marcus Fiesel, Ulysses Stable, Christian Clay Jenkins, Jeremy Bostick, Rohit Singh \u2013 these are Other. These are Gregor Samsa. These are autistic children destroyed by their fathers, destroyed so the family could walk again in the sunlight, unencumbered by the secret shame that once held them prisoner. What cannot be comprehended is destined for destruction. If we cannot find our own point of transformation, we risk throwing apples at our children, having mistaken them for insects. -=- Analysis: This poem examines the very real tragedy of fathers who murder their autistic children, juxtaposed against the \u201canti-Oedipal\u201d (Weinstein, lecture 5.4) story of Kafka\u2019s  Metamorphosis  in which Gregor Samsa\u2019s father kills him because he is no longer able to see Gregor\u2019s humanity inside the insect to which Gregor had transformed overnight. Just as the reader can understand that Gregor is still \u201cin there\u201d and witnesses the great tragedy of his death at the hands of an unforgiving father, those who care about the fate of autistics understand that there is a human child \u201cin there\u201d and mourn the tragedy when that child\u2019s parent is unable to see past the illusions of non-speaking autism and resorts to killing their child who has come to represent little more than a drain of personal and financial resources with no more value than an insect. The fiction of relationship in a case like Gregor\u2019s, where he becomes an insect, or in the real world cases of murdered autistic children is the illusion that Gregor (or Maxwell, Jori, Gabriel, et al.) has become \u201cOther\u201d in any sense different from the foundational human condition in which everyone is \u201cOther.\u201d Because someone does not \u201clook human\u201d, because they cannot speak, because they move differently \u2013 this does not make them Other in any way more real than the way that all humans, by virtue of living inside a different skin with a different brain and thoughts impenetrable to us, are inherently Other. Relationship is a happy illusion. Other is an unfortunate illusion. But the truth of human lives, mingling together, is a complex mid-point between connection and Other. So long as disabled children can be othered as easily as an insect, art does not have a privileged role in illuminating the illusion of metamorphosis. So long as parents can kill their own children for the burden of their disability, life illuminates the metamorphosis viscerally, undeniably, tragically. Brown, Lydia. \u201cHonoring the Dead\u201d.

{"date": "2014/10/29", "body": "I have always had volatile emotions. One popular (though deeply unkind) description of Autistic people is as \u201cemotionless robots\u201d \u2014 a description that doesn\u2019t even start to approach the emotional mess of me. If I hadn\u2019t met so many other Autistics with intense, messy emotions, lots of grief and rage, difficulty suppressing emotional impulses, I might continue to question my diagnosis. But there are plenty of us out there with hair-trigger emotions. And so many Autistics are like me in that strong emotions, even our own strong emotions, are completely overwhelming to us. Emotions are like being drowned at the beach and before I can get up from being knocked down by a giant wave of emotion, I get knocked down by a wave of overwhelm from having too much emotion. It\u2019s easy to get stuck there, battered by waves coming from within. I once watched a short video in which an Autistic pre-teen talked about typical people having a bucket for emotions (and sensory inputs) while Autistics often only have a tiny teacup (or in the case of senses that need extra input, a swimming pool.) It\u2019s a great analogy. I have a swimming pool for proprioceptive input that\u2019s almost impossible to fill and I have a tiny little teacup for emotions and too often I\u2019m trying to catch ocean waves in it. Recently, I found myself caught on the beach again. Events stirred strong emotions and follow-up events kept making things worse, not better, and I found myself in a downward spiral of too much emotion and too much overwhelm from too much emotion\u00a0causing even more emotion. It drove away the partner I\u2019d had for nearly two and a half years and I found myself alone, overwhelmed, devastated, and sinking under the waves even faster. I began to battle against self-talk, mainly centered around wishing I weren\u2019t Autistic, believing that a neurology that didn\u2019t come with such volatile emotions and such vulnerability to overwhelm would give me the perfect life that everyone \u2014 of any neurology \u2014 can, at times, yearn for in vain (for none of us get to have perfect lives. The secret is to make the best life we are able to and learn to love whatever\u00a0life we do end up with. There\u2019s no road map and only a portion of anything is ever really in our control.) I have pulled out of the nosedive by returning to an old friend, meditation. I used to meditate decades ago \u2014 so long ago that I can no longer remember if it did me any good. On the one hand, it seems it did, because I kept doing it for a long time. On the other hand, it seems it didn\u2019t, because I stopped doing it at some point. Although that could have just been life interfering with self-discipline. Or maybe\u00a0meditation made me feel so good that I forgot it was making me feel good and started thinking it must be a waste of time. I have no idea why I stopped, but I recently\u00a0found myself stumbling across articles about meditation in a synchronicity that was hard to ignore. The first thing that really caught my eye was an article about meditation and its effects on the amygdala. I had already been thinking about the amygdala a lot because it was pretty apparent that mine was over-active and over-stimulated. I had seen brain studies that indicated that many Autistics have very active amygdalas and even studies that suggested that we have more neural connections to our amygdala than non-autistic brains have. The amygdala is a pair of neural regions deep inside the brain, in the temporal region (the sides of the brain, more or less beneath your temples.) They are complex and, like much of the brain, only partially understood. They appear to have a strong role in emotions and decision-making, among other things. While pleasant emotions do\u00a0appear to correlate with amygdala activity, most studies focus on its role in stress emotions, anger, fear, anxiety, etc. If you do much reading about the brain and autism studies, you\u2019re quite familiar with the amygdala already as it\u2019s one of the favorite brain locations for neurology-based autism studies. Fight-or-flight anxiety and panic are so familiar to me that I had come to believe anxiety was my normal state\u00a0of being.\u00a0I became unable to \u201csee\u201d the anxiety except during rare times when it lifted and I could see, by contrast, that I had been extremely tense. Venturing out among people was often too much to bear, generating feelings of being trapped or of venturing behind enemy lines. So when I saw  a study that found indications of functional changes to the amygdala, apparently due to\u00a0mindfulness mediation , I was immediately curious and interested. I found studies that indicated that meditation can be effective in relieving  panic  and  depression , that\u00a0it can\u00a0enhance  cognitive abilities , and increase the density of grey matter in brain regions associated with  emotional regulation and perspective taking . I found a paper, published in 2012, about  using\u00a0meditation, specifically mantra meditation, as a therapy for Autistic children  age 3 to 14 years, that reported \u201crelief of symptoms\u201d that appear to be an effect of stress-reduction and increased emotional self-regulation. Having seen these studies (and many others, too numerous to list here) indicating potential benefits of meditation, my next step was to read  Meditation for Aspies: Everyday Techniques to Help People with Asperger Syndrome Take Control and Improve Their Lives , by Ulrike Domenika Bolls. Bolls\u2019 writing style (originally in German and translated into English by Rowan Sewell) is very clear and easy to understand, although at times repetitive. If I did not already have past experience with meditation, I think I might have felt confused by her book as it explains the benefits of meditation, the ways that people with autism are especially well-suited to become meditators, the physical (and some mental)\u00a0components of a wide variety of types of meditation, but never really gives a good sense of what meditation is, beyond \u201ca practice that can help you.\u201d In Bolls\u2019 defense, meditation is very difficult to explain. It is the sort of thing that is almost impossible to understand without actually doing it yourself. Bolls\u2019 book is a good resource for learning about meditation and its benefits, but it will not teach you how to meditate. The author tells her readers to go find a teacher for that. I found that a little frustrating but I did not regret buying and reading the book. It provides a good overview and is especially helpful for describing the wide range of meditation styles that are available. By the time I finished Bolls\u2019 book, I was pretty convinced that I needed to try meditation. I have often seen people refer to the Autistic brain/mind as being like a different operating system \u2014 there is nothing flawed or broken, but you can\u2019t expect to run iOS software on a Windows machine or vice-versa. Within this analogy, meditation is like a disc optimization routine that defrags the hard drive and makes everything run more efficiently. Meditation can optimize any hard drive because it is a self-applied process, so our computer (self) already applies it within whatever operating system (individual neurological configuration) the system (person) happens to be running. Since it had been so many years since I last meditated, I wanted more guidance than Bolls\u2019 book provides. And since I have a very low income and a fear of getting involved with a group or teacher that might end up being pushy or even cult-like (I have experienced this in the past and am very careful about what sort of quasi-religious or new-age people and groups I get involved with because of it) I was pleased to find two free sources of non-intrusive guidance in mindfulness meditation, which turned out to be the meditation type I found myself most drawn to. The meditation I did in the past was mantra meditation. I cannot explain why I felt the urge to do something different this time. I chose, instead, a form of meditation that focuses on the breath. Very simple, very quiet, very peaceful. It can be done while sitting or while slowly walking and I have found that mindfulness breath meditation while laying down helps me to go to sleep more quickly and peacefully as well. One source of guidance is a  set of free recordings you can download from UCLA\u2019s\u00a0 Mindful Awareness Research Center . These are good recordings and well-produced, but I do not like them so much because the voice is a higher-pitched female voice (and there are even some bells in the recordings) and my nervous system does not respond well to higher-pitched sounds. I find it difficult to relax to the female voice and there are even points in the recording where the pitch and attack (a musical word for the quality of the start of a sound) of her voice causes me to startle and tense up. They are good recordings, though, and if you don\u2019t have my sensory defensiveness against higher-pitched sounds, you may get great benefit from them. The other recordings are almost\u00a0perfect for me.  Sam Harris has recorded two guided meditations  and gives the files away for free on his website. (I feel I should give a warning about Sam Harris. He is more widely-known as an atheist\u00a0political commentator and he has some political views that I find deeply disturbing. He is\u00a0hawkish and has advocated torture and killing others for their beliefs. I avoid his political writing because I have gained so much benefit from his meditation teaching and I value him as a meditation resource. Too much exposure to his political views would make it impossible for me to use his voice as a meditation guide and I have so few resources at this point that I don\u2019t want to lose one of the most valuable ones I have.) I find\u00a0Harris\u2019 voice very soothing and relaxing and his guidance can bring me into a deeply meditative state very quickly. My goal is to continue using his guidance sometimes in my practice until I develop to a point where I am able to always meditate alone, without a sound track to help me. I already meditate much on my own, but still return to his recordings from time to time for assistance. In these early days, I appreciate the guidance as it helps keep me on track. If I had another recording that were equally effective for me, I would stop using Harris\u2019 recordings since his political views are so repugnant to me. Still, I am grateful for what he has done to make meditation more accessible to others. So . . . what has this experiment done for me so far? I am definitely calmer. Before I began meditating, I cried every day. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even know why I was crying. Now I cry infrequently and usually for obvious reasons, like a sad book or movie. Little things that used to bug me don\u2019t bother me any more. One example: I wear  Vibram Fivefinger shoes  (the \u201cbarefoot\u201d shoe with separate pockets for each toe) and they get a LOT of attention. I wear them for my health (in regular shoes, I develop fasciitis and tendonitis so painful I can\u2019t walk. In Vibrams, my feet stay pain-free) and not as a fashion statement or an attention-getter or conversation starter. It used to really bother me that I would carefully dress in beautiful clothes and all people wanted to talk about was my shoes. And the shoe conversation is always nearly word-for-word identical every time. It is so boring to leave the house and have the same conversation 10 times with strangers who only want to talk to me because my shoes are different. It started to really annoy me. I felt like I was being treated like a shoe advertisement, not a human being. I hated that everything I did to be beautiful\u00a0or get noticed would be ignored and my medical devices (because that\u2019s all my shoes are to me \u2014 a choice that keeps my feet healthy and pain-free) were center stage. And because people don\u2019t understand why I wear them, they\u00a0get intrusive in rude ways that they might hesitate to do if I had crutches or a wheelchair instead of \u201cinteresting\u201d shoes.\u00a0(Yes, I know that people get rude and intrusive about crutches, canes, and wheelchairs, but sensitive people usually understand not to do that yet don\u2019t really get it when it comes to my shoes.) And many of the routine comments people make are thoughtlessly rude even if\u00a0my shoes\u00a0were just a fashion statement. But here\u2019s the thing: for years I have felt irritated and put-upon\u00a0about people\u2019s reactions to my shoes. But after only a few days of daily meditation, I went out and got several comments about my shoes and it didn\u2019t bother me at all. I felt totally calm, not irritated. It\u2019s a small thing but it\u2019s also a really huge thing. I can tell that I\u2019m looking at life more objectively than I was before. The\u00a0sounds and smells and movements at the grocery store are still overwhelming to me, but I no longer feel so much like I am being personally attacked by them. Meditation is not some kind of \u201cautism miracle cure\u201d by any stretch of the imagination, but it is clearly helping me cope with strong emotions and handle stress better. I am feeling less depressed, less anxious, less frustrated . . . and the space those unwanted feelings\u00a0leave behind is giving me more capacity for clear thinking and compassion toward others. So I will continue with the practice, as it seems to be doing me much good. And I wanted to write about it, in case it could help others. Thank you for reading and may you have peace.

{"date": "2013/09/16", "body": "DSM 5? I\u2019m an open book about this book I opened. I went to the medical library near my house and scanned the autism pages from the DSM 5. Last night I typed them out (I scanned with an iPad Mini so they didn\u2019t look so great) and read it while I was typing. I was floored by a lot of what I saw. And by floored, I mean good floored! I had no idea some of that stuff was in there. We (the Autism/Autistic Communities) were so worried about people losing their diagnoses that there wasn\u2019t much talk about what else was in there. Well, This post is the beginning of a series of posts about what the DSM 5 actually says. I will quote excerpts from it (it\u2019s copyrighted so I can\u2019t just share my scans with you all, much as I\u2019d love to) and I will paraphrase other parts of it so that I don\u2019t exceed fair use laws in my country. But if you stick with me for this whole series, by the end, you\u2019ll pretty much know everything that\u2019s in there. Including the actual diagnostic criteria! Today I\u2019m going to address the big fear about losing your diagnosis. The great news is that if you had a diagnosis, you still do! The DSM 5 does not take away anyone\u2019s pre-existing diagnoses. So I\u2019m still Autistic. :-) Here\u2019s the actual text from the manual that addresses that issue (from page 51) and I\u2019ll see you again in my next DSM post! Note:  Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, \n Asperger\u2019s disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should \n be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked \n deficits in social communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for \n autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social (pragmatic) communication \n disorder.

{"date": "2013/09/18", "body": "Today I\u2019m looking at section B of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism. And I am awkwardly typing around a cat who decided this was the best time ever to conquer my lap. B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text): \n 1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g. simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases). \n 2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food every day). \n 3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests). \n 4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement). \n Specify current severity:  Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2). \u00a0 Again, some of the things I pointed out yesterday \u2013 the very helpful illustrative descriptions of types of behaviors and traits that fit into these categories, and a broad range of affectedness listed. Also the \u201ccurrently or by history\u201d phrase that is so helpful for someone who is having a hard time now and needs a diagnosis to help them but is not currently\u00a0manifesting all the symptoms required for diagnosis (but manifested sufficient for diagnosis in the past.) Section B is the only section in the diagnostic criteria that is not all-or-nothing. An individual only needs two of these traits for diagnosis. So instead of the thousands of different permutations Alyssa found in DSM-IV, there are only 6 permutations in the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 (4 items combine in 6 unique pairs: 1&2, 1&3, 1&4, 2&3, 2&4, 3&4.) The other big thing I want to note with this section before I go on with the rest of my day is number 4: \u201cHyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).\u201d I am so happy to see that in the official criteria! Everybody who knows an Autistic person and every person who is Autistic knows . . . KNOWS . . . that there is \u201cthis sensory stuff\u201d that goes along with autism. There has been a lot of debate and discussion over whether they are additional co-morbids or part of autism itself. And it\u2019s been confusing because our \u201csensory stuff\u201d is so different from person to person. I have hyperacusis \u2013 high pitched sounds make me dizzy, fall over, nauseated, etc. But I have no problem with *loud* sounds \u2014 in fact, I am a drummer. Other Autistics have a hard time with *any* loud sound. I know a married couple and she has hypersensitivity to sound and he has hyposensitivity to sound. So he has a deep need for sound stimulation and puts on loud music and she is assaulted by it because she needs lots of quiet. It\u2019s hard on them. But they\u2019re both\u00a0Autistic and know that about themselves so they work out ways to get both their needs met. I am so happy to see hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity listed\u00a0in the diagnostic criteria. The way\u00a0section B is worded,\u00a0the authors acknowledge that not *every* Autistic person deals with sensory issues. But it also accepts that it\u2019s a huge issue for a large number of us. Thank you, DSM-5 committee. It\u2019s about time! I don\u2019t have anything more to say today. I may combine C, D, and E in one post because they\u2019re so short. Then we\u2019ll move on to the severity table and the DSM-5 discussion of severity levels (which is SO\u00a0AWESOME! I am having a hard time waiting to get to that part!) and then move into some of the other things in the discussion section of the DSM-5 entry on autism. But now it\u2019s time for me to have some breakfast and run some errands so I will be back tomorrow with another DSM-5\u00a0post. Have a great day and be nice to your Autistic (especially if your Autistic is YOU!)

{"date": "2013/09/17", "body": "So, there are a lot of things I am almost bursting to talk about in the DSM-5, but I\u2019m going to set them aside for later posts because I\u2019m guessing that the number one thing people want to know is, \u201cwhat are the new diagnostic criteria?\u201d I gave a taste of that yesterday when I quoted the note that says that *EVERYONE* who has a DSM-IV diagnosis is grandfathered. You all get to keep your diagnoses. But what are they using for people being newly evaluated? If you are familiar with the DSM-IV criteria, you remember they have a sort of buffet going on: chose this many items from list A, this many items from list B, and so on. The new criteria have one \u201ctwo or more items from this list\u201d section, but most of it is absolute \u2014 you have it or you don\u2019t. So where the DSM-IV criteria allow for there to be 3129 different permutations of diagnostic traits that result in an autism spectrum diagnosis (thank you,  Alyssa , for doing that math!) The DSM-5 has significantly cut down on the \u201cwiggle room.\u201d Of course that has people worried! Because autism is a pretty broad spectrum and there are some very diverse ways of manifesting it. I look at my Autistic self and compare it to: my Autistic friends; famous Autistics like Temple Grandin, \u00a0Lianne Holliday-Wiley, Rudy Simone, Wendy Lawson, Jerry Newport, etc.; Autistic children of friends; etc. and I see a pretty wide range of difference. How can we all fit into one narrow set of criteria? Well, let\u2019s look at that. There are five main sections (A, B, C, D, and E) and I\u2019m going to spend today and the next four days looking at them, one at a time. So, let\u2019s see what section A (on page 50 of the DSM-5) says: A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text): \n 1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions. \n 2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication. \n 3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers. \n Specify current severity: \n Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2). (Don\u2019t worry: we\u2019ll get to severity level and Table 2 in a future post.) Okay, see what they did there? They didn\u2019t give the pick-and-choose options we\u2019ve grown used to seeing but they gave illustrative examples of the *range* of things that fit that criteria. That does two things: first, it helps people to get a better grasp of what they mean when they say, for example, \u201cdeficits in social-emotional reciprocity\u201d; and, second it shows that a person can be diagnosable whether they are completely sitting in the corner, staring at the wall, not responding when you call their name or whether they are approaching you and engaging with you but doing it by presenting sort of a \u201cwall of words\u201d where they are \u201cmonologuing\u201d about something really important to them but\u00a0forgetting to stop and let you share, too. That\u2019s huge, because the difference\u00a0between the two people I just described is pretty huge, but the difference is also not huge because both are Autistic.\u00a0The two hypothetical people I described are part of the same \u201ctribe\u201d of\u00a0people.\u00a0If you look at them, they will seem totally different . . . which is\u00a0good, because they are not the same person! But\u00a0the neurology that is underlying those two very different types of relating (or not relating, if you wish) to others is of the same stuff. Also, did you notice that it says, \u201ccurrently or by history\u201d? Does the person being considered for diagnosis\u00a0have these traits now or did\u00a0they use to have them when\u00a0they were younger but have developed and grown away from some of them? That\u2019s a big deal, too. As you will see, there are other considerations for an autism spectrum diagnosis, but the person who\u00a0has become \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d (whatever that means. It is a problematic phrase as Alyssa and Kassiane are currently\u00a0exploring in their blogs) might still be diagnosably\u00a0Autistic. That\u2019s something to consider before telling someone something like,\u00a0\u201cyou don\u2019t look\u00a0Autistic.\u201d There are many aspects of autism that are not immediately visible to the eye. And there is something I like to say, especially when people wonder why I don\u2019t resemble their six-year-old\u00a0Autistic child: \u201cdevelopmental delay does not mean developmental halt.\u201d We Autistics continue to develop and grow throughout the course of our lives. At age 46, I am still growing and developing in very dramatic and noticeable ways while non-autistic people do tend to get pretty solid by their twenties and don\u2019t really change a lot afterwards.\u00a0I\u2019m not making a value judgment! Both ways of developing are valid. I\u2019m just pointing out a huge difference and I am very glad to see that the authorial committee of the DSM-5 appears to have \u00a0noticed that, too, because you will see many different places in the text where they indicate a deep understanding of the ways that Autistic people change over time. So that\u2019s today\u2019s take-away:\u00a0 We no longer are choosing two or three things off a longer list. We have a fixed list of three things with section A: social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication behaviors, and relationships with others. But\u00a0within each of those three things, we have a range of different ways of being that\u00a0would fit into that\u00a0category. And each individual can express these criteria in a range of ways over the course of their life. I welcome discussion of the material I\u2019m posting in this DSM-5 series. And I will permit any comment anyone wants to make, so long as it is not advertising spam or something that reveals another person\u2019s private information or otherwise threatens others. Please do try to\u00a0be civil with one another, but know that during this discussion series I will not be practicing censorship at all \u2014 feel free to say what you really think. I promise you it\u2019s okay, even if I don\u2019t agree with you. I want this DSM-5 series to be a chance for people to really talk these ideas out without fear of reprisal. If you have a question specifically for me about the DSM-5 entry or anything related to this discussion, do call my attention to it by addressing me specifically (for those who might not know, my name is Sparrow, so\u00a0just start the comment with \u201cSparrow, [insert question]\u201d) and I will do my best, within the constraints of my time and knowledge, to answer. Thanks for reading and\u00a0please do stay tuned! There is a lot of\u00a0material in the DSM-5 and I am going to be spending a lot of time covering it, so keep coming back and I hope you are enjoying this!

{"date": "2014/10/07", "body": "This week, I watched a community implode. I\u2019m not going to talk about that, though, because it was very painful to watch people I love being treated so badly. But a lot of the implosion centered around a topic I do want to talk about. That topic is ABA \u2013 Applied Behavior Analysis, a common type of therapy for Autistic children. I watched people fight around in circles, chasing their metaphorical tails. It will take some time and lots of words to unpack this topic, but I hope you will stick with me on this because it\u2019s so important and there is a lot that needs to be understood here. Here\u2019s the argument in a nutshell. It gets longer, angrier, and much more detailed than this, but I am exhausted just from reading the fighting, so I\u2019m boiling it all down to two statements. And both statements are correct. Autistic adult: \u201cABA is abuse.\u201d Parent of Autistic child: \u201cI\u2019m not abusive and my child is benefitting greatly from ABA therapy.\u201d You read me right: both statements are correct. That is part of what I need to unpack today. I think the best place to start is with the fact that both people above are using the term \u201cABA\u201d, but what they are actually talking about are usually two different things. First we need to define ABA. Well, actually, first I want to put people at ease. Parents\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s got to be painful to feel like a whole group of people are ganging up on you and telling you that you are abusing your child. You love your child. You want the best for your child. You are spending thousands of dollars out of pocket to try to give your child the best possible chance in life. You worry about your child. You feel like you never even knew what love was until your child came along. You are not abusing your child. And if something you are doing is harming your child, you want to know about it and stop it. It hurts to be told that you are abusive toward the child you love so much. And my fellow Autistics\u00a0\u2014 you grew up feeling picked apart. You were subjected to things that harmed you. You still have PTSD today from things that\u00a0may have been\u00a0done with your best interests at heart but were actually quite damaging. You don\u2019t fit in to the world around you and the adults who were charged with your care when you were growing up were stumbling around in the dark when it came to trying to figure out how to raise a child like you were. It is triggering to see that\u00a0so many of the things that hurt you when you were growing up are still being said and done to and about children who are so very much like you were when you were their age. You want to stop the cycle of pain and you want children to grow up happy, healthy, and loved. It frightens and angers you to see many of the \u201cbest practices\u201d that\u00a0Autistic children today live with. And there is a good chance that the two of you \u2014 the Autistic adult and the parent of an Autistic child \u2014 are not even\u00a0talking about the same thing when you say \u201cABA.\u201d Major organizations (particularly Autism Speaks) have lobbied hard for Medicaid and insurance companies to cover ABA therapy for Autistic children. As a result, many therapists now call what they do \u201cABA,\u201d even in cases where the actual therapy is very different from\u00a0genuine ABA, in order to have their services covered by insurance. It\u2019s similar to the philosophy of therapists I\u2019ve known who don\u2019t believe in diagnosing mental illness\u00a0but put a name on their patients\u2019 struggles anyway\u00a0because many insurance policies only pay for therapy if the treatment is for a diagnosis listed in the DSM. That\u2019s the main point that I wanted to make, but there\u2019s still a lot to say on this topic. If almost everything is being called \u201cABA\u201d then what is actual ABA? And why do Autistic adults say it is abusive? What sort of warning signs should parents be watching for? What is harmful about certain practices? Those are a lot of questions to answer, but I will do my best. Bear in mind that I\u2019m not a therapist \u2014 ABA or otherwise \u2014 and I\u2019m not a parent. I\u2019m one Autistic adult, one person coping with therapy-induced PTSD, one person exhausted by the all-out war I see every day between people like me and people who love people like me, one person who wants to see a better world for everyone (but, I admit, especially for Autistic people.) ABA was developed by Dr. Ivar Lovaas. As\u00a0 a 1965\u00a0Life Magazine article  explains, the core theory of ABA was that a therapist, \u201cforcing a change in a child\u2019s outward behavior\u201d would, \u201ceffect an inward psychological change.\u201d The article says, \u201cLovaas feels that by I) holding any mentally crippled child accountable for his behavior and 2) forcing him to act normal, he can push the child toward normality.\u201d Much has changed, but this core premise of Lovaas\u2019 work remains solid. ABA\u2019s core\u00a0belief is that forty hours per week of therapy geared toward making a child externally appear as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible will \u201cfix the brokenness\u201d inside that made the child behave that way. ABA believes in an extreme form of \u201cfake it until you make it,\u201d and because it is behaviorism at its most pure \u2014 that is, a psychological science that treats internal processes as irrelevant to function (Lovaas said, \u201cyou have to put out the fire first before you worry how it started\u201d) \u2014 it treats behavior as meaningless and unwanted actions rather than as communication. This approach is troubling for many reasons. ABA strongly emphasizes the importance of intensive, saturated therapy and insists that it is crucial to get 40 hours a week of therapy for very young children. Think for a moment how exhausted you, a grown adult,\u00a0are after 40 hours of work in a week and you will begin to understand why we get so concerned about putting a three-year-old child through such a grueling schedule. Being Autistic doesn\u2019t give a three-year-old child superpowers of endurance. Forty hours a week of ABA is not just expensive, it is painfully exhausting. ABA maintains a schedule like this with the intention of breaking down a child\u2019s resistance and will. I understand that you are afraid for your child. Their future is unknown. You are worried about their ability to live a fulfilled life. You are worried about their ability to have self-supporting work and be taken care of after you pass on. And I understand that this fear, coupled with a deep desire to give your child the best you can give them, can lead you to accept the ABA attitude of \u201cmore is better.\u201d But stop a moment and think about the capacity for sustained focus of the average three-year-old and consider what a therapy that tries to double (or more) that capacity\u00a0is doing to a child. If you stress a child out or even traumatize them with\u00a0extreme therapies, you are paradoxically increasing the chances of incapacitating PTSD in the child\u2019s future. Yes, you want your child to develop as much as they are able to develop and you want them to enjoy their life and hopefully provide for themselves, but exhaustion and trauma\u00a0are not going to aid those sorts of development. Worse than the exhaustion of so many hours of therapy, though, is the heavy focus on making a child \u201cindistinguishable from his peers.\u201d The main goal of ABA is to make a child  LOOK  normal. This is insidious for a few reasons. first, it is the best way to get the parents to continue to co-operate with the therapists for many years. Of course you are going to be moved to tears if the therapist gets your child to look you in the eye or say \u201cMommy\u201d to you or sit at the table and eat a meal without fidgeting or melting down. Of course you will feel like the therapist is making progress and healing your child. That is a very natural response. So you will see the progress and you will want to continue with ABA therapy and you will be very defensive when adults Autistics online suggest that what is happening in your home might be a bad thing. What was bad were fights every mealtime. What was bad was never hearing your child\u2019s voice. What was bad were the judgmental or pitying stares you and your child got when you went out in public and people saw your child spinning around or flapping her hands or becoming so anxious you were forced to leave your groceries unpurchased and flee the store. But if your child is getting classic ABA therapy, what you are seeing is an illusion. And what looks like progress is happening at the expense of the child\u2019s sense of self, comfort, feelings of safety, ability to love who they are, stress levels, and more. The outward appearance is of improvement, but with classic ABA therapy, that outward improvement is married to a dramatic increase in internal anxiety and suffering. ABA therapists are trained to find out what your child loves the most and hold it ransom. Often, it\u2019s food. If your therapist suggests withholding food as a form of behavioral therapy, run screaming. That is harmful. If your child\u2019s therapist will not allow you to remain in the room during a session (they will usually tell you that your presence will be a distraction that will keep your child focused on you instead of on the therapy they need to be paying attention to) that is a big warning sign. If you are able to witness your child\u2019s therapy sessions and your child is spending a lot of time crying or going limp or flopping on the floor or showing signs you recognize as indicators of anxiety or fear, beware the therapy. If the therapist insists on pushing forward with the therapy when your child is crying or going limp instead of giving your child recovery time, run screaming. Therapy that trades your child\u2019s sense of safety in the present for a promise of future progress is exactly the sort of thing that Autistic adults mean when they talk about abusive therapy. Therapy should make your child better, not traumatize them, possibly for many years, potentially for the rest of their life. A therapist might tell you that \u201ca little crying\u201d is a normal thing, but I was once an Autistic child and I can tell you that being pushed repeatedly to the point of tears with zero sense of personal power and knowing that the only way to get the repeated torment to end was to comply with everything that was asked of me, no matter how painful, no matter how uneasy it made me feel, no matter how unreasonable the request seemed, knowing that I had no way out of a repeat of the torment again and again for what felt like it would be the rest of my life was traumatizing to such a degree that I still carry emotional scars decades later. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the perpetrator is a therapist, a teacher, a parent, or an age-peer: bullying is bullying. In my opinion, the goal of therapy should be to help the child live a better, happier, more functional life. Taking away things like hand flapping or spinning is not done to help the child. It is done because the people around the child are uncomfortable with or embarrassed by those behaviors. But those are coping behaviors for the child. It is very important to question why a child engages in the behaviors they do. It is very wrong to seek to train away those behaviors without understanding that they are the child\u2019s means of self-regulation. When considering whether you have made a wise choice in what therapy you are providing your child or not, you want to always remember a few cardinal rules: behavior is communication and/or a means of self-regulation. Communication is more important than speech. Human connection is more important than forced eye contact. Trust is easy to shatter and painfully difficult to re-build. It is more important for a child to be comfortable and functional than to \u201clook normal.\u201d Work on things like anxiety and sensory issues first. Work on getting better sleep (both you and your child). Things like eye contact can come later, much later, and only if your child is comfortable with them. There are work-arounds. Lots of people fake eye contact. Lots of people have good lives with minimal or no eye contact. But forcing a child to do something that is deeply painful and distressing for no reason other than to make them look more normal is not just unnecessary, it is cruel. I live two blocks from a behavioral clinic and I frequently walk several blocks out of my way to avoid walking past it because of the kinds of things I have seen when walking past the clinic. Let me tell you about the last thing I saw there, the thing that made me decide that I would rather walk an extra half-mile than risk seeing more ABA therapy on the sidewalk in front of the clinic. A mother and father came out of the clinic with a little girl, around\u00a07 years old by my best guess. Mother said, \u201cJanie (not the actual name), look at me.\u201d Janie didn\u2019t look at her mother. The mother said to the father, \u201cyou know what to do,\u201d and the father took hold of Janie and turned her head toward mother, saying, \u201clook at your mother, Janie.\u201d Janie resisted, turning her head away and trying to pull out of her father\u2019s hands. Mother crouched down and\u00a0Father\u00a0lifted Janie\u2019s\u00a0whole body up,\u00a0laying her across Mother\u2019s knee, face up. \u201cLook at your mother, Janie,\u201d father said. \u201cLook at me, Janie,\u201d Mother said. Janie began to whimper. Her body was as stiff as a board. Father held her body firm and Mother took hold of Janie\u2019s head, \u201clook at me, Janie,\u201d\u00a0Mother said. I was glued to the sidewalk. I didn\u2019t want to see any more but I\u00a0couldn\u2019t look away, couldn\u2019t walk away. Janie began\u00a0to moan and thrash her body. Father\u2019s hands held her body steady as she kicked and flailed. Mother\u2019s hands held Janie\u2019s head steady. Both kept urging Janie to look at her mother.\u00a0Janie\u2019s moans turned to screams but neither parent let her go. Finally, Janie\u2019s entire body went limp with defeat. She apparently made eye contact because Mother and Father began to lavish praise on her. \u201cGood girl,\u00a0Janie. Good eye contact.\u00a0Good girl. Let\u2019s get some ice cream now.\u201d Janie\u2019s limp body slid to the sidewalk where she lay, sobbing. Father picked her up and carried her to the car, the whole way praising her submission. \u201cGood eye contact, Janie.\u201d (This image \u2013 a drawing of eyes looking away with the caption \n\u201cForced eye contact hinders human contact\u201d \u2013 is a  sticker  and is also \navailable as a  light t-shirt  or  dark t-shirt  in adult and children\u2019s sizes.) What did Janie learn that day? I\u2019ll give you a hint: it was not that people are more trusting of those who make good eye contact. It was not that she will appear more normal and thus fit into society better if she makes good eye contact. It wasn\u2019t even that Mom really loves it when Janie connects with her through the eyes like that. Janie learned that adults can have whatever they want from her, even if it hurts and even if they have to hurt her to get it. Janie learned that her body does not belong to her and that she has to give others access to it at any time, for any reason, even if she wasn\u2019t doing anything that could hurt herself or others. Janie learned that there is no point in resisting and that it is her job to let others do what they want with her body, no matter how uncomfortable it makes her. You may think I\u2019m exaggerating or making this out to be more extreme than it is, but stop for a moment and imagine years of this therapy. Forty hours a week of being told to touch her nose and make eye contact and have quiet hands and sit still. A hundred and sixty hours a month of being restrained and punished when she doesn\u2019t want to touch her nose and being given candy and praise when she does touch her nose for the 90,000th time. Nearly two thousand hours a year of being explicitly taught that she does not own her body and she does not have the right to move it in ways that feel comfortable and safe to her. How many years will she be in therapy? How many years will she be taught to be a good girl? To touch her nose on command? To make eye contact on demand? Graduating to hugs, she will be taught that she is required to hug any adult who wants a hug from her. She will be punished when she does not hug and praised and fed when she does. And who will protect her from the predator who wants to hug her? Who will teach her that she is only required to yield her bodily autonomy for her parents and therapists but not for strangers? What if the predator turns out to be one of her therapists or parents? How will she resist abuse when she has had so many hours of training in submission? Therapy is an investment in the future, but ABA therapy is creating a future for Janie of being the world\u2019s doormat. Is that the future Janie\u2019s parents want for her? If your child\u2019s therapist believes it is more important for your child to comply with\u00a0every command\u00a0than to have any control at all over his or her body, run screaming. And don\u2019t forget that a layer of training does not change the underlying neurology. ABA uses the same methods and theories as dog training and if I train my dog to shake hands, it doesn\u2019t make him more human. It just makes him a dog who can shake hands. Similarly, if you train an Autistic to make eye contact and not flap their hands and say \u201cI love you, too\u201d and stay on task, it just makes them into an Autistic who can fake being not-autistic with some relative measure of success. Underneath the performance is still an Autistic brain and an Autistic nervous system and it is very important to remember that. Being trained to hide any reaction to painful noises, smells, lights, and feelings doesn\u2019t make the pain go away. Imagine years of living with pain that you have been trained to hide. How long would it last before you broke down? Some Autistics last an amazingly long time before they break down and burn out. And intensive ABA therapy will also teach a child that there is something fundamentally wrong and unacceptable about who they are. Not only is that child trained to look normal, they are trained to hate who they are inside. They are trained to hate who they are and hide who they are. They will work very hard to hide who they are, because they have learned to hate who they are. And as a result, they will push themselves to the brink of destruction. And when they finally crumble from years of hiding their sensory pain and years of performing their social scripts and blaming themselves every time a script doesn\u2019t carry them successfully through a social situation, they will be angry at themselves and blame themselves for their nervous breakdown and autistic burn-out. All those years of ABA therapy will have taught them that they are fundamentally wrong and broken; that they are required to do everything authority demands of them (whether it\u2019s right or wrong for them); that they are always the one at fault when anything social goes wrong; that they get love, praise, and their basic survival needs met so long as they can hide any trace of autism from others; that what they want doesn\u2019t matter. Now you know what to watch for. Your child\u2019s therapist may use the term \u201cABA\u201d in order to get paid, but they might not be doing these harmful, degrading, abusive things to your child at all. If your child\u2019s therapist is respecting your child, not trying to break down the child\u2019s sense of self and body-ownership, treating behavior as communication rather than pointless motions that need to be trained away, valuing speech but not at the expense of communication, giving your child breaks to recover and not over-taxing their limited focusing abilities . . . then they can call their therapy anything they want to, but it is not ABA. (And hold on to that therapist! They are golden!) And I hope that the next time you hear an Autistic adult say that ABA is abuse, you are compassionate. Remember the suffering so many of us endured. Know that we say those things because we love your children and want to help them. We do not say them because we hate you and want to call you abusers. We don\u2019t hate you at all and we want to help you. Sometimes we are clumsy in how we go about it, because, well, we are Autistic and communication difficulties are part of that package. But know that when we attack ABA, we are not intending to attack you. We want your child to sleep through the night and laugh with joy and become toilet trained (on whatever schedule their bodies can handle \u2014 don\u2019t forget that we tend to be late bloomers), and have a healthy, happy, productive, love-filled life. We want you to rejoice in parenting and connect with your children on a deep and meaningful level. When an Autistic adult says \u201cABA is abuse,\u201d you might be tempted to hear, \u201cyou are abusing your child.\u201d But that is not what we are saying. Next time you hear an Autistic adult say \u201cABA is abuse,\u201d please hear those words as, \u201cI love you and your child. Be careful! There are unscrupulous people out there who will try to convert the fear you feel for your child\u2019s future into money in their pocket at the cost of your child\u2019s well-being.\u201d And if you are a therapist and you are upset when we say \u201cABA is abuse\u201d, know that we are not talking about you . . . unless you are using shock punishments or making children endure long hours of arduous therapy beyond their ability to cope or teaching children that they do not have the right to say who can have access to intimacy with their body or not (and forced eye contact is a particularly nasty violation of a person\u2019s control over their bodily intimacy.) If you are not the kind of therapist who we are talking about when we talk about the harm of therapy, then we are not talking about you! Thank you for being one of the good guys. We\u00a0need more like you. Teach others what you know. Spread the love and help change the world, please! Thank you for reading all of this. I know it was a lot of words, but this is such an important topic. The children are the future and I don\u2019t have words to explain how painful it is when I see Autistic adults being verbally bullied and abused because they are trying to help the children by helping parents to understand more about the lived experience of autism and more about the kinds of things that can be very harmful to Autistic lives. I had over a decade of therapy in my childhood and much of it was not good therapy and I am explicitly damaged because of it. When I say ABA is abuse \u2014 when we Autistic adults say ABA is abuse \u2014 we are speaking from a collective wisdom gained through painful experiences that have left lasting scars on us. We don\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through the pain we have gone through.\u00a0Please respect where we are coming from and please do not add to the trauma by attacking us for trying to help others. Thank you. ========= Edited to add: if you would like to see some video examples of helpful vs. harmful therapies, check out this blog post I made a month later on that topic: Helpful vs. Harmful Therapies: What Do They Look Like?

{"date": "2013/09/20", "body": "Good morning, again! I\u2019m enjoying these morning posts. I\u2019m also putting together a book of my essays this week. It will have my two most popular posts from this blog and all the rest of the essays will be new, never before seen, essays. I\u2019m writing about food and eating habits, body image and body issues, what autism means to me, what is \u201cnormal\u201d and who is \u201callowed\u201d to be not normal, how I relate to objects, people, and animals, normalization, independent living, and more. I\u2019ll post here when it\u2019s ready. It will be for sale on Amazon as a Kindle book (you can get free Kindle readers for just about any device so you don\u2019t need an actual Kindle to read it.) and I hope some of you will be interested in getting and reading it. In the meantime, back to the DSM-5 series! I am really loving going through this, piece by piece. Today\u2019s section is Section D from page 50: D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning. Wow, one little sentence. Some of the other sections were huge and section D is just one sentence. Basically, it\u2019s saying that it\u2019s okay if all the visible symptoms and traits are in your childhood and you have compensated for them now, but you still have to have significant impairment in at least one important area of your life. This is a rough one to write about because it starts to get into some of the politics of the Autistic community. (The Autistic community is the community of people who are actually Autistic themselves. The Autism community is the larger community that also includes parents and caregivers, professionals, researchers, etc.) Some of the things this sentence touches on will be addressed later in this DSM-5 series because the section on severity brings those topics up again. Some are not explicitly mentioned in the DSM-5. One thing this immediately brings to mind for me are the ongoing discussions among Autistics about the concept of \u201cfunctioning levels.\u201d Many prominent Autistic writers have pointed out that if a person is labeled as \u201chigh functioning,\u201d often their struggles get ignored and they don\u2019t get as much help as they need. But if a person is labeled as \u201clow functioning,\u201d the expectations others have for them are often equally low and their skills and accomplishments are either ignored or treated as a sort of freakish \u201csplinter skill.\u201d I finally got some of the help I need, but before I got my aide, I often complained that functioning levels are deadly because I kept getting shuffled from one agency to another and being told by one\u00a0organization that I was too high functioning to qualify for their assistance but told by another that I was too low functioning to qualify. So things like functioning levels and severity levels (and mental age) are really sticky things in the Autistic community and many of us feel that these things dehumanize Autistics. At the same time, when roughly 1% of the population is Autistic, there has to be an efficient way to sort through us to make sure that people are getting assistance at an appropriate level, so severity levels and functioning assessments are quite necessary. I think the DSM-5 does a good job with this, but that\u2019s a subject for a couple of days from now when I post the severity tables and talk about them. Another issue people will likely have with this sentence is the idea that if you have no \u201cclinically significant\u201d difficulties, you\u2019re not Autistic (and a related debate centers around what makes a difficulty \u201cclinically significant.\u201d For example, losing your keys is not clinically significant. Losing your keys several times a day, every day is quite possibly clinically significant. Where is the break point between those two?) One thing that the layperson can get from this criterion is, again, to withhold judgment. I confess, I have sometimes looked at a fellow Autistic who has held the same job for 30 years and has a circle of friends they get together with regularly, who feeds themselves and keeps their house clean, and I wonder, \u201chow are they Autistic?\u201d This really is a confession, because this is the first time that I have ever publically admitted that I have these thoughts. That is because they are thoughts I am not proud of \u2014 it is judgmental and inappropriate. But I have also noticed that if I get to know that person better, I often learn more details about their life that aren\u2019t so clear on the surface. Like maybe\u00a0I only thought they were feeding themselves well and they actually often forget to eat or have too much exhaustion or inertia to eat for days at a time and are\u00a0genuinely but invisibly\u00a0malnourished while they go about doing their job and keeping their home in order and writing very moving things. Or maybe they\u2019ve had the job for 30 years but they are seriously held back in their career because they don\u2019t have any friends at work and don\u2019t know how to play the office politics so they have been trapped beneath a glass ceiling all those years and are deeply frustrated to still be doing grunt work so far below what they are capable of because they aren\u2019t given the chance to show what they can really do. In one case, I was quietly judging someone else\u2019s life only to later learn that they use AAC to communicate rather than speaking! That was an eye-opener! I really can\u2019t judge how difficult or easy someone\u2019s life is, where their challenges lie, or if their autism is \u201cclinically significant\u201d in a casual meeting and certainly not over the internet! But this brings up something else: if a person actually does develop enough coping mechanisms and learns well enough how to fit in so as to actually live up to that Holy Grail of \u201cindistinguishable from peers,\u201d are they still Autistic? I see claims that someone \u201coutgrew\u201d their autism or that their autism was \u201ccured\u201d or \u201cin remission\u201d and I wonder how a condition that is marked by both structural and functional brain differences that are congential \u2014 that is, present from birth \u2014 could ever be said to be \u201cno longer\u00a0Autistic\u201d if they still have the same brain. And there is the question\u00a0of whether the person is actually \u201ccured\u201d or has just learned to layer the right behaviors over top of a brain that is still very Autistic. I can understand, with the stigma that comes along with autism, why someone might want to\u00a0distance themselves or their child from the diagnosis if they have learned how to cover up the autism or their brain has developed to such a degree that they can pass for not-autistic. But I don\u2019t really think those cases are examples of \u201ccures\u201d because what makes a person Autistic (to me) is that they were born with an Autistic brain. So I\u00a0think the more correct way to refer to people who have developed those coping and masking skills so well is \u201cno longer clinically diagnosable.\u201d And that\u2019s basically what criterion D is saying: you can be quirky, you can have some measure of all these traits or have had them in\u00a0childhood, but if you aren\u2019t having significant difficulty with work or socializing or self-care or any other \u00a0important area of life, we can\u2019t diagnose you with autism. You might have social anxiety instead. Or you might just be eccentric. Or maybe you actually are Autistic but you are not currently diagnosable. It is interesting to me that one is required to have significant impairment in order to have the diagnosis. I\u2019m still kind of sensing out how I feel about that. For example, is Temple Grandin still Autistic? She works as a professor of animal agriculture and also as a speaker and writer about autism. She has pretty strong job security and seems to be doing great, career-wise. I have never heard her mention troubles with keeping her house clean or feeding herself. She seems to have friends and colleagues she enjoys and has expressed a disinterest in romantic relationships. She found the medication\u00a0and lifestyle solutions that addressed her anxiety. She seems to function quite well with no real impairments, right? But I have met Temple and it was very clear to me that she is very Autistic. It is incredibly obvious when you speak with her.\u00a0She has worked very hard to get where she is in life and\u00a0she has built a life that supports her needs, so she is not noticeably impaired in function.\u00a0And, according to criterion D, that might mean she is not\u00a0clinically diagnosable as\u00a0Autistic. But,\u00a0come on. She *is* Autistic. Who\u2019s going to argue that she isn\u2019t? So what does section D mean in a real world sense? I think it is\u00a0 more of a signpost than a hard rule. It reminds the clinician that one shouldn\u2019t go around diagnosing\u00a0people who are doing just fine. Diagnoses are not political statements \u2014 they are tools to help others recognize a person\u2019s particular needs. I have an aide because I have a diagnosis. Without the diagnosis, there was no \u201cproof\u201d that I wasn\u2019t just being lazy and hoping someone else would do things for me. I have a genuine impairment that requires assistance. But if someone is\u00a0\u201cfunctioning\u201d but only because they are barely, desperately clinging on by their fingernails, they really aren\u2019t functioning and they really need some assistance.\u00a0I would put forth the idea that Temple Grandin functions so well now *because* she was diagnosed as a child and got the help she needed and was able to earn enough money as an adult to build a comfortable world around herself that\u00a0suits her needs. She doesn\u2019t need a\u00a0diagnosis now because she has built her world to fit her. She has accommodated herself. But not needing a diagnosis is not the same thing as not being Autistic. And maybe that\u2019s the take-away here: don\u2019t judge someone else\u2019s life from a distance and don\u2019t assume that because they seem to be doing really well as an adult they aren\u2019t\u00a0Autistic and didn\u2019t have\u00a0lots of\u00a0extra needs as a child . . . or wouldn\u2019t\u00a0need lots of extra help if something disrupted the world they have built around them. An Autistic\u00a0who really seems to have their life together could be one of the worst hit if a natural disaster occurred because their carefully constructed world got disrupted. Sure, everyone hit by that disaster would be suffering, but the Autistic person who looked \u201ccured\u201d might end up falling farther and suffering worst because they didn\u2019t just lose all their possessions and home like everyone around them but also all the supports and accommodations they had built into their life that were masking their autism. Diagnosing\u00a0autism is tricky stuff and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t question other people\u2019s diagnoses. If someone tells me they are Autistic, that\u2019s good enough\u00a0for me. I don\u2019t need to \u201cfact check\u201d to see if they really are Autistic\u00a0or not. That would be like asking someone to prove they are gay! That would be ridiculous to me. Someone tells me their identity is one that mainstream society often stigmatizes and I\u2019m going to question that identity? No way. So that\u2019s it for\u00a0Section D.\u00a0We\u2019ll revisit some of this in severity levels but my next post will be the last\u00a0lettered section in the diagnostic criteria, Section E. Have a great day! I\u2019m going to go work on that essay book now. I hope your Friday is happy and productive and I hope you\u00a0are looking forward to a wonderful weekend.

{"date": "2013/09/19", "body": "Good morning! I\u2019m going to look at the section C of the diagnostic criteria today. I originally thought I was going to put C, D, and E all together but when I realized I\u2019d already written a thousand words about C, I decided to take them one at a time after all. After that, we\u2019ll\u00a0 move on to the table of severity levels and the discussion of severity levels, then on to the rest of the discussion section in the DSM-5. This is from page 50 of the DSM-5, in the section titled \u201cAutism Spectrum Disorder: Diagnostic Criteria 299.00 (F84.0)\u201d C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life.) Let\u2019s unpack\u00a0this. This one is HUGE! The DSM is acknowledging a couple of things here. They are acknowledging that a child may seem \u201cjust fine\u201d to their parents (although there are also plenty of parents of Autistic children who say they knew something was different almost from the day of birth!) until they go to school and start interacting with their peers and having more demands placed on them. I was one of those children. There were definite signs before school. For example, I learned to read somewhere around 2 or 3 years of age (hyperlexia) and began reading obsessively afterwards (and for the rest of my life. I actually have a panic attack if I think I will be stuck with nothing to read, so I have a nice stack of books waiting for me to read them because it gives me a sense of security and safety to know I have more reading material available than I could possibly read my way through before I buy more books. The internet also helps me feel safer about not running out of reading material. (I am straying off topic a bit, but one of the worst things adults used to do to me as a child was take away my books to try to force me to go play with other children.) I also had issues with spoken\u00a0language dropping in and out and I remember my mother many times telling me to use my words, saying that she knew I knew how to speak and she wasn\u2019t going to give me the food or drink\u00a0I was pointing to until I said with words that I wanted it. Very frustrating. But despite those \u201cquirks\u201d and other similar ones, and despite the concerns they raised in my parents (my father once told me it was kind of creepy to see a child so tiny, and barely able to\u00a0speak her own words,\u00a0yet able to read the newspaper and encyclopedia out loud, rapidly and perfectly) I was considered a normal-but-bright child until I went to school and the really noticeable behaviors began: hiding under the table all day and biting anyone who tried to coax me out, for example. Or coming out for art time but refusing to paint or color with anything other than black. So it was at age 5 when I first began to visit a psychiatrist in an attempt to understand what was wrong with me. In my own case, the autism was masked by my brother\u2019s leukemia \u2014 he was diagnosed when I was 3 and died a month and a half before I turned 7. And there wasn\u2019t as much understanding of autism back in 1972 when I first began visiting professionals, so for most of my childhood all my autistic traits were assumed to be signs of grief. The other thing that is pretty huge about section C is that it points out that we develop over the years, that autism manifests differently along the lifespan, and that many adults have learned how to fit in better. I\u2019ve had people say I can\u2019t be Autistic because I understand and use colloquialisms and sayings like \u201cdon\u2019t count your chickens before they have hatched\u201d without getting puzzled about what chickens have to do with the plans I am making about my future. I know what that saying (and many others) mean because at some point, in my childhood, I *was* confused about what chickens had to do with things or why someone said I shouldn\u2019t put all my eggs in one basket when I didn\u2019t have a basket or any eggs. I asked \u2014 or someone saw my confusion and explained \u2014 and I learned. I filed it away and when I began writing, I found I enjoyed using these strange sayings and other types of slang and casual language because I find them colorful and expressive. I \u201ccracked the code.\u201d But I still get tripped up by these things! Last year I was exposed to the saying \u201clet a thousand flowers bloom\u201d and I had to ask for it to be explained to me. It didn\u2019t make sense and I still find the phrase confusing, but I know what it means now.\u00a0Knowing what these abstract sayings mean\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not Autistic any more \u2014 it means I have the ability to learn and change and grow. It is so terrific that criterion C mentions that trait of Autistic people! We are not static! We have a developmental delay but not a developmental halt! We can learn and change and grow and some of us may even change so much that we don\u2019t \u201clook Autistic\u201d any more, at least to some people, some of the time. On a good day, I can go to the grocery, buy some food, pay for it, and leave, and no one realizes that they were just shopping next to an Autistic woman. On a difficult day, there is no way I can hide my differences and I see the stares and hear people asking each other questions about me. On a really bad day, I don\u2019t even go to the grocery, even if I\u2019m out of food. But the take-away from C is that you should not try to judge whether someone is Autistic or not by just looking at them without knowing them deeply. You might be seeing them on a really easy day or in a really easy situation. You might be looking at a child in a setting that does not offer too many demands\u00a0or too much challenge. You might be looking at an adult who has learned ways to be more invisible and look more like everyone else. Or you might be looking at someone who is expending a huge amount of effort. The French writer, Camus, once wrote: \u201cNobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.\u201d He could easily have been talking about a lot of Autistic people! That \u201cgood day\u201d trip to the grocery store I described? It is absolutely exhausting to me. Yes, I go in and buy 5 or 10 items and make smiles and chit-chat and leave a good impression behind me. Then I go home and collapse with the exhaustion of the effort. So I have to give another huge check mark to the DSM-5 \u2014 two check marks, actually \u2014 for criterion C. This section of the diagnostic criteria recognizes that we change and develop and that we can look different at different times in our lives or in different situations. I have some friends who say they believe I am Autistic but they are confused because they don\u2019t see it. That is because they have only seen me within my \u201csafety zone\u201d and on \u201csocial days.\u201d The moment they see me outside of the nice, shiny bubble I work hard to keep around myself and my life, they immediately understand. My partner has seen me far, far outside that bubble and says there is no doubt in his mind that I am, indeed, Autistic. (And part of why I love him so much is that not only does he understand the hard things about autism, but he sees the beautiful things about it, too, and says that he wishes he could take away the struggle but he doesn\u2019t wish he could take away the autism because too many of the things he loves about me are autistic traits.) So, just as much as I want you to remember not to judge the family you might see with the exhausted mother desperately trying to run interference on the screaming, crying child who seems \u201ctoo old to behave that way.\u201d I also want you to remember not to judge the person who has identified themselves or their child as being on the autism spectrum yet that Autistic person seems \u201ctoo normal to really be Autistic.\u201d If you only see one slice of an Autistic life, you don\u2019t have enough context to make any sort of judgments, good or bad, about that life or the family, friends, and environment that person lives their life among. I will be touching on these issues a lot more tomorrow when we look at section D. There is a lot to say about that criterion, too! Until then, may you have a lovely day and may you always be kind to and appreciate those you love. And may you always be sure to put yourself on that list of loved ones you must remember to treat well!

{"date": "2014/08/14", "body": "Since you\u2019re on the internet, you\u2019ve already heard the latest news \u2014 Robin Williams\u2019 wife announced that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s Disease. He hadn\u2019t wanted to announce it publically yet. He had not returned to drug or alcohol use. He was deeply depressed because of the Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis. The responses I saw, just in the first hour after learning this new information, revealed to me that there is a deeper level of stigma than mental illness. When all we knew was that Robin Williams had succeeded at suicide and that he had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and that he had spoken openly about depression and mania, there was an outpouring of compassion about the pain of depression. A few people aside, people were talking with compassion about depression. People were sharing phone numbers of hotlines. People were telling one another to be there for their friends, to listen, to care. People with mental illnesses wrote messages of solidarity and I even saw many folks seeing this climate of compassion and taking the strength and courage from it to come out of the closet about their own mental illness. But now that we know that Robin Williams had Parkinson\u2019s, what is the first thing I see? \u201cIt\u2019s still tragic, but it\u2019s more like a rational choice now.\u201d and, \u201cI feel as if, now came out he had Parkinson\u2019s disease, we can agree he had a reason to choose to die.\u201d and \u201cIf laws for euthanasia where better he could have chosen to die among his loved ones, family and friends and not alone and cruel.\u201d I\u2019m happy to say that others joined the conversation and spoke about why those kinds of attitudes are so chilling to disabled people. But still, the immediate reactions of able-bodied people shocked me. And it showed me that we still have so much stigma to dig ourselves out from under. Earlier this week, we were having conversations about the very real and very harmful stigma of mental illness. And we were seeing many strong and heartening responses about depression and suicide and reaching out to one another. Even Matt Walsh,\u00a0who had been skewered for a blog post titled \u201cRobin Williams Didn\u2019t Die From a Disease, He Died From His Choice\u201d, was trying to say that depression-fueled suicide shouldn\u2019t happen because we should be reaching out to one another, loving one another, helping one another through our pain. He clarified his position in a follow-up post titled \u201c Depression Isn\u2019t a Choice But Suicide Is \u201c. Although he still referred to depression as a \u201cdemon,\u201d a position that Maia Szalavitz points out is stigmatizing in itself: \u201cWhen even today\u2019s headlines about addiction and mental illness refer to struggles with \u201cdemons,\u201d you know that stigma remains strong.\u201d (from  How Much Did the Stigma of Mental Illness Harm Robin Williams? ) Going forward, we need to duplicate the sensitive conversations we were having about the stigma of mental illness, but this time, we need to talk about the stigma of disability. The instinctual responses I saw from people when they learned that Robin Williams had been depressed about being diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s are part of a \u201cbetter off dead\u201d stigma that disabled people encounter from others every day. In the Autistic community, we see it played out graphically, month after month, as parents and other caregivers kill Autistic children and adults and onlookers talk about the great difficulty of taking care of Autistic people, the cost, the suffering, the quality of life. So much sympathy goes to the parents who had been \u201csaddled with such a burden\u201d and so little sympathy, outside of the community of Autistics and our allies, goes to the disabled victim. When the first response to learning that Robin Williams had Parkinson\u2019s is that his suicide makes sense now, there is something very wrong. One person said, \u201c Couldn\u2019t he have called Michael J. Fox?? He died from fear of disability.\u201d And I wonder if Fox will tell us that he did speak with Williams. Or if he will reveal that he had no idea about Williams\u2019 diagnosis. I don\u2019t know if Fox could have helped Williams come to terms with the diagnosis or not, but Fox has been pretty open about his own life and he\u2019s surely someone I would want to have in my corner while I grappled with my life choices in the face of a Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis.  Parkinson\u2019s is a difficult disease to live with. Then again, so is depression, but our culture\u2019s instinctual response to depression was to remind people that we should fight against it, not to say that it makes sense to commit suicide because who would want to live with the pain of depression? We must\u00a0overcome our cultural attitude that a disabled life is a life not worth living. We must learn enough about the lives and thoughts of disabled people that we no longer have a knee jerk reaction of approval\u00a0to suicide committed to avoid a disabling disease. And we must work to build a society that accommodates and includes disabled people, welcoming disabled people into the community of \u201cus\u201d rather than relegating disabled people to a pitied and feared \u201cthem\u201d that \u201cwe can all agree\u201d would have a perfectly valid reason to kill themselves. Not only does this attitude devalue the lives of disabled people, judge their worthiness, \u201cother\u201d them, but it is dangerous. It is the beginning of a slippery slope. If we say that Robin Williams\u2019 suicide is now understandable, acceptable, rational, reasonable, supportable . . . we begin to erode the right of disabled people to live our lives. If we are too much trouble, If we cost too much, if we demand too many accommodations, are we forfeiting our right to exist? If the world thinks that we would be better off dead, how willing will people be to help us live a good, satisfying, fulfilling life? Who wants to spend resources on people who \u201cshouldn\u2019t be here\u201d? So if you hear about Robin Williams\u2019 Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis and you are tempted to think it makes his suicide better, more rational, or even okay, stop to think about what attitude you are carrying toward disability and why you are shocked at a suicide due to depression but only sad about a suicide due to disability. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/williams-and-fox.jpg", "http://themattwalshblog.com/2014/08/13/depression-isnt-choice-suicide-response-critics/", "http://www.substance.com/how-much-did-the-stigma-of-mental-illness-harm-robin-williams/10707/"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2014/08/14/deeper-levels-of-stigma/", "title": "Deeper Levels of\u00a0Stigma"},
{"date": "2013/09/21", "body": "I\u2019m combining Section E and Severity levels in one post because I don\u2019t have a lot to say about Section E: E. These symptoms are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level. The very few things I want to say: a. intellectual disability and autism are two separate things (though often found together.) I think everyone reading this blog already knows that but I also think almost everybody reading this blog has encountered someone at some point who didn\u2019t know that and I suspect many of us have frustrating stories. It can be difficult when, like me,\u00a0one doesn\u2019t\u00a0want to come across as stigmatizing toward intellectual disability (in fact, I feel strong solidarity with those with intellectual disability) but\u00a0one wants to communicate that autism is not the same thing as intellectual disability. I have the same issue with mental illness \u2014 autism is not a mental illness, but I don\u2019t want to add to the stigmatization of mental illness. I\u2019ve stopped correcting people who call autism a mental illness because I realized I really can\u2019t say what makes it different: most mental illnesses are partially or wholly\u00a0neurological (as is autism), mental illnesses are stigmatized (as is autism), mental illnesses lead people to behave in ways that others don\u2019t understand or are afraid of (as does autism). I no longer see any point in correcting someone who calls autism a mental illness. b. a repeat of what\u2019s already been said: autism is not a static, monolithic thing. If you are looking at a child, you expect autism to look different than if you are looking at an adult. Similarly, if you are looking at someone with an intellectual disability, you expect autism to look different than if you are looking at someone who scores very high on I.Q. tests. Something I noticed when I watched Sean Penn\u2019s performance in the movie  I Am Sam  was how much an intellectual disability can resemble autism. I figured, \u201cwell, it\u2019s just a movie. Not all of Hoffman\u2019s models for  Rain   Man  were Autistic so maybe Penn modeled after some Autistic people when preparing for the role,\u201d But a little bit of research revealed that there is a bit of \u201cobservational cross-over\u201d in real life. So one thing Section E is saying is to watch for that cross-over and be prepared to have to decide if the developmental delay is expected or unusual. (Intellectual Disability and Autism are so closely related that they appear in the same section of the DSM and they do often walk hand in hand. This brings up a lot of\u00a0thoughts about the way autism is portrayed, but I\u2019ll save those for another time because they\u2019re a little\u00a0more off-topic than I prefer to get in a blog essay, rambling though I tend to be.) On to Severity\u00a0Levels. The severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe succinctly the current symptomatology (which might fall below level 1), with the recognition that the severity may vary by context and fluctuate over time. Severity of social communication difficulties and restricted, repetitive behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity categories should not be used to determine eligibility for and provision of services; these can only be developed at an individual level and through discussion of personal priorities and targets. Look at that!! Did you see what they did there? \u201cseverity may vary by context and fluctuate over time.\u201d This is terrific! They are acknowledging (they acknowledge this multiple times and in different ways throughout the overall DSM-5 entry) that severity level is not a static thing! Hurrah! There is a conversation currently going on in the comments sections of these entries that is talking about this issue. Check it out. A woman in her mid-thirties is having problems right now and is seeking help and concerned that her potential autism diagnosis will be rejected because she was functioning at a higher level when she was a child and being very supported by the adults in her life. Now that she is going it on her own, she finds herself floundering. That is a change in context (and time) that has affected her severity level. And did you notice that bit about how the symptomatology might fall below level 1? While clinically significant impairment is required for an autism diagnosis, it is recognized that an Autistic\u00a0person might not always be impaired enough to require supports. Falling below level 1 means sometimes not needing supports at all. It is recognized that someone might be severity level 2 in some things, severity level 1 in others, and not needing supports at all in yet another set of life skills. This is one of the reasons so many Autistics shy away from \u201cfunction labels.\u201d For example, I would be called a high-functioning autistic (in fact, I\u2019ve seen that exact phrase in some of my medical records) but my functioning is fluid and there are times when I am not high-functioning at all. Calling me high-functioning sets up expectations that might block me from meeting some of my needs, for example my need for alternate forms of communication when I am in the hospital and my ability to speak has dropped out due to stress and illness. But I don\u2019t mind as much being described as \u201ccurrently functioning at severity level 1\u201d because there is the implication that I might not always function at that level. It communicates something (but not everything) about my current needs but does not cement me in that one place where it is never recognized that I sometimes have other needs. And on top of that, the DSM-5 recognizes that severity level is just a rough outline that doesn\u2019t tell you very much about an individual and so they remind professionals who are reading the entry that they cannot use severity level to determine services! That is also huge! Yes, it costs more and takes more time to approach services on a case-by-case, individualized basis but that\u2019s the thing about autism: every one of us is so different from every other one of us that there really is no other way to ensure appropriate services are provided. We have to be personally fit into the programs and services we need! So, I am really happy about that. I will leave you with the actual table of severity levels. They come in two flavors: social communication, and restricted repetitive behaviors. That\u2019s also nice: it\u2019s recognized that someone can be at different severity levels in those two things simultaneously. DSM-5 really does represent an improvement in how we, as a society, as talking about autism. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to specifically discuss what\u2019s in the severity table unless others make thought-provoking comments that really make me want to dive in there. It\u2019s mostly an attempt to quantify the factors that were already discussed in Sections A and B. So with Table 2, I bid you adieu for the day and will be back tomorrow with more discussion of the DSM-5. TABLE 2: Severity levels for autism spectrum disorder ============================================= Severity Level:  Level 3 \u201cRequiring very substantial support\u201d Social Communication:  Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause severe impairments in functioning, very limited initiation of social interactions, and minimal response to social overtures from others. For example, a person with few words of intelligible speech who rarely initiates interaction and,\u00a0 when he or she does, makes unusual approaches to meet needs only and responds to only very direct social approaches. Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors:  Inflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres. Great distress/difficulty changing focus or action. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Severity Level:  Level\u00a02 \u201cRequiring\u00a0substantial support\u201d Social Communication:  Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions; and reduced or abnormal responses to social overtures from others. For example, a person who speaks simple sentences, whose interaction is limited to narrow special interests, and who has markedly odd nonverbal communication. Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors:  Inflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty changing focus or action. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Severity Level:  Level\u00a01 \u201cRequiring\u00a0support\u201d Social Communication:  Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments. Difficulty initiating social interactions, and clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions. For example, a person who is able to speak in full sentences and engages in communication but whose to-and-fro conversation with others fails, and whose attempts to make friends are odd and typically unsuccessful. Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors:  Inflexibility of behavior causes significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Difficulty switching between activities. Problems of organization and planning hamper independence.

Some people have asked what, specifically, they should do to help in this case, so I\u2019m writing this blog post to answer that question and to explain his situation in\u00a0a bit more depth. The Washington Post has an editorial about Reginald Latson\u2019s situation , but here is a summary of the details: Reginald Latson (Neli to his family and friends) is a 22-year-old, black, Autistic man with an intellectual disability (his I.Q. score is below 70.) Four and a half years ago, he was sitting quietly, waiting for the library to open, when someone called the police to complain about the \u201csuspicious\u00a0black male.\u201d The police arrived and an unpleasant interaction ensued, during which Neli was arrested (according to the police, because he \u201crefused\u201d to give his name.\u00a0It is unclear whether Neli was able to speak or not in that stressful moment. It is clear that the police were confused about how to question a disabled person waiting for the library to open.) Although experts have testified that Neli belongs in a facility equipped to treat him properly, he has spent the last four years in a regular jail. This is an abuse of justice \u2014 Neli\u2019s autism and intellectual disability make him extremely vulnerable in a prison setting and he\u00a0deserves proper consideration for that. And he deserves to have proper support and to be moved as quickly as possible to an appropriate facility. A judge already agreed to let Mr. Latson transition to an appropriate facility in Florida but a prosecutor has actively worked to thwart that decision.

Below the bus are the words: Insulting fellow human beings with \u201cshort bus\u201d comments doesn\u2019t make you look funny; it makes you look cruel. When I first heard about  #TheShortBus flash blog , I was unsure if I should join or not because I didn\u2019t ride a short bus. But then I thought about all the times in my life when I\u2019ve been called \u201cshort bus\u201d or had someone tell me I should be on a short bus and realized that it doesn\u2019t matter whether I was actually on a short bus myself \u2014 the stigma touches all of us. And \u201cshort bus\u201d is symbolic of a larger body of cruel jokes people use to diminish others. There\u2019s also the R-word and\u00a0jokes about Special Olympics (including one not so long ago from our president, a man who has worked on legislation to help people with disabilities and really should have known better than to go there.) People go through all kinds of philosophical acrobatics to try to justify their use of these comments. The worst justification I\u2019ve ever seen was Ann Coulter saying that it was ethically okay for her to call President Obama the R-word because everyone knows he\u2019s not intellectually disabled \u2014 in her opinion, it would be wrong to call someone who actually has an intellectual disability the R-word but it\u2019s mysteriously okay to dehumanize people who are intellectually disabled by using them as nothing but a walking insult to smack others with. Bottom line: it\u2019s wrong! I don\u2019t care who you are using \u201cshort bus\u201d to mock or insult, you are hurting everyone who ever rode a short bus, all of us with developmental and other disabilities regardless of our mode of transportation, and everyone who knows and loves us. That\u2019s a lot of people to be so cruel and stigmatizing toward, just to get your little joke in \u2014 which, by the way, is not even funny. So stop it! Our ride is not your joke! Our lives are not your joke! Treat your fellow human beings with decency and stop using language that denigrates us for being different from you. Using aspects of the lives of disabled children (or adults) as jokes and insults is unacceptable! If you are a person who makes these sorts of comments, I hope you will think about who you are hurting with them. If you hear or read people making comments like this, I hope you will be able to speak up and tell them that it\u2019s not cool.

{"date": "2012/10/31", "body": "This is a re-post of the blog entry I wrote for the first  Autistics Speaking Day  on November 1st, 2010. Ironically, I took that post \u2014 and everything else in my blog \u2014 down just a week later because of a bully who was threatening to \u201cout\u201d my disabilty status in my department at my university. I was afraid that I would lose my position if people knew more about my struggles so I removed all the content of my blog and went into hiding. But now I have outed myself and no longer fear what a bully can do to me. I re-read this entry that I wrote for the first Autistics Speaking Day, in reaction to the first Communication Shutdown. And want to share it, both so it can be online again and because I don\u2019t feel I could improve on it. I could write something different \u2014 and I will next year \u2014 but this is one of the better things I\u2019ve written and I just want to go with it this year. So here it is: my entry for Autistics Speaking Day 2012: When I was nine, a poet visited our class. We each had to write a poem for her, titled \u201cI Am.\u201d Mine contained the lines: I am a dove who once knew the range of the cosmos. \nNow my wings are clipped and my heart aches for flight, a freedom taken for granted. \nI am a nightingale. Scoffed and scorned, I no longer sing. \nI am a mountain that fell and became sand. This is why I instinctively recoiled when I first heard that people were planning to abandon social network sites for one day in order to raise awareness of autism, show solidarity with non-verbal autistics, raise money for autism charities, and experience for a day what it must be like to be autistic. You will not experience what it is like to be autistic by turning off your computer for one day. And I am highly offended by the idea that I can only show how important autism and autistics are to me by shutting up. I\u2019ve been asked, told, and bullied into shutting up all my life. I am tired of being the nightingale who cannot sing, the dove whose wings are clipped, the mountain that has been ground down into sand by prejudice and cruelty and rejection. I will speak! If you want to know what it\u2019s like to be autistic . . . well, I can\u2019t tell you that because we\u2019re all different, but I can tell you how to experience  my  autism for a day. Be hesitant to leave your house. Your house is the safest place you know. If someone unexpectedly rings your doorbell, jump into the air with a startle reaction and feel your bowels turn instantly to water. Consider disconnecting the doorbell, even though it means people would still come and knock on the door, because the sound is so grating, so loud, so terrifying that you feel adrenaline-ill long after it\u2019s been rung. Leaving your house requires preparation. Not just bathing. Not just selecting clothes. You will have to spend time talking yourself into it. Every day. Every time you go out, you have to start preparing hours ahead of time with self-pep-talks and running through possible scenarios in your head so you will be prepared for every eventuality. Because of the time and energy this costs, expect to only be able to do one major productive thing per day. If you have to spend hours talking yourself into going to class, don\u2019t expect to have any batteries left over for working on homework. If you have to spend hours talking yourself into going to the grocery, don\u2019t expect to be able to do dishes or other house work while you\u2019re prepping yourself to leave the house. Many people\u2019s to-do list is full every day. Some people are more practical and put only three or four things on their to-do list. You are only allowed one thing on your list so make it count. But it\u2019s not all bad here in my life. And it\u2019s not all restriction from functioning the way people without autism function. If you want to know today what it\u2019s like to be one, specific autistic \u2014 that is, me \u2014 I have to ask you: Have you ever spent half the day lost in the beauty of how water moves?  Have you ever thrilled to hear the whisking sound of a crow moving through the grass, the sound penetrating all the noise and chaos around you of people talking and music playing? Have you ever caused those around you to marvel because you could hear the phone and announce an incoming call before it rings? Have you ever sat on a high bluff, watching a mountain lion stalking through the rocks and sagebrush, watching the rabbits flee before her like sparks shooting out of a log popping in the campfire? Have you ever firewalked, overcoming the emotional resistance to walking on hot coals simply and easily with the logical thought that since others were doing it, you could too? Have you ever solved a Rubik\u2019s Cube in less than a minute? Have you ever heard someone recite a five minute long poem for the first time and repeated it back to them afterwards, perfectly? Have you ever played in a drum circle of more than a hundred drums, feeling the rhythm pulsing through you so strongly it replaced your own heartbeat, feeling at one with everything and perfectly attuned with the people around you with whom you could never have connected so deeply through the words and gestures of common social interactions? Perhaps you have felt or done or thought some of these things. But that does not teach you that autism is \u201cjust like everybody else.\u201d To paraphrase what author Rudy Simone says, \u201ceveryone visits sometimes; we live there.\u201d So maybe you know a little bit about what it\u2019s like to be me when you get lost driving through a strange neighborhood. But I live that topographical agnosia every day and not just in strange neighborhoods. I get lost in buildings I\u2019ve been entering for years. Catch me on a bad day and I will get lost in my own living room. No kidding: I\u2019ve stood there before, thinking, \u201cI know the people who live here\u201d as I looked at my own home, rendered foreign by a combination of exhaustion and unusual brain wiring. Maybe you know a little bit about what it\u2019s like to be me when you stub your toe. But I live that dyspraxia every day and am covered with bruises from falling down or falling against things. I have enough balance to pedal a bicycle but have to use an old step-through frame from the seventies because I can\u2019t throw one leg over a bicycle without falling down. And even if you do know a little bit about what it\u2019s like to be me with the autism and the dysgraphia (difficulty handwriting) and the prosopagnosia (can\u2019t recognize people\u2019s faces) don\u2019t make the mistake of telling me, \u201coh, just keep practicing and you\u2019ll get better at that.\u201d You have no idea how much practice I have put in. You have no idea how much study and effort I have put in. You look at me and see an unpolished normal person who just needs to work a little harder. What you don\u2019t see is the amazing victories I accomplish every day. What you don\u2019t see is the way I have risen to challenge and fought the good fight and really pulled myself up by the bootstraps. Because all the work I have put in has only suceeded in making me appear flawed in your eyes instead of disabled. I have worked so hard and accomplished so much only to be told that if I work a little harder I might measure up to mediocre. This is something you really need to understand if you want to know what it\u2019s like to be me, one autistic girl, trying desperately to find a place of safety and comfort in this world. Understand this: only 15% of us are employed. If you want to know what it\u2019s like to be autistic today, my experience is as good as any other \u2014 imagine getting a job and working hard, coming to work on time every day, learning your responsibilities quickly . . . only to be fired in a week or two because \u201cit\u2019s not working out\u201d or \u201cwe hired more people than we needed\u201d (as you see them training someone to do your job when you come to pick up your last check) or \u201cyou don\u2019t mesh well with our team\u201d or any of countless other non-answers that don\u2019t tell you what you did wrong, what you need to try to change. Have you ever slept in the park? On a loading dock, closed for the night? During the day in a restaurant bathroom stall, sitting up on the toilet and grabbing as much sleep as you can in the safest spot you can find?  Have you ever eaten out of a dumpster? Would you know which restaurant pours bleach on the food before it throws it away so that no one can eat it? Would you know which restaurant throws away a trash bag of sandwiches still in their wrappers? Have you ever picked up bottles so you could turn them in for the deposits and finally eat? Have you ever gone days without eating? Have you ever been so hungry that you waited for the delivery truck to leave bread in front of the grocery so you could steal some, all the while weeping at being reduced to crime in order to survive? These things can be as much a part of the autism experience as IEPs and mutism. These things have been part of my autistic experience. Do you still want to know what it\u2019s like to be autistic? How about this? You enter a room of people and they\u2019re having conversations and you want to join in but you can\u2019t pick the words apart so the whole room is filled with a nonsensical \u201cblah blah blah blah.\u201d Someone turns to you and starts talking and you can\u2019t understand it past the blah blah of the whole room but you\u2019re reading their lips and then halfway through what they\u2019re saying, they turn their head away or cover their mouth with their hand and you lose any point of reference. You try to respond to them anyway, but talking when you can\u2019t hear what you\u2019re saying is like pouring novocaine into your brain and you can\u2019t do it. Oh, and by the way, people are always shushing you, telling you you\u2019re talking too loudly. You can\u2019t tell, though, because sounds get all muddled together in your brain and you can never properly hear what you\u2019re saying with all the noise in the world banging at your head. You want to listen to the class lecture, but someone coughed and someone else rattled a piece of paper and someone else shuffled their feet on the floor and there\u2019s no way you can follow the professor so hopefully the textbook will have everything you need to know. You want to watch television in the waiting room but the child next to you asked his mother a question and the door keeps opening and closing and people are moving around and someone smells really strongly of some kind of cologne that doesn\u2019t smell like fragrance to you \u2014 more like having rubbing alcohol poured into your nostrils. And so you can\u2019t hear the television and feel too antsy and desirous of escape to even focus on the pictures. You want to go check your mailbox but there are people out there and you\u2019re not ready to face people with their strange demands and their unexpected questions and their judgments and mocking. So you wait until 3 am to go take out your trash and see what mail you got that day. And you savor the chill night air and the bright stars and take note of the position and phase of the moon and wish you could float up into that blue night sky and hover amidst all the beauty and escape the chaos and pain of a world you have never felt you belonged to, not even before you knew what . . . or who . . . autism is. Because you don\u2019t have autism; you are autism. It is not something laid over a normal person, it is your person. It is your brain. It is your thoughts and perceptions and desires and being. You cannot draw a circle around part of yourself and say \u201chere there is autism and everywhere else there is not autism.\u201d It is who you are and it is beautiful and painful and joyous and tragic and challenging and fascinating and real. Every day. Every minute. You still don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be autistic . . . unless you are autistic. But I\u2019m glad you stopped by today because I think you might have learned more about living with autism from briefly stepping into my life in your mind, through my words, than you would have learned in a full month of turning your computer off. Happy Autistics Speaking Day to you and thank you for caring enough to keep your computer turned on today.

{"date": "2013/01/02", "body": "I was talking with my boyfriend yesterday about autistic inertia. I was describing how it affects me and bemoaning the fact that it\u2019s so clearly a real thing that exists but I never see researchers or educators talking about it \u2014 just us autistics. We know it exists, we know it\u2019s a real thing, but it\u2019s not in the official literature and no one is researching it. After I described it a bit, my boyfriend remarked upon how similar it sounds to what people with Parkinson\u2019s experience. Upon reflection, that didn\u2019t surprise me too much since Parkinson\u2019s is linked to dopamine and I\u2019ve read autism research that talks about irregularities in dopamine and seratonin in the autistic brain. He did a little searching and found a study using Parkinson\u2019s medications on autistic people that reported little improvement. But he also remarked that if the researchers weren\u2019t specifically looking for improvement in autistic inertia, they may have missed some of the effects of the medication. I promised my boyfriend that I would send him some links to things fellow autistics have written about autistic inertia. At the same time, I realized it\u2019s been a while since I updated my blog and so I thought I would just share the information here in case it\u2019s helpful to more people than just myself and my amazing boyfriend who is always so willing to go out of his way to understand me better. (I think about how difficult it must be to have a girlfriend who is not very \u201cstandard issue\u201d and I marvel at my great good fortune to have the heart of a man with his patience and gentleness and a love so big that he has become an expert on autism just for me. His love keeps me going when everything else in my life tries to stop me.) The first thing I ever read about autistic inertia was Anna Sullivan\u2019s handout from her presentation at Autreat 2002:  Inertia: From Theory to Praxis . Sullivan talks about the different manifestations of inertia and her descriptions make it clear that inertia is not one single thing. From what I can see, there are elements of executive dysfunction, of low energy/hypotonia, and of being out of touch with one\u2019s body and emotions. And this is just the beginning, from what I can tell. One thing Sullivan doesn\u2019t mention, though, is the idea that inertia is a difficulty in \u201cchanging gears.\u201d You will see the professionals talking about \u201cgear changing\u201d issues sometimes and that\u2019s a part of inertia, although not all of it. Also, Sullivan doesn\u2019t mention that inertia in autistics is not dissimilar to Newton\u2019s inertia, in that not only do we have difficulty starting things if we\u2019re stopped but we also have difficulty in stopping things if we\u2019re started. As I told my boyfriend yesterday, when I start researching for a paper, I have a hard time stopping the research and starting the writing. So I will end up with enough research material for seven papers before I ever manage to make myself stop researching and start organizing my material and writing it out. It does mean that my papers tend to be really good since I know far more than I end up putting in writing. But it also means that it doesn\u2019t matter how early I manage to start working on a paper, I will always be scrambling to finish it at the last minute. Something very important that Sullivan points out is the unevenness of skill sets in autistics. That is, an autistic person might be able to do something easily one day but run up against severe inertia with the same task on another day. Autism isn\u2019t something constant like blindness or deafness but rather something variable, more like multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, or lupus. What we can do one day, we can\u2019t do every day. What we can\u2019t do one day, we might be able to do on another. This, in my experience, has been one of the hardest things for people around me to grasp. People seem to expect some sort of constancy and consistency in the people around them and I\u2019m just not able to provide that steady, constant level of skill and function. Some days I easily \u201cpass\u201d for non-autistic while other days I am quite obviously affected by my autism. Sullivan ends with a suggested reading list. Since the article is older, one item on the list might be supplanted with a newer book. Sullivan lists \u201cPunished by Rewards\u201d by Alfie Kohn but I might recommend also reading (or reading instead) \u201cDrive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\u201d by Daniel H. Pink. Sullivan mentions a posting from Kalen and it\u2019s really good so it should be on the to-read list as well:  Inertia: by Kalen . Kalen writes about inertia from a more Newtonian perspective, including both getting stuck within a task as well as getting stuck trying to do a task. Kalen also mentions how disabling inertia can be in a person\u2019s life. It was a relief for me to read someone else describing inertia that way because it has certainly prevented me from doing many things I really wanted to do and it\u2019s hard not to feel lazy or inadequate about one\u2019s own inertia without the proper understanding of what it really is and what it really means. Kalen describes inertia as \u201ca combination of attention shifting and motor planning difficulties\u201d which definitely resonates with my experience. There are times when I am only able to act by willing my body to perform and just as many times when I cannot get my body to perform, no matter how much will I exert. When I lose the ability to speak, I can think about the sounds that I want to create. I can think about the ways my mouth and throat and lungs move when I generate those sounds. But I cannot will my body to speak. It is as baffling to me as it is to those around me, but I can think the words \u2014 I can even type the words \u2014 but I cannot speak the words when I am in a state of \u201cspeaking inertia.\u201d Just as there are times when those around me feel I might never shut up, there are times when it seems I might never speak again. Kalen offers a few suggestions for how to work with or around inertia, warning that not all suggestions will work for all people, nor will a suggestion that works sometimes for someone work every time or in every situation for that person. ArtsieAspie writes about the idea that autistic \u201cspecial interests\u201d might actually be a form of inertia in her  blog entry on her site, Letters from Aspergia . She talks about inertia as a sort of \u201cstuckness\u201d and mentions how much more we autistics tend to get overtaken by \u201cear worms\u201d \u2014 music stuck in the head. Or movies stuck in the head. Or anything stuck in the head. I have gotten stuck on a word or phrase and ended up repeating it over and over. In my opinion, yes, \u201cstuckness\u201d is inertia, whether it\u2019s being stuck on a special interest or stuck on song lyrics or stuck in a sort of stutter-loop. Although, just as with every other aspect of autism, it is easy to assume that all troubles trace back to an autistic trait. On LiveJournal, ChaoticIdealism writes about  Autistic Inertia & Sleep  in a way that makes it clear to me that they are living with Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder and assuming it\u2019s actually a manifestation of autistic inertia. I can really relate to that since I originally thought that my own Non-24 Disorder was actually Autistic Burn-out. (That\u2019s a whole different blog entry, but you can read about autistic burnout in Amanda Baggs\u2019 excellent essay  Help! I seem to be Getting More Autistic! ) Ali/Eliot writes about inertia and perseveration as two sides of the same coin in his blog entry,  Stare Up at the Sky . He talks about how difficult it can be to make decisions \u2014 everything from big decisions like buying a new laptop to little decisions like what to eat for lunch. He talks a bit about how his partner, Kitty, does thing to make it easier for him to eat regularly and make other decisions. Andrea has a few tips on how to battle inertia in her blog entry  Coping With the Inertia of Task Paralysis . But, as a commenter points out: \u201cGreat ideas, Andrea, but how the heck am I going to remember to do all that? I have a hard enough time remembering to remember and now I\u2019m supposed to remember the reminders for remembering? Help! I\u2019m trapped in an infinite regress!\u201d I\u2019m sure there is much more out there on autistic inertia, but the above is a fair introduction to the topic. Please do discuss this in the comments! I really want to hear from anyone and everyone about inertia, whether it\u2019s personal experiences or scientific (or even pseudo-scientific) theories. This is a topic that needs to be understood much better than it is and right now we are the ones hashing the ideas out. It\u2019s up to us to figure out what\u2019s going on and what to do about it. Thanks for reading and I look forward to hearing from you all!

{"date": "2013/02/11", "body": "I don\u2019t self-identify as a self-advocate. Oh, I am a self-advocate in that I seek to fill my needs and (most of the time) am able to ask others to help me get what I need. I am a self-advocate in the sense that is usually meant when goals are set for an Autistic that include the goal of helping the Autistic person learn to navigate systems, ask for what they need, explain their autism to others, and so forth. There is nothing wrong with self-advocacy and I strive to be a self-advocate and to encourage others to do the same. But self-advocate is not my self-identity. I am an advocate. I am an activist. And so are most of the Autistics I notice being called \u2014 or calling themselves \u2014 self-advocates. I\u2019m not writing to try to tell others how to self-identify. I believe everyone should have the autonomy to self-identify as they see best and the rest of us owe them the respect of calling them what they have identified themselves to be. It is a cornerstone of human dignity to be able to say, \u201cI am this,\u201d and have others respect you as such. I will cheerfully call anyone a self-advocate who chooses to identify as a self-advocate. And I don\u2019t judge or seek to diminish those who choose that identity to describe the outreach they do. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not my identity. I do think I understand how this term came to be so widely used. Our allistic (not autistic) allies were advocating for us (the best ones were doing so by doing what Kassiane calls  \u201csignal boosting\u201d  \u2014 that is, repeating our message for those who will only hear the words if they come from someone of a different neurotype) and so they came to be called \u201cadvocates.\u201d Someone noticed that Autistic people were advocating as well and they decided there should be a special word so people knew that the words (or art, or music, or performance) were coming from an Autistic person themselves. Digging into the pre-existing autism terms, they came up with self-advocate and ran with it. The problem is the term is dismissive. It is demeaning. It is en-small-ing. It is  infantilizing . And it is wrong \u2014 we are advocates, not self-advocates, when we do and say the things we do and say to try to make the world a better place for all Autistics. That\u2019s the key there: all Autistics. We are not self-advocating; we are advocating for our entire tribe. It shouldn\u2019t even feel natural to call us self-advocates when we come forth to speak and write about how Autistics are treated, what Autistics need, what Autistics deserve. I ask you this: do all of these sentences sound natural and right to you? \n The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an important African-American self-advocate. \n When Rosa Parks refused to sit at the back of the bus, she was engaging in a bold act of self-advocacy. \n During Vietnam, Buddhist monks became self-advocates by setting themselves on fire. \n The SDS was a student-run organization of political self-advocates. \n The National Organization of Women regularly engages in self-advocacy surrounding issues of importance to women. \n Do you begin to sense why I have issues with the term \u201cself-advocate?\u201d When I started Googling to see if I could find other Autistics who were not pleased with the label \u201cself-advocate,\u201d I was not surprised to see that I am not the first person to take issue with this label. The first page I found belongs to  Corina Lynn Becker , who writes, \u201cIn my opinion, self-advocacy is asking for a glass of water. This is not what I do. I am not asking for my human rights; I am demanding them, not only for myself, but for the rest of my community.\u201d When we are called self-advocates, it is easy to ignore what we say about the current generation of children who are growing up Autistic. \u201coh, she says some very important, provocative things! But my child is different. My child will never speak or drive a car or get married. She is not talking about my child; she is a SELF-advocate.\u201d No, we adult Autistic advocate are not like your child. We are not like your child because we are not children; we are adults! You cannot automatically tell what our childhoods were like by just looking at us or hearing us or reading our writing. Calling us self-advocates is the easiest way to disregard something you don\u2019t even know. When we are called self-advocates, it underlines the  myth that we have no empathy  by positing us as activists who are only advocating for ourselves. Because how could an Autistic advocate for other Autistics? Without empathy, we must only care about our own personal situation, and especially not the lot of those we will never meet. (That, in case you didn\u2019t realize, was sarcasm.) Sure, I write about myself. I write about myself a lot. But my stories are offered up as case studies, as examples. I advocate more for other Autistics than I do for myself. When I first re-opened this blog, I wasn\u2019t sure what my focus was. Over time, my focus has become very clear to me and it is to do whatever I can to protect the children and to help them grow up strong and free with happier childhoods than I was able to have and healthier adulthoods than I have ended up with. I don\u2019t write to change my world. I doubt that much of what I write can change my world. My chance has come and gone; I write to change the children\u2019s world and to do what I can to build a better future for autism and for the Autistic. This is not self-advocacy. This is activism. Another Autistic I found writing against the idea of being called a self-advocate when one is actually reaching out in advocacy for all Autistics is Neurodivergent K.  She writes:  \u201cAllistic, enabled people are considered the default for anything and everything, so when someone like me-autistic, disabled-does something on my own behalf like every other adult in the world it\u2019s seen as so damn special and cutesy that they decide they need another word for it. A word, I may add, that implies that what I have to say is not as important as what \u201creal\u201d advocates have to say. I\u2019m just talking about myself, you see. They\u2019re doing the really real work, for we need the great allistic savior! We\u2019re cast as sidekicks in our own movement.\u201d K suggests that it is the allistic advocates who need the special term, not us Autistics. She says they can be allies or parent-advocates while we take back the word \u201cadvocate\u201d for ourselves. I agree with her. Or just call us all advocates, for that matter, because why does there even need to be a separation? If we are all doing battle to improve conditions for Autistics (and have no doubt that if we improve the world for us, it will improve for everyone. This is how it has always gone in the past when an oppressed group finally won the fight to be viewed as fully human beings) then we don\u2019t even need an \u201cus vs. them.\u201d We are all advocates. We are all activists. We are all struggling to be part of the solution.

{"date": "2015/02/22", "body": "An overwhelming stack of documents. File this post under \u201cplan for the best but prepare for the worst.\u201d And although what I\u2019m going to say can apply to Autistic adults or parents of Autistic adults, it is directed primarily at parents of Autistic children. There is something very important you need to make sure you are doing for your child and that is saving every scrap of their disability documentation. When I say we are hoping for the best, what\u00a0that mean is that your child develops and grows and at the same time our society develops and grows and when your child attains adulthood s/he has communication skills (whether spoken, sign language, typed, or whatever) and society has acceptance of those who are different and together your child and an employer recognize what your child could offer and work together to make it happen. Or your child starts their own business and makes it happen. Or someone else starts a business centered around what your child can do and together they make it happen. These are all possibilities, no matter what your child\u2019s pattern of skills and struggles ends up looking like when s/he grows up. This is the best we are all hoping for. You want your child to be sustainably employed and self-supporting. I want your child to be sustainably employed and self-supporting. This is the future we are all fighting towards and hoping for. But . . . the unemployment rates for Autistic adults are kind of grim. I\u2019ve seen everything from 70% to 85%\u00a0but nothing much lower than that. For comparison, in the worst year of the Great Depression (1933) the unemployment rate was around 25%. Autistic adults face a grim economic depression. And the pinch hits everyone. If you really want to be depressed, I can link you to lots of articles about Autistic adults with university degrees who can\u2019t find work. Adults with graduate-level university degrees who can\u2019t find work. It\u2019s really hard out there for Autistic adults.  An informal discussion four years ago with two experts, Dr. Volkmar and Dr. Wiesner , provided lots of optimism but few concrete solutions or numerical data. Everyone agrees it\u2019s difficult. Everyone agrees that things are getting better. No one seems to know how much better or how fast or what to do about it all. So here is my advice to you: save every scrap of documentation. Start today. Save what you have. Send off for copies of what you don\u2019t have. Develop an efficient filing system for your documents. Scan your documents and put them on an external drive. Put them on two external drives and store one in a safe deposit box. Open a Gmail account just for the scanned documents and mail them all to yourself in emails with search-friendly notes in them so you can find what you need easily. Store them with a \u201csmoking crater\u201d mentality \u2014 that is to say, if you returned home from the grocery store one day to find a smoking crater where your home used to be, where are your child\u2019s documents? What should you save? Every scrap. Save all their medical records. Save every teacher\u2019s comment. Save every therapist\u2019s report. Save everything that documents your child\u2019s condition. If your child is currently receiving SSI, don\u2019t assume that the verifying documents you gave to the SSA still exist. They don\u2019t. You need to save copies of every one of those documents PLUS all the social security documents surrounding your child\u2019s SSI case. If your child is not receiving SSI but is eligible, those documents will help your child get SSI. If your child grows up and is unable to work, those documents will help your child get SSI in order to help them live independently or help pay for a group home or other living arrangement. If one or both of your child\u2019s parents die, become disabled, or retire, your child is eligible for Adult Child SSDI benefits. Even if these benefits add up to the same amount as SSI, the rules are less draconian, the medical coverage is better, and there are so many reasons your child will be better provided for on SSDI than on SSI . . . but you need to have documentation to show that your child\u2019s disabling condition has been present since at least age 21. It does not matter that your child has a diagnosis for a condition that is known to be something a person is born with.\u00a0 I know so many people who have conditions that people can only have if they were born with them (not just autism)\u00a0but they still had to fight to get Adult Child benefits and provide mountains of documentation and go before a judge to prove that they had been disabled since childhood. Save every scrap of documentation because your child might need it some day in order to prove that they qualify for benefits that can make the difference between life and death for a disabled adult. If your child grows up to be\u00a0on SSI disability benefits as an adult, they might want to take advantage of the new ABLE act (Achieving a Better Life Experience) that allows a higher amount of resources to those on SSI than the standard $2000, in order to provide for certain life expenses such as housing, transportation, and education. To be eligible for ABLE, \u00a0your child will need documentation to prove that their disability began before age 26. Again, there must be documentation and the documentation must be explicit and you must expect that you and your adult child will still have to \u201cdo battle\u201d with the government to get them to accept your proof and give your child the benefits they deserve. The documentation will have to show that the condition (in this case, autism) existed before age 26 and that it was disabling to your child before that date. So plan now. Save every scrap of documentation you have. Get copies of every scrap you don\u2019t have. Archive them, store them, duplicate them, make sure they are safe because they could turn out to make the difference in your child\u2019s future between a life of comfort and needs met versus a life of struggle, crushing poverty, and possibly even an early death because of too many needs not met. Save every scrap. They are more valuable than gold. Hope for the best, but don\u2019t fail to plan for the worst. Paperwork can be overwhelming for anyone, but it is crucial that you save every scrap of your child\u2019s paperwork starting right now. Just in case. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://unstrangemind.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/copies_of_documents_at_european_parliament_in_strasbourg.jpg", "http://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/college-bound-and-living-with-autism/?_r=0"], "link": "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2015/02/22/save-every-scrap/", "title": "Save Every Scrap"},
{"date": "2013/01/27", "body": "trigger warning: stories of abuse, poverty, and discrimination \u00a0 When I meet parents of young Autistic kids, especially after they find out how much I was like their kids when I was their kids\u2019 age, many of them say \u201cI hope my kid is like you when she grows up!\u201d \u00a0 I used to say, \u201cI hope she\u2019s much better off than I am,\u201d or simply, \u201cno, you don\u2019t,\u201d but over time I learned that parents refuse to accept that answer. Maybe they think I\u2019m doing that social thing where someone compliments you and you are expected to refuse the compliment a time or two, finally accepting it but maintaining your veneer of humility. Or maybe they\u2019re just baffled. But sometimes they even got angry so I finally learned that I should answer, \u201cthank you. That\u2019s very kind of you to say.\u201d Reinforced behavior \u2014 reinforced by social censure if I dare give the wrong response. And I am exquisitely sensitive to social pressure \u2014 it was one of the biggest clues that made me reject the misdiagnosis of schizoid personality disorder the moment I was given that one. \u00a0 But the truth is that they do not want their child to turn out like me. If your Autistic child turns out like me, you have failed. Your Autistic child deserves so much better than to turn out like me. \u00a0 Oh, I know what the parents are seeing when they say that. I\u2019m not so mindblind as to not realize: they see a very articulate adult. My writing skills are excellent. My vocabulary is quite large. And, while the largest part of it is self-taught, I am extremely well-educated. I even have university degrees: two bachelor\u2019s degrees and an ABD (that\u2019s \u201call but dissertation.\u201d I dropped out of graduate school about two inches away from a doctorate.) They see that and they think, \u201cmy child is non-verbal. My child goes to school and crawls around on the floor, meowing like a cat. My child still wears diapers while all her age peers have been toilet trained. My child bites and hits people. My child bites and hits herself.\u201d And so on. \u00a0 Then they hear that I was many of those things, myself. I was kicked out of the classroom for crawling on the floor and hiding under the tables. My first grade teacher said I was \u201cmentally retarded\u201d and petitioned (successfully) to have me removed from her classroom. I would not speak. I bit people, hit people, bloodied other children\u2019s noses, hit them with sticks, kicked, and spat on people. I could not hand-write and so I did not do school-work. I wet the bed until I was fifteen years old. I set things on fire. I was a very troubled and trouble-causing child. As a teen, I was expelled from the entire county school system and my parents had to find a private school willing to take me. At sixteen, I dropped out of school altogether. \u00a0 And yet, they think, you turned out all right. I\u2019m told I\u2019m inspiring. I\u2019m told I give them hope that their kids will be okay. How dare I dash that hope by telling them that no, I do not want their children to turn out like me. Maybe they think I say that because I hope their children do not succeed? That is not the case at all. The only reason I\u2019m typing these words today is because I want your children to succeed. I want you to help them be happy, healthy adults. I want you to learn and I want you to do it better. I don\u2019t want the children of today to spend tomorrow going through the things I lived through yesterday. \u00a0 I was raped. I was abused \u2014 domestically and otherwise. I was molested. I was taken sexual advantage of. I want you to teach your children to say no and I want them to know how to mean it and back it up when they say it. I want you to teach your children to value themselves and I want you to teach them to own their bodies. \u00a0 Children like yours \u2014 children like I was \u2014 are taught to be compliant. That\u2019s what 90% of autism therapy looks like to me: compliance training. They become hungry for those words of praise, those \u201cgood girls,\u201d the M&Ms or stickers or other tokens you use to reward them. They learn quickly that when they do what you want them to do, they are a \u201cgood girl\u201d and when they try to do what they want, they are a \u201cbad girl.\u201d I was not allowed to refuse to hug the man who sexually molested me for a decade of my childhood because I might \u201churt his feelings.\u201d That\u2019s pretty major, but there were millions of minor experiences along the way, chipping off my understanding of myself as something owned by myself and not something owed to the world around me. \u00a0 Even something so seemingly simple as the constant pressure to smile. Everybody wanted me to smile. And I was told that I was such a pretty girl and ought to smile. And I was told that I was so pretty when I smiled. And it was so important to everyone that, after a while, I sat in front of the bathroom mirror practicing faces, trying to find the muscle-feeling that would make a smile. I practiced and perfected until I could make a smile on demand. I worked hard until I had a smile that made everyone happy and got them to quit bothering me. And now, when I am afraid that I am being a bad girl, when I am resisting what someone else wants, when I am feeling the pressure to be a rag doll again, to be whatever and whomever I am being asked to be, I put on that smile as a shield to protect the tiny scraps that are left inside me as I give in and give up who and what I am because the pressure to comply is so huge and so uncomfortable. And because I was never allowed to say no, never allowed to own myself, never allowed to not-want and still be a good-girl. \u00a0 You do not want your child to grow up to be like me. \u00a0 I live in crushing poverty. I live on SSI, Medicaid, and food stamps, which means that I live about 20% below the poverty threshhold. If I marry, I lose much of that and become dependent on my husband, stuck in a relationship that I can only hope stays good because I have no resources to leave. If I marry someone else on SSI, the two of us lose about 25% of our cash and resources, so I have strong incentive to live and love without the legal protections that marriage can bring. With the current political climate and the battle over same-sex marriage, I think most of us now realize what it means to not be allowed to marry. My situation is somewhat different in that I am allowed to marry but I am penalized so grievously if I do that it is not really an option for me. \u00a0 Although I am so poor, I feel wealthy and fortunate because it is such a big step up from how I used to live. I have never been able to keep a job, which means before I started getting SSI, I was unable to consistently keep a roof over my head or food to eat. I spent a lot of time sleeping in the park, in public restrooms, on loading docks. I ate at soup kitchens and out of dumpsters and off what food I could steal. I entered into sexual relationships with strangers in exchange for a place to sleep and food to eat. It\u2019s called survival sex and it was really easy for me because of my life-long training as a rag doll, compliant, always more concerned with what everyone else wants than what I want, feeling frustrated and worthless because, despite that strong urge to please I never could  actually  please anyone. So it was easy to give up my life, pitiful though it was, to someone else again and again and again in order to stay alive. My life was not worth much, but it was all I had and I clung to it. \u00a0 Survival sex means abuse. Survival sex means being asked to do shocking and disgusting things \u2014 not even all of them sexual so you probably can\u2019t even imagine the things I\u2019ve been expected to do in order to survive. Survival sex means walking across the mile of bridge once again because someone thought it was funny to drive you out of town and drop you off alone, someone thought it was easier to deal with that slut they spent the night with by leaving her far away than risk that people they know might find out they were with her. Survival sex means risking your life, every day of your life, in order to stay alive. \u00a0 You do not want your child to grow up to be like me. \u00a0 I am well and truly disabled. I thought going to university would help change that, but I developed more disabling conditions while I was in university and struggling to comply. I didn\u2019t feel worthy to ask for accommodations that might have helped me. I was brought up to believe that I have to do things the way everyone around me does them and even then I am of less value than them because almost always, they do it better than me. But I can\u2019t ask for special treatment. I have to keep pushing to do it the way everyone else does. I begged to use a typewriter for school work but I was refused. I can\u2019t have special treatment. I will learn. I will get used to the pain. I will get used to the agony. I just have to keep trying. I just have to keep pushing through. If I ask for accommodations, I am admitting weakness. I am asking for special treatment. I am getting there on an unfair advantage and it won\u2019t count. \u00a0 So I actually went through ten years of university without accommodations for my dysgraphia, my central auditory processing disorder, my vestibular hyperacusis, my dyspraxia (mild though it is), my periodic mutism, my shutdowns, my meltdowns, my hypernychthemeral syndrome, my visual migraines . . . and the depression and anxiety and agoraphobia this collection of misery brought on. Because the thing all those conditions have in common is the modifying pronoun: they are mine. They are mine and I am supposed to own them and take responsibility for them and budget my time and apply myself (because I am not \u201cliving up to my potential\u201d) and conquer them. I am not supposed to ask for help. I am not allowed to ask for help. \u00a0 You need to teach your child how and when to ask for help. It is just as important as teaching them how to say no and mean it. \u00a0 You do not want your child to grow up to be like me. \u00a0 Disability is about more than impairments or barriers to doing. Disability is about societal discrimination and barriers to being. I am not just disabled by my conditions. I am not just disabled by my difficulties in saying no and asking for help. I am disabled by the world around me and the expectations it puts on someone who looks like me (and writes like me!) and the attitudes it has about what I can do and what I cannot do. \u00a0 I face strong discrimination every day. I am treated as lesser because I live on SSI. I am frequently accused of scamming the system by people who only understand disability as impairment in mobility or visible deformity. I am told, \u201cyou look just fine to me\u201d by people who have never set foot inside a medical school. I am given unworkable \u201csolutions\u201d and told I\u2019m ungrateful and not trying if they will not work in my life. Those who don\u2019t directly say anything to me show through their behavior that they view me as lesser, they think I have given up, they think I didn\u2019t try, they think I am lazy, they think I am living off their tax dollars. Every day, I hear someone say, \u201cwhy should I have to work so hard to pay for people who won\u2019t?\u201d I live in a world that tells me every day, directly and indirectly, that I am a worthless parasite. \u00a0 If I do not talk about being Autistic, I am viewed as an inferior example of a human, one who can barely get by, a slob who can\u2019t keep her house clean, a lazy, good-for-nothing, welfare queen. If I do talk about being Autistic, sometimes I am not believed \u2014 because I can talk at all. I sometimes suspect most people don\u2019t believe in my autism because they saw  Rain Man  or they saw  Touch  or they saw  Change of Habit  or they saw  Mercury Rising  or they saw  Bless the Child  or they saw whatever godawful made-for-TV movie-of-the-week that convinced them that they know what Autistics look like and I ain\u2019t it. \u00a0 Trust me, I was just as shocked to find out I am Autistic. When I grew up, most of your kids would not have been diagnosed. They say we have an \u201cepidemic\u201d of autism, a veritable tsunami of Autistic kids. When I was a kid, a good 90% or more of your kids would not have been diagnosed with autism. They would have been like me, labelled as \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d and then treated and mistreated as mysteriously broken \u2014 often treated with \u201ctough love\u201d to try to break them out of their \u201cwillful disobedience.\u201d Everything people say about your kids today? That they are brats, that they are spoiled, that they just need a good spanking? Those things were said about me, with the exception that I didn\u2019t have the autism diagnosis or the modicum of understanding your kids have so I was spanked and tough loved and abused into who I am today. \u00a0 I am not convinced that most ABA therapy is much different from the abuse I lived through. \u00a0 I still see parents and teachers abusing children in the name of treatment. \u00a0 Too often, I see a different label \u2014 autism \u2014 but the same lack of understanding surrounding it. \u00a0 And those kids are going to grow up into a world that doesn\u2019t want them, that doesn\u2019t want to employ them, that thinks they\u2019re scamming the system if they live on government support. The vast majority of Autistic kids are going to grow up to be adult Autistics like me. Even most non-verbal kids grow up to be verbal. Most Autistic kids are not going to grow up into the sort of adults that people look at and immediately want to help. Most of your kids  will  grow up to be like me. And that is criminal. \u00a0 Adult Autistics have a staggering unemployment rate. It\u2019s around 85%. Many of us would love to work but are unable to find anyone willing to give us a chance. In most cases, it\u2019s not that we can\u2019t work or won\u2019t work. In most cases, it\u2019s that there\u2019s no one willing to accommodate our needs, including the need to be accepted as people who look, sound, and behave differently. People are uncomfortable around us. I strongly suspect that the \u201cless Autistic\u201d we look, the more uncomfortable others feel around us. If we are very visibly Autistic, we are \u201cother\u201d and that is easier to accept. Not-like-me is much easier to handle. But the more we look \u201clike everybody else,\u201d the creepier it is for others when we turn out not to be like everybody else. The higher the expectations that are layered on us, the bigger a failure we look when we\u2019re unable to live up to those expectations. \u00a0 Number one: don\u2019t focus so much energy on making us look \u201cnormal.\u201d That\u2019s a waste of time. We\u2019re not \u201cnormal\u201d and we will never be \u201cnormal.\u201d We are Autistics and we are better off when you focus your energy on helping us to be the best Autistics we can be. If we look \u201cfunny,\u201d people will learn to handle that. They will get used to that. It\u2019s more important that we feel safe, calm, happy, competent. It doesn\u2019t matter as much what we look like getting there. If we flap our hands, if we don\u2019t look people in the eye, if we communicate through typing or we speak in a monotone \u2014 it\u2019s okay. Those are not the things that matter. But I see so much focus on those things as if getting us to look right is all that\u2019s required to enact a \u201ccure.\u201d Too many people seem to think that if we look like everybody else, their job is done and we are \u201ccured.\u201d \u00a0 But the monumental effort I put forth every day to try (and fail) to look like everybody else is sapping my talents and potential. All my energy, all my intelligence, goes into looking normal. There\u2019s nothing left over to do a good job at something. When the most important thing is for me to look and sound like everybody else around me, all I have personal resources for is showing up. That\u2019s all you can get out of me. And that\u2019s not even enough for a job at McDonald\u2019s. I know. McDonald\u2019s fired me after two weeks. \u00a0 You do not want your child to grow up to be like me. \u00a0 I don\u2019t have good answers. I don\u2019t have easy answers. I don\u2019t think there are good, easy answers. But I do believe that raising your child \u2014 if your child is an Autistic \u2014 is a much bigger task than just raising your child. If you care about your child, you need to be willing to reach out past your child. I  do  understand that raising a child, any child, is huge and takes all your time and energy. But if your child is an Autistic, you owe it to your child to reach past him or her and work on building a world that will accept your child. You have a responsibility to become an activist. \u00a0 It starts with how you treat adult Autistics. Do you listen to them, or do you insult them? When they tell you how hard their lives are, do you get scared for your own child and push the adult away? Do you take their anger too personally because you are afraid you might not be raising your own child in a way that will keep them from growing up to be filled with anger? Are you afraid your child will grow up to hate you? \u00a0 If adult Autistics scare you, do something! Listen to them! Take them seriously! Don\u2019t treat them like children. Don\u2019t tell them they can\u2019t possibly understand your child because your child is different. No matter how much you wish your child were different, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re made of the same stuff as adult Autistics, yes, even the most scary adult Autistics. \u00a0 Your child is just as vulnerable to growing up abused and discarded. Your child is just as vulnerable to growing up impoverished and angry. Your child is just as vulnerable to turning out the way we adult Autistics have turned out and not just the ones that inspire you. If you want your child to be someone who inspires you, you need to stop only valuing those adult Autistics who inspire you and instead value all of us. You will never understand how to help your child become the next Temple Grandin (or whomever your favorite adult Autistic hero is) if you do not take the time to understand how your child could become the angry Autistic activist who makes you want to cover your ears and hide. \u00a0 How you treat adult Autistics \u2014 all adult Autistics \u2014 is how you are telling the world to treat your child in twenty years. \u00a0 The kind of world you are working on building for adult Autistics today is the kind of world you are leaving your Autistic child to inherit tomorrow. \u00a0 You are working hard to raise a healthy, happy kid. What are you doing to make a world that kid will be able to live in? \u00a0 You do not want your child to grow up to be like me. \u00a0 So what do you want for your child? Whatever you want, it requires a lot of work and that work has to come from you and that work starts today, right now, this minute. \u00a0 What are you going to do next?
