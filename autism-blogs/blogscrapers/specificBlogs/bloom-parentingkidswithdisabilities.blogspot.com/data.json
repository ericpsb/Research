{"date": "Tuesday, June 24, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n Remember that quote:  Last night we were at Variety Village, the sports club adapted for people with and without disabilities. Ben was riding a bike around the track at a very leisurely, almost snail-like\u00a0pace while my hubby (and I, very briefly)\u00a0ran.  I was thrilled when I saw an old school friend of Ben's coming towards us on the inner lane, walking. We were going in opposite directions as lanes on the track are designated for different activities. He's a young man with autism who uses sign language to communicate. He had head phones on and was snapping his fingers to the music. We met him a couple of weeks ago, having not seen him for about four years.  Sometimes Ben doesn't respond to greetings, particularly if he's doing something like walking or riding that requires him to\u00a0concentrate on his coordination. As the young man came nearer, he waved to Ben, and gave him the thumbs up. I was a several feet behind Ben, and I saw him balance his left wrist on the handlebar and very intentionally wave back. \"Did you see that?\" I said, turning and gesturing to my husband. We smiled and I jumped up and down, like we'd\u00a0just experienced a tremendous bit of luck. What's a little thing in your life (or perhaps in the eyes of other people) that in fact is a really big thing? \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DsYq6YW9ec8/U6l-0v1XeoI/AAAAAAAAFVk/YV4RVuxdkpY/s1600/dreamstime_s_9960440.jpg", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=6991124603860241734&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=6991124603860241734&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=6991124603860241734&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=6991124603860241734&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2014/06/the-wave.html", "title": "The wave"},

He loves dogs. In his work, Scott advocates for disability legislation to improve the lives of people with developmental disabilities. Scott has Asperger\u2019s and writes about his experiences in poems. I asked him what five things he would share with parents raising younger kids with autism. Thanks Scott! Louise \n \n \n \n \n1. Autism is not correlated with violence. I say this in the wake of the Newtown, Conn. tragedy. \n \n2. People on the autism spectrum can have a wide range of emotions and attributes. \n \n3. Not all people with autism are lonely. \n \n4. People with autism can have diverse interests in subjects and hobbies. \n \n5. Parents should try their best to find the appropriate doctor and psychologist to make their lives happier. Treat your child with warmth and kindness. Using fidget toys and sensory-integration tools can help soothe tensions in the child with autism. In addition, parents could help find friends for their child: kids who might have similar interests and who are sympathetic to the child with autism. The friend can be on the spectrum or neurotypical. I do wish I could have had more friends when I was younger.  \n \nI also\u00a0asked Scott what he had learned during his internship at The Arc. \n \n\u201cI learned that people with developmental disabilities often do not get proper public services or health care after turning 22 and formally leaving the public educational system. There needs to be universal health care (physical and mental) for people on the spectrum and they should not be denied insurance coverage.  \n \n\u201cI tend to view the autism community as a new civil rights movement similar to that of African Americans and LGBT citizens. There definitely need to be more songs about autism. Perhaps, people like Neil Young, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Peter Yarrow, Pete Seeger and Tom Waits could do songs about this subject. It would also be great if Hollywood did a movie on the life of autism activist and physician  . I saw her when I was a child in the 90s in Lexington, Mass.  \n \nBelow is one of Scott\u2019s poems: \n \n \n \nNever knowing what to say \n \nNever knowing what to do \n \nAlways looking for clues \n \nJust a normal day \n \n \nFeeling unsure  \n \nTotally perplexed with everyday life \n \nAlways on edge never certain \n \nI wish I could lift this curtain \n \nNeeding to constantly satisfy my need for information \n \nAlways online searching for new revelations \n \nGoing from site to site \n \nObtaining new insights every night \n \n \nTrying to connect with people my age \n \nAttempting to reveal my unique vision \n \nBut ending up alone and unengaged \n \nFeeling like my life needs a total revision  \n \nJust a normal day \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CquxW8MfZ8Y/UNS6ilTt9XI/AAAAAAAAD0c/TD43W_VBS9Y/s1600/548777_648597488706_1095645811_n.jpg", "http://www.autismhighereducationfoundation.org/scientificeducational-advisory-board/margaret-bauman-md/", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=284717678869632618&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=284717678869632618&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=284717678869632618&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=284717678869632618&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/12/five-things-parents-should-know-about.html", "title": "Five things parents should know about autism"},

{"date": "Monday, December 31, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI\u2019m excited to share with you an interview with Michelle Miller of Cypress, Calif. Michelle, her husband Michael, and daughter Maya welcomed Michelle\u2019s nephew Dmitri (above left) into their family in 2011 after the death of both of his parents. Michelle runs  \u2014writing books for people who knit\u2014but had no experience with children with disabilities. Dmitri, now 10, has Down syndrome and autism. Michelle\u2019s daughter Maya is 6. The family brought Dmitri from his home on a rural mountain in Virginia to a city in Orange County, Calif. in October 2011. \n \n \n \n  My brother-in-law Ric\u2014Dmitri\u2019s father\u2014was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer in 2010. In January of 2011, my sister Miriam died from pneumonia. It was totally unexpected as she was only 45, healthy and young. She had been caring for both her husband while he was sick and Dmitri. I thought it was in everyone\u2019s best interest for Dmitri to spend as much time as possible with his dad, before he died, and we did that with the help of family and some respite care. I went and lived there for three months to take care of them until Dmitri\u2019s father passed away in September. We then had to wait another month for the court to grant me legal guardianship and at the end of October we brought Dmitri back to California with us. \n \n \n \n  No I didn\u2019t. My sister and I talked two times a week for a couple of hours each time, so I knew about Dmitri\u2019s life extensively, but that\u2019s not the same as physically being there. I really hadn\u2019t had any experience with disabled children at that point. I had friends who were disabled growing up in school, but I\u2019d never been in the role of caretaker. \n \n \n \n  The night my sister passed away I knew I\u2019m the youngest and best equipped in our family to be able to care for him. But for months I worried: Would I be able to do it all and would I do it well? It was scary. \n \n \n \n  I look so much like my sister and when he came home and saw me he went upstairs and cried. It was hard for me to know it was hurting him to see me. He had a lot of behaviours at that time and he fought me at every turn. I\u2019m sure some of those behaviours were anger and grief at not having his mom around. He was doing dangerous things and didn\u2019t have any concept of danger. When I first got to Virginia it was a battle everyday just to get him dressed and I thought: How will I do this everyday for the rest of my life? It was hard. One of his respite-care workers said he viewed me as a maternal figure, and that was why he was testing me. That helped me get through it a lot. \n \n \n \n  He can nod his head yes and no, and if he doesn\u2019t want to do something he\u2019ll sit down. And that includes if he doesn\u2019t want to cross the street: he\u2019ll sit down in the middle of oncoming traffic! Because he\u2019d been through so much, if he didn\u2019t want to do something, I didn\u2019t want to make him do it. I struggled with that. That\u2019s one thing I was able to talk to his dad about and work out. His dad told me that he and his mother decided early on that Dmitri was going to have to do things he doesn\u2019t want to do because that\u2019s part of being alive. \n \n \n \n  I just tried to stay in the moment as much as possible. I definitely didn\u2019t complain. I wanted Ric to have faith that my husband and I would do a good job. My daughter wasn\u2019t in school yet so she came and stayed with us for a couple of weeks at a time.  \n \n \n \n  Learning how to get him to do the things he needs to do everyday. But I\u2019ve figured out how to motivate him. Chicken nuggets and ice cream are good motivators. He\u2019s a good boy and although he still sometimes doesn\u2019t want to do things, he\u2019s a different kid now. \n \n \n \n  He still had some behavioural issues but he seemed to feel at home right away. We changed the guest room into his room and bought him some special furniture and brought comfort items of his from Virginia. It seemed like he knew this was where he was going to be. But it took a lot longer for him to feel really comfortable. \n \n \n \n  She\u2019s amazing. When Dmitri\u2019s dad was still alive, she asked me if Dmitri was going to be her brother. She was only five at the time and I didn\u2019t know how she was able to perceive that. She\u2019s great when we go out in public. She\u2019ll tell people \u201cThis is my brother. He doesn\u2019t talk and he has autism.\u201d Dmitri\u2019s dad said Maya was the first kid he ever played with. He would let her come into his room and play with his toys. They would hang out together\u2014more side by side than play. Dmitri lived on a mountain in a very isolated area, so he hadn\u2019t had play dates and regular contact with kids. Maya\u2019s been a tremendous influence on his life and I think a lot of his gains have been through being around her. Now he has regular contact with other children. \n \n \n \n  You\u2019re trying to get me to cry, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019ve changed a lot. The strides Dmitri makes may be little in other people\u2019s eyes, but I know how hard he\u2019s working and how much he\u2019s accomplished. I embrace and value the small things a lot more. I feel so grateful for everything that I have. \n \n \n \n  He hears us talking about them a lot. My sister was a photographer and we have her photos hanging in the house. We have pictures of him and his parents together. My sister was such a big part of my life that it\u2019s something we talk about often.  \n \n \n \n  I have a background in physics and that gave me a really good ability to do research. In the months while Dmitri\u2019s dad was still alive, I found out about the agency that provides services to people in our county and I started e-mail contact with them. I talked to as many other parents of children with disabilities as I could, and I read books. There are a lot of wonderful services for disabled folks here, including the special school for children with disabilities that Dmitri attends. Many of the services are offered through our Regional Center system and often are subsidized through special programs. Right now we do respite care and will soon start\u00a0ABA therapy through Orange County. \n \n \n \n  Yes. We now have a family that we do play dates with that has a son with autism. And we\u2019ve met other families of children with disabilities.  \n \n \n \n  It\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m able to put Dmitri on the bus and able to help my daughter get ready for school, and when Dmitri gets off the bus I\u2019m there. If I need to pick either of them up from school\u2014 or take Dmitri to doctor appointments, and he has a lot of them\u2014it\u2019s not an issue. I can adjust my schedule. If the kids need something, I can put my work down. \n \n \n \n  He likes electronics and musical toys. A favourite thing of his is a bouncy ball that he\u2019s good at bouncing. He has an MP3 player with children\u2019s music that he likes. And recently he began interacting with an iPad, which really shocked me. He likes Netflix and there\u2019s a group of apps I got for him called  , for reading. I can hear him in his room right now playing the one where he has to do a sequence of events to make the turkey dance.  \n \n \n  He was amazing. He never put up any roadblocks. He came out to visit us and worked remotely. He co-parents with me. He parents Dmitri just like I do.  \n \n \n \n  I would say reach out and find out what sort of services are available in your local community and network with other parents. Many times you won\u2019t know exactly what services you can get until you speak with other parents. I talked a lot with Dmitri\u2019s respite-care workers in Virginia and every time I go into his school, his teacher and I compare notes and I observe how they interact with him. In some ways you can\u2019t prepare yourself for adopting a child who can\u2019t talk. They\u2019re sort of trapped in themselves.  \n \n \n \n  In the past three to four months he\u2019s become a pretty happy kid. He smiles a lot. He\u2019s really settled and comfortable. If he wants something like the ketchup he\u2019ll go and get it himself, which is pretty huge for him. That shows me that he feels really comfortable and confident.  \n \n \n \n  I don\u2019t think about it too much. I know it was the right choice and I\u2019m so happy we did it. Even though it\u2019s been really difficult I would do it again in a heart beat. \n \nRead more about the process of adopting Dmitri on  . \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AlzcbKJtdOY/UOHjmCTEGiI/AAAAAAAAD3E/ecG9UNbJ5vo/s1600/8244886035_a9f1121292_k.jpg", "http://shop.fickleknitter.com/", "http://www.starfall.com/", "http://www.fickleknitter.com/archives/2012/12/becoming-the-parent-of-a-disabled-child.htm", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3331167782351560403&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3331167782351560403&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3331167782351560403&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3331167782351560403&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/12/from-mountain-to-city-home-is-where.html", "title": "Mountain or city, home is where the heart is"},

{"date": "Thursday, July 26, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe had a tremendous response to our magazine interview with former Canadian Olympian   (above right), stepparent to daughter Kilee (left), 16,\u00a0who has autism.\u00a0Here is an uncut version which couldn't be squeezed in its entirety into the print issue. I know it had me thinking long and hard! Thanks Silken! Louise \n \n\u00a0 \n \n \nSilken Laumann is a former world rowing champion and one of Canada\u2019s greatest Olympians \u2013 winning two silvers and a bronze. \n \nLess well known is the fact that in 2010, at age 45, Silken became a special-needs mom. \n \nThat year she and her partner David Patchell-Evans (known as Patch), founder and CEO of GoodLife Fitness, moved in together in Victoria, B.C., each bringing two children to their new family. \n \nPatch\u2019s daughter Kilee, 16, has autism and requires round-the-clock care.  \n \nThe other children are William and Tygre, both 14, and Kate, 12.  \n \nFor Silken, an elite athlete who once believed anything could be achieved through hard work, the reality of raising a teen with disabilities came as both a shock and a revelation. We spoke about her new life. \n \n \n \n  Kilee is 16 and she\u2019s profoundly autistic. She talks but in a very limited way. She\u2019s been diagnosed as cognitively disabled and operates around the age of two or three. She has episodes where she can have some pretty impressive meltdowns. That said, Kilee is a very passionate person. She has this really happy, loving energy a lot of the time. She loves to be active like her dad \u2013 hiking and swimming. She's a downhill skier who's skied double-black diamond. She's passionate about food. And she loves the other kids.  \n \n \n \n  I had a level of comfort because I volunteered at Ronald McDonald House, and we had quite a few kids with special needs come through the houses. And as a high-profile Canadian, I had spent a fair amount of time visiting kids in hospitals, including Holland Bloorview. But I certainly didn\u2019t know much about autism and my exposure to disability wasn\u2019t deep. \n \n \n \n  It's been quite a journey, as you can imagine. The first time Kilee grabbed me by the hair, I did everything wrong. I screamed. I fought back. I cried. I'm an Olympic athlete trained to jump out of the starting gate with a heart rate of 175, and I reacted like a woman being attacked in a dark alley. It wasn't rational and I was ashamed and embarrassed afterwards. She was crying and I was crying.  \n \nIt's been an upward positive swing from there as far as me managing my emotions around Kilee's physical outbursts \u2013 which happen less and less. I'm better at respecting her boundaries and I can see the signs of her escalating. I'm much more in tune with her energy when it starts to switch, so I'm much less likely to be in a situation where she grabs my hair and starts to pull. \n \n \n \n \n \n  I don't think anything could have prepared me for it. At the time I thought I was doing okay and I thought it was going well, but in retrospect it was really hard. Kilee moved from London, Ont. to British Columbia, which, as you can imagine with autism, was very traumatic for her. Her behaviour escalated within three weeks of moving out and we had outburst after outburst. Unlike my other kids, Kilee couldn't yell and say 'I hate you.' She'd come running at me or biting her hand or jumping up and down like a two-year-old. In the beginning I was far too judgmental. I didn't always separate the behaviour from the person. I couldn't see how much she was struggling. \n \nI'd get really angry at my husband too, thinking he didn't have enough discipline around setting boundaries for Kilee. It took me a while to get it \u2013 to start to understand the complexities of the situation and the complexities of Kilee.  \n \nThis is what happens with so many special-needs children. People just see the top layer and sometimes the top layer is not the best layer. With Kilee, as time went on, I saw layer after layer after layer. And as I have learned to be more still with her and much less judgmental, I can see just how vulnerable she is, just how hard she\u2019s trying, and just how frustrated she sometimes feels. And we're learning a language together on how to express that in a more helpful way than hurting or jumping or screaming. \n \nI\u2019ve come to understand that cause-and-effect consequences don\u2019t work with Kilee. That was hard for me because I\u2019ve parented my children on natural consequences. But that doesn\u2019t work for Kilee. If she throws her lunch out the window \u2013 which she did the other day on the drive to school \u2013 you can\u2019t just not give her lunch.  \n \nWhen my other kids\u2019 behaviour stunk, I always tried to look at the antecedent, knowing it wasn\u2019t just about what was happening in the moment. But with Kilee it\u2019s so much harder to figure that out, because she\u2019s so limited with language about emotions. You have to pay so much attention. \n \nIn the beginning it felt like Patch and I were always problem-solving around Kilee and I was so afraid my kids would feel this was 'all about Kilee.' It was important for me to say there will be certain accommodations made for Kilee, but the whole family will not be centred around one person. When Patch suggested putting locks on doors I said no, there's a point for me where we're not turning this into a group home. This is a family and everyone is important. Something that really helped was hiring a caregiver in the evening hours so we could give more equal energy to the kids. \n \n \n \n  I'm a very impatient and demanding person \u2013 demanding of myself \u2013 and that trickles over to people around me. One of my lifelong journeys is to not be so impatient and to not be so definite and confident that I know what needs to be done. Because with Kilee, none of that works. In fact, what's needed is the exact opposite. \n \nWith Kilee, 90 per cent is feelings, not verbal communication. When she's vibrating high I can physically feel this big energy. And when she's going off into a dark energy, you feel it and see it in her eyes.  \n \nHaving Kilee in my life has made me slow down, and shown me how fundamental it is to focus on the positive, because positive reinforcement for Kilee is so important. I need to look at what I can do to encourage her and compliment her, even when she's acting out, because sometimes the best way to help her switch gears when she's sobbing or biting her hand is to start talking to her. I'll say: 'Oh Kilee, you're such a good girl and you have such a big heart. And we love you so much.' And I keep going at it and feeling it with her. Because I know that in that moment she's beating herself up. \n \n \n \n  My husband stills hold onto that dream that he's going to fix Kilee and she'll come out of autism, but for me it's easier because I've come into her life later. She\u2019s still learning a lot, but I don't thinks she's coming out of autism.  \n \nWhen I've got myself into trouble has been when I get in that mode of being judgmental \u2013 seeing things that other people are doing wrong or reading books and thinking I know it all. I'll get all enthused about this or that therapy \u2013 like behaviour therapy \u2013 forgetting that they've already done it with Kilee and it was a really negative experience for her and didn't work. I realize now how arrogant that was. When I've gotten on my little high horse and preached is when things have been most stressful for Patch and I and when I've had the least amount of acceptance for Kilee. \n \nSomething we\u2019re working on right now is having Kilee not pee in her bed. She gets terrible rashes. A year ago, I had it all mapped out: this is what we\u2019re going to do and this is how many nights it will take. I got an alarm system for the bed and a bit of a schedule. Then I\u2019d get frustrated and angry when she didn\u2019t make progress. Now I think: Let\u2019s not have any judgment around it and assume she\u2019s trying her best. \n \n \n \n William has always just seemed to get Kilee and could communicate with her beyond what any of us could. He would tell us what she wanted: 'Mom, she doesn't want to do that' or 'Mom, she feels like this when you say that.' It took my daughter Kate longer to relax to enjoy Kilee because at one point she had a physical fear of Kilee, which was legitimate because Kilee outweighed her about three to one. \n \nIt's funny the things they're jealous of: just the other day William went on about how Kilee has her own bathroom in her bedroom. And I said of course she has her own bathroom, she's up 20 times a night and the bathroom is the biggest blessing. But I'm the oldest, he said. I tried to go a little deeper because I thought this really isn't about the bathroom. And then he said: She's also got an iPad and I don't. So I gave him permission to feel angry, and to tell me that Kilee doesn\u2019t get in trouble for her bad behaviour, that we have to leave the room and it should be Kilee. He was angry about a whole bunch of stuff, and I need to respect that this isn\u2019t always easy for the kids. I believe though, that my kids will gain more from having Kilee in their life than they\u2019ll be hindered. I believe it makes them all better people. My biggest issue when it comes to Kilee and all the kids is safety. My number one job is to keep all my kids safe. \n \n \n \n  Where it's helped is that I'm very strong and determined. Given some of the challenges we've had \u2013 bringing not only a blended family together but bringing a family with a profoundly autistic child together \u2013 I think I have a huge capacity for energy and endurance. And a lot of that came from being an athlete. Some of it is just my character. It's helpful to have a high level of energy, to know yourself well, and to be honest with yourself. I can't imagine having a child with a really challenging disability at age 25 when you\u2019re still discovering yourself. I have a huge amount of empathy for Patch and his previous partner Tammy and what they went through in those early years. \n \n \n \n  In my days as an Olympian I think I had a na\u00efve idea that I had more control over my life than I actually had \u2013 and I was much more controlling and determined that through hard work anything could be achieved. I thought that you just keep going at it till you solve the problem. But human beings aren't like that. We don't solve our own problems that way. And that's a journey I've been on for over 20 years. \n \nI\u2019ve discovered that life is not just about achieving, it's about being present. It's not about being in control but opening up every day to the wonders that life presents to you. And that happens in your heart, not your head. \n \nWith Kilee there are still times when that Olympic athlete comes out in me and I'll say 'We're going to do this and this, and this will happen' but I know that doesn't work.  \n \nMore and more, every single day, I see Kilee for who she is. And every time we try to tell her who she is and this is what she's going to do, she feels a sense of failure.  \n \nFor example, 'You're going to learn to write your name.' Well, that may never happen for her. And as a parent of an autistic child you're riding this fine balance: you don't want to give up trying different things because there might be a piece of the puzzle that gets put together, but you want to accept your child for who they are. If you\u2019re always saying 'I'm only going to listen to you if you talk in full sentences' you can\u2019t enjoy your child. You can\u2019t see their gifts. \n \n \n \n  She\u2019s slowed us down. Patch is so high energy and so are the other kids and I. Kilee brings us all to a level of peace and slowness. We slow down for her and spend more time at home because of her and it's a good thing.  \n \nWilliam is an almost 15-year-old boy who's 6 foot 4 and I can't think of a more awkward age to have a profoundly and obviously different sister. But he introduces his friends to Kilee and answers their questions. He includes her. If they're all going out to the hot tub he'll ask her if she'd like to come. It's the same with my daughter. It's she's beading, she'll bead with Kilee. I never get the feeling that my kids spend time with Kilee because they have to.  \n \n \n \n  As a parent there's a tendency to constantly be looking forward \u2013 to when your kid finishes university or when you figure out your daughter's dyslexia. You\u2019ve always got something to look forward to. With Kilee, there\u2019s this knowledge that she\u2019s going to be in some ways a child for a long, long time. She's growing up but her needs are still very much that of a child: she needs 24-hour supervision.  \n \nIt makes me feel more patient about life. It's not about what will happen tomorrow. It's more about today and being together and enjoying. I know a lot of parents of kids with disabilities worry a lot about the future. I don't. I've taken enough risks in my life and had enough disappointments that I have this feeling very deep within me that no matter what happens with Kilee, even if her behaviour escalates, we'll have the strength to make it through. \n \nPatch is more concerned. He gets really worried about things. We\u2019re very fortunate in that we have the financial ability to provide Kilee with the support she needs for the rest of her life. That's huge and I will be very open in saying that. I know there are many parents who don't have that kind of support. Their worries are different from ours. Our worries aren't financial \u2013 they're around her happiness and safety and we have more options than a lot of families. \n \n \n \n  I think I do bring fresh eyes. I love Kilee and more and more, as time unfolds, I love her as I love my own children. But there is a difference \u2013 and most stepparents would say that, particularly in the beginning. You've had your children your whole life, you've given birth to them, seen them as babies. I didn't have that with Kilee. I didn't climb the mountains Patch climbed with her. I have an objectivity that he can\u2019t have. \n \nThe thing he does have is a sense of failure \u2013 that he didn't do enough. I think guilt is something parents have anyway, but 10 times more when you're the biological parent. You read these books and they tell you that if you do everything right you're supposed to cure your kid and take them out of autism. But most kids don't come out of autism.  \n \nAt 16 Kilee is profoundly autistic. If there's a scale, it's easy to say we failed. She's not doing as great as this kid or that kid. Patch carries a level of guilt about that. I know it's irrational and I know it's not helpful, but I get where it's coming from.  \n \nI do have a child diagnosed with ADD and dyslexia and the other with dysgraphia, but these are mild learning issues. And even then, I\u2019ve had guilt: Was I structured enough? Maybe if I\u2019d been a different kind of person they wouldn\u2019t be so affected. \n \n \n \n  We laud intellect in our culture. We applaud achievement to the detriment of everything else. And when you're talking about achievement for Olympic athletes, you have to be born with the body. I was born gifted physically and I did a lot with that gift. But I couldn't have done anything if I hadn't had the gift physically.  \n \nPeople talk about (natural) physical talent and hard work in sports, but they tend to downplay the physical talent and that's huge in Olympic athletes. \n \n \n \n  What I tell myself now is it's not my business to get into other people's heads. Last fall we were in Sidney, Victoria with Kilee. She has these plastic animals that are like comfort objects she likes to carry. We walked by this toy store and they had these really high-end animals in the window and she lunged into the store and started clearing the shelf. People are leaving the toy store and Patch and I are trying to get her out of there. We can\u2019t stop to explain and I\u2019m hoping that people get it at some level \u2013 that it's not our fault and it's not her fault. Usually we go back afterwards and explain. \n \n \n \nSilken Laumann: As mothers, it's the most challenging thing to look after ourselves. It's been drilled into our heads that we sacrifice for our kids and we give up for our kids. I say hogwash. We are human beings. We need to be constantly renewing our energy so we have the capacity to give emotionally. You can't do it if you run out of life force.  \n \nI see moms in particular who have given up everything for their special-needs kid and I get it \u2013 sometimes who else do you go to? And I don\u2019t want to give them something else to feel crappy about.  \n \nBut I think we can fool ourselves when we get into a place of seeing ourselves as indispensable and thinking that no one else can care for our child. It won\u2019t kill your kid to be misunderstood by a caregiver once in a while so that you can keep yourself sane and happy. At the end of the day, moms who aren\u2019t looking out for themselves will die younger, have health problems, a poorer quality of life and far less emotional capacity. \n \nYou have to constantly look for opportunities to take care of yourself. When I go to my son\u2019s soccer game, I\u2019ll put on my running shoes and walk around the field, and every lap I\u2019ll stop and do squat jumps and push-ups. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rO1I4IrMmU8/UBGu1o3neuI/AAAAAAAABvg/FDFqlu7DB1c/s1600/DSC_1913_1841.jpeg", "http://www.silkenlaumann.com/", "http://www.goodlifekids.com/?WT.mc=GLKF-GoogleGrant", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=8759214586223464230&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=8759214586223464230&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=8759214586223464230&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=8759214586223464230&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/07/life-is-not-just-about-achieving.html", "title": "'Life is not just about achieving'"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 13, 2012", "body": "\n \n\ufeff \n\ufeffSometimes I despair at our culture's narrow sense of what makes a person 'matter' or, as Tracey Chapman sang in\u00a0 \u00a0-- what allows a person to \"be someone, be someone.\"  \n \nAre you your paycheque, your test scores, how well your body fits Western conceptions of beauty or athleticism or any other of a number of skills and attributes? \n \nIf you can't\u00a0measure up\u00a0(cause you're an infant or a senior or past your prime as an athlete or severely depressed or unemployed or disabled or terminally ill) does your value as a human being plummet? \n \nThis piece in the Huffington Post by my friend Ellen at   got me thinking:  \n \nEllen wrote about an acquaintance\u00a0who has a son with Asperger's who made the following comment: \n \n\"If there are 10 kids with mild autism and one with profound autism, the money should go toward helping the 10 kids because they would be 'better candidates' for contributing to society.\" \n \nI guess a similar argument could be made for educating only students with gifted IQs, since their brains can potentially plow back more into society than those of their average peers. \n \nBut\u00a0abandoning that\u00a0child with profound autism and his or her family will result in greater costs to society over time. \n \nAs Dr. Chris Feudtner, director of the department of medical ethics at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, noted in a  : \u201cIs medicine a one-on-one proposition or do we look at it from a societal perspective that includes people connected to the patient? If we cut respite care and a parent has to stay at home, do we count their lost wages as costs? If my child\u2019s quality of life growing up makes me happier, do we count that? What are the ancillary benefits of having a child do better? There are instruments to measure family stress and depression. If a family receives social services, does their level of anxiety and depression drop?\" \n \nIn the past religion kept alive the idea that every human life was sacred and had a fixed, immutable value. But since so many people have fallen away from religion, our worth has become variable and tied to what we do. That means that for all of us -- not just those with disabilities -- our value will rise and fall like a yoyo over our lifetime. \n \nThat is if we are allowed to live. \n \nA bioethicist and philosopher in a   attribute the right to life only to individuals who can appreciate their existence and have \u2018aims\u2019 or dreams for the future, so that depriving the person of that life would be experienced as a loss. If individuals can\u2019t value their life and plan for the future, because their brains are in the newborn state, or because they have a disability, the philosophers categorize them as non-persons who would not be harmed if killed.\u00a0\u201cMerely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life,\u201d is how they so eloquently put it. \n \nBecause of the idea that a disability reduces a person, creating acceptance for people with disabilities often seems to involve insisting that people with disabilities are \"the same\" as everyone else -- instead of broadening our concept of human diversity. \n \nIt reminds me of parents who\u00a0proclaim: \"My child doesn't see colour, my child doesn't see race.\" Well we know that's patently untrue. But it's possible that children haven't yet adopted the stereotypes associated with skin colour. \n \nIn the same way, children see physical, intellectual, communication or social differences, but don't necessarily ascribe something negative to them. \n \nAt Noah's Dad, I felt uneasy when I read a blog recently titled  . Rather than expanding our understanding of intelligence from that of book intelligence and IQ, it seemed that the authors were trying to convince readers that their son has the same problem-solving abilities as his peers. And maybe he does. But what about the child with Down syndrome who doesn't? Is that child in any way less valuable? \n \nEllen says in her   that her son Max, 9, with cerebral palsy, is \"as worthy as President Obama, Bill Gates\" and a list of other modern-day successes.  \n \nI agree, but not because of his abilities and potential, as she suggests, when she says: \"Who knows what Max is capable of?\" \n \nTo me, that way of thinking is a trap -- applying\u00a0the old measures of success to our kids and saying they're\u00a0going to stack up against the best of them.  \n \nI think we need to develop a new value system that sees human worth\u00a0as a birthright -- as something that\u00a0can't be\u00a0elevated or marred\u00a0by ability level\u00a0or what we do at any moment in life. \n \nEllen eludes to this when she says \"My son has made a difference in this world and will continue to do so,  .\" \n \nIn our culture, normal is valued and different isn't. As parents of children with disabilities, it's\u00a0understandable\u00a0that we'd\u00a0feel intense pressure to prove to the rest of the world that our children are, indeed, normal. \n \nI know I did this when Ben was younger.  \n \nI felt positively gleeful when the psychologist told us he was in the low-average range on his first psych test. When a preschool teacher doing a developmental assessment said he was normal cognitively, I sent out letters about it to family. I had all manner of explanations for why he couldn't do what his typical peers were doing, but was, in fact,\u00a0brilliant. But really, I just wanted him to be valued and accepted, to belong in the world. \n \nIsn't that, bottom line, what most people are searching for in life? \n \nI still want that, now that Ben's 18 and it's obvious that he'll never 'catch up' or 'pass' as a person without disabilities.  \n \nBut to see Ben's\u00a0gifts\u00a0requires breaking out\u00a0of conventional\u00a0notions of normalcy, worth and success. \n \nI'm not sure why philosophers\u00a0chose cognition as the quality that defines us as human -- thus stripping people with intellectual disabilities of personhood. In this thinking, the higher your IQ, the more human you are. I guess this explains the\u00a0  described recently in the New York Times: a growing number of high-school students who abuse stimulant drugs like Adderall in a bid to get straight As and high SAT scores. \n \nWhy didn't the philosophers, instead,\u00a0choose the universal desire to belong with others as what makes us human?  \n \nDon't you feel that longing every time you hear\u00a0these words in Chapman's  ?\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhy didn't the philosophers choose compassion, love\u00a0and interdependence as the defining qualities of humanity? \n \nI recently listened to a radio\u00a0interview with Jean Vanier, the philosopher and theologian who founded  . L'Arche runs homes for adults with intellectual disabilities who live with assistants who ascribe to\u00a0the\u00a0philosophy that we can learn about ourselves by living with people with disabilities. \n \n\"I think this is the big challenge for humanity,\" Vanier said. \"Can we get together? Can we let the barriers that separate people fall down? If we can move from the place of fear and the place of prejudice and compulsions, just to welcome people, to learn to accept people as they are and to see how beautiful they are.\" \n \nIn talking about a L'Arche resident who was violent, Vanier\u00a0names the fear within all of us that's awakened by people who are outwardly different. \"He triggered in myself my own fragility, my own weaknesses, my own anguish. I could see coming up in myself capacities for violence.\" \n \nPerhaps that's why people in our culture don't want to \"see\" disability -- or\u00a0death, for that matter --\u00a0because it forces them to recognize their own vulnerability. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WV-kKL8veSs/T9ipWbSebGI/AAAAAAAABa8/v8-NGJD6MCE/s1600/colour.jpg", "http://www.lovethatmax.com/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellen-seidman/are-kids-with-special-needs-really-burden-to-society_b_1574351.html?ref=parents", "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2011/12/costs-quality-of-life-assumptions-put.html", "http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full.pdf+html", "http://noahsdad.com/intelligence-indicator-down-syndrome/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellen-seidman/are-kids-with-special-needs-really-burden-to-society_b_1574351.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/education/seeking-academic-edge-teenagers-abuse-stimulants.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all", "http://www.larche.ca/en/larche", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=2491916478810265666&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=2491916478810265666&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=2491916478810265666&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=2491916478810265666&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/06/whos-burden-who-deserves-help.html", "title": "Who's a burden?

{"date": "Wednesday, August 15, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYesterday my blogging friend   had a piece published in Mamalode called  . It\u2019s a candid piece about looking out the window while feeding her daughter Moxie, who has Down syndrome, to see a group of children with special needs walk by. In that moment Meriah is overcome with fear that Moxie will one day be part of that group. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m heart-stoppingly scared that Moxie will be like those kids,\u201d she writes. And at the same time: \u201cI\u2019m deeply ashamed of that fear.\u201d \n \nMeriah\u2019s young son asks his mother, who is now crying, if it\u2019s because of a monster. \n \n\u201cI started to say no, but then I realized I was \u2013 monsters, after all, were invading my brain. So I nodded yes. \u2018Be not scared of monsters, Mama.\u2019 The boy responds. \u2018You should not be scared of monsters.\u2019\u201d  \n \nI imagined that the monsters in Meriah's mind were stereotypes\u00a0about people with disabilities she would have learned as a child. We all pick up cultural values about what is good and what is bad, who is accepted and who is not, without even being aware of it and those biases live in our memory, often at an unconscious level.  \n \nThe monsters Meriah feared, I think, were\u00a0depictions of\u00a0people with disabilities\u00a0as less than human, somehow lacking, worthless, and so to be feared, as if\u00a0human indignity could be caught like a flu bug. And Meriah wanted to protect her precious daughter \u2013 and herself \u2013 from that emotional sting. \n \nThoughts can pop into our minds that don\u2019t reflect our current way of seeing things. Instead, they are the regurgitation of culturally dominant fears and biases we grew up with. These storylines may\u00a0surprise us because we weren't even aware we were carrying them.\u00a0And when they rear their ugly\u00a0heads they can\u00a0feel real and threatening. \n \nI think that's\u00a0what happened in Meriah's story.  \n \nIt\u2019s not pleasant when this mental \"stirring up\" happens, but I\u2019m glad it does, because unexamined, these ideas, embedded in our subconscious, can impact how we act. \n \nWhich leads me to  , a piece by Dr. Fredric Neuman published in Psychology Today earlier this month. Oddly, this commentary is published under the header   and yet it is a doctor\u2019s account of his own inability to see a child with serious malformations as human, and the fear this engendered in him and his coworkers. Dr. Neuman, we are told, is now an expert in anxiety disorders. \n \nOver 50 years ago, Dr. Neuman was an intern at a Catholic hospital where a child was born with severe malformations. \u201cIt had a single fused eye in the middle of its forehead,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe irises pointed to the sides. There seemed to be four lids surrounding the eye like a box. It was blind, of course. A large part of the brain and head were missing. There was no nose\u2026The baby\u2019s esophagus and trachea had not separated, so that feeding the child was impossible\u2026Also, the child had extra fingers.\u201d \n \nDr. Neuman describes the child as \u201cunworldly,\u201d \u201calien\u201d and not looking like a human being. He says the obstetrician who delivered the baby called it a \u201cmonster\u201d \u2013 a medical term,\u00a0Dr. Neuman\u00a0says,\u00a0for a grossly misshapen baby.  \n \nThe obstetrician told the parents the baby had died, to protect them, we learn, and Dr. Neuman feels this was the ethical thing to do. Further, the baby was left to die, unfed, and this caused great anxiety on the unit because the baby did not die quickly. \u201cBecause it did not look like a human being, most of the time no one was disturbed by it\u2026\u201d\u00a0Dr. Neuman\u00a0writes. Until it cried. \u201cThen it sounded like any other baby. It was hungry, and it could not be fed. Picking it up would not stop the crying.\u201d \n \nDr. Neuman is asked by a resident to remove the child\u2019s extra fingers for no medical reason but as a \u201clearning experience.\u201d But when Dr. Neuman ties a ligature around the baby\u2019s finger and pulls tightly, it screams. \u201cThe kid was in pain,\u201d he writes. \u201cI should have realized that, but somehow I did not. It was because the baby did not really look like a baby...\u201d He puts the baby down and retreats. \n \nThe rest of the article details his overwhelming urge to smother the baby because it\u2019s causing such angst among staff on the ward. He says that another obstetrician might have smothered the baby before anyone had a chance to see it. \u201cSuch things happen,\u201d he tells us. The baby ends up dying before Dr. Neuman has a chance to see if he has the nerve to put his hand over its mouth. And all these years later he says: \u201cI still think now, that the right thing to do would have been to kill that baby. It wasn\u2019t really a baby; it just sounded like a baby\u2026\u201d \n \nWhen you think of the hate crime that has been perpetrated against people who are different \u2013 who are disabled, gay, the wrong race or religion, poor \u2013 doesn\u2019t the rationale usually come down to some version of: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a (human)?\u201d Throughout Dr. Neuman\u2019s piece, we never learn whether the baby was a girl or a boy because he refers to it only as \u201cit.\u201d \n \nThat baby deserved to be held by its parents, the people most invested in its life, to be treated with respect and to not suffer pain. \n \nIn another case that reflects societal attitudes about the worth of people with disabilities, a man with autism is being denied a heart transplant in Pennsylvania:  ?  \n \nIt's a complicated case, but it's not hard to see\u00a0how cultural values and physician attitudes about what constitutes quality of life trickle down into these decisions. \n \nAn interesting\u00a0 \u00a0crossed my desk about 94 obstetrical and pediatric professionals in a\u00a0hospital in France who were surveyed about euthanasia. All indicated they would agree to have their own newborn child's life actively terminated through euthanasia for conditions including Down syndrome, intellectual disability or lack of one arm or leg, among other disabilities. One doctor wrote on the survey: \"no handicap\u00e9s are allowed.\" \n \nAnd here, a mother writes about learning her teenager with autism was beaten up by a non-disabled peer on the job \u2013 at the Department of Disability Services of all places, in the District of Columbia:  . \n \nAnd that headline sums it up beautifully: Let's open our eyes. \n \nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the monsters that lurk in the recesses of our thinking \u2013 the cultural relics of fear and stigma and hate\u00a0that none of us\u00a0is immune to. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fDurHczKMJc/UCvZWRbGuEI/AAAAAAAAB-U/MXYfBbLCyTE/s1600/IMG_0468.JPG", "http://www.withalittlemoxie.com/", "http://www.mamalode.com/blog/2012/08/07/be-not-scared/", "http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fighting-fear/201207/the-cyclops-child", "http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-14/news/33201606_1_susan-brozena-transplant-evaluation-heart-transplant", "http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.bnds.fr/revue/rgdm/rgdm-20/dans-quelles-situations-decider-d-un-arret-de-vie-en-reanimation-neonatale-enquete-par-questionnaire-aupres-du-personnel-d-un-chu-2685.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3Ddans%2Bquelles%2Bsituations%2Bdecider%2Bd%2527un%2Barret%2Bde%2Bvie%2Ben%2Breanimation%2Bneonatale%253F%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D936%26bih%3D556%26prmd%3Dimvns&sa=X&ei=9-MrUL6cAe3iyAG2xYCwBg&ved=0CGQQ7gEwAQhttp://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.bnds.fr/revue/rgdm/rgdm-20/dans-quelles-situations-decider-d-un-arret-de-vie-en-reanimation-neonatale-enquete-par-questionnaire-aupres-du-personnel-d-un-chu-2685.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3Ddans%2Bquelles%2Bsituations%2Bdecider%2Bd%2527un%2Barret%2Bde%2Bvie%2Ben%2Breanimation%2Bneonatale%253F%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D936%26bih%3D556%26prmd%3Dimvns&sa=X&ei=9-MrUL6cAe3iyAG2xYCwBg&ved=0CGQQ7gEwAQ", "http://www.autismafter16.com/article/08-13-2012/eyes-wide-open", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3307618812295951743&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3307618812295951743&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3307618812295951743&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3307618812295951743&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/08/the-monsters-in-us.html", "title": "The monsters in us"},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI read this article in Nature yesterday:  . \n \nThe story describes the search for unidentified gene mutations that may cause unexplained forms of intellectual disability.  \n \nThis scientific \u2018hunt' around the world is made to sound very exciting, but the reasons for undertaking it\u00a0\u2014 the potential benefits and outcomes for real people that justify the enormous investment\u00a0\u2014 are a bit murky. \n \nThe article notes that in most cases identifying the mutations won't translate into treatment or cures. \n \nHowever, a scientist quoted says a specific genetic\u00a0diagnosis is important to parents who haven\u2019t known the \u2018why\u2019 of their child\u2019s intellectual disability for years. \n \nFor those of you who have a child with intellectual disability\u00a0\u2014 or physical disability for that matter\u00a0\u2014 is that true? How does knowing that my child\u2019s disability results from a mutation in gene x or gene y enable me to improve the life of my child in the here and now? How does parroting an exotic-sounding mutation or rearrangement change one iota the quality of my child\u2019s life\u00a0\u2014 or of the public\u2019s understanding and acceptance of him?  \n \nWhen Ben was three days old, our pediatrician\u00a0told us\u00a0that knowing the genetic basis of a particular syndrome, when rare, didn\u2019t often offer up any practical knowledge about interventions that could benefit the child or family. Not enough people had these syndromes to entice drug and other companies to research related treatments. \n \nIn our case, having a diagnosis for Ben's rare genetic condition did help me\u00a0find other families on international genetic bulletin boards who had valuable practical information to share. But I don't think that's what these scientists are after. \n \nKnowing the genetic 'why' didn't help me feel better or help me better support my child\u00a0\u2014 in\u00a0and of itself. \n \nThe Nature article refers to intellectual disability as a disease, but I don\u2019t see it that way. I see it as a different way of experiencing life that is marginalized by mainstream society\u00a0\u2014 in the same way that being gay, being a woman, being black, or being old\u00a0have been stigmatized. \n \nMy son\u2019s intellectual disability does not make him ill. It makes it harder for him to learn in conventional ways. I would never romanticize it, but I would not say it is without advantages. For example, my son is not capable of the deception of \u2018image\u2019 that blocks most people with average or Einstein intelligence\u00a0from truly knowing each other. \n \nEarlier this month I read  about Autism Awareness Day in Neurotribes, a blog by investigative and science reporter Steve Silberman. \n \nSilberman questions how dollars are allocated in autism research, noting most go into the \u2018hunt\u2019 for a genetic or environmental cause and cure \u2014 not to improving the lives of millions of adults living with autism. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI think that should be the starting point for investment in research for all types of disability, including intellectual disability: How will this research benefit the lives of people living with these conditions today? Unfortunately, improving the lives of people who are devalued in our culture is a much messier and complicated\u00a0undertaking than a tracking a gene change in a lab. \n \nYes, we have to look to the future. But there needs to be a balance between research that has the potential to benefit people decades from now\u00a0  and when we're talking rare disorders, it's hard to imagine there being a market to drive that kind of research, ever\u00a0  and research that\u00a0makes a difference to people today. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xYAzrc1ljYk/T47mDUyVIHI/AAAAAAAABIs/p8qlfQJjWiY/s1600/DNA+strands.jpg", "http://www.nature.com/news/gene-hunt-is-on-for-mental-disability-1.10463", "http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2012/04/02/autism-awareness-is-not-enough-heres-how-to-change-the-world/", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=1557517221371801087&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=1557517221371801087&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=1557517221371801087&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=1557517221371801087&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/04/research-magic-bullet-or-better-life.html", "title": "A magic bullet or a better life?"},

The average child born to a 20-year-old father had 25 mutations linked to the father. This increased by two mutations a year to reach 65 for children of 40-year-old men. The mother\u2019s age had no impact on risk. \n \n\u201cLots of random genetic changes happen with age and the majority mean zip,\u201d Evdokia said. \u201cIt\u2019s the rare ones that lead to syndromes like autism.\u201d  \n \nHowever, the more mutations a child has, the more likely he or she is, by chance, to have one of the rarer, disabling ones. \n \nThe study is important because it helps explain the biology of autism, which may aid in treatment. \u201cIf we understand the pathways from genes we discover we know where to focus our efforts.\u201d \n \nEvdokia emphasized that autism is \u201ca multi-factorial disease that can\u2019t be prevented at this point. Paternal age can now be seen as one of many contributors to risk \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t explain the majority of risk. \n \n\u201cThere are many, many reasons why you may end up with a child with autism and if the father is older the child gets this extra little hit. But most of the time a child needs to have many hits to get autism.\u201d \n \nOther factors that increase risk\u00a0include a father's genetic makeup, such as having a sibling with autism; the fetal environment, including infections during pregnancy and exposure to fertility drugs; and possibly some environmental toxins.  \n \n\u201cSome kids will have enough of a genetic hit to cause autism and some will have a genetic risk that interacts with one or more environmental factors.\u201d \n \nEvdokia said that the study is helpful in explaining the increase in autism rates in a huge population \u2013 but doesn't identify father's age as a major risk factor in individual cases.  \n \n\u201cIf someone asks me \u2018Do you think I should not have a baby because I\u2019m 40?\u2019 I would say you absolutely should have a baby. The majority of babies born to 40-year-olds are perfectly healthy.\u201d \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ez0tZZXFc8c/UGHSCVnQ3rI/AAAAAAAAClE/hilUp725BQI/s1600/dreamstime_xs_10446669.jpg", "http://www.nature.com/news/fathers-bequeath-more-mutations-as-they-age-1.11247", "http://www.nature.com/news/fathers-bequeath-more-mutations-as-they-age-1.11247", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=1785015164446342331&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=1785015164446342331&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=1785015164446342331&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=1785015164446342331&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/09/fathers-age-linked-to-autism-risk-but.html", "title": "Dad's age a small risk factor in autism"},

{"date": "Wednesday, February 1, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nMedia reports about changes to the definition of autism have led to fears that some children would no longer meet criteria to get services.  \n \nAn expert panel of the American Psychiatric Association is proposing a change as it prepares the fifth edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) \u2013 the first major revision in 17 years. \n \nI interviewed Dr. Jessica Brian, a clinician-investigator in the Autism Research Centre at Holland Bloorview, to learn more. \n \n \n \n  The proposed changes are to have a single term \u2013 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) \u2013 that includes children who would previously have fallen into one of three categories: autism, pervasive developmental disorder \u2013 not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), or Asperger syndrome. They\u2019re also talking about collapsing the idea of social deficits and communication deficits, since there are so many overlaps between the two. There will not be a single category for social deficits and a single category for communication deficits but one category called social communication. In that category you have to meet criteria on all of the items but the items are extremely broad and inclusive. \n \n \n \n  Not really. Currently there isn\u2019t evidence to support this distinction between three sub-categories. Most of the research out there doesn\u2019t find differences in terms of genetic susceptibility \u2013 so the three sub-categories seem to have the same genetic basis. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll find a family where one child has Asperger\u2019s and one child has autism. And prediction of outcome isn\u2019t supported by the three distinctions. When we follow kids in research we find they typically stay within the spectrum, but they move up or down in terms of whether they meet the full criteria for autism or the fewer criteria for PDD-NOS. We don\u2019t think of them as separate disorders, but as different intensities across a continuum. In my clinical work, the distinctions between the sub-categories can also be confusing for families. \n \n \n \n  If you have a room full of autism experts seeing one child, they will usually agree that the child fits somewhere on the autism spectrum but there will not be good agreement about which sub-category. It is challenging to identify exactly where a child sits on the autism spectrum and that\u2019s what\u2019s prompted these recommendations.  \n \n \n \n  We think one definition could expedite the assessment process, because we won\u2019t fuss about whether the child has PDD or autism, we just know they have ASD and we can move them into services more quickly. \n \n \n \n  In Canada it\u2019s extremely unlikely that kids with existing diagnoses would ever be re-diagnosed unless parents specifically want it and seek private assessments. There aren\u2019t the resources in the public system to re-diagnose these kids. So the fear of losing services is unwarranted, at least in Canada. I know people in the U.S. are worried about losing insured services but I have to ask the same question: Who is going to reassess all of these kids? \n \n \n \n  That\u2019s just one piece of preliminary evidence that hasn\u2019t been published yet. A study published in January found that 12 percent of higher-functioning individuals might be missed by the new criteria, but if only one criterion was removed, almost all kids would be included. It\u2019s important to note that we have to find ways to provide necessary services to kids who have needs even if they don\u2019t meet full criteria for a diagnosis. Some kids will still need communication or social or behavioural supports even if they don\u2019t get a diagnosis of ASD. We need to keep this in mind and keep pushing for needs-based access to services. \n \n \n \n  Yes, we can say that they will most likely stay on the autism spectrum, but developmental changes are very possible.  \n \n \n \n  According to the proposed changes, the term Asperger won\u2019t be used in the DSM. But I suspect there will be a strong group of people with Asperger\u2019s who self-identify that way and I would expect that that term will remain alive among individuals who have those characteristics. There is a culture of Asperger\u2019s that we won\u2019t lose anytime soon. It\u2019s a badge of honour, a characteristic many people are proud of. \n \n \n \n  We\u2019ve been using the term ASD for many years even though it\u2019s not in the DSM4.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  How are the boys affected in everyday life? \n \n  They\u2019re fully functional in terms of changing, toileting and eating, but they can\u2019t be left to their own devices for any length of time. Kenneth is somewhat verbal but Cameron has very little vocabulary. \n \n  What emotions did you experience when you learned Cameron also had autism? \n \n  I still remember the exact moment when I realized there was a bloody good chance that Cameron had autism. I went to pick him up at daycare \u2013 he was less than two \u2013 and all the kids were gathered in a circle having some sort of reading or social activity and Cameron was on the other side of the room playing Lego. I remember saying: \u201cUh oh.\u201d I knew from Kenneth so well that if Cameron was indifferent to what the other children were doing that wasn\u2019t good. In some ways, because I expected it, it wasn\u2019t as difficult. But in some ways I was more devastated because with Cameron being my second child, I knew what autism was. The writing was on the wall. There was no asking \u201cwhat does this mean?\u201d or relying on someone else to tell me what was involved. I think my wife Nellie and I were both equally devastated, in our own ways. \n \n  What practical challenges do you face? \n \n  It\u2019s one thing to restructure your life to meet one set of special needs, but it\u2019s more complicated to restructure life to meet the needs of two children\u00a0who are quite different, even though they have the same diagnosis. For example, we can leave Kenneth alone for short periods of time in the house if he knows where we\u2019re going and that we\u2019ll be back soon. But we can\u2019t leave Cameron by himself for even five minutes, because he\u2019s much more mischievous and could get up to something. Kenneth likes going to sports events and we\u2019d like to go as a family, but Cameron can\u2019t stand huge auditoriums. On weekends, when most families go out as a group, we often split up. I take one of the boys somewhere and Nellie takes\u00a0the other. \n \n  Are there other issues? \n \n  What the future holds is a big concern. I\u2019m a man in my mid 40s and I have two kids who can\u2019t take care of themselves. We have real concerns about down the road when my wife and I can\u2019t care for our kids anymore. \n \n  What strategies enable you to manage? \n \n  Good support is absolutely essential. You can\u2019t do this alone. My wife is a stay-at-home mom and we have a selection of caregivers we call on an ad-hoc basis. In the summer we have a caregiver for each boy for several hours each day, so that each can do the things they enjoy doing. There are resources out there and you have to investigate them. Some may be a waste of time but others are immensely valuable. As tough as it\u2019s been, we couldn\u2019t have done this without support and assistance. The other thing is you shouldn\u2019t hide yourself away because of your children. You need to be out there exposing your children as much as possible to the real world. You don\u2019t want to find yourself in a situation where you\u2019re cut off in your house and it\u2019s just you and your child with a disability. You want to keep visible and active. \n \n  How do you relieve stress? \n \n  My wife will head out for a few hours to get away and I have time to myself at work and go to the gym four times a week. I find that refreshing and it helps clear your mind. The reality is we\u2019ve been dealing with this since 1997 so while it\u2019s stressful, it\u2019s almost our lifestyle now. \n \n  What have you learned? \n \n  I like to think I get less stressed about things that aren\u2019t important. I\u2019m more easy-going. I have no desire to have a job where I work 80 hours a week. Seven years ago I switched from being a lawyer working long hours in private practice to doing legal work for an insurance company. That gives me the flexibility to be home by 5:15 and spend time with my kids. One positive thing about kids with autism is that they maintain an innocence to them which makes them enjoyable to be around \u2013 even when they\u2019re older. If my sons didn\u2019t have autism at age 17 and 14 they\u2019d want nothing to do with me. They\u2019d be hanging out with friends. But my kids like to be around me. Notwithstanding all these other issues, in some ways we\u00a0have a stronger family unit. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hQpSsrlTleA/TVwq3SXx9yI/AAAAAAAAApw/PmglAoBQnx4/s1600/2010-07-28-117.jpg", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3242398053759674900&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3242398053759674900&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3242398053759674900&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3242398053759674900&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2011/02/in-some-ways-we-have-stronger-family.html", "title": "'In some ways we have a stronger family unit'"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 7, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn a recent weekend, I watched the 1980s sci-fi thriller War Games with my family. This was a movie I'd never seen, but one that we five could all agree on. My family of software engineer husband Ned and three sons has so many variables it's a strange common denominator indeed that links us together: geeky, high-tech action movies with a hint of relationships to satisfy the mom.  \n \nOur weekends go something like this: My severely autistic son Nat comes home from his residential school, and I, of course, am happy to see him. I kiss his rough oily face and marvel at his size and presence. He stomps and stomps around \u2013 one of his autism-related calming behaviors \u2013 and it's all very endearing, even to the point of calling it \"Joyful House Stompies.\" \n \nOn this particular weekend, like most, I noticed a day later that the House Stompies were not so Joyful. They were just loud. (Nat is 21 and though developmentally delayed, physically he is right on time.) Nat was everywhere: running up the back stairs, to the third floor, down, then down the front staircase and into the kitchen (we live in a quirky, creaky Victorian that matches our family\u2019s personality). In the kitchen, Nat took a look at what I was\u00a0doing\u00a0\u2013 or not doing, as the case may be, because I'm always disorganized in Nat's eyes, when it comes to making meals. He then made a quick sojourn into the livingroom, to see what the rest were doing. As Nat thrives on routines which give organization to his otherwise chaotic inner world, I knew that I\u2019d better come up with some structured activities immediately, or Nat would escalate.  \n \nBut, on the weekends, we have our own inner lives, our own desires\u00a0\u2013 Nat included\u00a0\u2013 and orderly plans don't always pan out. Ned decided to take Nat on a walk to the coffee shop to pick up a pound of our favorite beans. Problem was, Ned was suddenly called to help a friend out with something. But he had already told Nat to get ready. I had gotten all psyched to have a quiet house for an hour but now suddenly we were already on Defcon 3 \u2013 a term I had learned about from having just watched War Games. Defcon 3 is the level at which Nat already has on his shoes. 'Shoes on' is the final part of the routine before going outside. If we are not ready when he is, Defcon 3 can blow up: 'Houston, we have a problem.' \n \nI could see Nat was escalating. I heard, \"Take walk, take walk,\" increasingly higher in pitch, the stomping even harder (loose old house ceiling fixtures clinking).  \n \nBut no. I didn\u2019t give in to it. You see, I have learned, in all these tiring years of being Nat\u2019s mom, that our neurons can be retrained. And so I thought to myself: You know what to do. \n \n\"Come on Nat,\" I said. He followed me upstairs. \u201cCome sit with me,\" I said, sitting on my bed. He sat.  \n \nNot a time-out. Just the two of us sitting in a peaceful place. The sun through the lace curtain was soft, etching filigreed gray shadows on the white bedspread. Quiet air lay heavily, reassuringly on our shoulders and against our ears. Nat began sucking his thumb, a good sign. The loud chirps rocketed me back in time, to 1990, to another room, the same bed, my beautiful golden baby next to me, refusing to nap. Oh Nat, I thought. We are still the same. We are still you and me.  \n \n\"Let's just wait a little bit,\u201d I said softly. \u201cDaddy is almost done talking on the phone. He will come. You will go on your walk. I promise.\" \n \nNat exhaled deeply. He had heard me. Not Defcon 3 at all. He\u2019s just my son, after all. My peace was his peace. And so we just sat together. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pv1hAjvc4iI/TZ4E5F87liI/AAAAAAAAAsI/HpnfvBVz4G4/s1600/senatorfamily.jpg", "http://susansenator.com/index.html", "http://www.google.ca/search?q=making+peace+with+autism+amazon.com&sourceid=ie7&rls=com.microsoft:en-US&ie=utf8&oe=utf8&redir_esc=&ei=6gOeTfWCL4mF0QGxmNzXBA", "http://www.google.ca/search?q=making+peace+with+autism+amazon.com&sourceid=ie7&rls=com.microsoft:en-US&ie=utf8&oe=utf8&redir_esc=&ei=6gOeTfWCL4mF0QGxmNzXBA", "http://susansenator.com/blog/2011/04/autism-helps-me-get-over-myself/", "http://susansenator.com/blog/2011/04/look-behind-the-lack-of-language/", "http://susansenator.com/blog/2011/04/group-home-proposal-in-brief/", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=8576407520692348867&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=8576407520692348867&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=8576407520692348867&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=8576407520692348867&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2011/04/we-are-still-you-and-me.html", "title": "'We are still you and me'"},
{"date": "Friday, February 25, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI\u2019ve begun Part II of Nat\u2019s Transition to Adulthood: the Day Program. November 15 is right around the corner, so that is my goal date for having his entire Transition setting set up. He will leave school that day and move out of his school residence soon after. This is a lot to contend with emotionally and pragmatically, for Nat and for my family. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing these blog posts: to tell all of you out there to get going as early as possible in your research and in your emotional process. You look at your little guy now and think, \u201cOh, God, I can\u2019t imagine him grown up. What will that be like? What will his peers be like? Will they be like a bunch of lost souls shuffling around from van to mall everyday?\u201d \n \nI will get to that. The only lost souls are those who are not feeling happy and purposeful in their lives. That includes you. I hope you are not a lost soul. But more about that later. I suggest you approach this the way your autistic child approaches learning any new skill: break it down into baby steps. Think about your modus operandi, how you operate, how you achieve things, and go with your own model. Maybe you like to do things methodically, one appointment after another. Maybe you do things in bursts, like me: one appointment or maybe ten, and then none for months. Whatever works. \n \nFirst you have to learn about who you are dealing with. I would try to understand the key players, the names of the departments and organizations involved. How do you learn this? You go to a workshop. Pick one workshop for this year, one Transition to Adulthood workshop. Write down your questions. Ask a few of them, but not all. Keep in mind that as you dip back into this stuff, it will clear up, concept-by-concept. There are Federal Programs and there are State Programs. Federal are for everyone, State differ. Who is your State point person? Cultivate a relationship with a friendly introduction via email or phone. \n \nNext you learn about the programs themselves, what they offer. SSI, SSDI, Section 8, Developmental Services, DayHab, Residential Supports. Don\u2019t worry yet about how to get into them. Just learn their function. I tried to figure out all of Section 8 in one fell swoop: forget that. These days I\u2019ve been touring centers in the Greater Boston area that offer a program M-F, 9-3. These are typically Medicaid-funded (Federal $) therapeutic programs, i.e., no employment/earning component. These are called \u201cDayHabs.\u201d The centers vary in quality and goals; some do highly individualized curricula and others have more of a general schedule with a choice or two. They go out into the community (it should be much more than malls, and if it is malls, then be sure your guy is learning money skills and dealing-with-the-public skills). Visit the program. Tour it and get a good feel for it and the clients it serves. Are they engaged? Happy? Watching TV? Can you imagine your guy there? \n \nImagine your guy there: he is part you, part the child he is now. So you think about how you would feel there, but not using your deep and complex social knowledge. Think about what he likes to do, and if you can\u2019t name a concrete activity, (mostly Nat likes to be active, with people but not talking to them), figure out when he is happiest. Does this place match that? \n \n(Be prepared for developmentally disabled adults. They are not as good-looking as kids with DDs. Think about it this way: no adult is as beautiful as a child. We age and uglify. Sorry. But don\u2019t look at these people as lost souls, broken, pitiful, sad. An unusual face is just that: an arrangement of features that you don\u2019t see everyday. It means nothing. A voice that speaks in grunts or not at all is still fully human, FULLY human, with an inner life, even if that inner life is pictures swirling around his mind, or beautiful sounds. I don\u2019t freakin\u2019 know! I\u2019m just saying, get past what they look like. It\u2019s just a body. We can\u2019t all be magazine people.) \n \nMany of these centers (also known as Vendors, or Service Providers) also have Day Programs, which are not DayHab, or therapeutic only. Day Programs often have a volunteer or employment option, but you need to find a way to pay for it. \n \nNext you find out how to pay for it. You need to find out if a program is an entitlement, or Medicaid/Federal money, or if it is something you have to push for with your Developmental Services point person (see above). You need to find out how to set up your savings so that they can help your adult child someday but not get in the way of his funding. I still don\u2019t really understand this one, but I have a lawyer who does. You are looking to set up a Special Needs Trust. \n \nAbout guilt: try not to go there. Even if you have resources to support your child, you don\u2019t want to get into a situation of depending solely on that, especially when you are gone. You have to think of your adult child as an independent adult \u2014 that is his right, it is about his dignity. These programs help him become an independent adult, as much as possible. We are so lucky that our society attempts to support those who cannot do it all on their own. We are a society that spends tons on building roads and highways and bridges. We are a society that subsidizes farmers and to some degree, big corporations with tax breaks. Everyone gets help and benefits from our government to some degree. Why shouldn\u2019t your guy? Why is one considered a handout and having our roads built for us considered a given? Think about it. I wish we could all chip in and get along. \n \nI have listed for you the big steps. You break them down. Do one thing at a time. Start a notebook. Save business cards and telephone numbers. Build your network. \n \nAbove all, give yourself a break, take your time, but still: do it. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dVjiERPKbFM/TWe2J8Dzl2I/AAAAAAAAAqA/-4sQ9z0aiN0/s1600/susan+senator.bmp", "http://www.susansenator.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Making-Peace-Autism-Discovery-Unexpected/dp/1590303822", "http://www.amazon.com/Autism-Moms-Survival-Guide-Dads/dp/1590307534/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1298641741&sr=1-1", "http://www.hopefulparents.org/", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3561683536461031450&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3561683536461031450&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3561683536461031450&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=3561683536461031450&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2011/02/transition-learning-curve.html", "title": "The transition learning curve"},

But this is the first time anyone has looked at how dads cope as their children get older. \n \nFor the study, Hartley and her colleagues looked at self-reported data collected between 2000 and 2005 from fathers of 240 individuals with autism, Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome ranging in age from 10 to their early 20s. \n \nAfter controlling for the child\u2019s age, family income and the marital status of the father, the research team found that dads of those with Down syndrome fared best out of the three disability groups while those with a child who had fragile X syndrome fell in the middle. \n \nFactors such as the child\u2019s behavior, the likelihood of having more than one child with a disability, the father\u2019s age and the mother\u2019s well-being did seem to play a role in fathers\u2019 experiences. But Hartley says more research needs to be done to better understand what\u2019s leading to elevated levels of depression symptoms in dads of those with autism in particular. \n \n\u201cThis is the first step to drawing attention to dads,\u201d Hartley says. \u201cWe need to get away from just looking at moms.\u201d \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2011/05/13/autism-toll-dads/13097/", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=5187942226594795373&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=5187942226594795373&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=5187942226594795373&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=5187942226594795373&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2011/05/dads-and-depression.html", "title": "Dads and depression"},

{"date": "Wednesday, October 19, 2011", "body": "\n \nA Ryerson study of 20 mothers of children with autism looks at how mothers\u00a0sacrifice their roles as parents, spouses, friends\u00a0and professionals in order to become full-time 'therapists' to their children. \n \n\"Parents are talking about this, but it's still not highlighted in the literature,\" said Dr. Nancy Walton, an associate professor at Ryerson's School of Nursing and ethicist who was speaking at a Bloorview Research Institute presentation yesterday. \n \nThrough qualitative interviews with 20 women, most of whom identified themselves as their child's\u00a0primary therapist, Walton uncovered the following themes: \n \nWhile professionals tell parents early intervention is key, an autism diagnosis typically meant that publicly-funded therapies\u00a0were cut off, and the child was wait-listed for services. One mother noted that in order to get her child help at the age of four, he would have had to be diagnosed in utero. Another said that her non-verbal child had been on a wait list for speech since 20 months. He\u00a0remained high on the list and was about to turn five. \n \nMothers took on the role of active therapist because publicly-funded therapy was rationed in inconsistent blocks or non-existent and they felt time was running out; they\u00a0saw their child as a unique individual that they knew best; and through networking they heard about positive\u00a0results from other parents who delivered most of their child's therapy. A therapist who wasn't able to provide the amount of therapy the child needed would offer to 'train' the parent to do the therapy at home. In addition to therapists, mothers viewed themselves as case managers in co-ordinating their child's\u00a0team of physicians, specialists and therapists. Fifteen respondents did not work outside the home and a number described therapy as their new 'career.' \n \nIn order to deliver a gruelling 48 hours of therapy a week, moms integrated therapy into their everyday life, often dedicating a room in the house to the task. Interaction with their child no longer involved any 'down-time.' Every activity\u00a0became purposeful and therapeutic, \"making it difficult to be a mom,\" Walton said. \n \nRespondents\u00a0described their therapy role as more than a full-time job. They\u00a0felt guilty if they weren't teaching their child every waking hour. The moms reported exhaustion and an inability to fulfill their role as spouses and to provide any one-on-one time to their other children. The respondents had no social life outside the home\u00a0and considered their child's therapy their work life.  \n \nOn a positive note, doing therapy often gave the moms the first effective way to interact with their child and when their child made progress, they felt rewarded. \n \nThe respondents\u00a0identified the lack of resources to help\u00a0mothers address exhaustion and take care of themselves. \n \nThey felt decisions about services and cut-off dates were arbitrary and ad-hoc. Walton, after analyzing the data, expressed concern for vulnerable mothers of children with autism who were new Canadians, didn't speak the language, had low literacy, or were single parents or isolated. \n \nDr. Evdokia Anagnostou, a neurologist and clinician scientist who focuses on autism at Holland Bloorview, asked whose mandate it was to protect the mental health of parents given the high levels of stress. \n \nWalton said that the mandate may fall within our commitment to delivering family-centred care. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=5109881897696366743&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=5109881897696366743&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=5109881897696366743&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=5109881897696366743&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2011/10/goodbye-mom-hello-therapist.html", "title": "Goodbye mom, hello therapist"},

From the moment that my \u2018birth plan\u2019 of soft lights, music and foot massage was scrapped in favour of a strong epidural, life with Nat (photo left) was a wild ride. \n \nWhen I think about myself in those early days, 21 years ago, I feel maternal and protective. I was so scared, before I even knew about the autism; a gauzy gray fear was wrapped around everything I experienced as a new mom. I think I was sensing autism, almost from the very beginning. I felt it when I looked at Nat, and it \njust kind of seemed like he would be content without me, like he didn\u2019t need me. His smile was always inward. And very quickly, as the developmental phases unfolded mostly normally over the months, I learned what it was like to be plagued with self-doubt. I felt something was wrong, but nobody else did. No one believed me. \n \nNat\u2019s diagnosis marked a huge change in our lives, a huge change in me. It wasn\u2019t just the focus it gave me, of needing to learn and learn fast; it was also the awareness that I had been right. Little scared new mother me, imagine that! It turned out I had a mother\u2019s instinct par excellence! \n \nIf I were to give the young me any pearls of wisdom gleaned along the way, I would start with this lesson about intuition. I would say, \u201cTrust your gut; you know your child best.\u201d The sooner I realized that I did know about Nat, the better I felt. The stronger I felt. I think that we need to feel strong as a first step towards dealing with autism. Strength breeds clarity, and from clarity comes vision, perspective. \n \nGetting clear about what is around you marks the early days post-diagnosis, but there will always be the need to focus and understand, even when your child is older. The important thing is to know your kid, and then figure out what\u2019s important\u2014to you and your family. \n \nEarly on, I knew that I wanted to be able to take family vacations the way I had with my family growing up. I did not want autism to stop that. And yet, it was so hard taking Nat to new places that I almost did give up the desire. Until one night, just before Thanksgiving, when I grumbled that there were no books that could \nhelp someone like Nat get through the holiday. \n \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make it yourself?\u201d my husband Ned asked, making it seem simple and obvious. Making me feel like I could do it. And so I did, cutting up family pictures and sticking them together to flimsy pages, telling the story of what Nat\u2019s Thanksgiving would be like, and showing him the familiar faces he would see. \n \nAnd Nat was delighted with it. This type of \u201cNat Book\u201d became our first strategy for taking Nat to new events. It was a successful strategy both for Nat and for me, because it strengthened my conviction that I did know what to do. \n \nOver the years Ned and I developed this kind of pattern, where we would talk together (grumble and grouse) about a problem we needed to solve, and together we would come up with some kind of solution. And later on, we would look back on the problem and it would be part of our \u201ccouple culture,\u201d a phrase I coined for our history together. There are so many old Nat stories we laugh about now, simply because we survived them. Like the time I caught him carrying poop from one toilet to another, simply because the first toilet was not working. \u201cAh, good times,\u201d my husband will say sarcastically, and we\u2019ll laugh. Laughing makes the event into something contained, shared and safe. It also makes you feel like you have a good \nlife, after all. And who is to say you don\u2019t? \n \nI did not learn the most important lesson about being Nat\u2019s mom until he was in his early teens. We were sitting on the living room couch together and he was being horrible. He was loudly and hysterically fake-laughing. He had been doing this for months. We could not ever get him to stop. But in that moment, that late afternoon, I kind of gave up trying. I just started poking him and tickling him, saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny, you? Huh?\u201d \n \nAnd suddenly we were laughing together. Real laughter. This struck me to my core. I think that any remaining shreds of old fear fell away then, as I realized the most important thing of all: Nat is just a kid. Not a creature, \nnot a disorder, not a freak of nature. \n \nHe is just my son and that is that. Knowing that, feeling that, is the secret of making peace with autism. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z8-mRTG1Qtw/TmjiGh9tDOI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/FhjKN81zAwk/s1600/makingpeacewithautism2.jpg", "http://www.blogger.com/goog_1530423511", "http://www.blogger.com/goog_1530423511", "http://susansenator.com/blog", "http://susansenator.com/blog/2011/07/turned-my-whole-world-upside-down/", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=4891445270255582871&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=4891445270255582871&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=4891445270255582871&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=4891445270255582871&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2011/09/he-is-just-my-son.html", "title": "'He is just my son'"},
{"date": "Monday, June 1, 2009", "body": "\n \nLast week, Karl Taro Greenfeld wrote a compelling op-ed piece in the   about how services for adults with severe autism evaporate the day they graduate from high school:  . \n \nGreenfeld is the author of the recently-released memoir  , a book about growing up with his brother Noah, who has autism. \n \n\u201cHe graduated from his special needs school on a bright, sunny Orange County day,\u201d he writes in the   piece. \u201c\u2026he was beaming, handsome in his bright blue cap and gown. \n \n\u201cBut for the profoundly autistic, graduation is perhaps the saddest day in their lives.\u201d \n \nLike many adults with developmental disabilities and odd behaviour, Noah couldn\u2019t get a job. His family tried unsuccessfully to find a day program where he could be productive and meet others. He wasn\u2019t \u201chigh functioning\u201d enough. The family couldn\u2019t afford to pay for ongoing behavioural therapy. Despite his family\u2019s best efforts, Noah regressed and became increasingly destructive to himself and others. \n \nHundreds of millions of dollars a year is pumped into autism research in the U.S., Greenfeld notes, but it\u2019s all directed at children. \n \nAdults aren\u2019t on the radar, and it\u2019s reflected in the lack of services and programs to support them. \n \nI have six years to try to cobble together a worthy adult life for my son Ben, who\u2019s now 15 and can stay in his special-needs high school till he\u2019s 21. He doesn\u2019t have autism, but he does have physical and developmental disabilities. \n \nWhile we\u2019ve made a lot of progress with programs like Bloorview\u2019s   \u2013 which aims to prepare youth with disabilities for independence in adulthood \u2013 there will always be adults with developmental or multiple disabilities like Ben who require lifelong supports. \n \nMy son needs constant supervision and someone who understands sign language to interpret for him. Where will he go during the day when he leaves high school? If my husband and I continue to work, who will support him during the day? How will we pay them? How will we find something meaningful for Ben to do? \n \nI used to come up with wild ideas about how we\u2019d create a business to employ Ben. \n \nTwo years ago we bought Ben a Bull Dog puppy. Without really giving thought to the practicalities, I started to envision Ben as a future Bull Dog breeder. We have a farm to retire to, breeders work online, and Ben loves computers. \n \nHowever, once I gave this some serious thought, it became apparent that Ben couldn\u2019t manage the physical side of caring for dogs \u2013 particularly when they\u2019re puppies. He has joint pain and fatigues easily. He\u2019d enjoy visiting with the dogs, but he wouldn\u2019t enjoy cleaning up after them and feeding them, and he wouldn\u2019t have the strength to train them (he struggles to walk his current dog). \n \nNow that Ben\u2019s in Grade 9, every time we receive a report card, we also receive a standard form that lists all of the courses required for an Ontario high school certificate. And beside each of these courses are typed big fat zeros \u2013 as if we need constant reminders that our child won\u2019t graduate from high school and, as a result, won\u2019t amount to anything valued in this society. \n \nI want for Ben what I want for all of my children: the opportunity of a future filled with meaning, learning, joy and friendship. But when I read about what happened to Greenfeld\u2019s brother Noah, I fear for the future and what it holds for Ben and our family. \n \nNew York Times health guide on autism \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24greenfeld.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1", "http://www.amazon.ca/Boy-Alone-Brothers-Karl-Greenfeld/dp/0061136662/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243610903&sr=8-2", "http://www.bloorview.ca/resourcecentre/familyresources/growingupready.php", "http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/autism/overview.html", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=2364855474905217919&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=2364855474905217919&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=2364855474905217919&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=2364855474905217919&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2009/06/graduation-is-perhaps-saddest-day-in.html", "title": "\u2018Graduation is perhaps the saddest day in their lives\u2019"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 1, 2010", "body": "\n \n \n \nGiven World Autism Awareness Day on Friday April 2, here's some exciting news about a clinical trial set to start at Bloorview. Louise \n \nBloorview has received an $805,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct a randomized clinical trial to see if Oxytocin \u2013 a hormone released during women\u2019s labour and milk let-down \u2013 improves social functioning in teens with autism. \n \nThe United Nations hopes to raise awareness of the disorder as a global health crisis on World Autism Day April 2. \n \nThe Oxytocin grant is one of four Bloorview-funded trials targeting social function, learning, motor skills and global functioning in autism \u2013 the only clinical trial program of its kind in Canada. \n \nAnimal research and pilot studies in adults with autism suggest Oxytocin plays a role in social memory, trust and attachment. \n \n\u201cGiven that people with autism have difficulties in those areas, and we\u2019ve had no success with other medications, it\u2019s time to look at whether Oxytocin has therapeutic potential for improving social deficits in autism,\u201d says Dr. Evdokia Anagnostou (in photo above), the child neurologist who heads up the clinical research program in autism at Bloorview. \n \nThe first phase of the three-year study will identify the optimum dose of the hormone. The second will be a randomized control trial of 60 adolescents with autism aged 12 to 18, who will take the hormone in a nose spray in the morning and afternoon for three months. Thirty teens will participate at Bloorview, and 30 teens will take part at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cThe Chicago folks have a lot of expertise in measuring Oxytocin in the blood and in doing genetic studies of Oxytocin in autism,\u201d Dr. Anagnostou says. \u201cWe have more of the clinical trial research expertise, so it\u2019s a nice partnership.\u201d \n \nTraditionally, research has looked at symptoms that autism shares with other disorders and borrowed medications used to treat those disorders to see if they work in autism. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be sloppy in matching and to gravitate to what is easy to do, what you know is feasible to do, but not really what the relevant question is,\u201d Dr. Anagnostou says. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the basic science data as it pertains to autism and translating those findings into clinical research. We start with genetics and animal models and control trials to understand what regulates normal social function. Then we study how the system is disturbed to produce abnormal function, and how it can be manipulated to mediate the disturbed part. It\u2019s a completely different approach.\u201d \n \nDr. Anagnostou is cautiously optimistic about the study. \u201cThis won\u2019t cure autism. But if at the end of the process we\u2019ve found a compound that has a direct effect on social function and social skills \u2013 and that can make existing social-skills interventions that much more effective \u2013 the impact will be huge.\u201d \n \nDr. Anagnostou is author of a small pilot study in press that shows Oxytocin improved social cognition and repetitive behaviours in adults with autism. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_c1udrhteUuc/S7Tz3ibZocI/AAAAAAAAAUY/dtYERod8PXQ/s1600/BloorviewMay12photos_124.jpg", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=6762508460610253137&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=6762508460610253137&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=6762508460610253137&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=6762508460610253137&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2010/04/us-department-of-defense-funds-autism.html", "title": "U.S. funds Bloorview trial of Oxytocin in autism"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 5, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the age of two, Carly Fleischmann (centre) was diagnosed with severe autism and an oral-motor condition that prevented her from speaking. Doctors predicted that she would never develop beyond the abilities of a small child. Then, at the age of 10, she had a breakthrough when she typed a message on her therapist\u2019s laptop. Seven years later she\u2019s in a gifted program at a regular Toronto high school.  , is a new memoir written by her father Arthur Fleischmann, which includes much of Carly\u2019s writing. I interviewed Carly\u2019s mom Tammy Starr (photo right,\u00a0with Carly's twin sister Taryn left) about their experiences. \n \n \n \n  I\u2019m very proud of the book. I knew Arthur had written a lovely and important book. But for me it was nerve-wracking. Even though my life has been public in my role as an advocate for Carly and other families with children with autism, this was very personal. I\u2019ve been out there as a fighter, but I\u2019ve never had our personal life revealed to this extent. \n \n ? \n \n  I started to read it a number of times but each time I started to cry. It was too hard to take. I knew the story \u2013 it was my life \u2013 but I found it difficult to relive. It was hard enough to go through it the first time. This book took a lot out of Arthur emotionally. I never would have been able to write it. \n \n \n \n  You can see how one is living a typical, full life on a very normal trajectory and the other one is being left behind in many ways. Carly wasn\u2019t able to hold her ground or keep up with peers, but also, people who knew I had twins would invite Taryn to their child\u2019s birthday party and not Carly. At one point Carly was too young to understand, but obviously there came a time when I\u2019m sure she understood what was going on. \n \n \n \n  More than I can understand. It comes out in the birthday messages Carly sends to Taryn. The other night Carly was having a hard time falling asleep and kept coming out of her room and we were really tired. Taryn was still up and running around, and I said: \u201cCould you please help us?\u201d I don\u2019t generally ask her to help us. I want to keep her relationship with Carly as a sister not a caregiver. The next thing I knew Carly was giggling and giggling in her bed and Taryn left her room and Carly didn\u2019t come out. They have this closeness, this bond. I really didn\u2019t know in the beginning how much Carly meant to Taryn. I didn\u2019t know if she was an embarrassment or what. There were times in the tween years where Carly did embarrass Taryn, but all kids embarrass their siblings and Taryn\u2019s past that. It\u2019s hard for Taryn. On the one hand, she has all these friends and an active social life and just got her G1 driving licence. And when she leaves the house she leaves her sister behind. But I\u2019ve never said \u201cPlease include Carly.\u201d That\u2019s not fair to either of them. Carly doesn\u2019t want to be somebody\u2019s burden. \n \n \n \n  She wasn\u2019t aggressive, but she was destructive to things. You could never leave her alone. She didn\u2019t stop moving. We used to say she was worse than the Energizer bunny. She had these compulsions pushing her and she wouldn\u2019t sleep and we\u2019d lie with her in bed. At 1 or 2 in the morning we\u2019d think she was just about to drift off and she\u2019d bolt up in bed and start emptying her dresser. Even though we were fortunate to have help over the years, it was a 24/7 proposition and we always had to be on our guard. If someone wasn\u2019t with her, she wasn\u2019t safe by herself. \n \n \n \n  In general I\u2019m Carly\u2019s business manager. I manage Carly Inc. I\u2019m the fighter and I\u2019m the one out there in court, but I\u2019m not her therapist or caregiver. I\u2019m her mother. I make sure everyone is there and everyone shows up and all the pieces are in place. But I\u2019m not the one that delivers her programs. I\u2019m not a patient person. I\u2019ve also been sick a lot. I\u2019ve had chemotherapy twice since the girls were born, as well as depression. Arthur has much more physical and emotional stamina to be in the trenches with Carly. He\u2019s been closer to her on a parenting level. I\u2019m the one who gets all the experts around the table for a team meeting. \n \n \n \n  The collaboration and dedication and imagination of her two main therapists \u2013 Howard and Barb \u2013 in terms of delivering programming to her through an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) lens. They were constantly brainstorming about what they\u2019d done and what was next. They never gave up on her and always pushed her. She had a high level of consistency and intervention over many years. All of Carly\u2019s waking hours were delivered in an ABA environment. \n \n \n \n  The two main ones she uses are  , a word-prediction software developed at Holland Bloorview, and  , a communication software. WordQ allows her to type faster. With Proloquo, Carly will anticipate the words or phrases she wants for different activities and write them on her laptop, and then Howard will program them into Proloquo. Before we went to Los Angeles over the March break, she thought of specific things she\u2019d want to say knowing who she\u2019d be meeting. And before she went to camp she created lots and lots of pages to ensure she wasn\u2019t misunderstood. For example, she has comments like \u201cI need a break\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t take this personally. It\u2019s my obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\u201d It allows her to explain herself to the world. \n \n \n \n  A ton. We knew she was smart and learning all the time. But we didn\u2019t know she was just like her sister Taryn, except she has this body that doesn\u2019t cooperate. Her brain and her sense of humour are like any other typical kid. I think we\u2019re going to find that common stereotypes about people with autism are so off the mark. We learned Carly has so much empathy and concern for other people and wants to help other people. The idea that she\u2019s closed off and not wanting to be a part of things is a bunch of crap. These kids want to be part of the world and they\u2019re very sensitive and emotional. But they might not be able to show it. We learned Carly was loving and very aware of everything that was going on, but she just couldn\u2019t communicate it. Being non-verbal doesn\u2019t mean being disengaged or not aware or spaced out. It means your mouth doesn\u2019t work. I feel badly about things I said in frustration or anger in the past because we didn\u2019t know how aware she was. \n \n \n \n  One of the things I said was \u201cWhat do you think of autism?\u201d She wrote: \u201cI have it and people don\u2019t want to see it.\u201d At the time her self-esteem was very low.  \n \n \n \n  We have to assume that that child understands everything you\u2019re saying and speak to them and treat them like any other child. People still speak to Carly\u2019s therapist or me, instead of talking directly to Carly. As Carly says, people talk in front of her back! You can never judge a book by its cover. Never take anything about these kids at face value. There are kids in there and when parents see glimpses of light and intelligence they\u2019re real. And you have to go on that and believe it. \n \n \n \n  She wants to be a typical teen like everyone else. She wants to go shopping and talk about boys and fit in. She has the same hopes and dreams in terms of school and travel and relationships. She and Taryn both want the same types of things. \n \n \n \n  She\u2019s had little formal academic exposure. It\u2019s been in fits and starts because of placements that worked or didn\u2019t work. But she has a photographic memory and it permeates everything. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten anything I\u2019ve heard or seen,\u201d she says. She says she can\u2019t look at things straight on because her mind takes 10,000 pictures. She\u2019s in a gifted program now and she takes a lot of the social sciences. She has an educational assistant with her. The curriculum is modified so that the teacher is satisfied that she knows the work. If there are 50 questions but she can show she knows the material in five to 10, that\u2019s what she does.  \n \n \n \n  When she first started writing she said she wanted to work in a bagel store. Now she\u2019s intent on going to the University of California at Los Angeles. We went on a tour while we were there recently. She loves interviewing celebrities and part of me thinks she will be doing something that involves journalism and writing. Temple Grandin is her hero. So perhaps she\u2019ll do something similar in terms of writing and lecturing and travelling.  \n \n \n \n  When she was 11 she was covered in bruises and we had her admitted to SickKids and they said she\u2019s self-injurious and one doctor thought she was attending to voices. That made us laugh. Later on, Carly told us she was slapping herself to stop herself from doing something more destructive \u2013 like stripping the beds or emptying the armoires. It was a coping strategy for the OCD. She was trying to manage her inner compulsions and anxiety. Her OCD is something we still work on with her occupational therapist and social worker. \n \n \n \n  When I\u2019m in Toronto it\u2019s full throttle and all-consuming. I get out of town when I can and I call it my autism-free zone. I have a good network of friends, although I tend to isolate a lot. \n \n \n \n  I have a strong sensitivity for the underdog and to not getting anything less than what a child needs. I haven\u2019t always felt like I fit in and I was bullied when I was a child. So I\u2019ve worked hard to advocate for families in the province who don\u2019t know the ropes. The part I find frustrating is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a new generation of parents of kids aged five or six picking up the gauntlet. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0k6y1y7XO9c/T32iZ4GXLsI/AAAAAAAABHs/92RhfMYTTd0/s1600/IMG_0150.jpg", "http://www.amazon.ca/Carlys-Voice-Breaking-Through-Autism/dp/1439194149", "http://www.goqsoftware.com/", "http://www.assistiveware.com/product/proloquo2go", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=4831382400632759389&target=email", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=4831382400632759389&target=blog", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=4831382400632759389&target=twitter", "https://www.blogger.com/share-post.g?blogID=447392662850613354&postID=4831382400632759389&target=facebook"], "link": "http://bloom-parentingkidswithdisabilities.blogspot.ca/2012/04/i-manage-carly-inc.html", "title": "'I manage Carly Inc.'"}
