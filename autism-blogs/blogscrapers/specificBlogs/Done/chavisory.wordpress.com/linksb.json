{"date": "January 9, 2016", "body": "As I see various reactions to things like Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country, requiring American Muslims to register and wear ID tags, or the attempts of multiple mayors and governors to exclude Syrian refugees from residence in their cities and states, it\u2019s common to see comparisons between the prejudices underlying those proposals and those that preceded events like the Japanese-American internment of World War 2, or America\u2019s refusal of Jewish refugees from Europe. These ideas are gaining traction again, it\u2019s said, because Americans don\u2019t know our history. Takei\u2019s remarks here are worth watching, but I disagree with his conclusions that the problem is that we don\u2019t know this history. Most everyone putting this stuff forward, or backing the politicians who do, I\u2019m willing to bet, knows about the Japanese-American internment. It\u2019s just that they have some kind of reason or excuse for why it was justified.\u00a0 Why the human suffering was regrettable, but the reasoning for it was basically sound.\u00a0 Or why maybe it wasn\u2019t right, but it was an understandable reaction.\u00a0 Or why it wasn\u2019t really that bad.\u00a0 Why people were lucky to be in our concentration camps instead of German concentration camps.\u00a0 Or why what they\u2019re advocating now wouldn\u2019t be really, really the same thing. Or on some level, they think that people who maintain that it was wrong then and it would be wrong now can\u2019t really be serious.\u00a0 That they\u2019re just saying what \u201ceveryone\u201d else actually thinks but won\u2019t admit.

{"date": "January 20, 2016", "body": "There\u2019s a group of assertions that have become common, among a fraction of parents who, superficially at least, believe themselves to be taking an accepting approach towards their child\u2019s autism or disability. They\u2019re not necessarily looking for a cure. They\u2019re not subjecting their kids to 40 hours per week of repressive therapy. They\u2019re not bemoaning their grief for the non-autistic child they lost or the tragedy that their family\u2019s life has become. They\u2019re just really insistent that autism not be allowed to be meaningful to  who  their child is. \u201cBut it\u2019s not who he is. It\u2019s just something he happens to have.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just part of who he is; it\u2019s not all of who he is.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s part of her but it doesn\u2019t define her.\u201d \u201cAutism isn\u2019t him, it\u2019s something that  happened  to him.\u201d Lately it comes to dominate discussions that aren\u2019t even about person-first vs. identity-first language choices, so fearful is the notion that autism might have any sway in who a child is. And in some ways, I am more frustrated with this variety of denialism than with the way more openly hateful outlooks of curebie parents. In some ways, I think the parents who far more openly hate their children being autistic are being more honest, as deeply unfortunate as I find their position, than the ones hiding fear and disgust behind \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my child as a person; this is only a thing that they have. It\u2019s not really part of them.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not who they are.\u201d Because that would be the worst thing. What if it is, though? What if they can\u2019t meet your demands that they cut themselves off from that much of their psyches? What if they can\u2019t or won\u2019t hack themselves up that way? As long as it\u2019s not actually who you are,  isn\u2019t actually de-stigmatizing. Just as long as you can let us believe that this isn\u2019t really part of  you  is not actually acceptance. Just as long as it doesn\u2019t have real consequences for how you have to live your life. \nJust as long as it doesn\u2019t affect you in any significant, unavoidable way. \nJust as long as it doesn\u2019t  mean  anything to you, let alone anything good. Just as long as it\u2019s fundamentally separate from  you . If it kind of sounds like \u201cLove the sinner, hate the sin,\u201d that\u2019s because it kind of feels like it, too. Being forced to hold something true and essential about you at arm\u2019s length for years and years, being told that you\u2019re not really the person you are, that the real you, the correct you, is someone who doesn\u2019t move through the world the way that you do\u2026that you are not really  like  this, it\u2019s just something that you  have \u2026. (Let me tell you something about trying to do this. The horrible part isn\u2019t that it can\u2019t work; it\u2019s that it can, for some amount of time, anyway. The result isn\u2019t a person who isn\u2019t autistic, it\u2019s a person who feels like a stranger or a ghost in their own life.) As long as your whole experience of the world\u2014the way language and emotion, music and light, passion and movement, space and time work\u2014isn\u2019t really innately woven into who you are\u2026 It\u2019s a variant, not a repudiation, of  who you are is not acceptable. You\u2019re only a person if  you  aren\u2019t like  this . \u201cBut it\u2019s not who he is.\u201d How would you know? (How good were  your  parents at reading your mind, at knowing how you truly and deeply felt about yourself as a child? How right were your parents about who you\u2019d grow up to be? How psychic about these things are parents, generally speaking?) Would she tell you? Would she have the words to? What expectation have you given her about how you\u2019ll react if she comes to you and says \u201cYes, it really is?\u201d Have you exposed him to the diversity of first-person viewpoints that would allow him to know one way or the other? Is he allowed access to autistic people who describe their own experiences in various ways? Different autistic people do have different conceptions of what autism is to them. Most say that it is part of  who  we are, but some don\u2019t; the point is that we all, individually, have the right to make those judgments about our experiences and internal lives and descriptive preferences. Do your children not have the same right to conceive of who they are or aren\u2019t for themselves? What if it actually is? What are you going to do then?

{"date": "February 10, 2016", "body": "This is a screen capture of the top headlines from the  New York Times  Television section one day last month. It is a little bit hard to get words around my bafflement at this state of affairs. People are gushing with happiness all over my Facebook news feed. People who I never knew previously were huge X-Files fans. People who I don\u2019t remember as being similarly obsessed when the show was last on the air.\u00a0 (Some people who I just didn\u2019t know yet, and I\u2019m thankful that I do now, and not only for the purposes of squealing about  The X-Files .) Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m happy about this. That I can flail about  The X-Files  pretty visibly these days; everyone else is, too.\u00a0 Maybe it just seems that way. That somehow, between when I was 11, or 21, and now, it\u2019s become perfectly acceptable, if not normal, to be openly obsessed with  The X-Files . It\u2019s a weird thing to feel a little betrayed and befuddled over. When I was a kid, when I was in college even, and got on about  The X-Files , other people tended to get quiet and move away. People who had professed their mutual love of it just moments before. My adoration of this show was mostly something vaguely embarrassing, tolerated, indulged. Over the years I had a couple of friends who shared my interest to a limited extent\u2026I was  really excited  when I met one other girl at camp who was into it, too. But we didn\u2019t get close.\u00a0 For a short span of time, I had the AOL message boards, but I was too young to have really great conversations there\u2026and then AOL itself became more grief than it was worth, and I didn\u2019t anymore. A lot of teenagers would say they liked it, but then would shy away from actually talking about it. Were they saying they did just to make small talk? To placate me? Because that was the thing to do, when someone said they liked something, was to say you liked it, too, regardless of how clueless you actually were, because to admit you didn\u2019t understand something that someone else did was the cardinal sin? (That would explain a lot, actually. Though I feel like I tried that a couple of times and it didn\u2019t work out well.) Did they really, but it was too uncool to admit how much they did, especially to someone like me? Was it the aliens? My dedication remained no less steadfast over the years of the show, but it was something I got more and more embarrassed of, and in the later years of the show even fellow serious fans started dropping away. I know, I know, I missed Mulder, too. (If you watch some of those season 8-9 episodes now, they\u2019re actually  good \u2014even I had no memory of some of them and was surprised at how good they were upon re-watch\u2014but everyone was so disillusioned by Mulder\u2019s departure that they just gave up.) But stuff just doesn\u2019t let go of me that easily. And it became one of those loves that left me more and more alone over time instead of less. I kind of just packed it away in my heart after the end of the show. I had a load-in the night of the series finale, which I made peace with videotaping for later. It was time to move on. The second movie got uniformly bad reviews; I continue to maintain  its release was mishandled .\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t even get to go with anyone to the theater to see it. A decade later I got onto Tumblr and was stunned to find a trove of loving, thoughtful, incisive commentary on the show, by people who were too young to have even watched it in its original run. And now we\u2019re at this point. What  happened ? What changed? Granted, for one thing, I have more neurodivergent female friends now. Dana Scully turns out to have been a cultural touchstone for a lot of girls who felt chronically weird and out of place. But that isn\u2019t all; a lot of it isn\u2019t coming from those people. Did pervasive mistrust of the government come to seem less silly and paranoid in the post-9/11 Bush years? Did everyone just get sick and tired of the culture that required we be aloof, indifferent, and uncaring?\u2026of constantly swallowing their enthusiasm and sincerity and hiding what they loved? (Even when I was too young to really get a lot of what the show was about, I think that may\u2019ve been a huge factor in what attracted me to it. Mulder and Scully just cared so damn much, when all the grownups in my life always seemed to be telling me to care less. Care less about the environment. Care less that school was an unfair, mean, and stupid waste of my time. Care less about being home by 8:00 on Friday night.) It\u2019s really great. It\u2019s more than a little incredible to me. It feels in a way kind of like I just stumbled into the world the way it always should\u2019ve been. But I also can\u2019t help but wonder, where  was  all this when I was 12, when it could\u2019ve meant everything?

The community gardens of New York City are what keep this place sane and livable.\u00a0 My 3rd floor apartment overlooks one, and in the summertime I love the peace and solitude of sitting outside perched on my fire escape, with a drink and a book, looking out over the garden where our neighbors grow roses, sunflowers, peas, and tomatoes.\u00a0 They have a rainwater collection system whereby run-off from a bordering apartment building\u2019s storm gutters is saved to water the garden instead of going to waste.\u00a0 Dogs lounge in the shade.\u00a0 Neighborhood cats stalk rats and pigeons.\u00a0 Fireflies turn it into a dark green twilight fairyland in June.\u00a0 Even though we live one block from Central Park, it\u2019s not a substitute for the little pocket of quiet and privacy tucked between the apartment buildings.\u00a0 A few months ago during a recurrence of our leaking bathroom ceiling horrors, our building management even offered to let us move into a vacant apartment one floor up in our same building.\u00a0 We said no.\u00a0 Only because the new apartment faced the street, not the garden. Looking or stepping into the garden in an unfamiliar neighborhood as I go about my often-hectic freelance work all over the city is a powerful glimpse into the personality of the neighborhood, and also into how the people there value their environment, and the protection of peace and solitude and nature. The profusion of gardens and greenspaces here is, ironically, one of the reasons I finally realized this past year that I can never move back to Kansas City.\u00a0 There are parks\u2013large, beautiful ones\u2013but they\u2019re isolated from the places where people actually live.\u00a0 Lots of the suburban areas are okay, but in the downtown areas where I could reasonably live, work and shop without having to own a car, there are just no trees, no green space.\u00a0 While in many other respects, the city is becoming much more of a place that I might like to live, with an exploding theater and arts community and a lot of great redevelopment.\u00a0 But over Christmas last year I visited my brother\u2019s downtown loft, and looking out over the city, I couldn\u2019t see a single tree, or square of green space, for blocks and blocks.\u00a0 I\u2019d been trying to figure out why I felt so depressed driving through downtown looking at the sidewalks and historic buildings, even though the neighborhood looked vibrant and well-kept.\u00a0 And it wasn\u2019t just that it was winter; there was really almost no vegetation. So thanks to the  Times  for bringing this to our attention, and I hope plenty of people will write the mayor and city council to remind them of the value of our community gardens, which are more priceless to the character of the city than any development they could possibly put in those spaces instead.\u00a0 I hope that a new plan can be agreed to which would give the gardens secure, long-term protection.

{"date": "November 27, 2010", "body": "\ufeff This is sort of a Thanksgiving post. In his  New York Times   column  this week, Bob Herbert asserts that \u201cHowever you want to define the American dream, there is not much of it that\u2019s left anymore.\u201d This is something I\u2019ve thought a lot about for months now, and I still can\u2019t decide whether I agree.\u00a0 With the essentials of Herbert\u2019s column, or with the notion that the American dream is over. I agree that however you look at it, we are in deep, deep trouble, and that we need a clear and realistic view of what kind of trouble if we\u2019re ever going to address it effectively.\u00a0 But it does matter very much how we define the American dream when we\u2019re questioning whether not there\u2019s any of it left or whether it\u2019s worth reviving.\u00a0 A lot of Herbert\u2019s conception of the American dream has to do with economic security and standard of living.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not saying those things aren\u2019t important benchmarks of a country\u2019s well-being, or that we don\u2019t have severe problems in these areas right now.\u00a0 I don\u2019t disagree that \u201cthe U.S. needs to develop a full-employment economy that provides jobs for all who want to work at pay that enables the workers and their families to enjoy a decent standard of living.\u201d\u00a0 But I\u2019m not convinced at all that that\u2019s what the real promise of America consists of, or should, or ever did.\u00a0 Everything he says is true, is real, is a big problem, but I\u2019m just not sure any of it defines the essential crisis that we\u2019re in. Here is what the American dream means to me: that America is a place of ever-renewable hope and individual opportunity.\u00a0 Where we have confidence in our Constitutional protections as the inviolable law of the land.\u00a0 Where we know that we are our government, and it is answerable to us.\u00a0 Where we can trust that every single one of us will be treated fairly and equally, whether seeking employment or education or redress in the courts, without regard to our color, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, or wealth.\u00a0 Where we defend the rights of others as our own. Of course my version of the American dream is as unreal and elusive as Herbert\u2019s.\u00a0 It has never actually been the case for probably the majority of Americans.\u00a0 It has always and only ever been an ideal, an aspiration, which we\u2019ve lived up to with progressive but extremely inconsistent degrees of success.\u00a0 A dream.\u00a0 There has never been a golden age of fairness and prosperity for all that was stolen from us. What I see is that we don\u2019t just lack any confidence or trust in our leaders and faith that we matter to our government; we don\u2019t believe in each other.\u00a0 We don\u2019t see each other as contributors to the solutions we need.\u00a0 We don\u2019t only lack a clear and accurate view of what our problems are; we don\u2019t even have a common vision to work and share and sacrifice  for .

Sound like a First Amendment quagmire yet? Graeme eloquently defends his former teacher, saying he was driven to a  suicide attempt at age nine in large part by anti-gay slanders by  classmates that long went accepted and unchallenged by teachers.\u00a0 The teacher says that he ejected the students for being disruptive, not for their stated opposition to supporting gay people, and I tend to believe him. But\u2026suppose that the students were telling the truth, that they only expressed their personal opposition to support for gays, calmly, non-threateningly and non-disruptively.\u00a0 Would their ejection have been a violation of their free speech rights?\u00a0 How should the teacher have handled the discussion? Doesn\u2019t the First Amendment protect even\u2013especially\u2013the most unpopular of speech? Yes, I would say, IF the students in question merely expressed a position, as vile and unfortunate a position as I find it, then the teacher did wrong to punish them rather than guiding the conversation to a useful and potentially enlightening conclusion\u2026even though he was right, doubtless in the eyes of some of his most vulnerable students, to oppose the sentiments as strongly as he was able to in the moment. As much as I despise the opinion that gay people (or black people, Gypsies, Muslims, whoever) are morally inferior, in my understanding, the right of free speech applies equally to these sentiments.\u00a0 We don\u2019t allocate the First Amendment\u2019s protection based on the popularity of the content of the speech.\u00a0\u00a0 So long as the speech does not constitute an explicit or implicit threat, well, people have the right to dislike whomever they dislike, whether or not their reasoning sucks. But students also need to learn that the right of \u201cfree speech\u201d does not mean the right of unchallenged or consequence-free speech, that just because their prejudice may be a religious belief doesn\u2019t disallow opposition to it, and that if they choose to express their bigotry, they should expect to be strenuously challenged.\u00a0 Banning or punishing such speech (again, as long as it\u2019s not actually a threat) will only give the bigots confirmation for their whine that they\u2019re being oppressed by the fascist liberal homosexual agenda or something.\u00a0 Simply suppressing it doesn\u2019t allow us to openly challenge it, to reveal its ugliness and violence for what it is, to discredit it with facts, or to show that the positions of acceptance and respect are stronger.\u00a0 Teachers are in an optimal position to do these things, and more importantly, to show their students how to do them. Graeme Taylor has eloquence, grace, and self-possession of which I could only be passionately envious at his age; there will be no one more suited to take up the task than he will be.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry that he\u2019ll have to.\u00a0 I shudder for his opponents to think of what he\u2019ll be like to oppose in debate in a few years.

It seems far more likely that Horne is terrified by the prospect of a minority group, which he sees as a threat to his version of Americanism, taking justifiable pride in the literature of their own heritage, examining their place in American history and their hopes for its future, and that those hopes might conflict with his own.\u00a0 He\u2019s not afraid of a bunch of Latino high schoolers plotting to topple the US government; he\u2019s afraid of them having a narrative of their place in society that\u2019s valuable, unique, and powerful. And he\u2019s counting on misinformation, ignorance, apathy, and xenophobia to protect him from any real consequences for his astonishing and vindictive attack on students\u2019 First Amendment rights and academic freedom.\u00a0 He knows he probably won\u2019t face any appreciable outrage from the state\u2019s citizens, because not many people will see themselves in the group of young Latinos he\u2019s maligning.\u00a0 Not many people will perceive any threat to the freedoms or safety from intimidation that they take for granted in this action, because they aren\u2019t part of a controversial literature class alleged to be inciting disloyalty and racial discord.\u00a0 But they should.\u00a0 Because if this can be done to any of us without the protest of our neighbors\u2013being legally targeted for what we are, read, or learn\u2013then it can be done to all of us, for any reason.

{"date": "January 8, 2011", "body": "One of the most shocking things anyone ever said to me came from my Mary Lyndon hall-mate Sally\u2013one of the very few fellow dorm residents I ever talked to much at all\u2013in my junior year of college. She told me I had \u201cmad style.\u201d I had never considered myself to have very much style at all, let alone mad style.\u00a0 I was always a  nerd  in school.\u00a0 Lately I had taken to wearing skirts with t-shirts and sneakers.\u00a0 I was trying to figure out some way to better express my femininity while remaining comfortable, and occasionally putting some of my new found awareness of line, silhouette, and color from costume design class to work for me in the many fine thrift stores of downtown Athens, GA.\u00a0 But to be someone with style, was a fate that had never crossed my mind as a possibility. So, having never gotten all that good at taking compliments, it was with similar awkward though delighted surprise that I found myself the recipient of a Stylish Blogger Award. My award comes from  Aspergirl Maybe , who is blogging her way through the book  Aspergirls: Empowering Females with Asperger Syndrome , by Rudy Simone, herself an author, musician and comedian with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome.\u00a0 It\u2019s a marvelous, concise, useful and emotional book, and I thank Ms. Maybe for introducing me to it and for her ever honest and fascinating blog. As a condition of accepting this award, I am supposed to pass it on to three more blogs\u2026and tell you seven things you don\u2019t know about me. The winning blogs are: 1.\u00a0  A Year of Plays , by Anna Moore.\u00a0 One of the things you wouldn\u2019t expect about working in theater is that it\u2019s really, really hard to get out and see theater.\u00a0 Anna pledged to see and write about one play a week for a year.\u00a0 She\u2019s still going, on a less strict schedule\u2026and producing a play and starting a theater company. 2.  Pomo Freakshow\u2019s yet-to-be-wittily-named blog , by Kestryl Cael Lowrey.\u00a0 I\u2019ve now seen two absolutely stunning one-man shows by Kestryl, and want to wish hir all possible encouragement and joy in hir new blogging exploits. 3.  The Intimacies Project  is a collaborative multi-media public art project of dance, poetry, and visual art, which last year did a series of free performances from a storefront space in the Port Authority bus terminal, inviting people in off the street to get a little art in their lives.\u00a0 One of the dancers involved, Billy, is someone I\u2019ve worked with before, and poet Claire Donato is a friend of a friend. The stuff you don\u2019t know about me is a little bit harder.\u00a0 Oddly, while I\u2019ve always conceived of myself as a private person, I was realizing the other day that I actually have very few real secrets anymore.\u00a0 There\u2019s almost nothing about me that  somebody  doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0 The strange part is that almost nobody knows all the same things\u2026I feel like people know different versions of me entirely depending on when they knew me.\u00a0 So the following aren\u2019t anything that I guarantee you didn\u2019t know about me, but rather that you may not have guessed, depending on what part of my life you came from\u2026. 1.\u00a0 I can in fact curse.\u00a0 I\u2019m actually very good at it.\u00a0 Around the apartment, I have the mouth of a sailor.\u00a0 In the interest of professionalism, I try to keep a lid on it in rehearsal, which often leads to the hilarious misconception that I  can\u2019t  curse\u2026and a lot of shocked cast members when tech week rolls around and they hear me drop the f*bomb for the first time.\u00a0 In college, I auditioned for the role of Catherine in  Proof , and the director asked me to say \u201cfuck you\u201d to her, just to make sure that I could. 2.\u00a0 I really enjoyed acting classes in high school.\u00a0 Other people were shocked, because I\u2019d always been so shy, but I loved learning that I had the power to create an illusion, and the powers of expression I had while being somebody else. 3.\u00a0 I have a biology degree.\u00a0 It\u2019s sort of a long story. 4.\u00a0 I drank a lot in college.\u00a0 Like, a  lot . 5.\u00a0 I love living in New York, but I miss so many things that I don\u2019t have here: hearing owls and crickets at night, being able to see the stars, a real porch, open sky.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure when, not even in the foreseeable future, but sometime I might have to leave NYC for someplace quieter.\u00a0 But I worry about being able to make a living someplace else. 6. My favorite words are all the ones without vowels.\u00a0 I do not believe  that \u2018y\u2019 counts as a vowel; when they taught us in first grade that it  did, I just chose not to believe it. 7.\u00a0 I wish I went to church more than I do. Anna and Kestryl, come pick up your award anytime!\u00a0 (Intimacies Project involves multiple people, so I don\u2019t expect them all to complete the lists.) And lastly on the topic of unexpected things, as it approaches one year since I started writing this blog, having very little idea of where it would take me, it\u2019s become one of the unexpected pleasures in my life, along with the interaction it\u2019s brought with people both old and new to me, so I thank you all for reading.

{"date": "February 9, 2011", "body": "I\u2019m not a big fan of mandatory schooling, as most of my readers will already know.\u00a0 Okay, I\u2019m not a fan at all.\u00a0 But I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s about time to require everyone to read Darwin\u2019s  On the Origin of Species . And I mean everyone. I read it myself last year, in a campaign of reading stuff that we should\u2019ve been assigned in school but weren\u2019t.\u00a0 I was a little bit (okay, a lot) appalled that as much as I thought I knew about evolution, I had actually attained a degree in biology without ever having read the seminal work on the subject. If you need evidence that our schools are profoundly failing to educate, consider that.\u00a0 Most biology students never have to actually read  On the Origin of Species . Or that, according to a  Times  article ( On Evolution, Biology Teachers Stray From Lesson Plan ) on a survey published in  Science  magazine last month, 86 years after the Scopes trial, only 28 percent of high school biology teachers are actually teaching the straight facts about evolution, the foundational principle of modern biology, while 13 percent are still explicitly teaching creationism. Srsly. The article shines a light on what the study calls the \u201ccautious 60 percent\u201d of biology teachers who in some way, shape or form, compromise on teaching evolution outright. In what other discipline would it not be outrageous to allow 73 percent (the 60 who don\u2019t teach evolution straight up + the 13 who openly teach creationism) of our educators to bow in deference to religious fundamentalism?\u00a0 But that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in biology.\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t there be nationwide outraged panic if it were found that an authoritarian sect of some religion other than Christianity were managing to seriously compromise how our kids are being taught? Yet this is what\u2019s going on in the overwhelming majority of our biology classrooms. One professor quoted, Randy Moore, doesn\u2019t think that better science education for instructors will help.\u00a0 \u201cThey already know what evolution is,\u201d he says.\u00a0 \u201cThey were biology majors, or  former biology students. They just reject what we told them.\u201d But do they really know what evolution is?\u00a0 I doubt it.\u00a0 If nearly three quarters of biology teachers aren\u2019t really teaching evolution or teaching it in a half-hearted way; or if they, like me, got through school as high-achieving biology students without ever reading first-hand the definitive books on the topic, then they really might not.\u00a0 And fundamentalist churches aren\u2019t simply rejecting evolution; they\u2019re lying about what the theory actually says and does not say.\u00a0 So when someone who hears about evolution in school but rejects it for religious reasons, are they honestly rejecting an accurately presented representation of evolution, or are they believing their pastor over their science teacher when it comes to what evolution by natural selection really  is ? So I come down, cautiously hopeful, on the side of the slightly more optimistic Dr. Eric Plutzer, who says that \u201cWe think the \u2018cautious 60 percent\u2019 represent a group of educators who,  if they were better trained in science in general and in evolution in  particular, would be more confident in their ability to explain  controversial topics to their students, to parents, and to school board  members.\u201d This is a cycle that can be broken, if educators know how to stand up for the facts.

{"date": "January 20, 2011", "body": "Usually, upon returning from being away from New York for the holidays, I walk back into my apartment and am shocked and appalled by the conditions I\u2019d been living in and wind up staying up until 4:00 AM cleaning.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even unpack before I clean.\u00a0 So BEFORE I left for Christmas this past year, I cleaned everything\u2013swept and mopped, scrubbed windowsills, slayed dustbunnies, changed sheets\u2026and cleaned on top of the bathroom medicine cabinet. Now there are many funny, and troubling, things about my apartment.\u00a0 Emily #2 and I often joke that, like the disturbing house of the novel  House of Leaves  that\u2019s bigger on the inside than the outside, more stuff fits in this place than physically, rationally should be possible. But the top of the medicine cabinet provides the best evidence that there is actually some kind of wormhole or other space/time anomaly at work in my apartment. I am only half kidding. We don\u2019t clean up there often, but when we do,  every  time, there\u2019s not just the dust and dirt and grime that you\u2019d expect, but  big  pieces of junk.\u00a0 And we can\u2019t figure out where it\u2019s coming from. Okay, see those two big white chunks?\u00a0 They seemed to be plaster or something similar.\u00a0 The smaller one is about half an inch across and the bigger one is more than an inch across. One corner of the bathroom\u2019s tile floor is crumbling from a succession of bad repair jobs.\u00a0 But how would this junk get from down there to up on top of the medicine cabinet? There\u2019s a hot water pipe that runs right next to the medicine cabinet, and there\u2019s a little space around the pipe through its hole in the ceiling.\u00a0 But nowhere near enough for stuff of this size to be falling through. And I\u2019m sure it would be easy for my skeptical friends out there to say, oh well, it\u2019s probably just left over from the last time your bathroom ceiling fell down.\u00a0 And it would be tempting to let myself believe that. But this phenomenon  predates , by years, the first time the bathroom ceiling fell down. So I don\u2019t know what else to believe\u2026other than that there\u2019s a wormhole in my apartment, or something like the magic karma frozen donkey wheel transport system between the Island and the Tunisian desert in  Lost , only instead of being that cool, it\u2019s between somebody else\u2019s crumbling apartment and mine.\u00a0 Or that maybe it\u2019s the NYC equivalent of  vibhuti , the ashlike substance that is supposedly the residue manifested by sages like Sai Baba in great acts of magic.\u00a0 Only I\u2019m not sure I want to know what kind of attempted metaphysical stupidity is producing this stuff. If anybody has a candidate for a rational explanation, or knows more about the odd behavior of old buildings than I do, I\u2019d love to hear it.\u00a0 Thanks in advance\u2026.

{"date": "May 2, 2010", "body": "Like many, I\u2019m sure, I\u2019ve been enjoying Jamie Oliver\u2019s Food Revolution reality show the past several weeks, and was disappointed that it was such a short series.\u00a0 At one point I remarked to my roommate that if the entire horrific, sordid history of reality television in America has led us to this point, it\u2019s been worth it.\u00a0 Much as I had qualms about one town being used as the embodiment of American ill-health, I thought it had real potential to get people interested, and angry, concerning food issues and especially how we feed children. Of course I\u2019m also aware that people and situations had to have been manipulated in the interest of making exciting television; it was still television, after all.\u00a0 Jamie had a more than slight tendency towards mild hysteria and blowing situations out of proportion, notably his assertions that if the local hospital wasn\u2019t impressed enough to donate $150,000 to his cause, or if Alice was negative with a visitor, or if DJ Rod wouldn\u2019t come over to his side, then the Food Revolution would be OVER. He was wrong, of course.\u00a0 Not insofar that the support of elected officials, local popular figures or lunch ladies is important to changing our food culture, but that the kind of overblown, invented competitions that make for suspenseful reality television will be what accomplishes the food revolution. A friend of my roommate\u2019s\u2013a kindergarten teacher\u2013was visiting over her spring break and watched a couple episodes with us.\u00a0 She e-mailed recently to say that when she went home and back to work, she asked her own kindergarten class to take the plain milk at lunch instead of the chocolate milk.\u00a0 Not only did they do it, they said that they liked it better. This will be how we actually accomplish the food revolution\u2013incrementally and cumulatively, person to person, by parents parenting (and getting together to put pressure on their own school lunch programs) and teachers teaching, through confidence that we are capable of making small but meaningful changes to make our food culture better. Jamie frequently asks his fans and readers to learn two of his recipes, and then teach them to two other people; if everyone did that, it wouldn\u2019t be long before we all knew how to cook again.\u00a0 Well, I already enjoyed cooking before the Food Revolution came along, having started making my own food, and baking, when I was about six, and most of the people I\u2019m close to here already cook as well.\u00a0 So in the spirit of spreading the revolution, dispelling the myth that good cooking must be difficult or expensive, here are a couple of my own recipes I love making and sharing. Chicken and mushroom cream sauce \nI threw this together from stuff I had in my kitchen one day. 6-7 cloves garlic \n2-3 stalks fresh rosemary \n8-10 oz. baby portobello mushrooms \n4 chicken legs (with thigh and drumstick) \nAbout 1 stick of butter \nAbout 1 cup white wine \n1/2 cup heavy cream \nBlack pepper Heat oven to 450\u00b0.\u00a0 Melt about 2 Tbsp. butter and brush over chicken legs in a baking pan.\u00a0 Put chicken in oven to brown. Mince garlic, slice mushrooms, and snip up the rosemary or strip it off its stalks if they\u2019re woody.\u00a0 In a big skillet over low heat, melt the rest of the butter.\u00a0 Add garlic and rosemary and simmer a few minutes (don\u2019t let the garlic burn!) until they start to get fragrant.\u00a0 Add the wine, return to a simmer.\u00a0 Add mushrooms.\u00a0 Continue simmering and stirring gently.\u00a0 Add cream, and keep stirring and simmering until the sauce is thickened and very fragrant.\u00a0 It may be a little brown from the mushrooms; that\u2019s okay. Check the chicken.\u00a0 When it\u2019s very nearly cooked all the way through, take it out of the oven, pour the sauce over it, and put it back for 10 minutes or so more, until it\u2019s completely done.\u00a0 Pepper to taste.\u00a0 Serve with lightly steamed green beans or asparagus. Italian Bread Salad \nMy mother taught me this.\u00a0 It\u2019s a stretch to even call it \u201ccooking,\u201d but it\u2019s an easy, light but substantial meal, wonderful in the summertime.\u00a0 It came about as a way to not let stale bread go to waste.\u00a0 I made it all the time when I worked in a little Belgian caf\u00e9 here and was always coming home with half-stale baguettes. 1 stale baguette or Italian bread. \nAny combination of the following: sliced Roma tomatoes, red onion, cucumbers, and olives \nA little crumbled feta cheese \nA couple tablespoons olive oil \nA dash of balsamic vinegar \nBlack pepper Cut the hard bread into chunks about 1\u2033 square.\u00a0 Place in large bowl or pot with all the veggies and cheese.\u00a0 Add just enough olive oil to coat the bread mixture and a dash or two of balsamic vinegar.\u00a0 Cover the pot and shake to mix well.\u00a0 Leave covered in the refrigerator overnight.\u00a0 The bread will become tender and chewy again from the oil and moisture from the vegetables. ***** I\u2019m always on the search for simple, good recipes myself, so share yours, and support the Food Revolution, in the comments.

So we\u2019ve been drinking it for a couple days, and so far no ill effects.\u00a0 Still, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d recommend this mode of consumption on a regular basis.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably not a reliable outcome of just leaving stuff in the back of your fridge\u2013we just got a lucky batch of wild yeast.\u00a0 It\u2019s mellowed out and gotten a little dryer since we first tasted it. I came home from a long day of dance workshopping yesterday and poured myself a glass, with just a little Smirnoff dashed in for oomph, to relax over an episode of This American Life, and went to bed early.

{"date": "May 6, 2010", "body": "In his New York Times op-ed yesterday,  \u201cTearing Away the Veil,\u201d  French politician Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9 attempts to make the case for France\u2019s impending legal ban of the wearing of Islamic veils\u2013the burqa or niqab\u2013in public.\u00a0 He convincingly does just the opposite.\u00a0 His argument for the ban is a snide and condescending apology for authoritarianism.\u00a0 He claims to be arguing for a reaffirmation of liberty, but it\u2019s clear that he has no idea what religious liberty is.\u00a0 He claims the practice of wearing a burqa is a \u201cblow against the dignity of women,\u201d but his own arguments are just as contemptuous and intolerant of women and their freedom to make decisions\u2013especially unpopular decisions\u2013to live on their own terms as are the clerics and cultures which enforce the wearing of the burqa. He, too, fears women who do not behave as he thinks they should. None of his justifications for his assertions that the ban is necessary for public safety or for the defense of French principles of liberty and fraternity even hold up to logical scrutiny, and are in fact a threat to the freedom of  all  citizens, not only Muslim women who wear a veil. First, he claims that the allowance of full-face veils is a serious security problem in a society dependent on security cameras to maintain safety and order.\u00a0 \u201cAs a mayor, I  cannot guarantee the protection of the residents for  whom I am responsible if masked people are allowed to run about,\u201d he says, and cites an example of a man in a ski mask who committed several robberies in a Paris suburb. Has this man ever experienced winter in Chicago or Minneapolis?\u00a0 I dare him.\u00a0 Masked people running about everywhere!\u00a0 Oh noes!\u00a0 A couple years ago in New York, we had a man in a ninja costume rob seven houses in Staten Island.\u00a0 Ban the ninja costumes!\u00a0 We cannot have ninjas running about! This reasoning is silly, of course, and factually absurd.\u00a0 Major cities all over the world allow masked people to run about all winter long.\u00a0 The visibility of the face in public is  not  always a public safety requirement.\u00a0 What\u2019s serious, and disturbing, is that Cop\u00e9 presumes the criminality of his citizenry, and suggests that it\u2019s their responsibility to live so as not to inconvenience the security cameras.\u00a0 Has he even read  1984 ?\u00a0 His example of not allowing people to walk naked down 5th Avenue not being an encroachment on liberty is the wrong one entirely; the correct one would be, are people allowed to walk down 5th Avenue masked?\u00a0 And of course, they are. Secondly, his appeal to social norms as mandatory for maintaining a political community and its dedication to equality and fraternity is a threat to anyone who has trouble with conforming to those norms or who chooses any expression of nonconformity.\u00a0 \u201cHow can you establish a relationship with a person who, by hiding a  smile or a glance \u2014 those universal signs of our common humanity \u2014  refuses to exist in the eyes of others?\u201d he asks.\u00a0 Really, this is so hard?\u00a0 By talking with them and listening.\u00a0 Treating them kindness and courtesy on the basis of the simple  fact  of their humanity.\u00a0 God help the blind or autistic, stroke victims, the facially disfigured, or simply shy people\u2013what do you do with them now, Mr. Cop\u00e9?\u00a0 People establish relationships with others by letter, phone and internet, without ever seeing their faces, on the basis of shared feeling and humanity, every single day. Cop\u00e9 tries to discredit veil-wearing by citing experts who say it isn\u2019t actually required in the Koran, but this is irrelevant to civil government.\u00a0 In the US, hundreds of different denominations have very different interpretations of what the Bible requires.\u00a0 The government is not in the business of deciding their validity; it protects all religious practice to the extent that it doesn\u2019t do violence to the rights of others.\u00a0 It\u2019s a danger to  all  religious liberty if we give any credence to the proposition that the government can take  any  holy book and dictate which is the acceptable interpretation. Finally, Cop\u00e9 maintains a profound ignorance of how integral and necessary religious belief and practice may be to religious people\u2019s understanding of their own personhood.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t have to like it, but he doesn\u2019t seem to have any inkling of it.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t consider that the veil may have meaning to women who wear it which is utterly different from his own presumptions of its meaning, and his presumptions are arrogant and insulting:\u00a0 \u201cThe person who wears one is no longer identifiable; she is a shadow  among others, lacking individuality, avoiding responsibility.\u201d\u00a0 But it is  his  prejudice which makes this true in his eyes; he makes no apparent effort to understand what the veil means to women who wear it.\u00a0 It is  his  prejudice and fear which robs her of individuality and human identity, not the veil. It is  his  attitude which excludes veiled women from participation in democratic society.\u00a0  He  is attempting to impose a \u201ccondition for living together\u201d that will force women to reject either their religious practice, or their participation in society.\u00a0  He  is the one trying to forcibly exclude veiled women; the veil itself cannot do that. If the French are disturbed by the implications of women choosing to wear the burqa, they would do better, and be truer to their purported principles, to redouble efforts to simply show respect and tolerance in normal, daily interactions with both veiled and unveiled women, demonstrating incontrovertibly to Muslim women that with or without a veil, they can expect to be treated with dignity, equality, and civility in France.\u00a0 But Cop\u00e9\u2019s ignorant and bullying apologetic for the ban demonstrates the opposite: that a woman will not be trusted to live on her own terms in France. Even the imagery of his article\u2019s title,  tearing  away the veil, suggests violence, not liberty, not equality, certainly not fraternity.\u00a0 He is saying to Muslim women, you will be exposed to the extent that makes  us  comfortable, or you will not be allowed to participate in society.

{"date": "May 20, 2010", "body": "I distinctly remember a book called  Pillars of the Earth , by Ken Follett, sitting on my parents\u2019 bookshelf in the loft of our house for much of my childhood, and then on a shelf in a spare room of my mother\u2019s house for all of my adolescence, and always in my continual quest to find something to read, I would see it, and decline to pick it up and read it.\u00a0 It looked boring, in my childhood judgment. Then last Christmas, literally as I was about to leave to get on a plane back to New York, my mother brought out her copy from the spare room for me and said she thought I would like it.\u00a0 Why then, I have no idea.\u00a0 But I did read it.\u00a0 It was not boring. Pillars of the Earth  follows the trials of a family of builders, and their adopted town, in their ambitions to build a cathedral in 12th-century England.\u00a0 The eventual heroes are Jack, the illegitimate son of an outlaw woman and a mysterious traveler, and Aliena, noble-born, disinherited, and self-made merchant, whose unlikely romance flourishes against all taboos and obstacles thrown in their way.\u00a0 Quickly it became one of my favorite books; despite somewhat flat and clunky writing, Follett\u2019s storytelling is masterful.\u00a0 I wanted it never to end. I didn\u2019t know there was a sequel until tipped off by a colleague as we were trading book recommendations:\u00a0  World Without End , released almost 20 years after the original.\u00a0 Oh joy! \u201cWe normally think of history as one catastrophe after another, war followed by war, outrage by outrage\u2013almost as if history were nothing more than all the narratives of human pain, assembled in sequence.\u00a0 And surely this is, often enough, an adequate description.\u00a0 But history is also the narratives of grace, the recountings of those blessed and inexplicable moments when someone did something for someone else, saved a life, bestowed a gift, gave something beyond what was required by circumstance,\u201d  writes Thomas Cahill in his introduction to  How the Irish Saved Civilization , and there could hardly be a better characterization of the situation of the characters in  World Without End , whose story picks up 200 years after the conclusion of  Pillars of the Earth  with Caris and Merthin, descendants of Jack and Aliena, childhood friends navigating a troubled love affair on the verge of the beginning of the Black Plague.\u00a0 Except that I would add to the graces of historical narrative, the desperate efforts and innovations of people bent on little more than survival.\u00a0 Reading  World Without End , I found myself again stricken strongly with the lament, \u201cWow, they really didn\u2019t teach us anything in school about how history actually  works .\u201d Many conflicts are illustrated through the hardships faced by the characters of medieval Kingsbridge: peasants versus cruel and despotic nobles, poor families against hunger and cold, reason against magical thinking and superstition, independent women and ambitious girls against institutionalized misogyny, the rigid and all-powerful church against the interests of the people it governed, circumstances continually stacked against people without money or influence, and rule of law against the presumed superiority and \u201cmight makes right\u201d mentality of the ruling classes.\u00a0 In one sense, the both the book, and the course of history, could be conceived of as the narrative of the vulnerable learning to stand up to bullies of all kinds, in all times and places. But Follett\u2019s narrative implicitly proposes an even more central conflict of history: that between people who are sincerely trying to accomplish, build, or create something; and those seek primarily to advance their own position or ensure their own power.\u00a0 The astonishing but elegantly simple thesis of  World Without End  is that the advancement of humanity rides on the triumph of those who create or build something real over the obstructionism of those who seek only to advance themselves (usually by controlling or oppressing other people).\u00a0 The heroes of this book are not heroes because they\u2019re particularly admirable as people (often, they aren\u2019t), or because of their resilience in the face of impossible odds, or even because they\u2019re less self-interested than their powerful adversaries, but because they find a purpose in building something real, or in making their world richer, more fair and less cruel as it directly affects the real lives of themselves and their neighbors, when they see that the only obstacles to a truly better world are the ego, incompetence, rigidity, or spitefulness of those in higher position.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t set out to change the course of Western civilization, but just to do something worth doing\u2013building a cathedral, a hospital, a bridge\u2013or even simply what they  needed  to do under the circumstances to survive or to preserve their human dignity and autonomy\u2013starting a new business, becoming master of a craft, figuring out how to grow a new crop to lift your family out of serfdom, standing up for your legal rights when they\u2019re all you have left.\u00a0 And in so doing, they became the great gift-givers of history, the hinges upon which would hang the fate of the world as we know it today. In yet another curious incident of thought-pattern synchrony this week, Rachel Maddow gave the  commencement address  at Smith College, telling the graduates that, sometimes, \u201cpersonal triumphs are overrated,\u201d illustrated by stories of people whose personal aspirations to fame turned out very badly for society, as opposed to people who found \u201cglory\u201d in real creation and lasting contributions to human well-being.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t be the granddad, don\u2019t be the grandma, whose temporal, personal triumph is something that you only hope gets forgotten in history,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cGunning not just for personal triumph for yourself but for durable achievement for life is the difference between winning things, and leadership.\u201d\u00a0 I can\u2019t help thinking that Merthin and Caris would agree.\u00a0 The entire speech is well worth watching.

In  Back From the Future  from the April 2010 issue of Discover Magazine, Zeeya Merali explores the emergence of the hypothesis of \u201cbackwards causality,\u201d or how the bizarre and counterintuitive rules of quantum physics predict that not only do the events of the past cause the circumstances of the present, but that the events of the  future  affect those of the past, and what this implies for human decision-making and free will.\u00a0 (Do not fear, my non-science-y friends and readers; the writing is very clear and straightforward.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to be a physicist to be able to understand or be amazed by it.) I watched Ok Go\u2019s music video,  This Too Shall Pass , about 15 times in a row the night that a cast member told me I had to go home and google it, it made me so viscerally and irrationally happy.\u00a0 The story of the video is quite amazing; knowing what kind of video they wanted to make, the band enlisted the help of 20 engineers and physicists to plan it; the Rube-Goldberg apparatus took 3 months to set up, and 89 takes to obtain the footage of it running smoothly.\u00a0 The perfection of the mechanics, musical timing and sensory and emotional beauty of the piece are stunning for just how  not  inevitable that perfection was, but rather the result of voluminous planning, history, fortune, focus, relentlessness of purpose, torturous tech rehearsals, and thousands of ineffable and seemingly inconsequential decisions which lighted the path to the final frame. Recently I looked around at my world, and my life, on a sunny late afternoon in SoHo as I was on my way back from dinner to a rehearsal and thought with thankfulness and amazement, \u201cwow, everything here feels  right  right now.\u201d\u00a0 I believe that the universe, or fate, or God, offers us signposts and signals, if we\u2019re paying attention, that we\u2019re on the path where we should be\u2026and that\u2019s what these two little snippets of human creation felt like, as well as reminders that your fate is not a single ultimate destination, or inevitable outcome, but the entirety of the way in which you live your life.

{"date": "May 31, 2010", "body": "A friend sent me an  article  last weekend from the  Chicago Tribune , entitled \u201cTransition to Adulthood Takes Longer than Ever,\u201d filled with now-familiar tales of the impact of the Great Recession on the career goals and financial independence of young adults: low-wage service sector jobs, college graduates returning to live with parents, and career and further-education plans on indefinite hold.\u00a0 According to the MacArthur Research Network, far fewer young adults in the year 2009 had reached five common rites of passage, known as \u201ctraditional markers of maturity,\u201d than in 1960.\u00a0 The five markers are: living independently, completion of schooling, full-time employment, marriage, and children. The problem is, I think the article (and a great many like it), as well as popular imagination, falsely conflates two different phenomenon\u2014that of extended childhood and adolescence, and that of increasing economic barriers to specific, material, culturally desired behaviors.\u00a0 Both may very well be real, and absolutely are related, but I wonder if there aren\u2019t also real and negative consequences to young adults of our common, but false, conflation of emotional maturity\u2014or real adulthood\u2014with economic enfranchisement.\u00a0 I don\u2019t necessarily think there\u2019s a problem with using the incidence of these milestones to help track broader economic or lifestyle trends, but the way in which these metrics being used more colloquially to judge adulthood is deceptive and superficial. Obviously, the five markers are only easily-measurable stand-ins for real characteristics of adulthood, and by using the former to talk about the latter, we risk mistaking them for each other. The only one I can easily agree with, for the most part, is the first.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s extremely difficult to know yourself fully as a self-sufficient person, and your capabilities, if you haven\u2019t lived away from your parents\u2013and college dorm living doesn\u2019t count.\u00a0 (And even then, other cultures don\u2019t judge this to be the case; it\u2019s common around the world for three or more generations to share a household continuously.)\u00a0 The others have fairly gaping logical holes when it comes to their usefulness as representations of actual maturity.\u00a0 Haven\u2019t plenty of woefully immature and ill-prepared people graduated from high school and college?\u00a0 Gotten full-time jobs?\u00a0 Gotten married too young to partners they didn\u2019t know well enough?\u00a0 Had children when they were in no emotional or financial state to support them very well? Isn\u2019t it a more mature position to put off marriage and children if you know you\u2019re too young or not financially secure? Additionally, the traditional five criteria of maturity exclude certain groups of people almost entirely from economic consideration as full adults.\u00a0 Arts professionals and freelancers, for instance, may be very unlikely to have a single, stable, full-time job, or consistent full-time employment.\u00a0 For instance, though I started working at 15, have often worked 80-hour weeks, held multiple jobs at once, and been consistently financially self-sufficient since graduation from college\u2026I\u2019ve never held a full-time job.\u00a0 I probably never will. Same-sex marriage is still illegal in 45 states.\u00a0 According to the traditional markers of maturity, gay and lesbian citizens are definitionally excluded from full adulthood merely by virtue of sexual orientation, regardless of their desire to marry or participation in long-term committed relationships.\u00a0 Six states have outlawed or severely restricted gays, lesbians, and same-sex partners from adopting or fostering children, and regardless of state law, same-sex couples face far higher logistical hurdles even to have biological children (and clearly are drastically less likely to experience unplanned pregnancies\u2014the cause of 50% of all children).\u00a0 So on the count of having children, again, LGBT citizens are far less likely to be counted as full adults than their straight counterparts. The common usage of the markers of maturity designates one particular model of work and family life as mature or adult\u2013completion of college, obtaining a full-time job, heterosexual marriage and children\u2013and effectively discounts different life choices which equally mature people might make as valid models of adulthood: lifelong singlehood, whether chosen or not; childlessness, whether chosen or not; long-term partnership without marriage; declining high school or college attendance if it doesn\u2019t fit your goals in life; creative or independent work which would never be described as a full-time \u201cjob;\u201d living in a multi-generational household if that would be the best thing for your family. When we\u2019re talking about whether young people are taking longer to grow up, I think we need to talk about the real characteristics of adulthood that the \u201ctraditional markers of maturity\u201d are only arbitrary representations of.\u00a0 Goal-orientation and completion rather than school completion.\u00a0 Dedication to an occupation or meaningful work rather than full-time job.\u00a0 Sustenance of long-term, intimate relationships (including with lifelong friends) rather than marriage; reliability rather than simply having had children, which, by itself, in no way demonstrates the skills which we wish it did.\u00a0 And also the traits necessary for a rich and independent life, especially during financially difficult times, which aren\u2019t explicitly represented by the five markers at all: good judgment, self-direction, resilience, creativity and problem-solving, adaptability and ability to adjust expectations. I think it  is  true that people are taking longer to grow up; I\u2019ve seen people only a few years younger than I am, almost completely unable to function confidently in the world: to go to the library to apply for a library card or register to vote or pick up tax forms, to conduct their own financial affairs, to cook, to become familiar with their neighborhood and find their way around, to make decisions or act independently of others\u2019 opinions or approval.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not for lack of a residence, college degree, job, or marriage; it\u2019s some kind of basic lack of engagement and confidence with the world, of which I\u2019m not sure of the origin. I fear that if what we\u2019re telling young adults is that being an adult is contingent on these particular markers, and they give every indication of remaining out of financial reach for the foreseeable future, it\u2019s a discouragement from thinking of themselves\u2014and behaving\u2014as real adults.\u00a0 There\u2019s an implication that you haven\u2019t accomplished the right things if you haven\u2019t accomplished these things, and that\u2019s a discouragement for young adults to think confidently and flexibly of their real options and choices, and an encouragement of superficiality.\u00a0 That\u2019s the opposite of what we should want to accomplish. Further, there are troubling implications for civil rights.\u00a0 Many of our rights as citizens are conferred or denied on the basis of age as a proxy for presumed maturity: not just the commonly celebrated vices of ability to buy alcohol and tobacco, to gamble, visit a strip club or get a tattoo; but obtaining a full driver\u2019s license, voting, running for public office, having the confidentiality of your medical treatment, and your bodily autonomy, guaranteed; military service; ability to sign a binding contract.\u00a0 If it becomes commonly accepted that people who have not attained particular milestones are not actually full adults, then the presumption of their right or ability to participate fully in democratic society could be imperiled.

{"date": "March 3, 2010", "body": "I really don\u2019t intend this to be a blog primarily about education issues\u2026they just happen to be the news articles that are catching my attention this week, and today proves no exception. This is something that I\u2019m very torn about.\u00a0 ( In Middle School, Charting Their Course to College and Beyond , NYT 2/28/10)\u00a0 Students in the North Brunswick, NJ school district will soon all have individualized education plans, or \u201cpersonalized student learning plans,\u201d as called in the article.\u00a0 The idea is that every kid, starting in 6th grade, has an online profile which they can use continuously along with parents and counselors to chart their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and career goals. I have long been ranting that kids need much more personal discretion to pursue their own interests, in school, more course choices, more freedom to do what they really want to do as the only path to true excellence in anything.\u00a0 So it\u2019s very tempting to see  any  step away from \u201cone size fits all\u201d education, away from disproportionate focus on correcting students\u2019 weaknesses instead of supporting and encouraging their strengths (which I tend to think actually reinforces the weaknesses in the long run), toward giving kids more insight and control over their college and career fates as a good thing. But I\u2019m sort of skeptical of this plan. One of my favorite frequent letter writers at Salon.com once wrote \u201cBe careful what you wish for, when it\u2019s going to be implemented by idiots.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s sort of how I feel about this.\u00a0 It looks really good, foolproof almost, but it could go really wrong in the wrong hands. Firstly, do the schools actually have the volume of course selection in middle school that would allow students to act on their career desires?\u00a0 Mine sure as hell didn\u2019t\u2013and we were in a relatively affluent district. Do teachers and counselors have the time and knowledge to assist and encourage students in pursuit of off-the-beaten-academic-path interests?\u00a0 Are the schools willing to give the kids the  freedom of time  during school hours to really pursue what they want?\u00a0 Forgive me, but I doubt it. Already, some of the school people quoted in the article are demonstrating some real wrongheadedness about what this system should mean for students: \u201cIf you don\u2019t know yourself and think you want to be a biologist, you may realize in your sophomore year in college you don\u2019t like science,\u201d said Mercedes Arias, a Linwood language arts coordinator who is helping develop the learning plans. \u201cYou should have really figured that out sooner.\u201d But, really?\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m all for people learning to be more self-aware and honest about what they want, but demanding this kind of decision-making of 11-year-olds is a bit harsh.\u00a0 Especially in the context of the way our whole culture is currently structured, they haven\u2019t had any chance to find those things out for themselves.\u00a0 Maybe going that far in science before realizing that it wasn\u2019t for you was vital to figuring out what you DID want to do.\u00a0 Maybe that kid will still maintain a lifelong interest in biology; she just realizes that doing it as a career isn\u2019t really what she wants.\u00a0 And the way that the school system currently isolates kids completely from the real world of work, you  don\u2019t  really see how professionals in your field work until you get to college.\u00a0 Why the blame on the kid?\u00a0 Kids that young should have the freedom to explore, the freedom to make mistakes.\u00a0 Even big mistakes.\u00a0 Especially big mistakes. And who really makes it to college before realizing that they  really  don\u2019t like science?\u00a0 In my observation, the vast majority of my classmates were openly science-phobic a long, long time before that. Secondly, I see the potential for this to become just another constriction on students\u2019 lives and interests, or another avenue for tracking kids into essentially permanent trajectories based on testing performance.\u00a0 Under the guise, even the intent, of giving kids more control, it could actually give them less.\u00a0 It could be a real trap for kids who have certain things expected of them by even the most well-meaning parents or teachers.\u00a0 Imagine how this could go for kids interested in exploring something outside their main area of interest: KID:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019d like to maybe try another art class this semester.\u201d But that\u2019s not in your learning plan. That\u2019s not working towards your goal of being a doctor. That\u2019s not at all what the Matchmaker test identified as your ideal career. If I can use myself as an example\u2026I was always, from childhood, interested in theatrical and performance art.\u00a0 I would beg for speaking roles in church plays.\u00a0 But no one would take me seriously, because I was a such a shy kid.\u00a0 Not that I thought I wanted to be an actress, but I was very interested in that realm.\u00a0 Only no one around me understood anything at all about the variety of functions necessary and careers available in the arts world, or else someone might\u2019ve been able to help me out more with getting involved in a way that fit my strengths.\u00a0 I took an acting class in high school and got involved with the production of the school musicals, and everyone acted shocked, just shocked! that I would do such a thing\u2013I was quiet and good at science.\u00a0 And I was thinking  but this is what I SAID I wanted all along and no one would pay attention\u2013you\u2019re only shocked that I actually DID something about it given the chance.  I even had one of those career matcher tests come back with \u201cvisual or performing arts\u201d listed as my top match and no one would believe it. I was even about to go to college as an English major.\u00a0 And then one day my junior year, I realized  I like  reading .\u00a0 I\u2019ve thoroughly hated every single English class I\u2019ve ever been in, because they just ruin the experience of reading. So I entered college with a biology/drama double major.\u00a0 And no actual idea what I was going to do for a living.\u00a0 I was a sophomore before I knew\u2013the very first time I even ever  heard  of stage management, I knew, immediately and without a shred of doubt, that that was what I was supposed to do.\u00a0 Was it a late discovery? Maybe, but it was the  right  time, for who I was and where I was.\u00a0 I do still take an intense interest in biology and am glad I have the background; I don\u2019t look at all those years as wasted.\u00a0 Or the time I spent in acting, creative writing, journalism, or chemistry in high school; the broad and eclectic foundation of humanistic knowledge turned out to be a perfect foundation for what I eventually knew I wanted to do, even though I couldn\u2019t have known it at the time.\u00a0 But according to language arts coordinator Arias, I \u201cshould really have figured that out sooner.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, but what does she know? Many educators and parents say that creating learning plans for everyone can better prepare students for college, and motivate even low achievers to work harder by showing them that what they want matters, too. I do appreciate the attempt at giving students more control and personal investment\u2026but for heaven\u2019s sake, what does it say that this is a fairly new idea\u2013that what students WANT actually matters?\u00a0 And it shouldn\u2019t \u201cmatter, too.\u201d\u00a0 It should matter  primarily .\u00a0 I\u2019d be interested to see whether the schools are backing this up with available course selection, flexibility, and free time to pursue individual projects. I think the potential for students to take more control and more interest in their own futures is high, but the potential for misuse or gross oversimplification by teachers and parents, or for this to become just one more burden on kids who don\u2019t learn and grow on the same time line as everyone else, is also high. At best, though, perhaps this could be a tool by which students could pressure their school systems to actually give them more freedom in support of their personalized plans.

Naturally and understandably, these proposals caused fear, concern, and anger among the student population, and a lively listserv discussion ensued about the most effective methods of protest.

Basically, Salon did an article entitled \u201cHipsters on Food Stamps,\u201d with the tag line \u201cThey\u2019re young, they\u2019re broke, and they pay for organic salmon with government subsidies.\u00a0 Got a problem with that?\u201d and what could\u2019ve been an insightful piece on a group that we don\u2019t normally think of as using food stamps\u2013the young, childless, highly educated intellectual/creative class\u2013now finding themselves turning to them, or about the fact that it\u2019s actually possible to eat decently on a limited budget, got turned into an article practically guaranteed not to shed enlightenment but to elicit reflexive outrage at entitled young \u201chipsters\u201d using government handouts to buy luxury foods. One of the subjects of the first article wrote a  response  about how he was portrayed in an unnecessarily frivolous manner, and some of the real issues he\u2019s dealing with, which is more than worth reading. My friend Steven wrote a very personal response  today , so I figured I\u2019d better get my act together, but what really elicits the following is a commonality of anger and indignation I\u2019m hearing from both family members and friends\u2013some of whom may be reading, and I hope they\u2019ll comment\u2013at people who use public assistance and the low-income: presumed beneficiaries of things like the health care bill, benefits that were part of the stimulus package, and a more progressive tax code this year.\u00a0 \u201cThe government just makes it too easy for people to not do what they\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d my mother said.\u00a0 A fairly common refrain from a friend with whom I debate often is \u201cAt what point are people ever going to be allowed to fail without the government to step in and save them?\u201d I\u2019ve heard more than once that I wouldn\u2019t be so supportive of Obama, or progressive taxes generally, if I made more money, and a whole lot of consternation over the threat of policies which \u201ctake money away from people who work and give it to those who don\u2019t.\u201d The first misapprehension to get out of the way is that we do in fact take a lot of money from people who work and just give it those who don\u2019t.\u00a0 We don\u2019t.\u00a0 You can\u2019t be an able-bodied adult and just decide you don\u2019t want to work, and live off of public assistance.\u00a0 Almost every available program has some kind of work hours or placement requirement. Secondly, there seems to be a perception that the poor have it easy, or that we\u2019re poor only because we don\u2019t work hard enough, or enjoy being able to take advantage of government money.\u00a0 So let me share some personal experience: I applied for food stamps once.\u00a0 I was in my stage management internship, on a stipend of something like $216 per week after taxes, if memory serves.\u00a0 I.e. $864/month.\u00a0 I actually tried to survive on that for a few weeks, tightly rationing 3 meals a day, no snacks\u2026and then I was just too hungry.\u00a0 My stomach hurt all the time.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t think.\u00a0 I sold a toaster on Craigslist for $10 to do my laundry one week.\u00a0 So I went to apply for food stamps.\u00a0 It was a horrible, degrading experience which I do not wish to repeat. I certainly wasn\u2019t ashamed nor did I feel undeserving of them\u2013I was after all  working  for very little\u2013even my hyper-conservative, solidly anti-social safety net Republican father said \u201cYou\u2019ve paid taxes; it\u2019s just YOUR money.\u201d\u00a0 Still, I felt\u2026strange, out of place, going to the food stamps office.\u00a0 Like a well-educated, ambitious person like me shouldn\u2019t need this, or someone who\u2019s voluntarily gone to work in the arts has made their own bed and shouldn\u2019t have the nerve to ask for help. But if you weren\u2019t ashamed to begin with, they\u2019d make you ashamed. In the waiting room of the food stamps office we were treated like criminals.\u00a0 Very stupid criminals.\u00a0 Appointments were running 3 hours behind schedule and we literally were not allowed to ask any questions about why, or what was going on, or if we might reschedule.\u00a0 The room was windowless and I had a claustrophobia-induced panic attack.\u00a0 I finally saw a social services worker, who talked to me like I was a dimwitted child who\u2019d done something bad.\u00a0 I was crying by that point. I got denied for not providing a FULL bank statement, which was just a  level of intrusiveness that I couldn\u2019t deal with, so I never even got to  the stage where you have to be  fingerprinted .\u00a0 I didn\u2019t bother to appeal; the initial experience had been tiring and depressing enough. It\u2019s not easy being poor; it\u2019s hard, and it\u2019s not only those who don\u2019t want to work hard enough, or didn\u2019t bother to get an education, or had children too young, who wind up poor.\u00a0 Sometimes, it\u2019s people like me.\u00a0 Especially now. I don\u2019t consider myself a hipster; I\u2019m nowhere near cool enough, to start with.\u00a0 I still qualify for food stamps based on income, though I\u2019m sure many people, including some friends, would think that I don\u2019t deserve them: I\u2019m single, childless, relatively healthy and knowingly entered a low-paying artistic profession.\u00a0 And while usually I say that I\u2019d have to be  much  more desperate than I am to repeat the first experience I had\u2026sometimes lately I wonder if it would actually be the more responsible thing to do to go apply again.\u00a0 I\u2019d be able to look out for my health better.\u00a0 I\u2019d be able to save more money and pay down my remaining credit card balances faster (which I ran up mainly with groceries), and food stamps are a good deal for everyone: they return, last I heard, $1.71 to the economy for every government dollar spent.\u00a0 So every person on food stamps is actually helping the economy and their neighborhood, especially if they spend them on locally grown food, more than they would by struggling nobly and unnecessarily. My point, I suppose, and the unintended lesson of the pair of Salon articles, is that it\u2019s easy to condemn with superficial information.\u00a0 But reality on an individual basis is much more complicated.

{"date": "April 18, 2011", "body": "I\u2019ve sort of been looking out for an excuse to write about this topic, and lo and behold, I got a  request  (thank you  bbsmum !). One day in college I was sick in bed, and asked a friend to bring me over some tea and books.\u00a0 One of the books she brought me from her personal stack of library books was Grace Llewellyn\u2019s  Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life & Education .\u00a0 As evidence of how much she said she\u2019d loved it herself, it was already weeks overdue. I\u2019d never heard of unschooling before, but I was a convert.\u00a0 I mean, I sort of understood, with that book, how people become religious zealots.\u00a0 It so succinctly and vividly captured everything that I felt was Wrong with the public education system. At its most basic, the concept of \u201cunschooling\u201d contests the premise of the traditional school system that children best learn what they need to know by being forcibly confined to a classroom for 7 hours a day, 9 months a year, for 13 years, and mandated to learn all the same things at the same time in the same way as everyone else for most of those years.\u00a0 I\u2019ve come to think of it as \u201cfactory-style schooling.\u201d Rather, the premise of the unschooling movement is that children come as they are desperate to learn, they don\u2019t much have to be coerced or threatened into it, that people learn best by doing first-hand what they\u2019re truly interested in.\u00a0 That the wide world is full of educational opportunities free for the asking and people should be able to use whatever resources work best for their own purposes.\u00a0 And that, intrinsically, children deserve no less than adults to be taken seriously as people worthy of respect and of having a say in the conduct of their own lives. Some caveats: I\u2019m speaking of the American compulsory public school system in its predominant form.\u00a0 I\u2019m not against the idea of any schools ever, at all.\u00a0 I have no personal experience of charter schools, specialty schools like Montessori or Waldorf or schools designed to accommodate specific disabilities or special interests, so I don\u2019t have any basis on which to make generalizations or criticisms of them.\u00a0 I know that people choose those educational options for a whole variety of reasons (the operative word being  choose ).\u00a0 And I know that some public schools are doing really wonderful things (one of the coolest in my opinion being the  New York Harbor School ) to give their students greater opportunity for self-direction and creativity. I\u2019ll try to be brief (ha), as there are many good books on this subject, about some of the reasons I think unschooling is worthy of consideration as an alternative to how we currently educate most of our kids: 1.  The school system does not have students\u2019 best interests at heart. \u00a0 It can\u2019t.\u00a0 It\u2019s incapable of having any respect for individual learning needs, life needs, passions or ambitions that fall outside the narrow parameters it\u2019s designed to allow.\u00a0 Because the system isn\u2019t designed to give impassioned minds as free a reign in their own highest development as possible, but to keep as many young people under control in as small a space as possible.\u00a0 The convenience of the system will always take precedence over individual well-being. 2.  The school system is dishonest .\u00a0 It lies to students about what life is really like and what will be required of them.\u00a0 The traits most required for success in school are obedience and credulity, whereas the traits most required for success in life are creative problem solving, courage and critical thinking.\u00a0 Rather than discouraging immaturity, ignorance and short-sightedness, it exploits those traits to keep students under control with fear of the future.\u00a0 Adults with any self-regard wouldn\u2019t put up with a fraction of the disrespect, humiliation and absurdity that school kids do every day only because they don\u2019t know that they have a choice.\u00a0 By isolating students from working adults and from the world as it really is, schools create the impression that the knowledge they offer is all there is, and the way they require learning is the only valid way.\u00a0 The system calls people failures who simply can\u2019t do things the way it demands.\u00a0 It says that education is something separate from real life by cutting students off from the world around them and from genuine experience.\u00a0 It says that life is something you\u2019re preparing for, that you\u2019ll be qualified for upon graduation, not something that you  are  living. 3.  Age grading  reinforces immaturity.\u00a0 It deprives kids of older classmates to be role models and mentors, younger classmates to be models and mentors  for , and pathologizes healthy and helpful relationships between students of all ages as developmentally inappropriate or undesirable.\u00a0 It demands that there\u2019s a right or a wrong age to learn any given subject or skill. 4.\u00a0  I\u2019ve made this argument before, so I\u2019ll truly keep it short here:  the main values instilled by the school system are obedience, conformity, and fear of authority.\u00a0 Those are not the traits we most need citizens to have to fix our democracy, our economy, and our environment. 5.  The real world is so much better , so beautiful, wondrous, strange, astonishing and so full of things to learn to do.\u00a0 Thirteen years is too long to spend locked up. Though I\u2019m tempted to try to anticipate and preemptively answer some of the more common objections to the unschooling movement, I\u2019m curious to see what will naturally come up in discussion.\u00a0 So comments section, take it away!

Much as I enjoyed this fascinating blog, the need for it was always a melancholy thing in itself, necessitated by the constant loss of New York the way it used to be, not just the danger (which I won\u2019t mourn) and grit, but appreciation for beauty and grace rather than just functionalism and profit\u2013which I can\u2019t say I ever really knew myself, having only moved here about 6 years ago this summer, but even so, I can feel the difference between the first time I visited and now.\u00a0 The proliferation of bank branches, chain drugstores, and Starbucks is\u2026disheartening.\u00a0 St. Mark\u2019s Place looks like a tourist trap, a theme park version of the countercultural haven it used to be.\u00a0 Brand new giant glass luxury condo towers blight the skylines of my own neighborhood\u2013crassly discordant and out of context in this largely Hispanic working class neighborhood of townhouses and pre-war walk-ups bordered by three parks.\u00a0 And don\u2019t even get me started on Williamsburg.\u00a0 I don\u2019t consider myself a privileged young transient or a long-term tourist here; I\u2019d like to stay for many more years, and yet I worry seriously about the continuing affordability of doing so (not that I know where else I\u2019d be able to live and still earn a living) if something doesn\u2019t change drastically. What makes me sadder, and more anxious, is when Brooks says in his farewell letter that in five years of keeping the blog, he doesn\u2019t feel that his writing has made any real difference in the course of events.\u00a0 That makes me wonder what kind of chance writers, artists, and agitators of all kinds really have when up against the basically unlimited money and power of business interests and callous and opportunistic \u201cleaders.\u201d Still, I\u2019m not quite as pessimistic as Brooks.\u00a0 Change is really the only constant; old New York is worth mourning, but nothing, nowhere, ever gets to stay the same.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that things only get worse.\u00a0 Last year we got the High Line Park (an abandoned elevated train track converted into a floating garden walk), and next year we\u2019re scheduled to get the High Bridge pedestrian promenade back.\u00a0 My neighborhood (which shall remain unnamed) has also seen the opening of several eclectic small caf\u00e9s and bars, and the best cheapo Chinese takeout place ever, in previously empty or ramshackle corner storefronts, not just the monstrous luxury condos.

I have news for the creators of NERD GIRLS.\u00a0 I was a nerd.\u00a0 I am a nerd.\u00a0 And it wasn\u2019t fun.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t sexy.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t pretty; I still can\u2019t stand the feel of makeup on my face.\u00a0 Things were not good for me, and nobody wanted me the way I was, for many, many years.\u00a0 But THAT is not what you want to make a TV show about, because that\u2019s not what your audiences want to see and acknowledge. \u201cWhy are Nerd Girls hot right now?\u201d the website asks.\u00a0 But nerd girls are not hot right now.\u00a0 A romanticized, superficial and highly-sexualized fetishization of a fantasy girl pretending to be a nerd is hot right now.\u00a0 I\u2019m willing to bet that things are just as hard as they\u2019ve ever been, and completely not hot, for real girls who don\u2019t fit pop-culture notions of what\u2019s desirable.\u00a0 Who don\u2019t fit in with their peers.\u00a0 Who love science, computers, or books but  don\u2019t  also love makeup and fashion or look like a  Seventeen  model.\u00a0 Who can\u2019t wear those shoes because they  hurt .\u00a0 Who are odd, who are introverted, who don\u2019t make friends easily.\u00a0 It\u2019s lonely and hard to be smarter than everyone around you, or disinterested in stupid peer culture, or rejected because you\u2019re not willing to pretend to be\u2013not sexy.\u00a0 People don\u2019t love you for it.\u00a0 They sure as fuck don\u2019t want to put you on TV for it.\u00a0 The pretty plastic picture is easier. NERD GIRLS claims a couple of different goals: To dismantle myths that boys are better at math and science than girls, and that \u201ca female engineer is socially inept with no sense of style.\u201d\u00a0 And, from the website (I\u2019ll be done with this post soon, because I wanna barf every time I have to go look at that website again), to \u201ccelebrate smart-girl individuality that\u2019s revolutionizing our future,\u201d and to \u201cencourage other girls to change their world through science, technology, engineering, and math, while embracing their feminine power.\u201d Okay, so just do that.\u00a0 It would be fantastic to see a series about real female scientists and their struggles in the school and work world, normal women with prestigious scientific careers.\u00a0 I would adore watching a series that really was going to deeply explore and debunk myths about girls\u2019 mathematical ability and follow their journeys through school.\u00a0 But what you\u2019re selling here is not individuality.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pinup girl, just a different one than we\u2019ve seen before, which has little to do with the real lives or feminine power of real girls.\u00a0 It\u2019s nothing but pornography for people who would rather that real, awkward, smart girls were something prettier and more acceptable to mass tastes than they are. This, NERD GIRLS, is hurting real girls.\u00a0 This is just holding up one more unrealistic, unattainable, beautiful package that they have to embrace or else be judged as not enough. As an antidote, here a couple of my favorite real girl nerds: Barbara McClintock, who discovered a type of gene called the transposon, which can jump between chromosomes.\u00a0 She was my historical scientist heartthrob in high school. And Alice B. Sheldon, who wrote acclaimed, Nebula Award winning science fiction for many years under the pen name of James Tiptree, Jr.\u00a0 She was a Renaissance woman, also having worked as a watercolor artist, a satellite image reader during WWII, and run a poultry farm.\u00a0 There\u2019s a fantastic biography of her out,  James Tiptree, Jr.: The Double Life of Alice B.

I requested a copy from the library first, but returned it and went and bought a copy after I loved the first chapter that much.\u00a0 My apartment is small; I have to be selective about buying books. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek  is written very much in the heritage of Thoreau\u2019s  Walden .\u00a0 In 1971, Dillard lived near Tinker Creek, in Virginia, and wrote about finding immense significance in the abundance, intricacy and violence of her ecological neighborhood over the course of a year.\u00a0 It\u2019s a wonderful book to read in the spring. I was particularly struck by what she says about the human quality of innocence: We\u2019re so accustomed to thinking of innocence as a negative state: as a lack of knowledge, a lack of sexual experience, a lack of maturity, something to be overcome.\u00a0 Even in more desirable terms, \u201clack of guile or corruption; purity,\u201d in the phrasing of my New Oxford American Dictionary, innocence is defined by absence, by lack.\u00a0 In Dillard\u2019s conception, by contrast, innocence is a positive, nearly palpable state of intensity, a potentiality, a spark, not only the absence of self-consciousness but a presence\u2013devotion\u2013and the capacity for active pursuit of joy.

{"date": "June 22, 2010", "body": "I\u2019m actually about a week late on my response to this article.\u00a0 Sue me; I\u2019ve been working on two separate productions this week. In a June 11 article, \u201c Long Road to Adulthood is Growing Longer ,\u201d the  New York Times  reports from the findings of researchers from the MacArthur Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood, purporting to show that young people are actually taking longer to reach adulthood these days. The disservice that this article does to young adults begins in its second sentence, declaring that \u201ca growing body of research shows that the real Peter Pans are not the boomers, but the generations that have followed.\u201d This is a careless characterization of 20- and 30-somethings that, on top of everything else we\u2019re facing, we really don\u2019t need, thanks anyway Patricia Cohen.\u00a0 Peter Pan, remember, deliberately determined to remain a child forever.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t hobbled in his quest for maturity and independence by a major economic collapse, spiraling higher education costs, untenable health care and housing costs, and a 20% unemployment/under-employment rate.\u00a0 He chose eternal childhood and a fantasy existence over what he saw as the drudgery and hypocrisy of the adult world. Really,  New York Times , does that sound like American young adults of today? Once again, like the article from the  Chicago Tribune  I wrote about a couple weeks ago, the  Times  reporter takes at face value, without much critical inquiry, assumptions that fewer young adults meeting certain commonly accepted markers of maturity actually means that young adults are less mature (which, as I\u2019ve said before, I might agree that they are, but for far different reasons).\u00a0 There\u2019s no consideration for the possibility that perhaps, in the face of wildly altered circumstances from those in which our parents and grandparents came of age, young adults are simply making different choices.\u00a0 And what\u2019s more, that those choices might be rational and well-informed. Early in the article, Cohen cites as an incidental example of adulthood taking longer to take hold the provision of the new health care law which allows adult children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance policies up to age 26.\u00a0 But this is no indication whatsoever that young adults are less adult, but rather that wages have been stagnant for 30 years while insurance premiums have spiraled out of range of what a college graduate with an entry level or hourly wage job can reasonably afford.\u00a0 How does that reflect on our maturity, rather than on the unfairness and irrationality of our haphazard health care delivery systems? Frank F. Furstenberg, leader of the MacArthur Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood, is quoted as saying \u201cA new period of life is emerging in which young people are no longer adolescents but not yet adults.\u201d Is it that we\u2019re not yet adults, or that young adulthood now holds different challenges (among which I would include an educational system that actually discourages rather than encourages maturity and independence) and more choices than it used to?\u00a0 Most of the anecdotes contained in the article are about young women taking longer to complete their education, and thus marrying much later and delaying childbearing.\u00a0 But, among other factors, birth control is legal now.\u00a0 It was once assumed that young adult women would marry and have children by their early 20\u2019s, simply because they didn\u2019t have many other options.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t better for their personal maturity, to do what society assumed they would because they lacked compelling career options; it was far worse.\u00a0 (If you haven\u2019t read it, Betty Friedan makes the case eloquently in  The Feminine Mystique , a book I enjoyed and identified with far more than I thought I would.)\u00a0 But the  Times  article laments that according to a study out from Princeton, \u201cMarriage and parenthood\u2013once seen as prerequisites for adulthood\u2013are now viewed more as lifestyle choices.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, a \u201clifestyle choice\u201d is whether to live on the East Side or West Side, to drive or bike to work, to cook at home or eat out, to get a cat or a dog.\u00a0 To marry and have children are serious, life-altering choices involving the fates of at least two other people.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that I wouldn\u2019t like to do those things, but to do either right now would completely upend my career pursuits and independence. Indeed, I don\u2019t see anyone among the people profiled in the article who are Peter Pans\u2013deliberate children\u2013but rather people whose careers or economic circumstances necessitated further education, whose life trajectories simply didn\u2019t take the courses they assumed they would (and how many people\u2019s actually do?), and in the cases of the marriage-delayers, who honestly took their feelings into account in wisely not rushing into marriage at 23.\u00a0 When did honest self-reflection in delaying a major life decision become lack of maturity? Things get more interesting on the  website  of the newsletter for the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood.\u00a0 It seems that much of this group\u2019s current research agenda is based on a vision of the past that, well, isn\u2019t all that true.\u00a0 One of the postulates shaping their body of research is stated as being that Sure, it\u2019s true that young adulthood has changed dramatically in the past few decades.\u00a0 But the assumption and ordering of most of these rites of passage are incredibly skewed towards the middle and upper classes of the mid- to late 20th century.\u00a0 This sequence was far from the lockstep norm for most people, for most of American history.\u00a0 Most states had no compulsory education through the end of the 19th century; it was not assumed that most people would graduate from, or even  attend , high school.\u00a0 There has  never  been a time when most people graduated from or even attended college.\u00a0 Prior to the industrial revolution, many people never \u201cgot a job,\u201d but learned a trade through an apprenticeship to a family member or neighbor, or inherited a family business or a farm.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t the lockstep following of these steps that used to make people adults by their late teens; it was the fact that they\u2019d had to  do things  for themselves their entire lives. And then: But how is it established that adulthood is actually occurring later?\u00a0 I agree that many social policies and institutions don\u2019t serve young adults well, but that it\u2019s because they presume a level of economic enfranchisement that\u2019s out of reach for young graduates in the current job market. The website criticizes earlier media portrayals of \u201cTwixsters\u201d and \u201cAdultolescents,\u201d and says that the Research Network \u201ctakes young people seriously.\u201d\u00a0 But that is not the implication of what its leader, Mr. Furstenberg, said to the  New York Times : \u201cWe have not developed and strengthened institutions to serve young adults, because we\u2019re still living with the archaic idea that people enter adulthood in their late teens or early twenties.\u201d But I don\u2019t see any likelihood that this view is going to result in young adults being taken more seriously, rather than less.\u00a0 If we\u2019re shaping policies and institutions on a new paradigm that 18-34 year-olds (yep, that\u2019s the age range given for this new period of young adulthood on the website) are in fact not effective adults, how does that not lead to taking them less seriously, as able to be self-directing and fully engaged in and responsible for their own lives, choices, and contributions to society and democracy?\u00a0 What Furstenberg blindly and rather deceptively confuses, as the  Chicago Tribune  article did, is personal maturity and capacity for independence with achievement of economic and material goals. If it\u2019s an archaic idea that we become adults in our late teens or early twenties, then I think we need to start looking backwards for guidance on how to take young adults seriously.\u00a0 Because this forward-looking vision of Mr. Furstenberg\u2019s of recognizing ever less-adult \u201cadults\u201d is not going to help us establish realistic ways to help people reach self-sufficient adulthood in a timely manner.\u00a0 It will further justify the social exclusion of young adults from full enfranchisement and economic participation.\u00a0 It asks us to further infantilize young adults rather than seriously considering remedies to the economic circumstances that make full independence so difficult.\u00a0 This view itself is  helping  to lengthen the road to adulthood, not providing solutions for young adults who are seeking greater independence.

{"date": "June 29, 2010", "body": "I\u2019ve been really torn about responding to this one\u2013 Online Bullies Pull Schools Into the Fray \u2013though since the  Times  got 547 comments on it, I guess I better chime in\u2026. The conundrum is how much schools can do to prevent and punish cyberbullying by text message, YouTube, or Facebook, that occurs off school grounds and outside of school hours.\u00a0 The article profiles Benjamin Franklin Middle School in New Jersey, and is accompanied by a chilling picture, which I can only hope was posed, of a small group of very young (like maybe 11 or 12) female students, standing in a semi-circle, not chatting or playing, but texting on Blackberries and other elaborate QWERTY-enabled phones. It\u2019s a hard one for me, because of course I\u2019d like to side with the bullying victims and say that the school should do everything in its power to stop bullying.\u00a0 But in this case, \u201ceverything in its power\u201d would mean an unacceptable intrusion into students\u2019 lives outside of school (as we should\u2019ve learned from the  Pennsylvania case  in which a school district was caught monitoring students in their own bedrooms via their laptop cameras). And certainly, the schools create the kind of environment in which bullying of all kinds thrives, so it\u2019s tempting to want to hold them responsible when the nastiness goes off school grounds. But\u2026why do middle school students have smart phones?\u00a0 Why do they have internet usage unmonitored by parents?\u00a0 Why do they have Facebook pages (against even Facebook\u2019s terms of service, which bar anyone under 13) without their parents being their \u201cfriends\u201d and therefore able to see everything that happens on the page?\u00a0 These circumstances are created by parents, and the responsibility of raising kids to be decent human beings is the responsibility of parents.\u00a0 It should go without saying, but apparently it doesn\u2019t, that discipline for kids\u2019 wrongdoing  outside of school  is the responsibility of their parents. *** The article recounts a few different schools\u2019 experiences with massively disruptive incidents born from online spats, and their attempts to smooth things out between students.\u00a0 Principal Tony Orsini laments that \u201cAll we are doing is reacting.\u00a0 We can\u2019t seem to get ahead of the curve.\u201d No, Mr. Orsini, you can\u2019t.\u00a0 Because you might have the legal designation of  in loco parentis  when it comes to restricting students\u2019 civil rights and commanding their behavior in your building, but you can\u2019t actually take the place of a parent.\u00a0 And you can\u2019t teach compassion or respect or human decency in a basically authoritarian institution where children are considered as factory products instead of people. *** In the end, Benjamin Franklin Middle School organizes a group of 8th grade girls to talk to the 6th graders about responsible technology use and cyberbullying.\u00a0 Actually, not such a bad idea, to enlist older students, who kids might be more likely to take seriously than their parents or teachers.\u00a0 The 6th graders seem intrigued.\u00a0 But unintentionally, it sort of highlights exactly what\u2019s wrong with middle school environments that allows and encourages cyberbullying in the first place: the environment itself practically enforces immaturity.\u00a0 There are no younger kids to look after and protect, there are no older kids to look up to and emulate, and the only adults are ones whose job it is to control and manipulate you, so they\u2019re not very compelling role models.\u00a0 And there\u2019s  nothing  meaningful to do.\u00a0 Is it really any wonder at all that kids turn to petty technology-mediated aggression for entertainment and to make themselves feel bigger? I wish schools would return to housing kindergartners through 6th graders together, and 7th graders through high school seniors together.\u00a0 My own school district back in Kansas City has recently gone even further in the  wrong  direction, separating 6th graders out from the middle schools and putting them in a designated \u201c6th grade center.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t even want to imagine what kind of psychodrama goes on in that place. The article closes with a sweet sounding girl named Emily telling the younger kids that if they\u2019re being cyberbullied, \u201cGo to the school.\u00a0 The school will make it stop, immediately!\u201d\u00a0 But Emily dear, most schools can barely control the bullying that goes on inside their walls.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad your school at least takes it seriously. There\u2019s a saying in biology and genetics regarding the influence of both nature and nurture on outcome: \u201cGenetics loads the gun, and environment pulls the trigger.\u201d\u00a0 In the case of cyberbullying, parental negligence is loading the gun, and school environment is pulling the trigger.\u00a0 (The technology is only amplifying effects; there were predatory little girls a long time before we had Facebook.)\u00a0 But schools aren\u2019t capable of dealing with the consequences; they cannot be expected to act as police, prosecutor, judge and jury when discipline matters cross over into stalking, harassment, and libel; and we should not invite them to have any more reach into students\u2019 out of school lives than they already do.\u00a0 It\u2019s like schools have scared parents into doubting their ability to do their own jobs.\u00a0 Parents need to stand up for their kids and take it back.\u00a0 And if they don\u2019t understand the technology or how to control it, they need to learn\u2026before they give a Blackberry to an 11-year-old.

{"date": "March 10, 2011", "body": "Today, Republican Representative Peter King\u2019s congressional hearings on radicalization within the American Muslim community begin.\u00a0 And I would say that this blatant and apparently un-self-conscious re-enactment of the McCarthy hearings, this repellent attempt by Representative King to use collective blame to make us view our Muslim fellow citizens with fear and suspicion or as somehow less than fully American, makes me ashamed to be an American, or makes me ashamed that King represents my state. Except that everywhere, I read about people standing up to what King\u2019s doing, speaking up in defense of the Muslim community, pointing out the hypocrisy of the very premise of the hearings, and drawing comparisons to the McCarthy hearings and Salem witch trials.\u00a0 And it makes me proud, and makes me wonder if we might finally actually be learning something as a country, even if our leaders aren\u2019t yet.\u00a0 Which is that, while any of us are in danger of persecution or officially sanctioned injustice, all of us are. In illustration, one of my favorite articles of the week, shared by a Facebook friend, comes from the  Washington Post  and chronicles the relationship of support built between the Muslim and Japanese-American communities on the west coast in the years since 9/11.\u00a0 ( Japanese Americans: House hearings on radical Islam \u2018sinister.\u2019 )\u00a0 The Japanese-American community remembers the internments of World War II, based on nothing more than suspicion of their ethnicity.\u00a0 They remember that it  can  happen to them, and it can happen again. I have a theory, which is that people who instigate and support this kind of targeting and suspicion of others based on group identity, are people who are themselves pretty sure that the same tactics will never be turned back against them.\u00a0 People who have never been excluded or abused or marginalized based on who they are, have an easy time believing that they never will be.\u00a0 People who have always been able to take their place in society, or even humanity, for granted, have a hard time imagining not being able to do so. But people who have been marginalized instinctively identify ourselves in every marginalized person, and see the danger to ourselves in injustice against anyone. There\u2019s a scene in one of my favorite books, which I\u2019ve written about before,  World Without End , in which a serf named Wulfric and his family have run away from the lord who controls their land, to another community where they have a chance to be independent and escape the grinding, perpetual poverty of feudal life.\u00a0 Sir Ralph comes to force Wulfric to return, as was legal in those days: the lord who owned your land effectively owned you.\u00a0 Another man tries to defend Wulfric, who says \u201cBe quiet, Carl.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want you killed for my sake.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not for your sake,\u201d says Carl.\u00a0 \u201cIf this thug is allowed to drag you off, next week someone will come for me.\u201d And that\u2019s why King seeks with his hearings to get Americans to see American Muslims as not truly us, but \u201cthem,\u201d some alien and hostile force among us.\u00a0 Whatever his ultimate aim is, and I don\u2019t believe for one second that it\u2019s really just to determine the extent of radicalization in the Muslim community, it depends on us seeing Muslims as something other than and less than ourselves. And that\u2019s why I say that today, I\u2019m a Muslim too, or might as well be, because anything that can be done to anyone\u2013like being presumed guilty of collusion with terrorists and investigated by Congress for your religious identity\u2013can be done to all of us.\u00a0 Every single one.\u00a0 Never pretend that it can\u2019t.

{"date": "February 22, 2010", "body": "Has anyone else noticed this tendency?\u00a0 The  Times  could be doing some really valuable on-the-ground reporting of the effects of the recession on everyday individual Americans who, despite working hard and doing everything right have found their lives, careers, health, and security unraveled by economic forces far beyond their control.\u00a0 But their reporters keep choosing to highlight really bad poster children.\u00a0 (I\u2019m sure many people remember  these two. ) I\u2019m about to walk a really, really fine line of victim-blaming and mentally distinguishing the \u201cdeserving\u201d from \u201cundeserving\u201d poor here.\u00a0 I know that. Sunday\u2019s article, \u201c The New Poor: Millions of Unemployed Face Years Without Jobs ,\u201d about the mal-adaptability of our social safety net to long-term, intractable unemployment, profiles Jean Eisen, out of work for two years now.\u00a0 Her unemployment insurance extension just ran out for the second time.\u00a0 She\u2019s doing without medication, getting groceries from the food pantry, and willing to do just about any job she\u2019s able to do, no matter how menial.\u00a0 The 6-month unemployment rate of women in her age group has doubled since the early 1980\u2019s, according to the article. My heart was with her, until this line: \u201cShe and her husband now settle their bills with only his $1,595 monthly disability check. The rent on their apartment is $1,380.\u201d Okay.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what cost of living is like in southern California, but there are 1-bedroom apartments cheaper than that in NYC.\u00a0 And $1,595 is more than I usually make per month working.\u00a0 And up until recently, when the latest extension expired, she was also getting $702 biweekly from unemployment.\u00a0 I understand it takes money to move, plus deposit and first month\u2019s rent, but seriously?\u00a0 It sounds like these people showed no forethought whatsoever much, much earlier in their unemployment, when they would\u2019ve still had the cash to move to a cheaper apartment so as not to strain their savings with $1,400 rent. And then: After a trip to the food bank, she says  \u201cI\u2019ve got 10 bags of pinto beans.\u00a0 And I have no clue how to cook a pinto bean.\u201d And: All of which helps explain why Ms. Eisen \u2014 who has never before struggled to find work \u2014 feels a familiar pain each time she scans job listings on her computer: There are positions in health care, most requiring experience she lacks. Office jobs demand familiarity with software she has never used. She has no idea how to cook a pinto bean?\u00a0 Okay, knowing how to cook beans isn\u2019t probably going to get her off unemployment, but\u2026she doesn\u2019t have the skills, or the mental initiative, to get out a cookbook and look it up?\u00a0 She\u2019s been out of work for two years and hasn\u2019t tried to learn some of the computer or accounting skills that office jobs ask for? I\u2019m not overlooking or denying the import of the facts here that there are 6 applicants for every single job available in this country, that manufacturing jobs that used to pay enough to raise a family on have disappeared overseas, that high school and even college degrees used to mean a whole lot more than they do now, that medical costs are crushing, that age discrimination is a big problem for older women especially, that something is very, very wrong when Ms. Eisen could earn $13.25 per hour, plus bonus and benefits, with a high school diploma in the 1980\u2019s, and in 2010, I can earn the about the same ($14.50), LESS after inflation actually, on a  good  day,  without  any benefits, with two college degrees and a prestigious internship under my belt.\u00a0 I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t deep and nefarious economic forces at work here beyond any of our individual influence, or that people aren\u2019t suffering and legitimately afraid of homelessness who worked hard their whole lives, saved, lived within their means, didn\u2019t buy homes they couldn\u2019t afford, and have done everything rational to cut back on expenses and still find themselves driven to the brink.\u00a0 I\u2019m confused at the Times\u2019 seeming selective inability to find them.\u00a0 (Because they  did , several weeks ago, for an article on the 6 million Americans now living on no income other than food stamps.) But doesn\u2019t it say something about why this woman can\u2019t find a job that she\u2019s not mentally self-reliant or literate enough to look up the instructions for cooking beans, or try to pick up some computer skills in two  years  of unemployment? And even at that, I don\u2019t really blame her. Our entire educational system encourages passivity and obedience for the majority of students, and blatantly discourages or even punishes inventiveness, independence of thought, critical thinking, high literacy, passion for any subject, skill, or craft that doesn\u2019t fall under the school system\u2019s purview, excellence at anything for its own sake, and an attention span of more than 50 minutes.\u00a0 The overriding lesson is that the way to success, security, and financial comfort is to \u201cwork hard,\u201d get good grades, and follow the rules.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a big fat lie.\u00a0 Ms. Eisen probably has gone through life more or less doing what she was told.\u00a0 Doing what she thought she was supposed to.\u00a0 And it\u2019s left her so helpless that she can\u2019t figure out by herself how to cook a pound of beans, let alone pull through a major economic downturn intact. This is something we are going to have to change about the way we educate kids if we are ever to fix our economy in a sustainable way.\u00a0 And I never, ever hear it talked about in any speeches or pleas for education reform. And secondly, we\u2019ve got to stop worshipping and fetishizing \u201cmiddle class\u201d status.\u00a0 What is it, what\u2019s magical about it?\u00a0 As far as I can see, it consists of the ability to live in the suburbs and maintain a lot of stuff that people don\u2019t actually need to live well.\u00a0 As far as I can tell, the Eisens are in the trouble they are now largely because they maintained their middle class life long after they couldn\u2019t really afford it.\u00a0 People don\u2019t think about what they need; they just consume.\u00a0 We as a society need to stop shaming the non-middle class, and stop being afraid to live with less.\u00a0 Or rather, I think it\u2019s time we demand more social benefits\u2014affordable college, healthcare, public transit and healthy environment\u2014and learn how to live  well  without more superfluous material ones. And the  Times  is, quite unintentionally I\u2019m sure, trivializing the real severity of the economic situation for a lot of people right now by choosing as its emblematic economic victims people who couldn\u2019t find their way out of a paper bag in any kind of hardship.

Then there was a sequel of sorts,  Ophelia Speaks , a compilation of teen girls\u2019 own responses and reflections on their lives and the original book, seeking to let girls speak for themselves about their lives and somewhat fill in the gaps they felt were left in Pipher\u2019s book.\u00a0 I ran out to buy it.\u00a0  \u201cNow someone will tell the truth for me, surely now someone will get it right!\u201d  I thought. Nope.\u00a0 It was another fascinating book, this time in the words of the fascinating aliens themselves.\u00a0 But I recognized myself nowhere among them.\u00a0 I started to accept that either there were no girls like me anywhere, or I wasn\u2019t a real girl at all.\u00a0 I don\u2019t even remember there being any women who made me think \u201cI could grow up to be like that.\u201d And then (to make a very long story short), I was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, and in reading the blogs and books of other autistic women and developing supportive relationships with them, I found a way to identify with other women at all for the first time. *** I don\u2019t write much about my work, for a variety of reasons, but it\u2019s been no big secret lately that I\u2019ve been working on a particularly difficult production, which has taken more or less everything out of me in the past couple months.\u00a0 It was a choral music piece called  From the Fire , about the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which had its 100th anniversary this past week.\u00a0 On March 25, 1911, 146 garment workers, mostly teenage girls and young women, either burned or jumped to their deaths because they were locked in on the 9th floor of the factory building near Washington Square when a fast-moving fire broke out in a bin of cotton scraps.\u00a0 The tragedy proved a watershed moment in the social history of America, for workers\u2019 rights and unions, mandates for workplace safety, and voting rights for women. Within the first couple weeks, the rehearsal process had become so hard that I felt myself starting to shut down emotionally and detach myself from any real feeling for the show, which was the last thing in the world that I wanted, since what this kind of show can accomplish is exactly the reason that I wanted to work in theater in the first place. Then one night in vocal rehearsal, I sang along silently in my head as the chorus of girls sang a line of a song: \u201cBlessed are you oh lord our God who made me a woman, yes, a woman who can work.\u201d\u00a0 And it hit me: I am one of  these  girls\u2013the ones in front of me.\u00a0 I was there to look out for them, backed up by a strong union, in no small part because of what happened to the girls of Triangle.\u00a0 Performing artists are still a vulnerable population in many ways, and I was one of them, and as hard as things were still going to get, my job was to protect them.\u00a0 I was there to be on their side. *** In the final song of the show, a cascading canon of voices sing out the names of girls of the Triangle factory, both survivors and the dead.\u00a0 The performers had been directed to abruptly face outwards, to an individual member of the audience, as each one sang her line.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until the third performance, which happened to fall on the actual anniversary of the fire, that I realized that one of the student actresses, in the down right corner of the stage, was turning directly to me (where I was calling the show from an improvised platform) when she sang \u201cLizzie will be remembered.\u201d\u00a0 I teared up.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t hold her gaze for more than a moment.

{"date": "February 23, 2010", "body": "The New York Times  reports  today: \u201cBecause economic progress and educational achievement go hand in hand, educating every American student to graduate prepared for college and success in a new work force is a national imperative,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cMeeting this challenge requires that state standards reflect a level of teaching and learning needed for students to graduate ready for success in college and careers.\u201d While superficially uncontroversial, the above statement has so many things wrong with it that I almost didn\u2019t know where to start.\u00a0 So why not at the beginning? \u201cBecause economic progress and educational achievement go hand in hand\u2026\u201d  Okay, sure, average yearly and lifetime income increases with increasing level of degree attained.\u00a0 People with doctorates make more (on average) than people with masters\u2019 degrees, who make more than people with bachelors\u2019, who make more than people with high school diplomas, who make more than people who didn\u2019t finish high school.\u00a0 On average. On an individual level, though, isn\u2019t this just a restatement of the false assurance that doing your homework and doing well in school leads to economic security?\u00a0 Nevermind the possibility that you could graduate from college and be able to find no job at all, or be saddled with tens of thousands of dollars of student debts and no foreseeable hope of paying them off?\u00a0 And that some of our most successful artists, scientists, and innovators of all sorts were screw-ups and drop-outs?\u00a0 (Bill Gates and Jamie Oliver come immediately to mind.)\u00a0 Is it college that gives you the skills to earn more money, or are employers demanding college degrees for positions with skill sets that really shouldn\u2019t require them? Also, implicit in the statement is the assumption that school achievement and educational attainment are the same thing.\u00a0 Or that the latter follows naturally from the former.\u00a0 Not remotely true. \u201c\u2026educating every American student to graduate prepared for college and success in a new work force is a national imperative.\u201d  To mandate that every student must meet any given level or standard is to guarantee that some children  will  fall short and be labeled failures.\u00a0 Because, simply, people are all different.\u00a0 People all have different aptitudes, different talents, different learning styles.\u00a0 Not inferior, but different.\u00a0 I would hazard to say that most children don\u2019t learn material well the way that school teaches it.\u00a0 Otherwise, why would our educational world be in the mess that it\u2019s in?\u00a0 Kids aren\u2019t learning the material, and not because they\u2019re that dim, because the material isn\u2019t that hard. Conversely, to make the standards such that everyone achieves them is to make them meaningless on the federal level rather than the state level. And we need to stop pretending that every student needs to or should go to college.\u00a0 This is the mentality that has made a college degree almost as meaningless and devalued as the high school diploma in terms of what it says about an individual\u2019s knowledge and job readiness.\u00a0 If everyone achieves it, if everyone\u2019s required to achieve that standard for almost any job, what does it mean?\u00a0 Nothing. \u201cMeeting this challenge requires that state standards reflect a level of teaching and learning needed for students to graduate ready for success in college and careers.\u201d   States can say anything about what their standards are.\u00a0 High schools can say anything about what they\u2019re teaching.\u00a0 But you can\u2019t just demand a high  level  of teaching and assume that  what  the schools are teaching is in fact what is needed for success in college and work.\u00a0 And in my experience, the quality of what is being taught in K-12 is not remotely what is needed for success in college and beyond.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter how much content you memorize or how well you can take a standardized test, no matter how high the level of reading or math that it\u2019s testing, if you can\u2019t use those skills in an integrated way with personal drive, self-discipline, reasoning, discussion, creative problem solving, and project organization, which are the skills that college success depends on, along with open-mindedness and receptiveness to constructive criticism.\u00a0 Unless middle and high school have changed  a lot  since I was there, students aren\u2019t being judged on these criteria, but on their ability to follow directions.\u00a0 But you can\u2019t write state educational standards based on those things because you can\u2019t standardized-test them.\u00a0 You can only see them in actual accomplishment. And you can\u2019t demand any level of learning, at all.\u00a0 That  only  comes from individual motivation, ambition and desire.\u00a0 You can frighten or coerce kids into performing at a certain level, for a limited amount of time, but you can\u2019t  make  them learn, at any level.\u00a0 Your state standards can reflect whatever you want; it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s happening. While I sure think this statement of purpose would be an improvement over the current No Child Left Behind, according to which, apparently, states get to decide for themselves what constitutes \u201cchallenging\u201d reading and math standards, making state standards ultimately meaningless, I still think it\u2019s well-intentioned but ultimately misses the point of what education should be and will propagate the same problems on the national level. \u201cIn better aligning the law to support college- and career-ready standards,\u201d the White House statement said, its proposed rewrite of the No Child Left Behind law would \u201crequire all states to adopt and certify that they have college- and career-ready standards which may include common standards developed by a state-led consortium, as a condition of qualifying for Title I funding.\u201d Is  this  what they meant by that?

{"date": "March 13, 2011", "body": "I\u2019ve had my first blog award, and now I\u2019ve been tagged in a meme, by Rachel at  Journeys with Autism . I think at some point this meme was to post the books that were in actuality physically by your bedside, but for me, that would be all of them\u2026since my bedroom is very small, so the bookshelves which occupy two walls of it are, necessarily, very close to my bed.\u00a0 Luckily for all, it\u2019s now a more general \u201cwhat are you reading\u201d meme.\u00a0 And these are the rules: 1.     Take a picture of the books you are reading currently and add  them to your post. 2.     Describe the books and if you are enjoying them 3.     For every book you are reading, you have to tag one person. 4.     Leave the person a comment letting them know you tagged them. I used to have a personal rule that I couldn\u2019t be reading more than one book at a time.\u00a0 At some point, I had two books (and I don\u2019t even remember what they were) that I wanted to read with equal desperation, and my usual respect for delayed gratification was so overwhelmed I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 Then I realized that that wasn\u2019t a real rule, it was one I made up, and I could be reading as many books at a time as I wanted.\u00a0 Without further ado, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been reading: 1.  Triangle: The Fire That Changed America  by David Von Drehle.\u00a0 An exhaustive but very readable history of the causes and aftermath of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, this book contains much of the background and source material for the production I\u2019m currently working on, a dramatic choral music piece called  From the Fire  in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the event this year.\u00a0 The fire was New York City\u2019s worst workplace disaster before 9/11/01, in which 146 garment workers, mostly young immigrant girls, died because, for an evil confluence of reasons large and small, they were locked inside a dangerous factory.\u00a0 I loved reading this, both because I enjoy having a fuller understanding of the background and origin of the shows I work with, and because the Triangle tragedy was one of those things that I vaguely remembered being mentioned in passing in 8th grade history class, but we were never really taught its importance as a turning point in American history, for women\u2019s rights and workers\u2019 rights among other things. 2.  A Game of Thrones , by George R. R. Martin.\u00a0 This is the first installment of a fantasy series which came highly recommended by a friend, and my intrigue was sharpened by the visually gorgeous previews for the forthcoming HBO series.\u00a0 I was totally hooked by the end of the prologue.\u00a0 It\u2019s the story of a land on the brink of war where nothing and no one is quite what they seem at first, and Martin plays around very unsettlingly with big ideas about power, love and trust, morality, and what we think we understand about the natural world. 3. Rachel\u2019s own book,  The Uncharted Path .\u00a0 Rachel, I\u2019m going to cherish this as part of my growing \u201csurvival manual.\u201d\u00a0 Before I read this, I thought that I had actually hit some limit on my ability to be stunned by recognition of my own experience, or having to keep saying \u201cgood god, I thought it was just me.\u201d\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 Knocked speechless. 4.  Saint George and the Dragon , by Margaret Hodges, illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman.\u00a0 One of my favorite picture books as a child, it\u2019s an adaptation of the most famous episode from Edmund Spenser\u2019s Middle English epic poem  The Faerie Queene .\u00a0 It had been on my mind a lot lately and I considered asking my mother to mail me the copy she still has, but then figured I might as well have my own since I could get it for $3 on Amazon.\u00a0 Its completely enchanting watercolor illustrations have not lost their power to entrance me in the 25 years since this book was first read to me. 5.  1776 , by David McCullough.\u00a0 I actually haven\u2019t started this one yet\u2013it\u2019s next up.\u00a0 My dad and I tend to like the same kind of history books, so he passed this one on to me after he finished it.\u00a0 He says it\u2019s an intensely human, personal account of the first year of the American Revolution; it sounds almost impossible that I won\u2019t like it. 6.  The Lacuna , by Barbara Kingsolver.\u00a0 I\u2019ve made a habit of re-reading things I\u2019ve loved to wind down before bed.\u00a0 This is the one I\u2019ve gone to for much of this past year, and is a book that will amply reward re-reading.\u00a0 I love this book on so many levels, and it\u2019s kept blossoming and unfolding to me the more time I\u2019ve spent with it.\u00a0 Typically I say that it\u2019s impossible for me to name one \u201cfavorite book,\u201d because so many have meant so much to me but in very different ways or times or circumstances.\u00a0 But this one\u2019s in serious danger of being my favorite book for a very long time. And now, for my six victims!\u00a0 You!\u00a0 I want to know what you\u2019re reading!\u00a0 Because I either like your writing or think you\u2019re interesting, and not because I, like, need more stuff on my list of things to read or anything\u2026. 1.

{"date": "February 28, 2010", "body": "About five years ago I read  The Poisonwood Bible , and loved it so much that I figured I would never read another book by Barbara Kingsolver.\u00a0 I was too afraid of being disappointed; I couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d ever manage to live up to the accomplishment of that book.\u00a0 So for five years, I didn\u2019t touch another of Kingsolver\u2019s novels.\u00a0 A friend gave me  Animal, Vegetable, Miracle  for my birthday, which I did adore, but that didn\u2019t count since it was a completely different medium and genre. Well, my stepmother, who adored  Poisonwood Bible  on about the same level that I did, gave me  The Lacuna  for Christmas, in open defiance of my oft-stated fear of reading any more Kingsolver ever.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t not read a Christmas present\u2026though the shabby reviews I\u2019d heard had me convinced more than ever that this would only be a let-down after  Poisonwood Bible . Ignore the reviews.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t get it.\u00a0 The book isn\u2019t even about what they say it\u2019s about.\u00a0 It\u2019s not even about what the dust jacket says it\u2019s about.\u00a0 Honestly, this book touched me so personally and deeply that at first I thought I wouldn\u2019t even be able to write about it publicly at all. The first thing to understand is that  The Lacuna  is a character-driven story.\u00a0 And I have never, never empathized with a character before like I did with Harrison Shepherd.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had favorite characters\u2013Lyra of  His Dark Materials , Astrid of  White Oleander , Adah in  Poisonwood \u2013but never felt the sense of connection with a protagonist\u2019s inner life that I did with Shepherd, whom we follow in the novel from a lonely 12-year-old boy to an accomplished author as an adult, before his life is ruined by the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings of the early 1950\u2019s. Kingsolver\u2019s remarkable and uncanny sense of character voice is on display again here as it was in  Poisonwood .\u00a0 The story is narrated mostly but not entirely by Shepherd himself, through his journals and personal papers, collected and curated by his faithful secretary at the end of his life.\u00a0 Often, I would forget entirely that I was not in fact reading the personal diary of an odd teenage boy, but the novel of a middle-aged woman.\u00a0 He was utterly real to me.\u00a0 He\u2019s a perpetual outsider, always torn between worlds but belonging to none, intensely emotionally immersed in each place he lives but forever without a real home.\u00a0 Raised in both the US and Mexico, dualities and contradictions persist throughout and rule his life: he\u2019s able to love deeply but never feel loved.\u00a0 He has no native language.\u00a0 He\u2019s a writer of wildly popular historical fiction, but who has no understanding of how people actually think.\u00a0 His lawyer has to explain to him that the anti-communism sweeping the country has almost nothing whatsoever to do with actual communism.\u00a0 \u201cThey think I\u2019m too  lucky ?\u201d he asks incredulously of the people who resent him for the comfortable life he eventually attains, without seeing what mere survival has cost him. \u00a0 And ultimately, though he will not speak up for himself, believing that \u201cGod speaks for the silent man,\u201d he is betrayed by his own words anyway. The \u201clacuna\u201d of the title is literally an underwater cave, and summaries of the book call it symbolic of the difference between private reality and public presentation, but it\u2019s more than that: it\u2019s the inadequacy of language to tell some truths, the void of understanding in any story, the missing piece, which Kingsolver says is always the most important piece, whether of a story or of a person; the most important thing is the one you don\u2019t know. Other negative reviews have accused that Shepherd is too passive an observer of history to be engaging, too retiring and bashful a representative of the everyman participant in major events that Kingsolver means him to be, but this misses the point.\u00a0 His life is an emblem of how events make each of us the people we are\u2013he was forced to play a great part in history just to survive, and was fatally marked by it, but remained a lacuna himself\u2013the part of the story we don\u2019t see. This is a gorgeous book; Leon Trotsky and Frida Kahlo are magnetic characters that I came to appreciate as people along with Shepherd, and the ending is magical.\u00a0 But the character of Harrison Shepherd is what made me deeply grateful to Kingsolver for  The Lacuna .

{"date": "April 17, 2010", "body": "I\u2019ve had a hard time figuring out how to conclude this little series\u2013which was never intended to be a series in the first place; it just turned out that I had more than one post\u2019s worth to say\u2013because the conclusion is, as of yet, impossible to know.\u00a0 What we\u2019ve done and what will become of the Millennials will conceivably not be known for 20 years, or 30, or longer. Two cases have been weighing on my mind lately, in this frame of reference, which I think are in some ways mirrors of each other: those of Constance McMillen and Phoebe Prince.\u00a0 I think the stories of these girls have the potential to say a lot about who we are, and who we\u2019ll be.\u00a0 Constance and Phoebe and most of their classmates are 10-15 years younger than most of my readers, those from the first years of the \u201cmillennial\u201d generation.\u00a0 These are the kids who will probably be considered the end of it. Most of you probably know both stories by now.\u00a0 Constance McMillen, 18, wanted nothing but to be able to take her girlfriend to her senior prom, and to wear a tuxedo to do so.\u00a0 Her school refused, and when the ACLU threatened a civil rights suit, the school canceled the prom rather than allow a lesbian couple to attend and scapegoated Constance to her classmates, who proceeded to have a \u201csecret\u201d prom intended to further exclude Constance and put up a mean-spirited facebook page, filled with their prom pictures, called \u201cConstance quit yer cryin.\u201d Phoebe Prince, 14, after brief relationships with two older students, was hounded to her death by suicide by four months of vicious, merciless bullying by a group (5-9, in varying reports) of fellow students, in which school officials declined to intervene. Somewhat astoundingly, both stories of heartbreaking cruelty contain reasons for hope. The younger end of our generation is represented not just by Constance\u2019s classmates at Itawamba Agricultural High who participated in her exclusion and scapegoating, but by the hundreds of thousands who subsequently became facebook fans of \u201cLet Constance Take Her Girlfriend to the Prom!\u201d and protested her treatment in other ways (and the 2800 or so who hijacked the \u201cConstance quit yer cryin\u201d page just to rail against the level of human meanness and vileness that allowed its creation.\u00a0 It\u2019s now been almost entirely taken over by supporters of Constance and of equal rights.) and of course by Constance herself, who I look up to her for bravery and accomplishment although she\u2019s 10 years younger than I am. Kids like Constance will be the ones who make our future whatever it will be. Nothing in the world will ever make up for Phoebe Prince\u2019s death.\u00a0 But the progression of the case indicates that things may be changing in how we treat young victims of violence and bullying, in how adults treat kids and in how we allow kids to treat each other\u2013all of which sets the stage for the treatment of people that we allow in society at large. In a turn which I feel fairly confident saying would never have happened when I was in middle and high school, nine students who tormented Phoebe to her death have been criminally charged for their actions.\u00a0 I don\u2019t read many forums online which attract commenters young enough to be Phoebe\u2019s classmates, but if what I have read online is any indication (a very unscientific survey, admittedly), people around my age who were bullying victims ourselves are overwhelmingly in favor of the prosecution, and though there are no charges filed against school officials, there\u2019s a great deal of criticism and astonishment directed towards the adults who knew what was going on and failed to step in to protect Phoebe. Attitudes are changing concerning how we should treat young victims, and young perpetrators; people are demanding that bullying victims be protected and not dismissed.\u00a0 And people my age are starting to become parents.\u00a0 The people my age I know who are parents make me hopeful that our children are going to be raised with far less tolerance for cruelty and injustice. I think that we overwhelmingly want to make the world a better place than we found it.\u00a0 We can, and we are.\u00a0 My grandmother, a few months ago, told me confidently that she knew that in one more generation, the idea of gay marriage equality would be \u201cno big deal\u201d anymore, that the opposition was simply going to die out.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t just take it for granted that it\u2019ll happen.\u00a0 This is what I want us to do: Remember the lesson of Obama\u2019s election.   Whether you supported him or not, whether you love him or hate him, remember: all of the people who were supposed to know, said that he couldn\u2019t be elected.\u00a0 We cared enough to prove them all wrong.\u00a0 We changed the course of this country.\u00a0 We changed the course of world history with Obama\u2019s election. Vote, for heaven\u2019s sake.  The 18-24 cohort was the only age group to experience a statistically significant increase in voter turnout in the 2008 election\u2026to 49 percent of registered voters.\u00a0 That\u2019s pathetic.\u00a0 The 25-44 year old group participated at about 52%.\u00a0 Still pathetic. This is why our representatives don\u2019t feel they need to take our concerns seriously.\u00a0 We have their jobs in our hands, and we don\u2019t make use of that power. Never believe anyone who tells you that one person can\u2019t make a difference.  Anyone who tells you that, by word or deed, doesn\u2019t want you to get anything meaningful done. Speak up.  When portrayals in the media of our generation, our lives, our problems, don\u2019t match up with your reality, when political leaders use bigoted, false and shallow characterizations of young citizens to push their agendas (as was done in the passage of the health care bill) speak up and say so.\u00a0 E-mail the editor when a publication does it.\u00a0 Call and threaten their jobs when politicians do it.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have to tolerate what they say about us, let alone believe it. And throw the whole weight of your support behind kids like Constance McMillen, who refuse to be bullied or frightened into submission by idiots.\u00a0 Tell kids what they  are  capable of, which is anything in the world, rather than what they\u2019re not.

{"date": "April 10, 2010", "body": "When you\u2019re a freelance theater artist, you can often wind up with a very atypical and erratic work schedule.\u00a0 Like this winter and early spring, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of work for Juilliard on a 3:00-10:00 PM schedule, leaving my entire mid-morning free.\u00a0 When I\u2019ve worked a whole day and get home exhausted at 6 or 7 PM and it\u2019s dark and cold out, I\u2019m fine with fixing dinner, cleaning the apartment or other petty chores and curling up in my room with a drink to surf the internet or catch up on TV before bed.\u00a0 But that\u2019s no way to spend a gorgeous spring morning if you don\u2019t have to go to work till 3:00. So one of the things I\u2019ve loved doing with my morning hours is seeking out places in Manhattan, and beyond, that I haven\u2019t yet made myself familiar with in the five years I\u2019ve lived here. When I decided that I was moving here, I feel like my family thought I was nuts\u2013being a very introverted person who treasures quiet and nature and open spaces\u2013because a lot of people, when they think of Manhattan, automatically think of Times Square, or Macy\u2019s and the midtown area, or 5th Avenue.\u00a0 But most of New York City actually isn\u2019t anything like that at all, and there are some uniquely charming, stunningly beautiful places here. Today, my AEA day off from rehearsal for my current project, is a bright, sunny, blustery day which I wanted to be spending exploring Inwood Hill Park, at the northern tip of Manhattan, but alas, I\u2019m at home fighting off debilitating monthly cramps with large quantities of coffee and Irish cream and ibuprofen.\u00a0 Heating pads have never worked much for me, but the warmth of the Macbook on my lap is nice and soothing nonetheless.\u00a0 So that\u2019s why I\u2019m home on a gorgeous day off, blogging about a trip to the park instead of being there.\u00a0 This was my fascinating but slightly heartrending field trip to High Bridge Park on a nice morning in March a couple weeks ago: High Bridge Park is named for the bridge between Manhattan and the Bronx which once carried the city\u2019s fresh water supply along the Croton Aqueduct by gravity from north of the city.\u00a0 It runs for about 30 blocks along the north-eastern corner of Manhattan.\u00a0 I started walking south from around 178th St. along the Harlem River. Walking through some of New York\u2019s lesser-known parks can be a saddening experience.\u00a0 NYC has a huge amount of park space to take care of, so the Parks Commission has its hands full to begin with, and I\u2019m sure that between the recession and both city and state budget crises, they have to make some difficult decisions on priorities.\u00a0 Additionally, Central Park suffered massive damage in a brief but fierce summer storm of a type known as a \u201cmicroburst\u201d last year, which they\u2019re still cleaning up, and which I imagine will continue to be a drag on budgets for months still to come. The result can be neglect for parks in less-traveled, and frankly, lower-income areas. High Bridge has lovely architecture and landscaping\u2013bridges, arches, tunnels, curving paths and steep winding stairways, old-fashioned street lamps.\u00a0 But some of it is just in terrible shape.\u00a0 Lamps are broken and gutted and look like they have been for quite some time.\u00a0 I actually saw one street lamp with a thick clump of moss growing where its bulb should be.\u00a0 Stonework is covered in graffiti.\u00a0 Fallen trees and branches laid thickly across paths, and probably not from one of the most recent storms, either, as there were crocuses coming up deep in the depressions left by upended root bulbs. Call me cynical; I just have a hard time believing that conditions like this in someplace like Central Park would be let go for very long.\u00a0 I hope I just happened to hit High Bridge in an unusually neglected pocket, or that springtime cleanup wasn\u2019t underway yet. There\u2019s a nice walking/biking trail overlooking the Harlem River, though.\u00a0 And the jewel of the park is the High Bridge water tower, which once upon a time was used to control water pressure across High Bridge itself. I was disappointed not to be able to go up inside it; it\u2019s locked up.\u00a0 Currently you can\u2019t walk across High Bridge itself, either, though it was once a popular promenade for walkers and bikers.\u00a0 It was closed to traffic after a couple of rock-throwing incidents in the 1970\u2019s, but word is that plans are underway to refurbish and reopen the walkway to the public in 2011, for which I am extremely excited.

{"date": "April 1, 2010", "body": "I was having yet another debate with an old friend this week via facebook; it\u2019s been a common occurrence in the wake of the passage of the health care bill.\u00a0 The debate quickly turned from my instigating question to the subjects of socialism and the dangers, and advantages, of welfare.\u00a0 My friend said, I don\u2019t mean to single her or her views out for judgment, because they are far from unique, at least in my recent experience as I wrote yesterday.\u00a0 After I argued that in the first place, that\u2019s not what socialism is, and secondly, it isn\u2019t happening, she told me of a family she knows from the school where she works: neither parent works; they\u2019re both on disability, and can\u2019t seem to stop having children.\u00a0 All five of their current children have some degree of mental or developmental disability and are all receiving disability payments.\u00a0 And in this school, which largely serves low-income families, this family is far more representative of the norm than the exception. My sister, a registered nurse, when she works overtime, sees close to half of her paycheck withheld in taxes and FICA.\u00a0 Who does she get angry at?\u00a0 The military; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan?\u00a0 The crimes of Wall Street and the bank bailouts, the fraud that toppled the world economy?\u00a0 The sheer numerical fact that there are more baby boomer retirees than there are younger workers supporting them?\u00a0 George W\u2019s unprecedented level of deficit spending, largely on tax cuts for the richest? Nope: the welfare mothers and illegal immigrants on the neonatal ward. Okay, I said\u2013even if these parents are not really disabled or too mentally ill to work, and are therefore committing social security fraud and getting away with just not working\u2026even if it\u2019s true that the illegal immigrant teen mothers brag about being able to take advantage of the welfare system\u2026look at their life.\u00a0  Would you want it? I don\u2019t necessarily mean materially, because they probably do have a car, computer, television, cell phone, DVD player, whatever.\u00a0 But look at their real quality of life.\u00a0 Is it really a life that you\u2019d want to live?\u00a0 Is it a life that you\u2019d trade places to have? Or do you think that the government does too much for people, protects them too much from the natural consequences of bad choices?\u00a0 Look around your city streets on a cold night.\u00a0 Are there no homeless people?\u00a0 A third of them are veterans, and a quarter are severely mentally ill.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry; the world is still more than capricious enough that the wrong choices, or simple lack of resilience, can devastate lives.\u00a0 NYC has had an increase of one third in the homeless population this year alone.\u00a0 I promise you, that surge is not made up of people who just decided they\u2019d rather not work anymore. So be content.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made their choices, and the consequences of those choices, I think, are punishment enough for them.\u00a0 You\u2019ve made yours, and if you have a life, and work, and family that you\u2019re proud of, there\u2019s nothing at all that you need to envy or resent from the poor. I just don\u2019t understand this kind of vitriol towards people who have so much less.\u00a0 I really think that a lot of revulsion towards the very poor, the homeless, people dependent on government aid, comes from personal fear, that we ourselves could\u2019ve been in such a position, if things had been a little different, if we\u2019d been born into a less fortunate situation.\u00a0 Every time I see a bag lady on the street, I know that that could\u2019ve been me, and the confrontation of that knowledge is both chilling and humbling. So the next person who thinks that the poor are getting away with something, that you\u2019d be happier about your income tax return if you made a lot less money, that it\u2019s easy or carefree to need public assistance or that the poor have too much given to them, this is my invitation to you:\u00a0 sell your car and move here, to NYC.\u00a0 Get a rent-stabilized apartment in Washington Heights and a caf\u00e9 job for $7 or $8 an hour.\u00a0 Good luck getting your landlord to deal with the rats or fix the bathroom ceiling when it caves in, and oh yeah, they\u2019re raising subway fares again this year at the same time they\u2019re drastically cutting back service, which is going to make it a lot harder to get to your opening shift at 4:45 AM.\u00a0 Fantastic, you\u2019ll be poor! Sound good?\u00a0 If not, think about why not.\u00a0 Because you do actually have the enjoyment and appreciation of the things you\u2019ve worked for and earned in life.\u00a0 Because you know that you  are  fortunate. I\u2019ve been reading Henry David Thoreau\u2019s  Walden  this week, and at the conclusion of the book, as he looks back on his experiment with simple, deliberate life in the woods (where he actually only lived in his tiny, hand built cabin for about two years; he wasn\u2019t a hermit or misanthrope), he gives much of the most eloquent advice in the book, urging all of his readers not necessarily to do as he\u2019s done, giving up every superfluous comfort, but to wake up to the realities of their own lives. It\u2019s easy to misread much of the ranting in  Walden  as a condemnation of a materially comfortable existence, but it isn\u2019t; it\u2019s a condemnation of the illusion that life is what we acquire, of a life lived in material riches and comfort, but without meaning, hospitality, reflection, or purpose.\u00a0 Someone who has those things within himself, Thoreau says, is always richer, and far more of a whole person, than someone without them.\u00a0 Stop worrying about how badly other people conduct their lives, and make  what you truly want of yours, because someone who has set out deliberately to live the best life they know how, never has anything to envy from those who have not. Except that I envy anyone whose bathroom ceiling doesn\u2019t cave in every 6 months\u2026\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/contentment-or-blaming-the-poor-for-the-wrong-things-entirely/", "title": "Contentment; or, blaming the poor for the wrong things\u00a0entirely"},

{"date": "April 19, 2010", "body": "Peggy Orenstein\u2019s columns annoy me on a regular basis, and yet, to be honest with myself, I had to read  this one  twice just to be sure of why it annoyed me so, so much. Orenstein is wondering how she can raise a daughter with a healthy relationship to food and her own body when she herself has so many weight and body issues, and whether it\u2019s even possible to raise a daughter to love her body while still watching her weight.\u00a0 \u201cHow can you simultaneously encourage your daughter to watch her size and accept her body,\u201d she asks? Well, you can\u2019t.\u00a0 At first I wanted to rail against the surface hypocrisy inherent in the question; no, you can\u2019t always be bothering your daughter to stay thin, and still raise her to accept her body, thick or thin. I appreciated that Orenstein wants to do whatever it takes to not pass on her own pathologies to her daughter, though I thought, it shouldn\u2019t be that complicated: encourage eating for health, not for weight control.\u00a0 Don\u2019t keep junk food in the house.\u00a0 Turn off the TV.\u00a0 Make sure she knows how to cook. But the truth is that I too worry about being able to raise children to be healthier, physically and emotionally, than I am in so many ways.\u00a0 I wonder how not to obsess about not obsessing about something that you are in fact concerned about.\u00a0 Because I so rarely really identify with or understand the worries or preoccupations of other women, I find myself  expecting  not to be able to sympathize with pieces like this.\u00a0 I want to believe that things are simple, but I know the facts are that for a lot of people, for a lot of reasons, they aren\u2019t, especially when you become a parent.\u00a0 So to be intellectually honest with myself, no, I don\u2019t think her concerns about how to impart both healthy body acceptance and good health are unfounded.\u00a0 Especially when what\u2019s all around us in the media, in ways we don\u2019t even fully grasp, is so profoundly damaging. Upon second reading, what I realized caused my visceral reaction of irritation, was that she raises the issue of, but then doesn\u2019t really challenge or criticize in any way, how parents use their children in competition against each other, and in defense of their own self-image and social status. If this is what it\u2019s like to live in Berkeley (and I don\u2019t necessarily take her word for it that it is), that\u2019s a toxic environment for raising emotionally healthy children with a decent self-image, regardless of how organic and local the vegetables are, or how well she manages to suppress her own insecurities about food and weight. She writes about a study which found that mothers are more likely to notice a daughter\u2019s excess weight than a son\u2019s, acknowledging the expectation of girls more than boys to project the right image: But does she feel this way?\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t seriously question the presumption that having a fat girl  is  a parental failure, and that the girl, by implication, is a failure.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think she\u2019s saying that that\u2019s true, but she legitimizes the prejudice by taking it for granted.\u00a0 (And she\u2019s engaging in some nasty assumptions herself about the motivations of the \u201corganic-eating, right-living\u201d parents in her community.)\u00a0 She\u2019s pretty clear; while she doesn\u2019t want her daughter inheriting her own disordered thinking about food, she does want her daughter to stay thin.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Just for health reasons? She seems to recognize the wrongness of it, yet still tacitly engages in it, if the first paragraph of the article is any indication.\u00a0 Whether or not she actually sees having a fat daughter as a failure, she\u2019s seeing life and child rearing in terms of competition over image and reputation, and I think that\u2019s potentially just as damaging to a child\u2019s self-acceptance as being saddled with a parent\u2019s food issues is\u2013the knowledge that you\u2019re never valuable, sufficient, or truly loved, apart from the image of the family that you project.\u00a0 That more than being healthy, content, and comfortable with yourself, you need to worry about what other people might think of you, or might think of us because of you.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what it means to a child to say, \u201cbe healthy, but watch your size.\u201d\u00a0 Having healthy kids isn\u2019t a competition.\u00a0 Living well isn\u2019t a competition.\u00a0 Orenstein doesn\u2019t quite seem to understand that, and I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s Berkeley\u2019s fault.

Only far in retrospect is that bright, sparklingly vivid tranquility that was there the whole time apparent to me, as I take a last few peaceful hours to myself this morning, before I begin tomorrow my next long, hard slog through a production that I can already tell is going to take everything out of me for the next couple months.\u00a0 It\u2019s like the assurance of peace only now caught up to me in time, or I caught  up to it.\u00a0 The sense is resonant of a verse of one of my current favorite songs: I am assured, yes, I am assured, yes, I am assured that peace will come to me. \n A peace that can, yes, surpass the speed, yes, of my understanding and my need. \u2013Josh Ritter, \u201cLark\u201d A thought that I\u2019m going to try to hang on to\u2026as it\u2019s becoming apparent that my next few weeks are going to feel more like this: Remember: Every situation is different with respect to the bear, the terrain, the people and their activity.

{"date": "November 29, 2010", "body": "So the group American Atheists has put up this billboard outside the Lincoln Tunnel in New Jersey: \n I\u2019m not even going to get started on the billboard\u2019s implications that faith and reason are mutually exclusive conditions of being.\u00a0 Or that only atheists are reasonable people.\u00a0 Or that all religious belief is literal and simpleminded.\u00a0 Or its smarmy pretenses to intellectual superiority.\u00a0 Or the fact that\u2013though it\u2019s sadly true that atheists have for many years endured inexcusable insults, abuse, and persecution from believers\u2013lumping all Christian believers together into a stereotype, insulting their intellectual capacity, and spitting on the significance of their holiday is probably not the greatest way to win friends, allies, respect or acceptance. What I do want to critique is the billboard\u2019s chief assertion\u2013which I hear from some atheists quite frequently\u2013that religious beliefs amount to nothing more than myth, or even fairy tale. (And I say SOME atheists, because most I know do not go around insulting other people\u2019s beliefs just because they don\u2019t share or understand them.\u00a0 Just like most of the religious people I know  don\u2019t  believe, or go around telling atheists, that they\u2019re amoral devil worshipers who are all going to hell unless they\u2019re saved by Jesus.) Yes, I know it\u2019s a myth, thanks very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m a Christian, and I know that the Christmas story is a myth. But atheists who condescendingly call religious stories myths and fairy tales actually aren\u2019t succeeding in insulting religion.\u00a0 They\u2019re showboating their own ignorance and shallowness by belittling the cultural and emotional importance of myth and fairy tale. When we think of \u201cmyths,\u201d most of us probably think first of the Greek and Roman myths, which maybe we learned in school, and were probably told that they were the way that ancient people explained natural phenomena like the seasons because they didn\u2019t have science yet.\u00a0 So we got the impression that myths are simplistic stories that ignorant people make up for themselves to explain what they otherwise can\u2019t. And \u201cfairy tales\u201d now carry a strong connotation of \u201cDisney\u201d in American culture\u2013sweet and fanciful stories to comfort children with, which always have happy endings. But neither of these is historically accurate.\u00a0 Most people know by this time that the original fairy tales of medieval Europe were not at all what Disney later made of them; they were dark and frightening and contained more than ample murder, rape, child abuse, grinding poverty, evil, and sorrow and suffering of every kind.\u00a0 And they didn\u2019t sugarcoat or dumb down the reality of these things for children.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t told to distract children from the horrors of their daily existence, but to illustrate, symbolically, how to confront and cope with them. And to really be familiar with the Greek/Roman, Scandinavian, Celtic, ancient Japanese, or any other culture\u2019s collection of myths, they\u2019re not superficial or simplistic little stories about why we have seasons; they\u2019re incredibly multidimensional, psychologically rich narratives about a culture\u2019s conceptions of its relation to morality, fate, death, nature, birth and renewal, eternity, and love. And we\u2019re  still  telling and retelling those stories, every day, in every possible medium\u2013in movies, books, music, theater and dance.\u00a0 In  comic books , even.\u00a0 We\u2019re still moved and educated and entertained by them.\u00a0 Not because we think that they\u2019re literally or factually true, but because they have powerful emotional and intuitive resonance with  timeless human experiences that can be hard to articulate or accept in  literal ways.\u00a0 Not because we unquestioningly believe them, but because they  make us question .\u00a0 They are supposed to make us think more deeply about our own lives, not stop thinking. So it doesn\u2019t offend me when anyone calls religious experiences and stories myths.\u00a0 Because they are, in the best sense of the word.\u00a0 They give common voice to the most difficult and intimate of human experiences.\u00a0 What\u2019s maddening is when people hurl \u201cmyth\u201d as an insult, without any apparent understanding of what they\u2019re saying.\u00a0 It reveals much more about their own disdain for what they don\u2019t understand than it does about the significance of religious celebration.

And then the pigeons struck. I had taken the boxes inside for a few days during a cold spell; the peppermint especially liked the warmth inside, and in a few days, the box was nearly filled with bright green stems a few inches tall.\u00a0 I put them back outside when it was warmer again, came home from rehearsal one day, and to my horror, found almost all of them tattered, harassed-looking, or snipped off almost completely at the soil line.\u00a0 The strawberry had been putting out a couple of huge brand new leaves, which were gone, and the arugula had been practically uprooted and looked battered within an inch of its life. The pigeons didn\u2019t do this last year\u2026and I still can\u2019t understand why this year.\u00a0 When I first put in plants last summer, they did nip at them mildly for a few days, but then stopped.\u00a0 So I was frustrated, but figured that they\u2019d get bored of it this year as they had last year and stop.\u00a0 I replaced the first arugula, which did soon perish, with four more robust looking plantings of baby greens.\u00a0 The mint started to regrow, and I put everything back outside again. And they did it again.\u00a0 The greens just vanished, not pecked at but uprooted entirely, and the mint got bitten back down again, many of the remaining shoots tattered and broken.\u00a0 The basil was picked at, too, but not damaged nearly so badly. The one thing that pigeons don\u2019t seem to enjoy is thyme.\u00a0 It was not touched. A confession here: Yes, I could get metal wire cages, or one of those plastic decoy owls\u2026but, being usually pretty broke, I was reluctantly unwilling to spend far more money protecting these plants than I spent on the plants themselves, or the value that I was ever likely to get from them in harvest.\u00a0 Looking online for cost-effective solutions, I found that supposedly, there is no natural pigeon repellent.\u00a0 At all. Unwilling to accept this, I thought \u201cI\u2019ll bet I could download an owl,\u201d and sure enough, some Googling found several solid black owl silhouettes.\u00a0 I printed one out and blew it up a little, cut it out and taped it to the window in front of the planters. It looks really good, a little bit sinister, from inside\u2013and even frightened one of my roommates one night.\u00a0 And I held out hope for a few days that it was sort of working; I wanted to believe I was seeing less pecking damage over the next few days. But from outside the window, I could tell that it was so much dimmer inside than out that this black silhouette was not very scary looking.\u00a0 Still, I hoped that pigeons were more innately owl-aware, and this vague shadow might prove dissuasive. Then my other roommate caught sight of this thing one morning while working at home.\u00a0 She said this pigeon was the size of a chicken, and not apparently afraid of anything.\u00a0 Shadow-owl fail.\u00a0 My best option was starting to seem like catching this monster pigeon and wringing its neck. The next thing I tried was a simple physical barrier\u2013we have lots of clear plastic salad containers, so I set a few over the newly recovering shoots, in a way that would allow them both light and a little air. This did prove a little more effective.\u00a0 The covers proved just enough of a hassle to the pigeon hoards that they must\u2019ve judged that the food value they were getting for the effort wasn\u2019t worth it.\u00a0 They could push them around, but after a couple of weeks, it looked like they\u2019d actually gotten bored and more or less given up.\u00a0 And the new shoots were getting too tall to be smushed under the covers. But I was disheartened.\u00a0 The thrice-destroyed mint was growing back much more slowly than at the beginning of the spring, I had one remaining little salad plant, and it looked so lonely that I couldn\u2019t bear to eat it.\u00a0 The strawberry has shown not one flower; I think I will probably not get a single berry this summer. And then I made a pot of black-eyed peas one weekend.\u00a0 I\u2019d been craving them.\u00a0 I soaked the pot overnight, as per package directions.\u00a0 But it was a hot night in June, and in the morning, the whole pot of beans was not just softened, but sprouted.\u00a0 Feeling like a gleefully experimental kindergartner, I took three of them, while I boiled the rest, and planted them in a little glass pot outside.\u00a0 They grew so fast, the white shoots turning green in the sunlight and then flourishing unbelievably-sized leaves for such a short time, that I had to transplant them within a couple of days.\u00a0 Within 48 hours, I couldn\u2019t believe that these things had been dry peas in a plastic bag in the grocery store barely a couple days ago. I have no idea what the time to maturity of peas is, but they\u2019re now little bushes and still rapidly growing. Figuring I better get something to salvage the rest of the space in box number 2, I finally got a tomato plant, whose pungent and toxic leaves I thought would be less likely to be found acceptable food by the pigeons (I admit, the smell of tomato plants has always been one of my favorite smells).\u00a0 So far, so good; they don\u2019t seem interested.\u00a0 The variety is \u201cMr. Stripey,\u201d which I\u2019ve never heard of before; I\u2019m sort of excited to see how they\u2019ll come out. So it\u2019s been an experimental but not very productive summer.\u00a0 Since most of my now-successful plants went in so late due to false starts, I don\u2019t know how much if anything I\u2019ll get by fall\u2013maybe a few handfuls of peas and tomatoes.\u00a0 Maybe enough mint for a cocktail; it\u2019s all grown back again, but nowhere near as tall and robust as it should\u2019ve been by this time of year.\u00a0 The basil is just starting to get bushy, so I\u2019ll have it with some pasta or eggplant.\u00a0 The thyme alone is doing wonderfully.\u00a0 I like snipping it over grilled lamb or pork chops, or just on tomatoes with a little salt.\u00a0 I had good results earlier this year with a rosemary-infused simple syrup I devised, which I think I\u2019ll try next with thyme, to use in some kind of drink with Hendricks gin and berry herb iced tea. That sounds like a good plan for August, no?

(Incidentally, I grew up in the Kansas City area but did not attend the KCMO school district; my town was served by the Park Hill district.\u00a0 It was considered a \u201cgood\u201d school district\u2013it\u2019s probably still ranked among the best in the state\u2013but I was miserable.) Superintendent Covington is brave and brilliant for making this transition.\u00a0 A high school diploma will mean something again\u2013that students have actually mastered something of their own initiative\u2013whereas right now, in most places, it means that you sat there for 13 years and didn\u2019t try to do anything too hard. I could have finished the high school English curriculum by the end of 8th grade, in the time that I spent reading the whole textbook by the end of the first week of school every year and then sitting through the rest of the year zoned out and angry while the teacher tried to control the discipline problems of kids who just didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 The math curriculum between 3rd and 8th grade was meaningless\u2013you just had to sit in math class because most kids had gotten long division and fractions but weren\u2019t ready for algebra.\u00a0 No more in downtown Kansas City.\u00a0 I just about want to cry when I think about all the art classes I didn\u2019t have time to take, that I could have if I weren\u2019t stuck in classes that meant  nothing  to me or were absurdly below my ability level. What might this end\u2026\u00a0 Labeling kids failures for not learning the same things the same way at the same time as people who just happen to be the same age.\u00a0 Teaching to the lowest common denominator.\u00a0 The busywork required to keep all students in a class achieving on the same mediocre and arbitrary level. What might this create\u2026\u00a0 Respect and encouragement rather than punishment for independence and self-direction, active learning and risk-taking rather than passive obedience.\u00a0 A healthier social environment, with kids able to befriend and work with a diverse set of other students continually and based on shared interest, instead of being confined almost exclusively with people only their own age for 13 years.\u00a0 Invaluable mentoring relationships with teachers who will be able to spend time guiding students independently in their own goals. If I had to name a single policy change that would do the most to change the public school institution from a place where I would not dream of sending a child, to one that I\u2019d be thrilled to support, this would be it.\u00a0  Merde  to Kansas City, and may many others follow their example.

{"date": "July 11, 2010", "body": "I like to believe that if the economy or food supply chain were ever to seriously, catastrophically tank, I\u2019d be one of those hardy people who\u2019d be able to grow or forage enough of my own food to get by. Sadly, this hypothesis is not supported by the results of my efforts at fire escape container gardening this summer. The location presents several not-insurmountable challenges: first, we\u2019re north-facing, but with tall buildings on both sides.\u00a0 I guess the resulting light situation would best be described as \u201cpart sun,\u201d in that it\u2019s fully sunny from dawn till about noon\u2026and then it\u2019s shady.\u00a0 (I haven\u2019t been able to sustain anything inside; the apartment is very long and narrow\u2013what\u2019s termed a \u201cshotgun\u201d apartment\u2013and gets almost no real sunlight since we\u2019re faced on both sides by adjacent apartment buildings across narrow alleys.) Challenge #2: The landlord. I had put out a window box and a couple pots the second summer I lived here, mostly of flowers.\u00a0 Shortly, we got a letter from our management office stating that all objects had to be removed from the fire escapes, or they would  be  removed.\u00a0 I thought I would be a little recalcitrant and see if they actually meant it, so I ignored about three of those letters.\u00a0 They did mean it.\u00a0 Disheartened, I didn\u2019t try to have window boxes again for a couple of years, but finally, the demands of my mental health to have plants won out. I thought I\u2019d get smarter and put them up on the railings of the fire escape; that way, they\u2019d have no excuse that anything was blocking fire egress.\u00a0 So I got one box and a railing bracket, and as detailed below, battled the bizarro weather all summer to grow a few herbs. Sure enough, about September, we got another letter from the landlord.\u00a0 Remove all objects from the fire escapes.\u00a0 This time I fought back, though.\u00a0 I wrote a letter back to the effect that a.) there are no city fire codes that prohibit railing boxes, only boxes that block fire escape walkways, and b.) that there is no provision in our lease prohibiting railing boxes, so, therefore, please leave my stuff alone.\u00a0 And so far, it looks like I\u2019ve won.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard back from them, and my boxes haven\u2019t been bothered. Anyway\u2026last  summer was complicated in New York by very late cold weather  (like, it didn\u2019t really stop feeling like winter until about May), followed  by daily torrential rain through July.\u00a0 The peppermint did just fine; it\u2019s an invasive weed that behaves much like kudzu and is almost impossible to kill.\u00a0  The basil was okay\u2013it will put up with a lot as long as it\u2019s  consistently warm, being a Mediterranean plant.\u00a0 The sage did not do  okay.\u00a0 I actually did not detect any growth from the time I planted it  until it died in November.\u00a0 Sage is a dry weather/desert plant, so  although it was warm, eventually, I think it was just in a state of near-drowning  almost constantly, and couldn\u2019t recover. But somewhat happy with what I did get\u2013a lot of peppermint (which mainly went into Firefly sweet tea vodka lemonades) and basil (snipped over fried eggplant with tomato sauce, or on top of egg/cheese/tomato sandwiches)\u2013I wanted to try to expand this year into some of the 12 feet or so of railing space I still had and try some more varieties of produce. I wanted to go for baby eggplants, but the sunlight situation, I thought, probably wouldn\u2019t serve them well.\u00a0 I had always shied from tomatoes in window boxes because of their tall gangliness.\u00a0 Some other commenters over on the  Possum Living blog  suggested that lettuces working surprisingly well for containers without consistent sun.\u00a0 And I had had good luck with strawberries in my Midwest backyard as a teenager, despite woefully neglecting them.\u00a0 So I settled on some arugula mix baby greens, and an alpine strawberry plant (I just got one, because they send out runners like mint does, so I figured I\u2019d have a whole box by the end of the summer from one plant.)\u00a0 For the herb box, there was plenty of peppermint coming up again (it\u2019s a perennial, which will return year after year), and I added basil again, and thyme. And then came challenge #3: The Pigeons. I have never hated pigeons before this summer.\u00a0 People call them flying rats that eat trash, but I couldn\u2019t blame them for doing their ecological part in cleaning up the mess that humans make of this city.\u00a0 People accuse them of carrying like 120 different diseases\u2026but I was at a loss as to how  that  makes them more disgusting than humans.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve always found them pretty, especially here\u2013we don\u2019t just have the standard gray ones, but all shades, patterns and combinations of white, black, brown and violet\u2013and even sometimes unnervingly intelligent. And then they destroyed everything. {To Be Continued\u2026\u2026} ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.possumliving.net/blog"], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/frustrations-in-urban-container-gardening-part-1/", "title": "Frustrations in urban container gardening, part\u00a01"},
{"date": "July 18, 2010", "body": "It\u2019s funny the things you miss when you\u2019re in tech and preview week for a new musical\u2026.like a  Times  article that scores spectacularly in not one but two of my big journalistic pet peeve departments: picking bad poster children, and grossly mischaracterizing the Millennial generation. The article is \u201c American Dream is Elusive for New Generation .\u201d\u00a0 It profiles Scott Nicholson, who supposedly has been fruitlessly looking for work for two years out of college.\u00a0 The only problem? He hasn\u2019t been.\u00a0 He received an offer for, and turned down, a $40,000 per year job with an insurance company, because he thought it was a dead-end job.\u00a0 Still living with his parents (and thus not worrying about rent) and sending out a handful of resumes per week, he also started a small lawn-mowing and garden business to pay some of his living expenses.\u00a0 He\u2019s had a good shot at  at least  two jobs in two years:\u00a0 the insurance job which he thought was beneath him, or expanding the lawn and garden freelancing (the article says he\u2019s got half a dozen clients, which would seem to me to portend the potential for further success).\u00a0 He hasn\u2019t struck out in the job market at all; he\u2019s failed to find a job straight out of college that will provide him with the easy success and standard of living he\u2019d come to take for granted. I don\u2019t want to pile on to Scott too much more; I think he\u2019s an entitled brat, but over 1400 comments on the original article have now eloquently pointed that out to him, and the fact that his name will be forever linked to this article and the picture he painted of himself in Google\u2019s search algorithms is probably going to prove more than sufficient reproof.\u00a0 I want to discuss some of the problems with his kind of lazy reporting and the responses it engenders, its effects on the rest of us, and how\u2013in spite of itself\u2013it points to what we really need to do. The comments on the story were really fascinating, and I dare say more enlightening than the article itself, and they almost all fell into one of these categories: 1.\u00a0 Scott\u2019s a spoiled brat who needs to learn that no work is beneath him in times like this. \n2.\u00a0 This just proves what I always knew, that Millennials are entitled narcissistic losers who think everything in life should be tailored to be \u201cfulfilling\u201d to them. \n3.\u00a0 Uh, I\u2019m a Millennial, and no, Scott does not represent us or our difficulties or view of work. \n4.\u00a0 Good for Scott for holding out for a decently paying job, and shame on everyone telling him to compromise! (This was a very small minority of responses.) And one of the big problems with reporting like this is its ability to engender response #2; it feeds the confirmation bias of people who already want to believe this.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t shed any light on actual obstacles to getting living wage jobs for recent college graduates; it only provides fodder to those who would prefer to believe that we\u2019re just unrealistic and spoiled and therefore to blame for all of our own problems.\u00a0 And if the paper of record succeeds in confirming this fact to enough of our elders?\u00a0 It\u2019s scary.\u00a0 I really can\u2019t tell at this point whether the  Times  is just being hapless in its selection of article subjects, or if it\u2019s actually intent on promoting this kind of prejudice against young adults.\u00a0 Or if its writers and editors truly have no effing clue how hard it is out there for 20-somethings who aren\u2019t incredibly privileged and so this was really what they thought was a good example.\u00a0 Really, in a city with over 200 Starbucks locations, they couldn\u2019t send a reporter into one to find a college-educated 25-year-old working a $16,000/year job and ask why? Also, there\u2019s the potential for this to embolden lawmakers who claim that extensions of benefits like unemployment and food stamps aren\u2019t necessary, or are actually prolonging joblessness, because they encourage dependency and a sense of entitlement to collect a paycheck for nothing.\u00a0 Who really believe (and there are those who do) that people on unemployment would rather just sit around collecting government money than take a non-perfect job. But most people on unemployment are not sitting around happily turning down $40K jobs.\u00a0 They  actually  cannot find a job.\u00a0 Most people on unemployment do not have their parents paying their rent. Then I\u2019m also troubled by response #4, and its presumed polar opposition to response #1.\u00a0 Because in part of its basic observation, it\u2019s correct: wages suck.\u00a0 Wages have been stagnant since the late 1970\u2019s.\u00a0 Service sector wages particularly suck.\u00a0 And young adults are not wrong to make the case that we need to be paid more, as the cost of a college education has grown disproportionately large compared to expectable salary in return.\u00a0 (Particularly disturbing is the phenomenon of entry-level jobs masquerading as unpaid internships.)\u00a0 But the attitude that we should just hold out to be paid what we\u2019re worth doesn\u2019t get us anything: not credibility, not work experience, not independence, not the self-knowledge and resilience that comes from doing a job and doing it well in order to survive\u2013not because it\u2019s necessarily your dream job.\u00a0 It does zero good at this point to refuse to take basically decent jobs to protest that we aren\u2019t being paid what we should be, because millions of older, more experienced, more desperate people are lined up and happy to take them.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll still wind up looking like clueless brats. And those comments, and the off-base posturing of the whole article, really go straight to the question of what the American Dream is.\u00a0 The  Times  would have us accept that the American Dream is to waltz into a corporate finance job straight out of college with no work experience, with a salary sufficient to support a consumptive upper-middle class lifestyle, and the fact that Scott can\u2019t do it even with all his family\u2019s connections on his side, shows that the American Dream is dead for 20-somethings. I really hope that that\u2019s not what the American Dream is.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it is.\u00a0 And I think that we need to be able to articulate what it  is  to us in order to counter the notions propagated by this article.

{"date": "February 22, 2011", "body": "This opinion piece ( What Is Wrong With the Arts? ) from the Huffington Post made the rounds of Facebook last week among my theater friends, mostly garnering at least some degree of agreement with the thesis that, contrary to much common knowledge about what\u2019s hurting our arts culture, the arts are suffering the most because there\u2019s not enough really good art being made. But I wasn\u2019t on the side of the author (Kennedy Center president Michael Kaiser) until fairly deep into his article; in fact, I started out fairly upset at what he seemed to be charging, when he says that \u201cthe arts are in trouble because there is simply not enough excellent art being created,\u201d and goes on to list a large handful of iconic choreographers, conductors and composers of the 1950\u2019s and \u201960\u2019s, and that \u201cthe classical arts have simply not kept up\u201d with the kind of creativity and innovation going into television, movies, and rock music. (Though I  may  be inclined to agree with him about rock music, given the intelligence and loveliness of some of the rock music I\u2019ve heard in the past couple years.) Young artists today just aren\u2019t up to it, he seems to be saying. And I don\u2019t believe him, because I see astonishing art almost every day.\u00a0 There\u2019s almost not a week of my working life that goes by in which I don\u2019t feel privileged and blessed and astonished to be seeing what I\u2019m seeing. But by the end of the piece, he\u2019s saying something different, when he writes: Now he\u2019s not indicting artists at all, but producing and funding organizations.\u00a0 He\u2019s confused the creation of art with  production  on a high level.\u00a0 And isn\u2019t that exactly what he\u2019s complaining about, when he bemoans the substitution of celebrity for excellence, of ever bigger and more expensive spectacle for insight?\u00a0 Isn\u2019t THAT the problem?\u00a0 He\u2019s got artists and what they do confused with institutions and what they do.\u00a0 And he\u2019s right about the behavior of the institutions.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that excellent art isn\u2019t being made, it\u2019s that it isn\u2019t being chosen for support by institutions and canonization the way it was in the decades he\u2019s nostalgic for.\u00a0 But I promise you, it is being made. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m not going to the Kennedy Center or Lincoln Center  or Broadway to see it (and that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother discussion about the cost of art to working people, including actual artists), but places like La Mama ETC, and Manhattan  Theatre Source, and the Fringe Festival (yes, as much as we all love to complain about the Fringe Festival).\u00a0 It\u2019s being done by groups like New York  Theater Experiment and Company XIV. It\u2019s often being done in the low, low budget shadows. One of the most daring,  emotionally riveting and heartstoppingly good pieces of theater I\u2019ve  ever seen to this day was called  The Warzone is My Bed , and it was done  at La Mama with no sets but one wall and a bed.\u00a0 And I have no idea what, if anything, happened to it after the end of its 2007 showcase run. I think about the projects I\u2019ve worked for which have brought me to both tears and elation, night after night as I sat and ran the cues. There\u2019s not enough excellent art being chosen for financial support and further production and distribution.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that no one\u2019s making it.\u00a0 It means no one\u2019s paying attention.\u00a0 Or that the people who are don\u2019t have the financial means to bring it to a wider market.\u00a0 Or that the people with the financial means are making bad judgments about what\u2019s good art.\u00a0 Or that we all lack faith (maybe justifiably, given the box office success of  No Strings Attached  and  Jackass 3D ) in the willingness of the wider citizenry to pay for daring, challenging performing arts. But in any of those cases, if we were to actually, substantially, visibly support the most talented and insightful of individual young artists, I bet we wouldn\u2019t be complaining about not having enough good art.

{"date": "December 9, 2010", "body": "CNN asks this week \u201c Is an internship the new entry-level job ?\u201d in an article profiling several recent college grads who have racked up half a dozen or more unpaid internships apiece while looking for full-time jobs in their degree areas. Several things trouble me here. \u201cI want to do what I studied, and I don\u2019t want to settle,\u201d says Ani Kevork, who graduated in 2009 and is in her first paid internship after six unpaid internships.\u00a0 Six. unpaid. internships. I\u2019ve written before that people who know how to be constantly learning  are never confined by their schooling.\u00a0 Kevork seems determined to be  confined by her schooling.\u00a0 Maybe this recession will pass and she\u2019ll get a job in her degree area.\u00a0 But then what happens to her in the next downturn or the one after? I have to wonder what she studied; the article doesn\u2019t say.\u00a0 I sympathize\u2026who doesn\u2019t want to be actually working in the area they studied for?\u00a0 But I have to take issue with the outlook that taking a job that isn\u2019t what you studied for right out of college is settling.\u00a0 This is something that humanities and arts majors have always had to cope with.\u00a0 It\u2019s the right thing to do for some people, and may be the wrong thing for some people, but if your priority is to be self-supporting, it\u2019s often just the way to do that.\u00a0 And this is only even a choice for people whose parents are able and willing to financially support them indefinitely.\u00a0 Anyway, she\u2019s settling in a different way: working without getting paid. Which is obviously the second big problem.\u00a0 Companies are learning that they can get away with not paying their young workers, because we\u2019re so desperate and fearful of being left out in the cold entirely.\u00a0 And if companies are actually using interns to fill functions that used to be paid positions, or if an unpaid internship is really a low-level job and not primarily educational in nature, then that\u2019s also illegal.\u00a0 And after six (or nine, or 15) internships, an internship is no longer serving an educational function; you\u2019re being taken advantage of.\u00a0 But this is a condition that we\u2019re being told to accept, or risk falling behind young workers who are more willing to be endlessly taken advantage of. Thirdly, as the article notes, \u201cit\u2019s no longer enough to get a degree. Employers expect a certain skill  set of those they consider for a job post-graduation.\u201d But then, shouldn\u2019t we be asking why students aren\u2019t learning that skill set as part of their education?\u00a0 If a college education was once considered sufficient preparation for an entry-level job, and is no longer, to the extent that a post-graduation internship (or six) is now considered by default to be essentially mandatory, shouldn\u2019t we be seriously questioning both colleges and employers why a college education is no longer measuring up to real skill requirements?\u00a0 Not that a classroom education can or should ever be expected to bestow everything a graduate needs to learn, but most students should\u2019ve had some significant opportunity in the course of their college years to obtain and practice real professional skills.\u00a0 (I\u2019ve estimated myself that probably about 75-80% of my real college education occurred outside the classroom.)\u00a0 And young workers can and should be expected to pick up skills and knowledge on the job. I\u2019m by no means unilaterally against internships, including unpaid ones in some circumstances.\u00a0 There are specialized skills that are best learned in the context of the real working world.\u00a0 Mentoring relationships with experienced professionals can be priceless. My own one and only internship (paid) was among the most important experiences of my life and continues to pay off professionally.\u00a0 But when we\u2019re talking about years\u2019 worth of multiple unpaid internships now being the only way that many young workers can stay engaged in the labor market, and we\u2019re expected to accept this as just the way it is now, the very concept of what an internship is supposed to be is being abused to the point of meaninglessness, along with the skills of young workers.\u00a0 This is something closer to acceptance of a new version of indentured servitude. And lastly, while the article touches on the statistic that currently only 41% of Millennials have a full-time job, it doesn\u2019t explicitly make a connection between this recent acceptance of unpaid internships in place of entry-level jobs and our generation\u2019s supposed Peter Pan syndrome.\u00a0 So, for future reference ( ahem,  New York Times ), the next time anyone\u2019s wondering why 20-somethings can\u2019t seem to move out on our own, get married, and start having kids, consider that maybe it\u2019s because employers don\u2019t seem to think that they should have to pay us.

{"date": "December 21, 2010", "body": "Variety ran this fascinating article a couple days ago, on the stage management team of the new musical  Spiderman: Turn Off the Dark . ( \u201cSpiderman spins epic technical challenge: Seven stage managers try to corral Broadway spectacular.\u201d ) It\u2019s been fascinating and a little unsettling to me, as a stage manager, the extent to which the stage management of this now infamously troubled production has been in the public eye, because, of course, when things are going as they should, we and our work are mostly invisible.\u00a0 To the public, to the audience, and to an extent even to the cast and rest of the production team. We\u2019re like fairies that way. I have not seen  Spiderman  in previews, and don\u2019t plan to, can\u2019t afford to, will probably be too busy to\u2026it\u2019s a low priority for me given that I probably won\u2019t even be able to make it to  In the Heights  or  Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson , which I desperately want to see, before they close.\u00a0 Though I do sometimes go to shows I probably wouldn\u2019t otherwise ( Shrek ) to appreciate the technical wizardry of how a production that large and intricate is done, given that most of what I do is of a much more intimate scope.\u00a0 But mostly, I don\u2019t want to support in any way the vision that  Spiderman \u2018s dependence on outsized spectacle is the future of Broadway theater or what\u2019s required to keep audiences\u2019 attention because they can\u2019t be trusted to think or imagine anything for themselves.\u00a0 I\u2019d rather just be told a good story\u2013tight, elegant and well-acted. The first preview was apparently a nightmare which had to be halted five times.\u00a0 There have been four major injuries in the course of the rehearsals and previews so far, the latest just last night when a stunt double fell 30 feet into the pit when a safety rope broke.\u00a0 I appreciate that the producers, director and designers are attempting to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on stage, and that there\u2019s risk in everything we do in theater, but it\u2019s time to stop the magical thinking when it becomes clear that a conception of a show cannot be accomplished with a reasonable expectation of safety. And yet I stand in total amazement of C. Randall White and Kathy Purvis.\u00a0 Because I can\u2019t begin to imagine what they must be going through right now, and the kind of single-minded professional determination they must possess to be dedicated to trying to keep this production together.\u00a0 Because their capability and bravery in taking this on is so far beyond what I ever hope to be.\u00a0 As much as I think  Spiderman  was probably a bad idea from the very start, I could never wish this kind of trouble on any production knowing that there\u2019s a stage manager, or seven, doing their goddamn best to carry out impossible demands and keep everyone safe. And I\u2019m even a little bit glad for the public having a glimpse into the job of the stage manager, because there is so much blame flying around for the show\u2019s problems, so much misunderstanding or total lack of knowledge of the job and what its responsibilities are.\u00a0 And because usually, mostly in productions in which we manage to remain secret fairies, it is a wonderful job.

{"date": "September 15, 2010", "body": "President Obama gave his  second annual start of the school year address  this week to the nation\u2019s students, and many media sources have noted the general absence of the paranoia and outrage that marked the occasion last fall, including accusations of injecting politics into education, socialist indoctrination, and parents threatening to pull their children from school for the day lest their vulnerable minds be contaminated by whatever inflammatory thing the President might have to say to 3rd graders (I\u2019m still at a loss as to what these parents really feared he might say).\u00a0 But I\u2019ve actually found both years remarkable for the almost utter lack of attention paid to the substance of the speech itself. I was thrilled to hear Obama openly acknowledge the realities and difficulties that many students are facing: financial insecurity and family tension, the wars and the recession, wondering if they\u2019ll be able to afford college at all.\u00a0 I always resented being talked down to or having the truth soft-pedaled to me as a kid so I was appreciative that he didn\u2019t even try.\u00a0 I was glad to hear him ask students to reject bullying and show kindness and respect each others\u2019 differences; I\u2019m not sure it would\u2019ve done a lot of good but that\u2019s something I would have loved to hear a President say when I was in middle school.\u00a0 I think the President spoke with an awareness that childhood bullying, unchecked, grows up into the kind of much more dangerous bullying behavior\u2013lying, smearing, contempt, character assassination, open disregard for the rights or dignity of opponents, even violence\u2013that we\u2019ve seen all too much on display in our political process lately. I was glad to hear him tell students that \u201cnobody gets to write your destiny but you.\u201d\u00a0 I wish this was the #1 lesson that we imparted to all students: that no one else gets to tell you who or what you are, or what you can or can\u2019t do. The two big (and almost completely predictable) things wrong, however: the near-equation of education with school success, and the lauding of \u201chard work\u201d as the key to nearly all success, in education, life and career. The fact is that the school system we have now is, for many, many students, a tragically counterproductive system or simply a  bad  learning environment.\u00a0 It has no respect for learning differences, for individual ambition, or for independent thought.\u00a0 Its goals are standardization and submission to authority.\u00a0 By constantly punishing students for their deficits rather than encouraging them and letting them go as far as possible in their strengths, it forces most students to be mediocre in most everything.\u00a0 Schools confer diplomas, not education.\u00a0 When the school system does not serve the goals of education or of the individual student (which was usually, in my experience from kindergarten through 10th grade), then our encouragement of students to fulfill their full educational potential might need to include encouragement to leave school behind and pursue their own education. And we need real schooling options which will take into account the individual learning styles, desires, and goals of students when those are at odds with what\u2019s considered acceptable by the current school system.\u00a0 The schools we have are failing too many kids.\u00a0 Asking them to keep playing along is not a solution to anything. \u201cMore and more, the kinds of opportunities that are open to you will be  determined by how far you go in school.\u00a0 In other words, the farther you go in school, the farther you\u2019ll go in life,\u201d Obama stated, as if this is a  foregone conclusion.\u00a0 I hope it isn\u2019t.\u00a0 I think that this is a  vision of the future that we should and can reject and turn back from.\u00a0 With the exception of highly technical, scientific or medical career fields, there\u2019s no particular reason that it needs to be true.\u00a0 Indeed, this faulty outlook that everyone needs more and more schooling\u2013that everyone needs a college degree\u2013to be successful and comfortable is, I think, is largely responsible both for the explosion of college costs and the increasing meaninglessness of a college degree.\u00a0 And to look at the number of our geniuses, innovators, artists and business successes who were school failures or dropouts or who avow that their formal education had little or nothing to do with their eventual success, is a pretty strong refutation of the presumption that length of schooling is deterministic of how far anyone can go in life.\u00a0 Whereas I worked hard and did well in school and found myself graduating high school with all A\u2019s and almost no skills, something that I had to take it upon myself to fix.\u00a0 People who can teach themselves, on the other hand, who are always learning and adapting, are never confined by their schooling. Hard work, of course, is a necessary ingredient to most success, but not a sufficient one.\u00a0 We have millions of people out of work right now, and not for any aversion to hard work.\u00a0 Likewise, millions of people are desperate for any job and more than willing to take menial or physically demanding ones, but find themselves disqualified (or \u201coverqualified\u201d) by advanced degrees.\u00a0 Most of them, I\u2019m sure,  have  worked hard their whole lives, doing what they thought they were supposed to do, believing that hard work would keep them safe.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of our most intoxicating and stubborn national myths, that hard work is the primary necessary condition for material success and security; it\u2019s our way of saying that life is fair at its core and that people ultimately get what they deserve.\u00a0 But it isn\u2019t, and sometimes they don\u2019t.\u00a0 Often, the people who work the hardest struggle the most for their entire lives. What\u2019s going to restore America\u2019s vitality and point the directions in which we need to go next in so many areas\u2013energy independence, health care, job creation, healing our ecological situation, just to name a few\u2013in addition to hard work, are ingenuity, creativity, critical and fiercely independent thinking, judicious willingness to take risks\u2026and ethical leadership.\u00a0 All of which are precisely the things  discouraged  by the predominant way in which we currently educate children. What I wish a leader would say to the nation\u2019s students is this: that in order to write your own destiny, you have to take your education into your own hands.\u00a0 That means being focused and unashamed of what you want out of your life and what you want to accomplish in the world, looking around you to assess whether your educational environment is helping or hindering you in meeting your own ambitions, and taking things into your own hands if it isn\u2019t.\u00a0 Because playing by other peoples\u2019 rules is no future at all, for you or for the country.

{"date": "October 7, 2010", "body": "A couple of posts ago I mentioned that my apartment is without a television.\u00a0 We actually wind up mentioning this fact fairly often, whenever we\u2019re once again looking for a subleaser to live in our third bedroom.\u00a0 After one round of Craigslist roommate hunting a few years ago, we realized that most people still took the presence of a TV for granted, while we had long taken its absence for granted, and then blessedly realized that explicitly mentioning our lack of a TV, and lack of any desire to acquire one, in a roommate ad, vastly decreased the number of responses from people who were unlikely to be suitable roommates anyway. We do still  watch  some TV; Emily #2 has a Netflix subscription, and most of what little I want is online for free. We just don\u2019t  have  a TV.\u00a0 I think it certainly cuts down on the total amount of TV watching that we do, as well nearly eliminating passive, stupid TV watching.\u00a0 Everything we watch has to be a conscious decision; we can\u2019t just leave the TV on in the background and thus wind up sitting in front of it all night.\u00a0 Even watching stupid TV has to be a conscious decision ( Hoarders .\u00a0 I\u2019m guilty). People know that stuff is all online these days.\u00a0 People increasingly do not watch shows one episode at a time in their original television runs, but in marathons from Netflix.\u00a0 Still, the typical response, when it comes up that we don\u2019t have a TV, is almost without variation: But what do you  do ?! It never fails to horrify me, that incredulous question.\u00a0 Or amaze me how short the collective memory of humanity is. What do we do without television?\u00a0 Things that people did before there was television, I guess.\u00a0 Here are some of them: 1. We talk to each other.\u00a0 Most of the nights that I\u2019ve inadvertently stayed up way past a reasonable bedtime were because Emily #2 and I got into a conversation and couldn\u2019t get out. 2.\u00a0 We drink, and talk to each other. 3. We cook.\u00a0 Usually when people say they don\u2019t have time to cook, I wonder how much TV they watch. 4. We read. The internet, the newspaper, books.\u00a0 (\u201cWhen I was your age, television was called  books !\u201d ~  The Princess Bride ) 5. We listen to the radio.\u00a0 Yes, I know  This American Life  is available as a podcast.\u00a0 There\u2019s still something ephemerally great about sitting around the kitchen on Saturday afternoon and just  listening  to it.\u00a0 During both the 2004 and 2008 election seasons, we listened to most of the presidential candidate debates rather than watching them, and it was really fascinating what a difference in perception we\u2019d have from people who watched them on the quality of argumentation, the importance of certain answers over others, even who won. 6.\u00a0 We write.\u00a0 Emily #2 is a playwright.\u00a0 And I\u2019m a letter-writer, and a journal-writer, and now I guess, a blogger. 7. We work.\u00a0 Both of us are in theater/entertainment; we work long hours and we work at night.\u00a0 And the saying \u201ctruth is stranger than fiction\u201d is true; it\u2019s stranger and it\u2019s way more entertaining.\u00a0 Very little of what gets made up to put on television can beat the reality of what we go through every night in live theater for suspense or entertainment value. We don\u2019t miss it\u2013the ceaseless noise or mindless chatter.\u00a0 We like our neighborhood because it\u2019s quiet.\u00a0 We had a roommate once who said she\u2019d be okay without it, and then really, really wasn\u2019t and kept trying to pressure us into getting one.\u00a0 Literally, there isn\u2019t even room in a single room of our apartment to put one, and we told her that we\u2019re not paying the rent to live in New York City in order to sit in front of the TV.\u00a0 I seriously don\u2019t think I envision ever owning a TV again.

{"date": "October 4, 2010", "body": "On the set of my last production,  With Glee , a musical about five wayward teenage boys sent to a remote boarding/reform school in Maine, a chalkboard hanging above the balcony carried the fictional Westbrook School\u2019s coat of arms, as invented by our scenic designer Jen, and a motto: \u201cThe Best is Yet To Be.\u201d I told her that I really loved that choice of motto, both as it thematically concerned the play and the personal journeys of the characters, and as a retort to a very commonly held truism in our culture, one that I felt we were inundated with when I was a teenager: \u201cHigh school is the best time of your life.\u201d\u00a0 No, the motto gently said to both characters and audience, these are  not  the best years of these boys\u2019 lives.\u00a0 With growing confidence, perspective and self-acceptance, things are only going to get better for these kids. This past week, Dan Savage launched his  It Gets Better project , sharing videos from LGBT adults about the full and happy lives they have now, in response to a disturbing number of suicides by gay teens in recent weeks, to tell LGBT teens who are suffering bullying and abuse that life gets so much better after high school, and that they should hang on and live to grow up.\u00a0 It\u2019s a wonderful thing, though, not to detract at all from what Dan is trying to accomplish for gay teens, I would love to see this message extended more by all adults to all teenagers.\u00a0 But especially to all the misfits, all the nerds, geeks and dorks, anyone suffering bullying or ostracism, anyone being told that everything you are is wrong, anyone who feels hopelessly different or isolated or alone. During graduation week of my senior year of high school, one of the  activities of enforced fun planned for us was an address to the  graduating class by a recent alumnus.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if this speech was  supposed to be inspirational, or a reality check, or what\u2026I forget his  name, but the speaker regaled us with glory days tales about how he\u2019d  been a big, cocky, good-looking football star who everyone loved.\u00a0 He  couldn\u2019t hack it in college, though, and dropped out after one semester,  developed a drug addiction, got his girlfriend knocked up, and wound up  waiting tables at his dad\u2019s pizza joint.\u00a0 His thesis statement, his  conclusion from his own experience, was \u201cappreciate this time, because  high school is the best time of your life.\u201d\u00a0 I think he  actually  said \u201cit\u2019s all downhill from here.\u201d\u00a0 A friend sitting next to me in the auditorium said,  \u201cSo just shoot me now.\u201d Anyone who tells you that high school comprises the best years of your life is lying to you.\u00a0 Maybe they just don\u2019t know any better themselves.\u00a0 Maybe high school WAS the best time of their lives, in which case they should be pitied, not listened to.\u00a0 Maybe they\u2019re lying deliberately for more sinister motives; I\u2019m not really sure.\u00a0 But they ARE lying.\u00a0 Life gets so much better. There\u2019s a corollary lie that was told to me, and probably to others, with words and without, over the whole course of my growing up: that adulthood is awful.\u00a0 Everything that adults said about adulthood made it sound tedious, boring, scary and expensive, with not much redeeming quality to recommend it.\u00a0 You have to work at a job, pay bills and clean the house. You have to wear pantyhose to your job (to which I silently, internally replied, \u201cno, that just means I can\u2019t have that kind of job\u201d).\u00a0 Get good grades or you\u2019ll wind up flipping burgers. \u201cIn the real world, you\u2019re going to have to learn to work with all kinds of people,\u201d was the most repetitive, cloying, condescending refrain I heard from teachers, as a solitary girl who resisted forced group work. And certainly most of the adults around me weren\u2019t people I wanted to grow up to be.\u00a0 They yelled, they lied, they spent their days flaunting their arbitrary power over children, telling me what I couldn\u2019t do and that everything I was was somehow wrong.\u00a0 They were condescending and unfair.\u00a0 They MADE adulthood look stupid and awful.\u00a0 I told myself I would never be one.\u00a0 Don\u2019t trust anyone over 30, as the line from a movie went. All of those people were lying, too.\u00a0 Adulthood is wonderful.\u00a0 You get to live on your own terms.\u00a0 You have the power to make your life what you want it to be.\u00a0 It is scary sometimes, and it is expensive, but in almost every other respect, it\u2019s nothing like what I was led to believe it was.\u00a0 Even the paying the bills and cleaning the house parts are actually sort of great.\u00a0 Because every bill I pay reminds me that I\u2019m making a living from something I love doing.\u00a0 Because I like my crazy little apartment; it\u2019s my own space and I like taking care of it.\u00a0 Because everything is better when you know you\u2019ve earned it. I have a job that I didn\u2019t even know existed when I was in high school.\u00a0 In theater, which most of us grew up being told was not a viable option for making a living.\u00a0 It\u2019s a joyful job, shepherding art into the world, which exploits my strengths (like my love of organizing stuff) and allows me to wear whatever I want.\u00a0 I go to work most days in jeans, boots, and my favorite hoodie. The number of people who have ever cared where I went to school or what my grades were=zero. I have wonderful friends, still only a few close ones, chosen and kept for mutual affinity and respect, who I consider as good as family.\u00a0 I have good relationships with the people I work with.\u00a0 My longtime roommate and I joke about being non-sexual \u201cdomestic partners.\u201d I even have better relationships with my parents now that they have no say over how I live my life. It\u2019s not that there are never bullies or unpleasant people, but I have the ability to choose not to keep them in my life for very long; I\u2019m not locked up with them.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have problems, but I have more self-knowledge and self-trust with which to handle them.\u00a0 Most of the bullies of my childhood have lives I wouldn\u2019t want, and the people who had the hardest time in school are doing the most amazing things now. So to all kids having a hard time right now: please live to grow up.\u00a0 College is amazing, and adulthood is better still.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much to learn and experience.\u00a0 There are so many people who will love you for who you really are.\u00a0 The real world is so much more wonderful and free than high school gives you any ability to imagine or anticipate. And grownups, can we all vow to be better examples to the kids in our lives?\u00a0 To be models of something they might actually want to be, to show them the best of what life has to offer and what they can hope for?\u00a0 Because treating kids like they\u2019re stupid, like their problems are trivial, like they don\u2019t deserve fairness or consideration, only teaches them that adulthood is not something to aspire to.

{"date": "August 22, 2010", "body": "I want to address a lot of the misrepresentation, careless thinking, and downright asinine argument surrounding the plans for Cordoba House, a Sufi-affiliated Islamic cultural center to be built in lower Manhattan near the World Trade Center site. To start with, I think there are two big honest misunderstandings driving a lot of the bluster of this debate.\u00a0 First, what this project actually is\u2013and it isn\u2019t a mosque (though it shouldn\u2019t matter even if it were, but I\u2019ll get to that).\u00a0 Its organizers describe the concept as an Islamic cultural/community center modeled on the 92nd St. Y, a huge, multi-use community center of Jewish affiliation (itself modeled on the YMCA\u2013same concept, nominally Christian).\u00a0 It has Jewish cultural and religious events, but also continuing education classes in music and the arts, performance space (where the dance company I work for recently participated in a festival of new work), gym facilities and a pool, child care, summer camp and after school programs, and classroom space\u2013with everything open to everyone in the community.\u00a0 This establishment is pretty well-known in New York, but I don\u2019t know that other cities have similar, equally prominent organizations, so I wonder if a lot of people across the country aren\u2019t really understanding what the analogous plans for Cordoba House are. The second big misunderstanding is much more massive, and less excusable, though hardly limited to this particular debate.\u00a0 It\u2019s that Americans don\u2019t really understand religious divisions and the difference between religion itself and fundamentalism. Islam has militant fundamentalist sects, and peaceful progressive sects, and everything in between,  much like Christianity does.  The 9/11 perpetrators were of the former  bunch, the people trying to build this Islamic cultural center are of  the latter bunch\u2026.  Islam, like Christianity, is  not  one  monolithic, homogeneous group that all believes the same things. For instance, Presbyterians and Mormons both consider themselves  Christians, but they do not believe the same things, and their concrete ideas of what Christianity should accomplish in the world are wildly divergent.\u00a0 This is so in just about every major religion; even Buddhism has had violent radicals. So asking  the Sufi sect of Islam not to build near Ground Zero because the bombers  were \u201cMuslim\u201d makes about as much sense\u2013zero\u2013as would asking  Presbyterians not to build a church near the ruins of the Murrah  building in Oklahoma City because Timothy McVeigh was a militant nationalistic  \u201cChristian,\u201d out of some kind of misplaced respect for the feelings of victims.\u00a0 It\u2019s not respect, it\u2019s cluelessness. They\u2019re not the same  group.  They don\u2019t have squat to do with each other.\u00a0 The progressive Muslims trying to build a cultural center are not responsible for the fact that many Americans don\u2019t understand the differences between their group and the handful of crazed militant radicals who flew planes into buildings, and let themselves be ruled by fear of the unknown.\u00a0 They should not be held emotionally or morally responsible, just like we don\u2019t hold Christianity collectively responsible for what McVeigh did, or that guy who flew his plane into the IRS building, or Fred Phelps\u2019s hateful funeral protests, or the people who bomb women\u2019s clinics and murder abortion doctors. Then there\u2019s the widespread argument of opponents that they\u2019re not saying the Cordoba Initiative shouldn\u2019t have the right to build at that spot, it\u2019s just that they  shouldn\u2019t,  out of sensitivity or respect or understanding for the feelings of 9/11 victims.\u00a0 Or that they should just choose a different location, not so close to Ground Zero, which is \u201challowed ground.\u201d But freedom of religion in this country does not have a geographic limitation.\u00a0 We do not indulge freedom of religion only in approved zones.\u00a0 We have freedom of religion\u2013the assurance that our government does not discriminate against its citizens on the basis of religion\u2013period.\u00a0 How far away would be far enough?\u00a0 And hallowed to whom?\u00a0 Only the white Christians who died there, and not the Muslims who also worked there, died there, lost family and friends in the attacks and suffered terribly with everyone else in the aftermath?\u00a0 Where is the respect and sensitivity to their feelings?\u00a0 They not only lost family and friends like everyone else; now they\u2019re tarred with suspicion and guilt by false association with the killers. The Muslims who live here are just as much New Yorkers, and just as much Americans, as all the rest of us.\u00a0 The protection of their Constitutional rights is just as sacrosanct as those of all the rest of us.\u00a0 They have just as much claim to any piece of ground here that any New Yorker or any American does. And to say that they should have the \u201cright,\u201d to build there, it\u2019s just that  they shouldn\u2019t out of consideration for others\u2019 \u201cfeelings\u201d is just about as  bad as saying they shouldn\u2019t have the right.  It\u2019s saying that they  should consider themselves second-class citizens when it comes to  freedom of assembly and freedom of worship, that they should curtail the  exercise of their own rights out of deference to the irrational and  incorrect portrayal of themselves as violent extremists.  It\u2019s saying  that they should regard themselves as not worthy of equal protection  under the law, out of respect for others\u2019 ignorance and fear. They  shouldn\u2019t.\u00a0  They should stand up and proclaim what they stand for, that the hijackers are not representatives of their Islam, and that they will not be ruled by others\u2019 ignorance.\u00a0 And I cannot think of a better repudiation to the ideology  of the 9/11 perpetrators than to have this cultural center, a representative  of peaceful religion and interfaith respect, an emblem that America will not be scared out of honoring the rights of all of our citizens equally\u2013which is what makes us the great country we claim to be\u2013so close to Ground Zero.\u00a0  I  look forward to visiting as soon as they\u2019re open.

{"date": "August 28, 2010", "body": "As many people probably noticed, the  New York Times Magazine  did another long piece ( \u201cWhat Is It About 20-Somethings?\u201d ) on the Millennial generation\u2019s struggle for economic independence and continuing failure to meet \u201cmarkers of maturity\u201d last week, which I actually give some credit to for being slightly more nuanced and objective than most of the  Times\u2019  coverage of the topic, investigating the work of social scientists who say that \u201cemerging adulthood\u201d is a whole new stage of human development that needs to be accounted for versus those who disagree, and the history of how life stages have been classified as necessary states of psychological development rather than cultural phenomena.\u00a0 Salon.com ran a companion piece from one of their bloggers, a more stereotypical lament (\u201c I became an adult at 22: Why can\u2019t you? \u201c) that 20-somethings can\u2019t seem to grow up and get out of their parents\u2019 houses.\u00a0 Both garnered many hundreds of responses. A lot of commenters say that the problem is that 20-somethings are either entitled or spoiled; we just won\u2019t or can\u2019t figure out how to do what it takes to be independent: we won\u2019t accept a lower standard of housing, we won\u2019t live with roommates, we won\u2019t work multiple jobs, we won\u2019t do without our luxury coffee drinks and expensive toys, we have to have our parents paying our iPhone bills, we just don\u2019t understand how harsh real life is and how hard the future will be for us, having grown up so coddled and with no work ethic. And there are a lot of people, bless them, attempting to be helpful and supportive, insisting that no, it\u2019s IMPOSSIBLE to survive out there on what entry-level jobs pay. This culminated, for me, when I commented tangentially on a  Times  comment board (for an article concerning people whose total 99 weeks of unemployment insurance is about to run out) in response to someone who had insisted that it was not, that yes, it IS possible to survive in New York on under $400 per week.\u00a0 That actually, I was doing pretty well in the weeks that I made $400.\u00a0 In reply, another commenter said that I must be \u201ceither 20 years old, living in a cardboard box, or a liar.\u201d Except that here I am, and a  lot  of people my age, not 20 years old, not living in a cardboard box, doing what one faction says we just won\u2019t do and what another says we can\u2019t. And I don\u2019t write this to claim that everyone should be able to do what I do, or that I\u2019m necessarily representative of more recent college grads (the economy hadn\u2019t yet *completely* sacked out when I graduated six years ago), or that scarcity of fair living wages isn\u2019t a problem for young workers, or to belittle 20-somethings who  can\u2019t  find a job right now and/or have made a rational and well-informed calculation to live with their parents for a while, or to complain about my situation.\u00a0 Just to point out that a lot of us ARE doing what almost every side of this increasingly boneheaded debate says that we are not: growing up, becoming independent, and doing whatever it takes to stay that way. So here\u2019s the snapshot of my experience: I\u2019m 28 years old and I live in New York City on under $400 per week: I live in upper Manhattan, in a lovely neighborhood which, as I\u2019ve said before, I will not name, since it remains relatively undiscovered (and therefore relatively affordable) and we like it that way.\u00a0 Our apartment is rent-regulated, meaning that the rent can only be raised a certain percentage per year as long as the household income is under $170K.\u00a0 Even so, I spend more than half my income on rent most months.\u00a0 (As a yardstick, \u201caffordable\u201d and secure housing is generally considered as costing no more than one third of your income.) The neighborhood is lovely, but the building management is not.\u00a0 It\u2019s an old building, probably about 90 years, as we were told by a repairman working on the gas lines that originally powered the light fixtures, and it has problems common to old buildings, but our management company does not know how, nor do they care, to actually maintain and take care of it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had repeated and chronic issues with leaks, collapsed ceilings, buckling floors, electrical outages, gas leaks (one that nearly killed a neighbor and left us without cooking heat for a month), and lack of heat and hot water in winter.\u00a0 Our bathroom pretty much falls apart every six months, because our building management is unclear on how grout is supposed to work. Why don\u2019t we just move?\u00a0 Well, moving\u2019s expensive and disruptive, and for our price range, we could only afford a building with  different  problems, and it wouldn\u2019t be across the street from Central Park. I work in the performing arts, and no, I did not expect to leave college with a drama degree and get a job with a living wage in my area of expertise.\u00a0 I worked a lot of different jobs to support myself while I worked my way up in my field.\u00a0 For four years while I worked gigs that paid no more than small stipends, I supported myself working in coffee shops, and then doing temp work.\u00a0 When the market for temp workers tanked in early 2009, I had little choice left but to support myself by my theater work alone.\u00a0 Some substantial gigs materialized in the nick of time. I stage manage full-time now and make my living doing it.\u00a0 I am almost always working multiple jobs.\u00a0 I am well-acquainted with 12-14 hour days and 80-hour weeks, though those are becoming less common now that I don\u2019t have a \u201cday\u201d job.\u00a0 (I actually had to be reminded by a friend that in most quarters, it is  not  considered \u201cspoiled\u201d to be able to make a living from one job.)\u00a0 It\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m thankful to be this busy, because it means I survive.\u00a0 I like my work; I\u2019m thankful for all of it that I can take.\u00a0 My income isn\u2019t stable, though; in particularly good months, I save as much as I can for the inevitable slow times. I split rent on a tiny apartment with two roommates.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have a television, so we don\u2019t pay for cable, let alone flatscreen, high-def, DVR, whatever.\u00a0 I have a radio, and otherwise get most of my entertainment online and from the public library.\u00a0 Since I work at night, I don\u2019t go out much to bars or movies.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have an iPhone; I have a 3-year-old cell phone, the one that came free with my calling plan.\u00a0 I have a Macbook, which I saved for a year and a half for, and which isn\u2019t a luxurious toy, but a professional necessity.\u00a0 The one I was using before this was 9 years old and 4th-hand. A confession: I finally have an iPod.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t even have bought one; a friend gave me her old one when my 12-year-old knockoff discman finally broke. I don\u2019t have a car, and will probably never own one again.\u00a0 Public transit is everything here, but the MTA wants to raise the monthly fare from $89 to $130 and do away with unlimited rides, which will be a real hardship for me since I\u2019m often working multiple jobs per day. I don\u2019t buy new things very much.\u00a0 I use things until they\u2019re not usable anymore.\u00a0 I have kitchen utensils and pots that date from my parents\u2019 marriage.\u00a0 I only buy clothes on sale. I don\u2019t eat out much.\u00a0 I know how to cook, and I cook large dishes that can get me through a week: roast chicken and potatoes, casseroles, quiches, squash, rice and beans, and stews.\u00a0 I eat a lot of pasta, cheese, apples, and peanut butter.\u00a0 I buy produce in season.\u00a0 Still, my credit card is sometimes my grocery safety net.\u00a0 (I have hypoglycemia, so I can\u2019t just eat less when my budget gets stretched thin.) We don\u2019t have a microwave, and we don\u2019t have air conditioning. Almost needless to say, I don\u2019t have health insurance.\u00a0 My union does offer incredibly affordable insurance, but the way it\u2019s allocated makes it problematic\u2013you have to have worked a certain number of contract weeks semi-annually to remain eligible.\u00a0 It would be a great deal for someone in a long-running Broadway show.\u00a0 For someone in my situation, however, it would provide no continuity or security whatsoever, as I\u2019d always have to be looking backwards and forwards three months to see if I\u2019ll still have insurance at any given moment.\u00a0 I\u2019m enrolled at a community clinic in Chelsea, with a generous income-based sliding fee scale, where I pay $30-$60 to see my doctor. I don\u2019t have a gym membership.\u00a0 My job entails a lot of physical activity, and I walk for both pleasure and exercise. I get my hair cut once or twice per year at most.\u00a0 I do my own laundry.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had the same pair of winter boots since I was 15 years old.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably way past time for me to see a dentist. So that\u2019s it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m whiny or entitled; I\u2019m a fairly low-maintenance person who doesn\u2019t need a lot of entertainment outside of my work, which I know I\u2019m fortunate to have.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m living a luxurious or coddled existence here.\u00a0 I take care of myself, but I do without a lot of things that many people consider necessities, and that a lot of older people take for granted.\u00a0 This is just my reality, and I\u2019ve worked hard for it, and so it peeves me to no end to be told that young adults just don\u2019t have the work ethic or discipline or value independence enough to do this.

{"date": "May 26, 2016", "body": "When I saw  this story  popping up on social media all week, I was uncomfortable with it.\u00a0 When I heard the author  speak  on WNYC earlier this week, I got queasy. I think this mother is wrong.\u00a0 Not to not want her daughter to be a bully or to say that parents need to be proactive about stopping bullying at its source, obviously, but the way she decided to go about that is teaching some collateral lessons that I don\u2019t think are good ones at all. It\u2019s not actually wrong to just not enjoy someone\u2019s company and not want to spend time with them.\u00a0 Someone trying *really hard* to be your friend can be incredibly invasive and draining, and it\u2019s not wrong to be irritated by that behavior. If this had been a little boy, I\u2019m wondering whether Blanchard have reacted the same way.\u00a0 Or whether she\u2019d\u2019ve decided she\u2019d rather teach her kid that she has a right not to have contact or relationships with people she doesn\u2019t want relationships with. (Same-sex romantic relationships exist, and stalking and harassment and domestic violence occur between same-sex partners as well as opposite-sex ones.\u00a0 This girl could just as easily have internalized the message that she\u2019s obligated to give time and attention to a female romantic pursuer who won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u00a0 This lesson won\u2019t necessarily not carry over into someone\u2019s romantic relationships just because this situation was a same-sex interaction.) I don\u2019t think the other little girl was probably a budding stalker rather than a lonely, over-eager kid.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t mean she has or had a right to another person\u2019s time and attention.\u00a0 That she does is a dangerous lesson for her to have been taught, too.\u00a0 That if she\u2019s relentless enough, eventually people will break down and change their minds about not wanting a relationship. Sometimes a kid might need to be prodded to look more closely at their rejection of a person, at whether prejudice or misunderstanding is at its core.\u00a0 Sometimes they have utterly correct instincts of discomfort with someone that they can\u2019t verbalize or explain. Apparently things turned out okay with Bethany.\u00a0 But a lot of other kids grow up and realize that their \u201cfriends\u201d were directed to be their friends by parents or teachers, and that has really not great consequences for self-worth or good relationship skills.\u00a0 Volumes of writing at this point have also been done on the harm of knowing that you\u2019re somebody\u2019s assigned friend, and how you learn that people are only ever just tolerating your presence, that no one genuinely likes you and that being your friend is an act of charity that you should be grateful for. \u201cI dug in deeper. I refused to drive her to school the next morning, until she agreed. It seemed that, at least until now, I had the car keys and the power.\u201d This isn\u2019t anti-bullying, this is an adult demonstrating her absolute power over a child\u2019s choices, and it\u2019s not impressive or endearing, or harmless.\u00a0 At its heart, it\u2019s just \u201cmight makes right.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had a few people say, I don\u2019t tell my children \u2013 force my children to be friends with people, but these very same people force their children to brush their teeth, force their children to eat green vegetables.\u201d That you teach kids to take care of their own bodies is a world away from teaching them that they owe their attention to whoever wants it badly enough. I was a bullying target, but I also had a couple of relationships in which I didn\u2019t really have choices about whether or how to be in them.\u00a0 Each of those things did its own kind of lasting damage.\u00a0 In some ways the effects of being pressured into friendships that other people wanted me to have, have been far more insidious. It\u2019s one thing to encourage a kid to see past her preconceptions about a dorky classmate (which I say as the dorky classmate) and to give her a chance, or say she can\u2019t be snide to her or be mean about her behind her back.\u00a0 Maybe she could spend a limited amount of time with her.\u00a0 Maybe a teacher could get involved in matching the other girl up with another lonely kid.\u00a0 Maybe there could be a lunch or recess reading or game group so that no one winds up sitting alone if they don\u2019t want to be.\u00a0 Maybe a kid needs to learn how to say \u201cno\u201d without being a bully, but maybe the other girl also needs to learn to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. It\u2019s sad when someone doesn\u2019t want to be your friend, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can just make them be.\u00a0 Or hound them until their parents get mad and make them be.\u00a0 There\u2019s no level of popularity at which you owe someone friendship. There\u2019s such a thing as saying no to a relationship gracefully.\u00a0 There\u2019s a difference between not being a bully and not being allowed to say no.\u00a0 Ostracism can be subtle, but I can\u2019t believe that makes the answer \u201cYou don\u2019t get a say in who you have friendships with or spend time on.\u201d\u00a0 And if I have a daughter who comes home one day and says she doesn\u2019t want to be friends with another girl, that will not be my worst nightmare.\u00a0 It won\u2019t even be close. It was hard to not have many friends, and to like people who didn\u2019t like me back.\u00a0 Their total disinterest was a hard lesson to learn, but the very last thing I would\u2019ve wanted in response is for a relationship with me to be seen as an investment or an ATM transaction or a point to be made.\u00a0 For someone to see indulging my presence as a character-building exercise for their own kid as being my real utility as a human.\u00a0 For someone else to have been told they didn\u2019t get to say no to a relationship with me. That\u2019s not what it is to truly be seen as a person.

{"date": "April 27, 2016", "body": "As I\u2019m finishing this post, it\u2019s nearing the end of Autism Acceptance Month, and almost Blogging Against Disablism Day (which is officially May 1), and the more I thought about getting around to writing it, the more I thought that it kind of stands at the intersection of those two things\u2026 acceptance of autism and disability, and opposition to prejudice based on disability. We talk a lot during Autism Acceptance Month about the rights of autistic and disabled people to education, to employment opportunities, to accommodation and acceptance in public spaces. We talk a lot about our capabilities, and about what we understand about our experiences. But I think that there needs to be an understood right of people\u2014particularly young people\u2014to not understand. And to not have that impact their right to access and to information. Here are some examples of how what I\u2019m talking about plays out: My  most-shared post  is one in which I ask parents to tell their autistic kids that they are autistic. And every time it goes around, a certain number of people respond, pretty predictably, \u201cBut what if he doesn\u2019t understand?\u201d Or \u201cHe\u2019s too young to understand.\u201d Or \u201cShe\u2019s too much in her own little world to understand.\u201d Or \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like she even notices she\u2019s different. She wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d Or when we weigh in on issues of language preferences or sexual orientation or gender identity among autistic people, people say \u201cMy child can\u2019t dress himself; he would never even understand this debate.\u201d\u00a0 Or \u201cWell, you\u2019re fortunate to be able to understand your experience this way, but my child wouldn\u2019t.\u201d (Side note: There\u2019s a lot I still don\u2019t understand about gender identity. That doesn\u2019t make discussion of it unimportant or useless to me. That would still be true if I couldn\u2019t speak or type or dress myself\u2026which I couldn\u2019t when I was the age those kids are now.) Or we talk about the  importance of learning-disabled kids having access to the same curriculum  that their non-disabled classmates do, not only material judged to be on their own instructional level. \u201cBut what if they don\u2019t understand\u201d the same books as their classmates are reading? \u00a0 Well, so what if they don\u2019t understand? How do you know if you don\u2019t let them even try? Is it the end of the world if you give someone a chance to engage with the same material as their age-mates and they don\u2019t understand? They might not, but what if they did? What if they would, but you wouldn\u2019t even give them a shot? \u00a0 We have to be allowed to not necessarily understand perfectly, not understand everything, not understand right away, or to try and not understand at all, without being declared forever incapable of understanding, if we\u2019re going to get a fair chance to understand. Those have to be acceptable possibilities. We also might understand differently. We might understand something from an angle that  you  hadn\u2019t considered. We might understand something later. It is actually pretty common that we understand something suddenly,  but after it\u2019s distilled for a long, long time . That we have access to the information is important, the whole time, not only in the moment when we come to understand it. (Somebody tell me who here  really  understood, like,  Huckleberry Finn , or  A Wrinkle in Time , or  To Kill a Mockingbird,  the first time you read it? To say nothing of something like  Hamlet ?  Here\u2019s a great essay  about how practically everyone has spent many decades misunderstanding a well-known poem.\u00a0 Yet we don\u2019t preemptively decide of non-disabled students that they will not understand this poem, so they should not read it, even though chances are that they will not understand it.\u00a0 White people are famously having a hard time understanding Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cFormation.\u201d In my elementary school, we were taught to sing \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d in kindergarten, \u201cErie Canal\u201d in second or third grade. I  guarantee  you that we did not understand what those songs are really about when we were five or seven or eight years old. I saw Peter, Paul, and Mary perform when I was about that age, too, and I did not understand \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind\u201d or \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d Does that mean we should have been denied any knowledge of those works?) And none of this means that it doesn\u2019t matter if information is presented to someone in a form that they  can  understand whenever possible, whether that means in simplified language, with pictures, subtitles, or in whatever way increases its accessibility. It means that preemptive assumptions about what someone will or won\u2019t understand aren\u2019t a reason to not even present them with the information (or discussion, or work of art, or material that the rest of their class is learning). How are we supposed to wrestle with information we\u2019re not allowed access to? How are we supposed to ever understand if the fact that we don\u2019t understand is reason enough to keep us from the tools of understanding? Like, do you see the trap? It starts to look like you don\u2019t, in fact,  want  us to understand. Non-disabled people are presumed to be capable of learning from experience and becoming better informed over time. Part of that process is  necessarily  not understanding something at some point. If the benchmark we have to meet to be given vital information about ourselves and our own lives is that there is no point at which we don\u2019t or can\u2019t understand it, that\u2019s a game we can never win, because that\u2019s not possible. If whatever assumption somebody wants to make about whether we will or won\u2019t understand is enough to deny us the information that would allow us to exercise more informed control over our own lives\u2026how are we ever supposed to gain the rights to information, or to greater autonomy? Just don\u2019t be disabled? \u00a0 And one major irony is that we write and write and write and write about the importance of knowing, of having language for our experiences, about what it means to be autistic, to be disabled, about the positives and the negatives, about the harm of compliance training, about the  harm of indistinguishability  as a therapy goal, about what acceptance does and doesn\u2019t mean\u2014and the majority of non-disabled parents and professionals persist in not understanding. Often sincerely. But often willfully. A lot of people just struggle with what we\u2019re saying, but a lot of people keep intentionally twisting and misrepresenting what we say and hearing only what they\u2019re determined to hear. And no one says that for the crime of not understanding, you forfeit your right to new information, or to information presented differently, or to any access to information, about yourself or the world, or your right to keep trying to understand, or to take time to process unfamiliar concepts. Why is that? My high school math teacher would say to us periodically, \u201cKids are always asking me, \u2018when am I ever gonna use this?\u2019 And the answer is\u2026probably never. But if you don\u2019t know it, then you definitely won\u2019t.\u201d If someone is given access to a discussion or a set of information, it\u2019s true, they might not understand it. They also might not be able to express what they do or don\u2019t understand. If they\u2019re not given access at all, they definitely won\u2019t.

{"date": "November 27, 2015", "body": "I lost a Facebook friend a few weeks ago. We didn\u2019t know each other offline.\u00a0 I wonder if things would\u2019ve gone differently if we had.\u00a0 A meme featuring what sounded like a Richard Dawkins-derived quote was shared. I protested. The conversation didn\u2019t recover. So here\u2019s the thing. I understand that a lot of people say strident and absolutist things about religion out of anger at their own experiences. I can completely and fully accept someone else\u2019s right to be hurt and resentful of their own bad religious experience. I am fully aware that such experiences are all too common and entirely real. No shortage of people have no shortage of solid reasons to be resentful of the religion they grew up with. And I still just can\u2019t deal with it when they go around declaring that \u201creligion\u201d is only ever this oppressive, anti-thought, patriarchal monolith. Because almost intrinsically, what that\u2019s saying is, \u201cYour faith tradition, your community, your religious background, don\u2019t exist. Because religion that isn\u2019t like  this  doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d It\u2019s no more true than the fact that the taiga exists makes deciduous forests not exist. Those are both ecosystems. They\u2019re both forests. They share some important features of forest ecosystems. But they are also different ecosystems in vital ways. Temperate rainforests and tropical rainforests also both exist. Subtropical deserts and alpine deserts both exist. I think I have not seen any other topic, especially among otherwise very well-educated, liberal people, about which it is still so accepted to say \u201cMy experience is the only genuine one. This was my experience, so that\u2019s the way it  really  is.\u201d And not just accepted, but considered clever and enlightened. We don\u2019t accept that with regard to sexuality or ethnic or cultural background, or gender, or even linguistic background (with AAVE and Appalachian dialects increasingly recognized as fully valid ways to speak English\u2014there isn\u2019t just one static, proper incarnation of \u201creal\u201d English). We increasingly don\u2019t accept it with regard to neurology or disability. (What I\u2019m absolutely not saying is that anti-religious bigotry is the \u201clast acceptable prejudice.\u201d It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s simply a popular one in some factions of society. It\u2019s not the last acceptable prejudice, but it is one of the broadest common examples of a No True Scotsman fallacy.) But it is hugely acceptable and even considered laudable in many intellectual circles to declare \u201cThis is what religion is and this is what religion does and this is categorically true because it was my experience.\u201d Things get painfully ironic when anti-religion absolutists claiming that faith fundamentally precludes the exercise of rational skills, refuse to apply those same skills themselves when, and only when, the topic is the mere existence of varieties of religious faith other than those with which they are familiar. Then very observable facts don\u2019t matter. World history doesn\u2019t matter. Cultural diversity isn\u2019t a thing. Religion only ever behaves in one way. Listen. I have spent the vast majority of my life fighting my own erasure in multiple ways. There are so damned many ways in which people have tried to write me out of my own experience. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t be both this and this.\u201d Real people don\u2019t work like that.  I  don\u2019t understand, so  you  are mistaken about your own experience. You are what we say you are and your experiences are what we say they are. It didn\u2019t work when I was ten, and it doesn\u2019t now. I don\u2019t believe for a single solitary second that religious belief should be held above criticism or interrogation, or that the implications of statements of faith shouldn\u2019t have to stand up to some kind of critical or ethical examination. There are all kinds of debates about religious thought that I\u2019m happy to have, and that we should as a society be having. Pretty much the  one  fight that I just can\u2019t with right now is that religious faith like that which I\u2019ve experienced my entire life doesn\u2019t actually exist. Or isn\u2019t actually religion because it\u2019s not what someone who doesn\u2019t share that experience has decided it must be. (And anyway, if religion is only, ever, inevitably repressive, misogynistic, homophobic, anti-intellectual, authoritarian, etc\u2026. then how do we expect to be able to ask religious communities to be better? If the only true alternative is that they cease to exist? We actually  lose  a lot of ability to make useful criticisms if religion can only be considered as this insidious, monolithic, one-dimensional thing, not taking into account actual diversity of belief and practice.) And I\u2019m just at a point right now where I can\u2019t cope with it or engage with it. And I don\u2019t think that fully owning the fact that so many people have been hurt by religion means that I have to shut up and take it in the face of blatant denial of the very existence or possibility of experiences that are not that, or of communities like the one I grew up in and like the one I\u2019m blessed enough to have now, and of even more faith experiences outside even my own ability to imagine or conceive of. There\u2019s a difference between listening, and consenting to erasure. But having these arguments turns out to be constructive an infinitesimally small percentage of the time. Relationships in which I have to continually defend the existence and acceptability of something pretty integral to who I am and my experience of the world are not relationships I have the energy for right now. And frankly I become skeptical of your feminism or your anti-racism or your neurodiversity acceptance if you then go and say \u201cReligion should be eradicated.\u201d That\u2019s a serious qualifier on your support for the self-determination of people whose religious or faith experience is intrinsically tied up with their lived experience of gender, family, racial identity, culture, or neurodivergence. I think people can be not bad people, and be validly hurt in ways that don\u2019t play well together, and with sadness, I conclude that that may be the case if someone else\u2019s pain means that they have to make these absolutist pronouncements that fundamentally misrepresent or erase another group of people and their belief systems.

Mystified, I mentally tried to retrace events:\u00a0 the last time I knew I used it, the last time I knew I saw it\u2026cleaning day.\u00a0 I\u2019d taken everything off my dresser to dust the top of it, then put it all back and then made my bed.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t distinctly remember putting the incense burner back along with everything else. I checked all the dresser drawers, in case I\u2019d just knocked it into one while putting something else away.\u00a0 I thought I might\u2019ve left it on the bed and subsequently flung it somewhere when I changed the sheets.\u00a0 I checked underneath and behind all relevant pieces of furniture.\u00a0 I emptied my purse and backpack and computer bag.\u00a0 Nowhere. Both roommates denied borrowing it and forgetting to return it.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t have minded; I just wanted to know where it was. I only half-jokingly accused my friend of swiping it just to see how long it would take me to notice it was gone. We don\u2019t have cats. I didn\u2019t care about the cost; it was only about an $8 incense burner.\u00a0 Its value is sentimental; I got it on a summer break trip to San Francisco with my best friend in college (leading one roommate to suggest that if its value wasn\u2019t its cost, I should just buy another one\u2026which would guarantee the spontaneous return of the original, in the manner of TV remote controls lost in the sofa cushions). I was just thinking about it again this morning, being mad about it, planning another deep excavation of all the dresser drawers\u2013again, its only real value is the memory of when I got it\u2013and consoling myself as I often do at the loss of various things with Rena Grushenka\u2019s line from  White Oleander , \u201cYou want remember.\u00a0 So just remember.\u201d \u2026When Emily #2 texted me at rehearsal to say she\u2019d found my incense burner, but did I know where her incense was? The box of incense was probably on my dresser in the aftermath of a bookshelf rearrangement, but where did she find the burner??? Inside our little kitchen sideboard where we keep the cookbooks, and oddly, lain straight across the top of one cookbook (of traditional Greek cooking).\u00a0 There\u2019s no way it got put there by accident. I had looked in that thing.\u00a0 Multiple times.\u00a0 I had taken out cookbooks since then.\u00a0 I could swear it was not in there. \u2026Until it was.

{"date": "March 15, 2016", "body": "I started reading this article ( How to Raise a Creative Child. Step One: Back Off ) wanting so badly to like what I think it\u2019s trying to say, but just wound up so annoyed at many of the assumptions and implications the author makes in order to say it. It\u2019s true\u2014you can\u2019t program a child to become creative. You can\u2019t engineer that kind of success. Love is a better teacher than a sense of duty. But Grant is kind of just imposing this duty on a certain set of kids in a different way\u2014implying strongly that the right outcome for those kids is to become a revolutionary or visionary leader in their fields. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair, either. Grant also seems unfamiliar with some of the realities of being a gifted child. Whether someone suffers from social or emotional problems, or is kept from learning to be original by adult expectation or fear of failure, aren\u2019t the only factors in whether or not they\u2019ll grow up to change the world. There\u2019s more to the equation than that, and not all of it is even wrong. I\u2019m going to go point by point: This is not the trajectory that probably most genius follows, though. Particularly for twice-exceptional kids, probably including Einstein, who Grant keeps quoting approvingly. This describes a tiny number of child prodigies, and doesn\u2019t include most people who grow up to be accomplished, creative adults\u2026many of whom spoke or read late, have no particular musical or mathematical talent, or were simply unspectacular at school until they found their own groove later on. Underscoring Grant\u2019s ignorance here, he talks about giftedness, creativity, genius, and prodigy status almost interchangeably throughout the piece. But they\u2019re not the same thing. Giftedness is widely accepted to entail a high capacity for creative problem-solving, but most gifted children are not prodigies. Prodigies are not necessarily geniuses, nor particularly creative, nor geniuses prodigies. Many impressively creative children are never identified as gifted, indeed are often perceived as academically lacking. All of those things can manifest very differently in different children under different circumstances (and historically, many of the ways in which they\u2019ve been identified have been problematic, to say the least, on multiple levels). And none of them equate to limitless capability. Any ability =/= every ability. This is a common misconception about academically gifted children in particular. The fact of our advanced abilities in one regard is misapplied to argue that we should be able to do  anything  else we really want to do (or someone else wants us to do). \u00a0This is especially obnoxious for twice-exceptional kids, who have to expend a lot of cognitive resources on navigating the world in ways that most people don\u2019t. In some ways, those struggles can spur creative development. In some ways, though, they\u2019re just draining. Everything\u2019s  not  just easy for a very talented child. They often don\u2019t, though. Classmates often demean and ostracize precocious or conspicuously different kids. Their parents often misunderstand and undervalue their talents, struggle to relate to them, and fear not being able to meet their needs. Siblings and teachers resent them. Schools tacitly allow bullying and obstruct opportunities for acceleration. Kids with IEP\u2019s are told they\u2019re not eligible for honors or AP classes. In a recent case in Canada , two brothers were both admitted to a prestigious arts high school. The boys\u2019 home district didn\u2019t blink at transferring the required funding for the younger brother, but refused to do so for the older brother, because his educational funding stream was disability-related. How many brilliant kids does this happen to whose families simply don\u2019t have the resources or social networks to fight back like the Wrays could? Particularly gifted or creative kids just aren\u2019t automatically given the supports they should have; they\u2019re often being actively thwarted. This is insulting. How are we defining a \u201cwhimper\u201d for these purposes?\u00a0 Why is the most concerning thing about a gifted child\u2019s life the way their career ends, anyway?\u00a0 Why do you get to declare the outcome of an artist\u2019s career a \u201cwhimper\u201d because they didn\u2019t go as far as you wanted them to? Quite frankly, so what? What percentage of  anybody  makes the National Academy of Sciences? There is  one  Nobel Prize awarded per year in a tiny handful of fields. That leaves the vast majority of gifted researchers and creators doing necessary, valuable work who will never win a Nobel Prize. That\u2019s not a meaningful benchmark of whether or not they fulfilled their potential as human beings or as scientists or artists. \u201cFor every Lisa Randall who revolutionizes theoretical physics, there are many dozens who fall far short of their potential.\u201d Why is \u201crevolutionizing theoretical physics\u201d and \u201cfalling far short of [your] potential\u201d a meaningful juxtaposition? Those two extremes don\u2019t accurately represent the possibilities available. Maybe the Westinghouse Search just isn\u2019t a very good predictor of future paradigm-shifting achievement. How does he know that Talent Search finalists who don\u2019t go on to revolutionize a field aren\u2019t in fact fulfilling their potential, but just in ways that are harder to quantify? That don\u2019t win the shiny awards? Maybe their potential just wasn\u2019t what you thought it was. And anyway, why is anyone particularly obligated to always pursue to the highest possible level the subject they were good at in high school? Does a gifted teenage scientist not have a right to give up something that they find is no longer in line with their own goals or desires? I spend a lot of time trying to explain this in  other contexts \u2026 Different skills are  different  skills. Technical virtuosity is a worthy talent\u2014it just isn\u2019t the same thing as compositional originality. Maybe a technically masterful musician isn\u2019t an innovative composer because they don\u2019t work at it\u2014or because they don\u2019t work that  way . Accepting that isn\u2019t a sin. We need original composers, and we need highly skilled musicians to execute and interpret their work. One of those things is not morally superior. That it\u2019s relatively rare for someone to be both is possibly not actually wrong. We have a common language of music because most musicians  aren\u2019t  going around reinventing the rules of music. That\u2019s okay. (And meanwhile, a lot of young musicians  not  identified as especially gifted as toddlers  are  composing their own original works.) But you don\u2019t usually produce new insights by focusing your energies on producing new insights, but rather on solving the really unglamorous, day to day, moment to moment problems, and seeing something differently. I have to tell you here about my favorite piece of paperwork. It\u2019s a character/scene breakdown. It was the result of a spreadsheet tweak by an unpaid intern PA. It was the third in a series of attempts to satisfy a director who didn\u2019t like either of my prior versions. And he didn\u2019t like that one, either. But it was simple and brilliant. I would never have come up with it; I have a tendency towards over-thinking. It eliminated an entire layer of translation from the problem. And it has persistently improved the quality of my work in every way, for every show, ever since. It saves time, it saves anxiety, and it saves scheduling mistakes, which saves money; it became almost every piece of organizational paperwork I use while stage managing a whole other multi-media project. It\u2019s just a rearranged Excel spreadsheet. That\u2019s how unspectacular creative innovation can look. We weren\u2019t sitting there focused on producing new insights; we were trying not to get snapped at by an unhappy director  again . And we  failed . But small breakthroughs like this accrue, hourly, daily, in every creative field, into major shifts in thinking over time. \u2026And what of the people who  do  become revolutionary adult creators who weren\u2019t identified as particularly gifted in childhood? What of the disabled and outsider artists, some of whom are supported and represented by places like the  Creative Growth Art Center , but some of whose work is never identified until after their deaths or ever at all, who spend the majority of their lives assumed to be categorically incapable by everyone around them? Where\u2019s the lament for that injustice, when we talk about lost creative promise? A more interesting question might be, what fraction of revolutionary adult creators was overlooked or written off as untalented in childhood? Or told that they shouldn\u2019t pursue what they did? How many Nobel Prize winners  weren\u2019t  extremely impressive young children, and what does that tell you? Again, it looks to me more like the frameworks we have for identifying conspicuous childhood ability just aren\u2019t very good at predicting adult achievement. But why should \u201cmaking waves\u201d be a goal unto itself? I have seen some of the worst efforts at advocacy or activism born from a desire to \u201cmake waves\u201d without having a deep understanding of the topics involved. A lot of acquiring that deep understanding, in order to effect sustainable, lasting change in a field, can look like years and years of absorbing existing knowledge and doing unglamorous work without making waves just for the sake of making waves. Novices absolutely  can  make important contributions and insights. They also  can  crash and burn, or do more harm than good, when they don\u2019t know what in the fuck they\u2019re doing or the history of what they\u2019re trying to do. Context matters. Revolution isn\u2019t always the greatest possible good. And like, we need gifted surgeons. We need brilliant defense attorneys! To become one can take everything that even the most gifted student has to give. Someone who gives their very best to healing their patients or defending their clients isn\u2019t under-performing because they don\u2019t necessarily decide to make overhauling the system their own highest priority. The problems entrenched in the health care and criminal justice systems have thwarted many of the greatest minds that have taken them on for many years. And again, there are professionals who actually do this kind of advocacy for systemic change. Just because most people don\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean that the people who should be doing it aren\u2019t. But skill at neurosurgery and skill at lobbying or activism are not the same thing. Different skills are different skills. The fact that the health care and criminal justice systems still harbor massive waste and injustice is more evidence of those issues being very big and very entrenched than of isolated child geniuses not reaching their full creative potential. I also imagine a lot of highly accomplished doctors and lawyers might take issue with the framing that really they could be doing so much more to reform the system if only their youthful sense of originality hadn\u2019t been quashed. That\u2019s a judgment of somebody else\u2019s life that I\u2019d be very wary of making without an intimate familiarity with what they do and why. Maybe they\u2019re dodging their true potential. Maybe they\u2019re making canny decisions about work/life balance. Maybe they\u2019re actually doing the best they can. There is room for both broad and narrow approaches to art, science, and social problems. Neither is more genuinely creative. The nature of the problem matters a lot. Love  is  a better teacher than a sense of duty. So what is all this presumed duty of gifted kids to grow up to be as creative as you think we should be? To solve the problems you want us to solve for you? (If  you  know so much about what needs to be done, why don\u2019t  you  go do it and stop foisting your existential disappointment on us?) Maybe a precocious child\u2019s actual true potential is not the same as your prejudice about their true potential, but that doesn\u2019t make it actually inferior. Parents shouldn\u2019t drive their highly talented children like achievement robots not because it short-circuits the kind of creative development we really want from them, but because it\u2019s objectifying and cruel. I just don\u2019t think the goal should be making sure more Westinghouse Talent Search finalists go on to win Nobel Prizes, as opposed to making sure that all children are more able to live their fullest, freest lives. I am so much more troubled by the thought of how many kids\u2014whether formally identified as gifted or not, whether conspicuous musical or linguistic prodigies or not\u2014have their promise and talents thwarted by poverty, by broken educational and criminal justice systems, by ableism and endemic racism, than I am by statistics about a relatively tiny number of prodigies who don\u2019t do what some professor of management thinks they should be doing with their adult lives. And those problems are all of our responsibility to contribute to solving, not to put on the shoulders of singular children to fix for us. We\u2019re not entitled to the accomplishment of any child, and we squander the talents of too many others.

{"date": "October 13, 2015", "body": "Months and months ago now, I saw an early preview performance of  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime  on Broadway. There were things I liked a lot about the show (most of the design, most of the acting), and things I didn\u2019t like (the conclusion\u00a0of a plot line involving abuse by a parent). \u00a0I found the show not un-problematic, but powerful and well-executed in many ways. \u00a0I was looking forward to discussing things like how well-rendered Christopher\u2019s internal life and thought and emotional processes were, or whether the sensory intensity of the design was effective in conveying the experience of an autistic person to a largely non-autistic audience. But I didn\u2019t get to have a lot of those conversations, because most of the autistic community was occupied primarily not with critiquing the show or its protagonist\u2019s portrayal, but with protesting\u00a0the casting of the actor who portrayed Christopher, Alex Sharp, specifically with the criticism that an openly autistic actor should have been cast to play the role, and that going forward, theatrical productions should commit to having openly autistic actors play autistic characters. I profoundly disagree with this stance for several reasons. 1. It has every potentiality to hurt and not help the situation. Almost every argument I have seen for imposing an expectation that autistic characters be played only by autistic performers is equally applicable to argue that only non-autistic or non-disabled actors can play non-autistic or non-disabled characters. Arguments that having life experience as a disabled person is the only way that an actor could realistically portray disability, or that physical, first-hand experience of autism is necessary to accurately \u201cembody\u201d an autistic character on stage, are perfectly reversible to argue that since people disabled from birth have no life experience of being non-disabled, their ability to represent non-disabled characters is necessarily inferior. Or that since autistic people have no first-hand, innate experience of being non-autistic, then how could they have the capacity to portray non-autistic characters? If non-autistic actors can\u2019t realistically portray autistic characters because of their lack of life experience, then how can autistic actors realistically portray non-autistic characters, when they don\u2019t have that life experience? This framing of the issue stands every likelihood of enshrining a bias that autistic actors are only capable of playing autistic roles. 2. It\u2019s not the source of the problem. The writing is, usually. Of all the stage and screen portrayals of autistic characters I\u2019ve ever seen, ranging from very bad to so good they took my breath away, and all played by actors who are non-autistic as far as I know, I have practically never thought that the problem was the actor. It\u2019s almost always the writing\u2014the attitude of the writer and of the other characters towards an autistic character. Are they positioned in the narrative as an object or a plot device or as a fully-fledged character central to their own story? The writers of the  Big Bang Theory , for instance, very clearly see Sheldon as an entirely appropriate target for the derision and mockery of the other characters. The screenwriter of  Napoleon Dynamite  positions Napoleon as an acceptable object of the patronizing amusement of the audience, not of true empathy or identification. If a playwright is writing an autistic character with the attitude that they don\u2019t need to be as fully developed and central to their own narrative arc as any other character, or based on largely inaccurate common knowledge about autism, then that is the core of the problem and is only going to be able to be partially mitigated by hiring an autistic actor to fight with the writing. If a playwright and the rest of the creative team of a problematic work is convinced of the rightness of their portrayal because of what they think they know about autism, then putting an autistic actor into that role for the purpose of battling those misperceptions\u2026frankly, that just sounds like an unbearable working environment. And if actors are relying on media stereotypes or previous stage convention in order to animate their autistic characters, then what you are seeing is bad and lazy acting, not merely a result of the wrong kind of person playing a role. \u00a0But most actors in my experience care about and want to empathize with their characters. What\u2019s the supposition about how this would work, anyway? That if productions buy into an expectation that autistic actors play autistic roles, and they can\u2019t find an autistic actor to fill an objectionable role, then the play won\u2019t get done? That won\u2019t happen. Productions get done when their producers care about them getting done and think they will sell tickets. If producers are unable to find an autistic actor willing to play a problematic role, they will find a non-autistic actor who will. There is no shortage there that\u2019s going to keep a production from getting done. 3. It\u2019s ethically dubious at best. I have yet to figure out, or have anyone explain, how it\u2019s possible to require that autistic characters be played by autistic actors without requiring that an actor disclose their disability in order to be considered for employment. And nothing about that sits well with me. I\u2019m unclear how it would be legal under the ADA, either. It\u2019s also requiring that an actor out themselves into a professional world in which most people, including most people in positions of hiring power, still hold conventional beliefs about autistic people including that we\u2019re incapable of things like reciprocity, emotional expression, empathy, and seeing things from points of view other than our own. In other words, the core requirements of acting. We don\u2019t get to dictate that somebody take that risk with their career, or that a producer demand it. I\u2019ve had people ask why someone who didn\u2019t want to out themselves would even answer a casting call\u2026and it\u2019s that acting roles are  jobs . For Actors\u2019 Equity members, they are how we earn our health insurance eligibility, pensions, and sometimes a living wage. I don\u2019t think we get to hold those things hostage to someone being willing or able to take a public stance about their own disability. That\u2019s not an intrinsic requirement of what acting is. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good or fair idea to establish a double standard under which the expectation of openness to public scrutiny about one\u2019s personal life, identity, and medical or psychiatric diagnoses is higher for disabled actors than non-disabled actors, or actors playing disabled roles vs. non-disabled roles. That doesn\u2019t sound to me like the fairness or equality I think we\u2019re seeking. Absolutely none of this is to say that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that can be done to change the situation or that we have to just accept poor representation. 1. Some Equity agreements and codes already require that producers \u201cactively solicit\u201d minority, female, and disabled performers to participate or audition.\u00a0 More should, and maybe all of them should. 2. The responsibilities of producing companies to ensure the rights and accommodations of disabled performers needs to be strongly stated, posted at auditions, included in the information to be posted on call boards, etc\u2026. including that if you disclose a disability or diagnosis to your employer, your privacy will be protected to the greatest extent possible.\u00a0 Our unions need to strongly assure disabled performers that they will back them up in asserting their rights in the workplace, and how. 3.\u00a0 There is a phenomenon in which non-disabled kids get to have hobbies/interests/activities because those things are considered good and constructive for their own sake, but autistic kids get everything good in their lives turned into therapy of some sort.\u00a0 That\u2019s wrong.\u00a0 Theater education is, in and of itself, skill-building in the best ways.\u00a0 Turning something that someone enjoys into just another avenue for therapy, for someone trying to fix you, is a huge turn-off. We need to keep on combating stereotypes that suggest that autistic people can\u2019t excel in the arts or humanities\u2013that we lack empathy or imagination, for instance, or are mainly good for low-level, ultra-repetitive tech sector jobs. And for the love of all that is good, stop telling kids that work in the arts isn\u2019t realistic.\u00a0 Parents, teachers, counselors, job coaches\u2013stop it.\u00a0  People work in the arts .\u00a0 If a student is interested in pursuing the performing arts, help them connect with real opportunities for training and experience. 4.\u00a0 Autistic people and allies\u2013attend and critique productions involving autistic characters.\u00a0 Companies  should  be taken to task for putting bad portrayals on stage, and should know that any time they are talking about autistic people, we are watching and listening. I want more autistic and disabled actors playing autistic and disabled characters. \u00a0I want more autistic and disabled actors playing traditionally non-autistic and non-disabled characters. \u00a0I want autistic actors to be considered equally capable across the board of playing any character. \u00a0And I want non-autistic actors to gain a deeper and more realistic understanding of autism and disability in their work. \u00a0I don\u2019t think that declaring that that work should be off-limits to non-autistic actors serves the causes of either empathy or artistry.

{"date": "May 6, 2011", "body": "The  New York Times  Economix blog reports this week ( Dimming Optimism for Today\u2019s Youth ) that, for the first time in a long time, a majority of Americans are not optimistic that today\u2019s youth will have a better life than their parents, as they answered the question: In America, each generation has tried to have a better life than their parents, with a better living standard, better homes, a better education, and so on.\u00a0 How likely do you think it is that today\u2019s youth will have a better life than their parents\u2013very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or very unlikely?

{"date": "June 2, 2011", "body": "I got busy and haven\u2019t had much time for writing lately, though I was following with interest the debate that broke out over the course of a couple weeks, across internet news sources, about, of all things, writing.\u00a0 Specifically, on the value of cursive.\u00a0 Whether we should still be teaching it, what its value is, whether it\u2019s effectively a dead language, an art form but with little practical utility in the age of ubiquitous keyboards, a waste of teaching time or whether it\u2019s still a necessary skill. The Case for Cursive (New York Times) The End of Cursive (The Responsibility Project) Cursive is Dead, Long Live Typing With Our Keyboard Pushers! (The Village Voice) Handwriting is a 21st Century Skill (The Atlantic) Dozens of commenters attempted the argument that we shouldn\u2019t waste time on cursive anymore because they never have to use it in their work.\u00a0 But that would be like me saying that because I don\u2019t use calculus on a day to day basis, we should stop teaching it.\u00a0  I  don\u2019t use calculus; that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t people who need to use calculus. And I need to write by hand on a nearly daily basis: Aside from this blog, I still keep a personal journal.\u00a0 At rehearsals, while I mostly type notes immediately into my laptop, I can\u2019t always have it with me, and the ability to write notes quickly and understandably is indispensable.\u00a0 In college, I never took class notes on my laptop, even though I can type faster than writing, not only to avoid carrying a computer around all day but because somehow the physical act of writing makes me visually absorb and retain the information better than typing it does.\u00a0 I still keep a paper planner for the same reason despite the easy and free availability of a number of computerized options.\u00a0 If I haven\u2019t written it, I haven\u2019t actually remembered it quite the same way.\u00a0 I write to my grandparents\u2013both of my grandmothers have gorgeous cursive handwriting\u2013and also to friends.\u00a0 A Facebook message, fantastic as I think Facebook is, can\u2019t beat the time and attention inherent in a real letter for some kinds of personal communication.\u00a0 I love the idea of something being physically carried between two people, an artifact of affection.\u00a0 There\u2019s note-taking in circumstances where it would be rude to whip out a computer, but I can do so discretely and quietly with a notebook. But more importantly that all of that for me, none of which is totally insurmountable without cursive, is this.\u00a0 Most of this debate has been conducted as if the content or quality of writing or communication exists independently of its format or medium, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u00a0 I think that the physical process by which we communicate deeply affects the quality of the communication.\u00a0 Not only do I write much differently than I speak, but there are things that I actually cannot speak, that I can only write.\u00a0 Someone once described the phenomenon very succinctly when she wrote of her own daughter, \u201cIt\u2019s like her hands know a language her mouth doesn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 ( Laura, this happened somewhere on your blog, but I cannot for the life of me find the post or the comment to link to it. )\u00a0 Most people apparently can talk through their problems and uncertainties; I can\u2019t.\u00a0 Speaking is too much work for me to engage in problem-solving at the same time.\u00a0 It requires a level of translation that writing somehow doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 I can\u2019t problem-solve by speaking, but I can problem-solve by writing. And within the realm of writing, I not only write very differently when I\u2019m typing as opposed to writing by hand, but there are things that I cannot articulate by typing, only by handwriting, and vice versa.\u00a0 There are thoughts that I can only will into existence with pen and paper.\u00a0 Almost any creative, emotional or personal writing, I must do by hand.\u00a0 When I write poetry (which I still do very occasionally), I can only do a first draft by hand.\u00a0 I literally can\u2019t type it; the words and the meter won\u2019t come. \u00a0And something about the quality of thinking that requires complex or deep reflection matches the speed of writing in cursive for me.\u00a0 Printing is far too slow to be useful for much of anything to me.\u00a0 Typing is too fast; my fingers can get ahead of my brain to the point that what I type is meaningless.\u00a0 Writing in cursive matches up to the speed of my train of thought. It\u2019s like how in Harry Potter\u2019s universe, wizards require a wand to do magic.\u00a0 Children can express a kind of vague and disorganized magic by will alone, but a real wizard has to use a wand for any purposeful, articulated magic.\u00a0 For some kinds of writing and some kinds of thinking, my hand needs a pen the way a wizard needs a wand. (But for other kinds of writing, typing is much better than writing by hand: anything fairly factual and straightforward, requiring the transcription of a large amount of information or detail, or when I basically already know what I want to say and only need to fine-tune it, such as when I have a longer paper or essay already extensively outlined.) For me, the ability to write in cursive isn\u2019t just a technical one, a compromise in speed between printing and typing, or an artistic one.\u00a0 Cursive is a key to my own mind and my own creativity that\u2019s granted by nothing else.\u00a0 For me, saying that we shouldn\u2019t teach or use cursive anymore is like saying that an entire mode of thought, practically an entire language, and one I think we can ill-afford to lose, should be eliminated.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s something worth resisting, for more than aesthetic or romantic reasons.

It\u2019s a letter from my great-great-great-grandfather Albert Darius, who served as an army nurse and then hospital steward during the Civil War, to his son Edward.\u00a0 After the war, as he was finishing medical school, struggling to set up a practice, and being divorced by his wife, Albert Darius was unable ever to keep all of his children with him, and they were fostered out to various neighbors and friends.\u00a0 (Clarence, mentioned in the second paragraph, was my great-great grandfather.) I would scan it in its entirety and make you all try to read it, but my scanner is broken, so I transcribe it here\u2026. My Dear Son, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have been so very anxiously awaiting a letter from you for some time; at last Mr. Wilson wrote me that you had gone to live in Shelbyville with Mr. O. A.

Pointing it out when an entire system has become radically unfair, or that the people who *did not cause a global economic collapse* are the ones being disproportionately punished for it,\u00a0 is not \u201cjust making excuses\u201d or \u201cnot taking responsibility for your own life\u201d or \u201cwanting to blame somebody else for all your mistakes.\u201d So you can think that the OWS protesters are dirty hippies.\u00a0 You can resent them taking up park space and making too much noise.\u00a0 You can dislike their tactics and criticize their vagueness, disorganization, and lack of concrete goals or actual policy proposals.\u00a0 You can think they\u2019re misguided and wrong. But do not slander them as \u201cjust not wanting to work.\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019re doing the work of calling attention to major injustice and keeping the tradition of protest and dissent alive in this country. As for the people on the  99% Tumblr \u2013not the Occupy campers\u2013it takes all of 20 minutes to write a screed on a piece of paper, take a picture, and put it on the internet, so you really have no basis whatsoever to judge these people\u2019s use of their time or decide that they\u2019re putting insufficient energy into finding or keeping a job or working for their own futures. Telling a story on the internet is not the same as not wanting to work.\u00a0 Telling the truth about how hard things are for most people in America right now is not the same as not wanting to work. Daring to say that \u201cthe circumstances that allowed this to happen to me are not okay\u201d is not the same as not wanting to work. The thinking that says that it is, is a relic of the way we were treated in middle school\u2013that somebody speaking up about unfairness or calling attention to a problem was shamed as guilty of creating a problem where there wasn\u2019t any when no one was speaking up. I guess a lot of people learned that lesson well.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t. A lot of the Occupy and 99% protesters are college graduates or have advanced degrees.\u00a0 You really think they dragged themselves through that many years of school, and the work and expense involved, because they \u201cjust didn\u2019t want to work?\u201d\u00a0 A lot of them went deep into debt for their college educations.\u00a0 You think they did that because they *didn\u2019t* want to get a job?\u00a0 Or because they believed parents, teachers, and employers who told them that they needed a college degree *in order to get a good job* these days?\u00a0 Do you really think that what they\u2019re doing now is  easier  than working a regular job, earning a living and going about their daily lives?\u00a0 Do you really think they\u2019d all still be out there, with winter coming, if there were enough jobs paying livable wages to go around and they could just go get one? When the economy first went into recession and unemployment spiked, many of these same people now protesting and occupying\u2013including myself\u2013yelled for a new WPA and Federal Theater Project, for the government to directly create jobs and put people to work.\u00a0  We wanted desperately to work \u2013to put the economy back together, to put the country back together, to contribute in meaningful and permanent ways to our culture and future. We begged to be allowed to work, to do the work that this country needed done. But our government didn\u2019t go that route\u2026it mostly tried instead to entice private enterprise into bringing jobs back.\u00a0 Private enterprise didn\u2019t come through with that.

{"date": "November 9, 2011", "body": "On Fantasy \u00a0Fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli. Reality is plywood and plastic, done up in mud brown and olive drab. Fantasy tastes of habaneros and honey, cinnamon and cloves, rare red meat and wines as sweet as summer. Reality is beans and tofu, and ashes at the end. Reality is the strip malls of Burbank, the smokestacks of Cleveland, a parking garage in Newark. Fantasy is the towers of Minas Tirith, the ancient stones of Gormenghast, the halls of Camelot. Fantasy flies on the wings of Icarus, reality on Southwest Airlines. Why do our dreams become so much smaller when they finally come true? We read fantasy to find the colors again, I think. To taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang. There is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us, to the child who dreamt that one day he would hunt the forests of the night, and feast beneath the hollow hills, and find a love to last forever somewhere south of Oz and north of Shangri-La. -George R. R. Martin, author I feel much the same way as GRRM about fantasy\u2014that it connects us to a deep internal knowledge and history of our own psyches, and recalls something huge and eternal in us.\u00a0 Epic fantasy, when I was in middle and high school, assured me that there was so much more worth living for than my schools and community were trying to tell me. But I\u2019m not sure about his dim view of reality\u2026as opposed to the disposable and shallow nature of much of what is sold to us as \u201creality,\u201d and told we have to accept as the scope of our adult lives.

Reality is the first pale green shoots of peppermint pushing up through the dirt in March. Reality is the guy who plays Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s \u201cEl Condor Pasa\u201d on Peruvian pan pipes in the Times Square subway station. Reality is the stunning silence of a great blue heron taking flight. Reality is the old Hispanic men in my neighborhood who sit outside in the summertime, playing an eternal sidewalk game of dominos with their boomboxes turned up loud. Reality is sunset over the Hudson River. Reality is moonlight, starlight, candle light, lantern light. Reality is creaky old bookstores, and the thrill of reading a forbidden book hidden between the shelves. Reality is the feel of sand as soft as cake flour under your feet. Reality is the smell of wood smoke on the first cold night of fall. Reality is stained glass, dark coffee, red wine, rosewood incense.\u00a0 The brush of a fat cat around your ankles, the way evening light moves over the Brooklyn Bridge and tops of the sycamore trees, rooftop Fourth of July parties with the sky on fire around you, waking up on a foggy morning in the Catskill mountains, the sound of the concertmaster tuning an orchestra, tiny cemeteries behind old churches, hidden waterfalls, thunder in a snowstorm, the way deer\u2019s eyes shine in the dark in a flashlight beam.

{"date": "September 5, 2011", "body": "I so, so wanted to like this article from the  Times , about what some recent graduates of prestigious universities are doing with their lives during the economic downturn instead of the stable, decently-paying jobs in their career field that just aren\u2019t available.\u00a0 ( Generation Limbo: Waiting It Out )\u00a0 I so, so almost did like it a lot.\u00a0 Obviously, we didn\u2019t get past the headline without another cute moniker for the latest crop of highly-educated youth left aimless and adrift by the recession (how many names have we had?\u00a0 Gen Y, Gen Why?, The Millennials, the Peter Pan generation\u2026I\u2019ve had a couple of ciders and I\u2019m losing track.\u00a0 What are we now?), but it came so close to hitting a mark of sorts concerning how young adults are coping with this economy, without a heavy dose of the condescension and belittlement that so often accompanies  Times  articles about the generation that supposedly just won\u2019t grow up. It\u2019s not the subject matter of this article that I find objectionable, because I\u2019m very interested in what young adults and especially the newest graduates are finding to do right now. It\u2019s the slight tone of amazement and false levity that\u2019s a little annoying.\u00a0 A summary of the article could almost have read \u201cSome graduates without corporate jobs decide to not be miserable, live lives anyway, do something creative.\u201d Lions and tigers and bears, oh my. Some of the subjects profiled are Stephanie Kelly, who has two underwhelming part-time jobs, but sort of enjoys the spare time she has to cook and write; Amy Klein, who took up a friend\u2019s offer to join a punk band when it was clear that a career in publishing wasn\u2019t going to be forthcoming anytime soon; and Sarah Weinstein, who manages a bar while doing media relations for an animal shelter as a volunteer. \u201cNo career? No prospects? No worries!\u201d chirps the author in summation of the outlook of these graduates who are taking their situation in stride, or doing something unconventional instead.\u00a0 But this is simplistic and patronizing.\u00a0 No, there are plenty of worries associated with having no job stability, an irregular income, little affordable housing, no health insurance, and no idea when the economy might really turn around or how long you might be jerry-rigging a life this way.\u00a0 But you can let them terrify you into paralysis and submission and mope around your parents\u2019 house sending out resum\u00e9s that may get looked at sometime around 2015, or you can go out and do something\u2013anything\u2013anyway. \u201cThey are thinking more in terms of creating their own kinds of life that interests them, rather than following a conventional idea of success and job security,\u201d says Klein. This is sort of how it\u2019s always been for people who, for many reasons, can\u2019t find a place in the mainstream or corporate job market.\u00a0 And I feel for the younger grads who are finding themselves not able to have the kinds of lives they were brought up to believe they should.\u00a0 And there are definitely bigger problems of economic justice when a significant portion of a highly educated generation just can\u2019t make money.\u00a0 But that so many are relearning what they can and can\u2019t do without, and what really matters to them, and questioning what kind of life they really want as opposed to what they once just assumed they\u2019d have, I believe has the potential to be a great thing for America in the long run. \u201cThey are a postponed generation,\u201d intones Cliff Zukin, author of a study from Rutgers on the economic situation of recent graduates.\u00a0 But people profiled in the article like Kelly and Klein\u2026well\u2026they\u2019re not.\u00a0 Just because they\u2019re not doing what they might\u2019ve been in a different economic climate doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re waiting around with their lives on hold, as if the only life worth working for is comprised of traditional job stability, marriage, kids and home ownership. Life doesn\u2019t get postponed, though certain goals might; life gets lived, one way or another.\u00a0 Bad economies don\u2019t stop time. Why should writing, cooking, taking a punk band on the road or doing whatever paid job you can stand to do while you work as a volunteer or activist for another cause be considered stalling on the life path?\u00a0 Just because it\u2019s a life path that doesn\u2019t take for granted what the upper middle class used to, in the same time frame?\u00a0 Why is this necessarily considered being stuck in neutral rather than just in uncharted territory? I\u2019d be willing to bet, for instance, that the day will come when Ms. Klein, whatever she ultimately ends up doing, will be glad for the creative and organizational lessons that she learns on the road with her band, as well as feeling artistically fulfilled.\u00a0 Because life is funny and resonant and meaningful like that if you\u2019re paying attention. So godspeed to the young graduates who don\u2019t see a reason to give up and stop living just because their expectations have been knocked around.\u00a0 I prefer their attitude to that of the experts telling us how stalled and postponed they are.

I wrote my sermon on how trusting in God often means being open to unexpected possibilities, including unexpected discoveries about ourselves.\u00a0 I remember sitting outside on the front steps of the church on a warm spring evening for a planning meeting, Brian approving of our sermon outlines and hymn selections, joking about what more humorous though inappropriate choices might have been.\u00a0 It wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\u00a0 There was an order of worship; I knew how it went.\u00a0 I only had to actually speak for five to seven minutes, from prepared text; I\u2019d done scenes longer than that.\u00a0 Jess and Nicky had to do it, too.\u00a0 If I could act, I could  do  this.\u00a0 And it would tell me something about myself. And I did, and it was actually pretty awesome; even though I was fairly sure I wasn\u2019t meant for the ministry, I wasn\u2019t sure at all that I wasn\u2019t destined for some kind of life in performance. A few weeks ago, I was on the phone with my father when he asked whether I\u2019d gotten Brian\u2019s resignation letter in the mail. WHAT?!?!  I said.\u00a0 No, I had not.\u00a0 What was going on, what happened?! But the news was good.\u00a0 Brian was leaving to become the executive director of the  Covenant Network of Presbyterians , a national organization working to encourage better welcoming and inclusion of LGBT people in the church.\u00a0 And he\u2019d been in a committed relationship with his partner, Troy, for the past nine years. Given my own past couple of years, I know what it takes to decide that being open about who you really are, whatever the fallout may be, is just worth it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I ever imagined that one day I\u2019d get to be so proud of someone who I already liked and respected  a lot  and who had been a gentle and encouraging influence in choosing to do something immensely difficult all that time ago.\u00a0 I\u2019m fairly sure I cackled for joy when I got off the phone. ****** 2. This has already made the rounds of Facebook, and now it\u2019s up on BoingBoing: earlier this week, my high school friend Chris returned his Eagle Scout medal in protest of the Boy Scouts of America\u2019s recent decision to continue the organization\u2019s ban of gay, bisexual or transgender scouts and leaders, joining a growing number of men who have done so. I\u2019ve always had a visceral dislike of the Boy Scouts on multiple levels, but the Eagle Scout award is the culmination of years of incredibly hard work, of which men who achieve it are rightfully proud.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t realize until today that only 2.1 million scouts have earned Eagle Scout status\u2026 since 1911 .\u00a0 So it\u2019s, to say the least, not a trivial decision to give up the award, in order to uphold what it\u2019s supposed to teach. \u201cGay scouts and leaders have the right and obligation to be true to themselves. Homosexuality is not a moral deviance, bigotry is,\u201d Chris wrote. Maggie Koerth-Baker\u2019s article and Chris Baker\u2019s and several other men\u2019s entire letters are  here . ****** I think I agree with a friend who said this week that I clearly have good taste in friends. ; ) ", "outgoing_links": ["http://covnetpres.org/", "http://boingboing.net/2012/07/23/eagle-scouts-stand-up-to-the-b.html"], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/not-exactly-news-i-know-brave-and-wonderful-people-24-2/", "title": "Not exactly news: I know brave and wonderful\u00a0people"},

I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s what faith is anymore. Because when I saw this picture, I thought, \u201cthat\u2019s what faith feels like,\u201d and I knew that feeling. \u00a0 It was exactly like this. I am alone, under the open sky, on a footbridge across the ocean.\u00a0 I have no supplies, no shelter, no map, no help, no possible escape to one side or the other, and only the vaguest idea that the home I\u2019ve never seen  could , improbably, exist at the other end of this, if there even is an other end of this. Faith is not irrational certainty; faith is pursuit in the face of utterly rational uncertainty when you have no remaining acceptable choices.\u00a0 When knowing what you now know, having seen what you\u2019ve seen, you can\u2019t do otherwise anymore, even in the face of overwhelmingly probable failure. Faith is closely related to hope, but also to exile, and exhaustion, and desperation. There is nothing behind you. There is no way back. There is nothing there you\u2019d go back for even if you could.\u00a0 And you can\u2019t, really. So you go forward.\u00a0 Because there might be something that you barely even know how to dream of. Faith is not deliberate ignorance or irrationality.\u00a0 Faith is just what you do when you can\u2019t do anything else anymore. Faith is when survival means giving up on everything you thought you knew. And I think to call on faith this way is an ability that most humans possess, regardless of any belief system that we do or don\u2019t claim.

{"date": "October 6, 2012", "body": "Some people have a thing against writing in books; I don\u2019t.\u00a0 I love a book best that is obviously well-loved and well-marked.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of those things that I thought would irk my romantic self about the Kindle, even as my practical self couldn\u2019t really argue against free books that take up no space. In this manner I came to be reading Mark Twain\u2019s  Life on the Mississippi  on my Kindle\u2026somewhat bittersweetly.\u00a0 It\u2019s largely about the heartbreak of the loss of the entire occupation of steamboating\u2013its skill set, way of life, and all of its romanticism\u2013to superior and more cost-effective technology\u2013the railroads\u2013in a stunningly short amount of time. But lo and behold, the Kindle preserves at least some of the functionality, if not the rough beauty, of other readers\u2019 notes and underlinings.\u00a0 This is probably not news to very many people but me, but I\u2019m still figuring this thing out\u2026but you can not only make your own underlinings and clippings of text, but see how many other readers underlined a passage for saving.\u00a0 And reading backstage one night, I found that five other readers, at least of this digital edition of  Life on the Mississippi , had underlined the following: Disappointment for my fellow readers swelled, for the paragraph from which at least FIVE of them had extracted that fragment as the vital piece of information actually reads: Teh irony it hurtz sometimes.\u00a0 I wanted to smack my forehead on something in frustration, the way you would with a normal book, but I was afraid of hurting the Kindle. Twain attempted to convey the sheer insufficiency of factoid to describe the age and majesty of the river when compared to the ridiculously small amount of time for which European settlers had been taking it for granted, and the significance that all of my fellow book underliners took from it\u2026was the barest factoid, without context, that could be extracted from Twain\u2019s vivid warning simile, in his long love song to a thing incomprehensibly old and powerful when compared to human civilization and understanding. I seem to recall Twain having sardonic things to say about human intellectual density.\u00a0 I could nearly hear him sighing from his grave.

{"date": "March 12, 2012", "body": "The last several weeks have brought a series of unfortunate articles, op-eds, and blog posts trivializing or dismissing the validity of or need for the Asperger\u2019s Syndrome diagnosis\u2014usually in some kind of misconstrual of what it means that the designation is being removed from the DSM-V in recognition that it\u2019s redundant with \u201chigh-functioning\u201d autism.\u00a0 These pieces often contain, or inspire in the resulting comments and letters to the editor, a raft of responses to the now widespread recognition of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome\u2014along with other invisible disabilities, learning disabilities, and subtler neurodevelopmental conditions\u2014along these lines: \u201cWhy do we have to pathologize everything?\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just appreciate people for who they are?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to label my child.\u201d \u201cLabels are for soup cans.\u201d \u201cBut everyone has quirks.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t we just use to have a broader conception of normal?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t we all just human?\u201d I want to explain why these make me violently annoyed. And there was a time when I might even have said the same things.\u00a0 When I would have given a lot just to be treated like everyone else. But eventually I realized that is not what people mean when they say that.\u00a0 What they really mean is usually one of two things:\u00a0 First, that \u201cI don\u2019t, can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t have to try to understand how things are truly different for you.\u201d \u00a0They don\u2019t want to, or can\u2019t, recognize that other people\u2019s experiences, needs, or abilities can be very different from their own and yet  equally real . It says they\u2019d rather deal with the superficial and they\u2019d rather you  be  superficial.\u00a0 Preferably in ways that make them comfortable.\u00a0 It\u2019s an alternate take on \u201cbut you don\u2019t look disabled.\u201d Or, second, it means they don\u2019t understand that  it isn\u2019t the label that makes someone different , or makes other people treat them differently; that  it is the underlying condition itself  that makes someone different, that is the reason they function differently, and that makes you know you are different. And I did know it, at a very early age, and even when no one else would admit it.\u00a0 Don\u2019t kid yourself that we don\u2019t know we\u2019re different if no one tells us. It\u2019s the label for a condition that confers the knowledge that what we\u2019re going through is known and recognized and survivable.\u00a0 That we are within the realm of human experience.\u00a0 That there even is such a thing as  we . ***** To be denied a name means having your very existence as a person who has a certain experience undermined, denied, and even disallowed. The fact that we have words for things is an acknowledgement that those things are real, that they  are  part of our world.\u00a0 George Orwell knew this when he wrote  1984 , in whose dystopic language system, Newspeak, words for concepts that Big Brother doesn\u2019t wish people to be able to describe are systematically stricken from the English language, so, for instance, without a word for \u201cfreedom,\u201d no one will be able to conceive of the thing itself. I also find it striking that in so much literature concerning magic, magical ability turns on a wizard\u2019s, elf\u2019s, or magician\u2019s knowledge of true names, or true language.\u00a0 To know the true names of things is to have mastery over your world. It\u2019s not just what you are, but how the world works for you. Try going through your life every day, being able to tell that things simply don\u2019t work for you like they do for everyone else.\u00a0 That you can try to do everything exactly the same way that normal people seem to, and yet somehow it just doesn\u2019t work for you like everyone says it should.\u00a0 From the way shoes fit to the way sales clerks treat you, how food tastes and feels, how your brain organizes information and how medications work (or don\u2019t) to the color saturation of the natural world to the essential nature of reasoning, time, and memory; to the fact that no one ever  quite  understands anything you say.\u00a0 Then tell me you don\u2019t need an explanation.\u00a0 Then tell me that you wouldn\u2019t give anything for one word to tell you why. Or imagine the single most true thing about yourself.\u00a0 Whatever that is for you.\u00a0 The  most true  word that springs to mind when you think \u201cthis is what I am in the world.\u201d Now imagine that everyone in your life denies that it\u2019s real, or even possible, yet finds a way to punish you every day of your life for functioning in accordance with it. I know what it is to be told day after day, in ways large and small,  \u201creal people don\u2019t work that way.\u201d Since I have a label, I know the world I belong to is real, and the people I belong to are real. That there are people I can go to for support and advice, and they  know  what in the hell I\u2019m even talking about. That somebody else\u2019s child doesn\u2019t have to do what I did thinking they\u2019re alone in the world. I doubt I can make you feel what a miracle it is, if you\u2019ve never lived without that.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve never been without the ability to hear another person say \u201cI know,\u201d and know it was true. That\u2019s what it is for me to have a label. ***** And then there\u2019s this rationalization being thrown around that all of these people who shouldn\u2019t really be labeled with an ASD\u2014regardless of whether all of their characteristics  do  add up to autism\u2014can be re-classified and receive services for all of their various subordinate learning disabilities and other issues, which just have other names like \u201cnon-verbal learning disorder,\u201d or \u201csocial communication disorder,\u201d etc. But here\u2019s the problem: \u00a0 I am not simply an amalgamation of all of my various quirks, disabilities, and learning/perceptual/emotional/physical differences.\u00a0 I\u2019ve made that list.\u00a0 There\u2019s not another category that even could better account for what I have.\u00a0 I knew  all  of the various traits that made me hopelessly different, but without being able to know why, and it had me actually formulating hypotheses of how I was really a fairy being and not human at all\u2014some highly unlikely genetic throwback to an unknown species, older and distinct from modern humans\u2014of which I was the only one left.\u00a0 (Kind of like how if you backcross zebras for long enough, you get something that looks a lot like a  quagga .\u00a0 I identified with  Henry the quagga  for a long time\u2014a creature that wasn\u2019t supposed to exist anymore, but somehow, sort of, did.)\u00a0 I  literally, seriously believed that I was the last fairy on earth  because it was the only remotely coherent explanation I could come up with on my own. The word \u201cloneliness\u201d doesn\u2019t really begin to name that way of existing. So, yes, you can just like and appreciate me for who I am. What you cannot do is treat me as a whole person by trying to remedy separately all of the difficult traits that come with  what  I am.\u00a0 Because that is what turns a person into nothing but a collection of flaws. No, you cannot \u201cjust accept someone for who they are\u201d if you have no intention of acknowledging what that actually is.\u00a0 You cannot do that while you deny and belittle what somebody is actually experiencing.\u00a0 You cannot do that if you see acknowledging disabilities as a shameful thing. No, you cannot just accept someone for who they are, if what you mean by that is the exact opposite. ***** \u201cBut imagine the effect on a child of being told your brain works in a way it doesn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want a school psychologist to give a clumsy, lonely teenager a description of his mind that isn\u2019t true.\u201d I don\u2019t want that either, and I don\u2019t have to imagine.\u00a0 I was constantly being given a description of my mind that wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0 It is a terribly alienating and disheartening experience.\u00a0  We should obviously endeavor not to misdiagnose people. \u00a0 I was misdiagnosed with some other things: being able to speak but just not wanting to, depression, dysthymia, and being a control freak perfectionist who just didn\u2019t want to admit I wasn\u2019t unique and whose standards for humanity were too high.\u00a0 I know firsthand the harm of misdiagnosis.\u00a0 I am not denying that misused labels can be damaging and prejudicial. But there is no evidence that ASD\u2019s are systematically over-diagnosed by professionals.\u00a0 What I do see happening is that mainstream pop-culture does not truly understand what ASD\u2019s are, and so misinformed laypeople speculate baselessly about odd personalities like Al Gore, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, etc., based on shallow (and frequently false) stereotypes.\u00a0 When these writers  wrongly conflate this cultural trivialization and misappropriation with rampant over-diagnosis  to argue that Asperger\u2019s Syndrome (or any invisible disability) is a dubious and unnecessary designation,  they contribute to the very trivialization they claim to be opposing . ***** In my last production, a character says with sad resignation near the end of the play, \u201cThere is no word for what I am.\u00a0 I have looked.\u201d And that\u2019s what you perpetuate when you deny or scoff at the use of a word for what someone is, or what they have, or what they identify with.\u00a0 You say \u201cyou don\u2019t need a word for what you are.\u201d \u00a0You say that your wish for denial takes precedence over theirs for self-knowledge, acceptance, practical information, treatment, or however they need to deal with the truth. And If you\u2019ve never needed a label, needed a word, needed a name, and not had one\u2014or as Emily Willingham  wrote last week , \u201cIf you have not lived a life like that, one that has been bereft of an emotional glue that groups you with others who feel as you do\u2014then you are privileged indeed.\u201d If you have not lived my life, you do not get to decide that I don\u2019t need language for the experience of it.\u00a0 You do not get to say \u201cthere is no word for what you are,\u201d that \u201cthere is no word for what you share with other people,\u201d  when there is.

{"date": "December 5, 2012", "body": "Two major considerations of autism and the place of autistic people in society sort of collided in the news media this past week.\u00a0 First, the New York Times\u2019 Sunday Magazine ran a long piece, \u201c The Autism Advantage ,\u201d on a European company, Specialisterne, whose mission is to find supportive employment opportunities for people with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome in the tech world.\u00a0 And second, the House of Representatives held the  first hearings in a decade on rising diagnostic rates of autism spectrum disorders . In both forums, it quickly became apparent, as it often does, that by having any ability to take an active role in our own lives or discussions about us, our right to do so is discounted by many.\u00a0 The comments section of the Times article quickly exploded with criticism that because some autistic people are too severely affected to ever hold jobs, the article was irresponsible or trivializing, that the employment concerns of the so-called \u201chigh-functioning\u201d had no place in discussions about real autism. And the originally slated panel of witnesses to Congress included zero autistic people of any stripe.\u00a0 When Michael John Carley and Ari Ne\u2019eman were added in response to pleas from the advocacy community, complaints resulted that two such \u201chigh-functioning\u201d men couldn\u2019t truly represent autistic people, or did so inadequately because their testimony didn\u2019t focus on the need for a cure for \u201clower-functioning\u201d people. Effectively, that because some autistic people have severely compromised communication abilities, we should not have been represented,  in a Congressional hearing about the federal response to our existence , at all. And I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times in online discussions when I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m nothing like someone else\u2019s child, couldn\u2019t possibly understand what their child goes through or have any idea what it\u2019s like to be their child\u2026before they list off a litany of experiences that sound a whole lot like my own childhood. (Or sometimes not.\u00a0 Sometimes someone else\u2019s experience with the autism spectrum is actually radically different from mine.\u00a0 It\u2019s called a spectrum condition for a reason, and  we know this , better than anyone.) I may never be able to convince these people that my experience has anything in common with their children\u2019s.\u00a0 I know that no single human being can ever truly know the experience of being another, but I also can\u2019t convince myself that I have no place standing up for those kids. Because I remember getting the message so often, in so many ways, that there was no place for me in the world as I was, that I was never going to make it in \u201cthe real world.\u201d\u00a0 That I wasn\u2019t going to be allowed to make it if I wasn\u2019t going to do a better job of pleasing others. I remember not being able to look the way I was supposed to, talk the way I was supposed to, dress the way I was supposed to.\u00a0 I remember not being what anyone wanted. Because my heart broke for your kids when Michael John Carley asked the nation to remember, when we talk about the autistic,  that the vast majority of us can hear and understand what you say about us\u2014and a gallery full of people behind him angrily shook your heads \u201cno.\u201d \u00a0 Because I remember being told again and again that I could not be perceiving what I was perceiving, and being told that I couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be able to do what I knew I could. Because I remember having no one who spoke or understood my language, and losing hope that I ever would.\u00a0 I remember having no one who thought that the world as I experienced it was worth respecting or understanding remotely enough to be any help to me. Because I remember the constant implication that the ways I was being treated were acceptable because the way I am was not acceptable. These things wear you down, day after day.\u00a0 The memory of it all wears on me still.\u00a0 I want better than that for your kids.\u00a0 I think we can all do better than that for your kids.\u00a0 I\u2019ve cited before, and probably will again, the quote from Adrienne Rich: When someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world and you are not in it, there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing. I think that all of your children deserve to see a world with them in it, and belonging in it. And far from our abilities disqualifying us from that role, I believe that our communication abilities and everything that we\u2019ve done and learned for ourselves are all the more reason why we have a responsibility to stand up for kids like yours.\u00a0 If I were to decide that because of the gap in our apparent abilities, that they and I have nothing whatsoever to do with each other\u2026.If I said \u201cYou\u2019re right; because I can speak and write and have a job, and your child might not ever, then his rights, dignity, and well-being have nothing to do with me,\u201d  then  I really would be guilty of the accusation leveled against activists so often\u2013that we care nothing about the well-being of the more severely disabled. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.

{"date": "January 7, 2013", "body": "The  Chronicles of Narnia  have been some of the most formative books in my life, a situation in which I know I\u2019m not alone.\u00a0 I got my set as a Christmas present from my grandparents when I was 11 or 12. There\u2019s a common criticism of them, however, out of many quite reasonable ones, that\u2019s irritated me for a long time. He may not have been the first to think it or to say it, but author Philip Pullman\u2019s articulation of what he finds wrong with the books, encapsulated in the problem of what happened to Susan Pevensie and why, when she does not return to aid Narnia in the final book of the series, may be most responsible for a now widespread interpretation that Susan is cast out of Heaven because she grew up and embraced her sexuality.\u00a0 Indeed, I think I have hardly ever had a conversation about these books since college in which \u201cThe Problem of Susan\u201d didn\u2019t feature prominently in their criticism: It\u2019s tempting and convenient, because it echoes charges so commonly made against Christianity as a whole\u2013that it\u2019s intrinsically set up to punish natural human sexuality, among other things like critical thinking and self-determination. It\u2019s too bad that Pullman\u2019s interpretation is practically unsupported by the text.\u00a0 You\u2019d have to take the passage in question completely out of context of the entire rest of the series for it to be even remotely plausible; indeed, even by quoting it incompletely, he leads his listeners in a nearly complete distortion of the reasoning behind Susan\u2019s exile. Here is the incident, from  The Last Battle , which Pullman cites: Susan is not just doing what she needs to do to grow up.\u00a0 The reason given is  not  that she\u2019s growing up; the text itself refutes this.\u00a0 Lady Polly, the speaker after Lucy\u2019s now-infamous line, denies that growing up is what Susan is doing at all. She is pretending that her previous experiences in Narnia never happened.\u00a0 She denies the people she knew there, who she loved and who loved her, people who died for her and what they meant to her, what she\u2019s been through and everything she\u2019s done up to this point.\u00a0 She calls all of it a childish game. Nor is there any defiance of the will of Aslan here, who has never in this entire story forced any of these people into any task or burden or mortal danger against their own free will.\u00a0 Who has in fact, repeatedly, stood by and let them actively make bad choices.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t hear an order from Aslan and say \u201cno,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d \u201cnot this time,\u201d or \u201cfuck you, I\u2019m not a plaything.\u201d\u00a0 She denies that she ever knew him. Some other points of Narnian history further illuminate the absurdity of Pullman\u2019s claims: 1. That time in  Prince Caspian  when Bacchus showed up for a romp\u2026 And it\u2019s a delightfully saucy good time, for a god who supposedly hates life and is into damning children for sensual exploration. 2.\u00a0 Susan herself, in  The Horse and His Boy , is described as having multiple suitors.\u00a0 She\u2019s being courted for marriage by Prince Rabadash of Calormen\u2026 \u2026but she\u2019s awfully sweet on Corin, Prince of Archenland (though here she\u2019s mistaken a runaway slave named Shasta for the prince)\u2026 There is no condemnation whatsoever stated or implied for her romantic activities. 3. Lasaraleen A minor character who also occurs in  The Horse and His Boy , Lasaraleen is a childhood friend of Aravis, and perhaps unexpectedly, one of my favorite characters in the series.\u00a0 She\u2019s a party girl, socialite, and trophy wife\u2026and perhaps the most totally and unabashedly herself of anyone in this world.\u00a0 She loves luxury, being seen, and having a good time. We\u2019re supposed to see Lasaraleen as doofy and shallow, but she\u2019s also affectionate and loyal.\u00a0 She helps her friend escape from being caught and returned to an arranged marriage at serious risk to herself, and no further particularly harsh criticism is made of her life choices. 4.\u00a0 Other adults have come and returned to Narnia before. -King Frank and Queen Helen Former London cabbie Frank and washerwoman Nellie become Narnia\u2019s first king and queen in  The Magician\u2019s Nephew .\u00a0 They are already adults when brought to Narnia (albeit accidentally in Frank\u2019s case).\u00a0 Aslan treats them with trust and respect and is clearly not expecting chastity, but children and grandchildren from them. -Digory Kirk and Polly Plummer The first human children to stumble into Narnia, they return as adults (probably in their 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s) with the others for the Last Battle.\u00a0 Peter and Edmund, wearing beards at their reappearance, are also young adult men by this point.\u00a0 Presumably they\u2019ve all done what they had to do to grow up, and it didn\u2019t include betraying the memory of everyone they\u2019ve ever loved. Nothing  in the world of this story indicates that any of the other protagonists who have grown up either in Narnia or out of it, did not go through \u201c naturally responding as everyone has ever done since the history of the world to the changes that are taking place in one\u2019s body and one\u2019s feelings.\u201d\u00a0 N othing.\u00a0  Because, as Pullman correctly observes, these feelings and explorations are fairly universal. \n The gravity of Susan\u2019s sin is not in her embrace of superficial frippery, or in any normal adolescent desire on her part for adulthood, sexual experimentation, maturity, or self-determination.\u00a0 It\u2019s her betrayal of her true self.\u00a0 It\u2019s her denial of her own emotional history and experience, and what a lot of other people went through by her side. And even for that, nobody bars the doors of the Stable to Susan as she begs to go through to eternal life.\u00a0 She is not in Narnia, because she, for her own reasons, chose not to get on the train whose demise brought her siblings and former mentors back to Narnia for the Last Battle.\u00a0 Susan may have saved her (earthly) life by not getting on that train, but at the ultimate cost of her own authenticity. Ability to return to your true home requires acceptance of who you really are.\u00a0 That\u2019s not something that Aslan, or the Emperor Over the Sea, or all the forces of Deeper Magic are capable of doing for her.

{"date": "October 19, 2012", "body": "The end of actual summer tends to be slightly preceded every year by me getting literally bored of eating summer fruits and vegetables, falling into a malaise in which I can\u2019t even figure out what to eat, and then developing a craving for large, serious squash. I was inspired to try this for the first time last year, when I was in a similar mood and craving a hot, thick soup, and thought first that I\u2019d try my hand at potato soup or potato chowder.\u00a0 I can\u2019t say where the inspiration came from to make it pumpkin instead, but I thought of Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s lamentation in  Animal, Vegetable, Miracle , that in most recipes involving pumpkin these days, the recipe will call for one 15-ounce can of pumpkin.\u00a0 No one knows how to hack up a large vegetable to  eat  rather than use for decoration anymore. I asked advice of a couple friends, followed some of it, and setting forth without recipe, hacked up a pumpkin. We\u2019ve been enjoying a crisp, lovely fall in NYC, and so I made this for the second time last week, refining my technique slightly from my first experience.\u00a0 (Protip: using the food processor for this is  not worth it .) You will need: A large stock pot \nOne smallish cooking pumpkin \nOne or two large onions, sliced \nOne large white potato, or 3 or 4 small red potatoes, diced \nAbout 4 cups chicken stock (I make a batch from the leftovers every time I roast a chicken, so I always have some in the freezer and don\u2019t have to buy it.) \nHalf a stick or so of butter.\u00a0 Or more.\u00a0 Usually more, in my case. \nA couple tablespoons olive oil \nA couple tablespoons flour \nAbout half a pint of half and half or heavy cream 1. Preheat the oven to 400.\u00a0 With a sharp, sturdy knife, cut the pumpkin in half.\u00a0 Scoop out the seeds, and cut the halves in half again. I always forget how long that part takes. 2.\u00a0 Put the quartered pumpkin sections on a baking sheet and rub with olive oil. And put into the oven.\u00a0 Roast till tender and starting to caramelize, probably around an hour. 3.\u00a0 When the pumpkin is cool enough to handle, scoop the flesh out of the skins and shred well with a fork.\u00a0 It should be soft enough that this is fairly easy.\u00a0 (This is where I discarded advice to use a food processor, which I tried my first time through, and made a mess.) 5.\u00a0 In the stock pot, melt the butter, and saut\u00e9 about half the onions until tender.\u00a0 Move the onions off to one side, add the flour to the butter, and whisk until it\u2019s incorporated.\u00a0 This creates a roux that will help the soup thicken later. 6.\u00a0 Now add the chicken stock and bring to a low boil.\u00a0 Add the diced potatoes and cook till those are tender. And now start adding the pumpkin, in small amounts at a time, cooking till each addition is incorporated.\u00a0 It\u2019ll disintegrate a good bit as it cooks, but I like it to keep some of its rough, shredded texture.\u00a0 I\u2019ve wound up only using about half the cooked pumpkin in the chowder, and saving the other half for use in other delicious baked things. Add the rest of the sliced onions, and cook till tender.\u00a0 Add salt to taste. 7. Turn the heat down so the pumpkin-y broth at this point is just simmering, and slowly add and stir in the cream.\u00a0 Cook on low heat\u2013don\u2019t boil\u2013until the chowder is heated through.\u00a0 More salt and pepper to taste. And I garnished mine with fresh thyme. It\u2019s fabulous with some toasted crusty bread and glass of white wine, and presidential debates or  Doctor Who  on television.

{"date": "January 30, 2013", "body": "A friend sent me a link to this Radiolab episode (\u201cVoices in Your Head\u201d) from a couple years ago in response to a different inquiry altogether (having to do with certain experiences of schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations), but it was startling to me in an unexpected way. http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2010/sep/07/voices-in-your-head/ Jad is talking to developmental psychologist Charles Fernyhough about how he believes children learn to think by internalizing external verbal processes: Early in the episode, Fernyhough asks us to think of a parent and child solving a jigsaw puzzle together, and the back and forth dialogue between them in which, he posits, a child learns to think.\u00a0 The \u201cthinking\u201d here, he says, is happening in the interaction between parent and child, and not internal to one or the other at all.\u00a0 It\u2019s by learning to make this verbal process internal, that we become thinking people, he says.\u00a0 \u201cIf you watch any kid with their parents, anywhere in the world, doing this kind of thing, you\u2019ll see them thinking together,\u201d he tells us. Immediately I thought, \u201cHow insulting to non-speaking or non-verbal people,\u201d or even to people whose primary intelligence is not linguistic, but spatial, movement-oriented, artistic, or musical? But then I was even more stunned.\u00a0 Wait, I thought\u2026Is this possibly why so many people cannot imagine that someone who doesn\u2019t talk doesn\u2019t truly think?\u00a0 Why people are so highly skeptical of the genuine intelligence of someone who can type but not speak?\u00a0 Because most people  do , in fact, learn to think by speaking and can imagine no other way? I never did engage in the kind of mutual narration described, or individual narration about what I was learning to do; being forced to engage in that kind of communication while trying to understand or carry out a task actually badly impedes my ability to do it.\u00a0 I have the damnedest time getting people to understand that I\u2019ll be better off if they show me something once or twice and then  leave me alone  to get comfortable with it, rather than hanging over my shoulder and re-explaining and correcting until I\u2019ve got it perfectly, which will  never happen  under those circumstances.\u00a0 It\u2019s also one of the major reasons why I did so badly in cognitive-behavioral therapy:\u00a0 Because having to speak severely impedes my ability to think.\u00a0 I speak by translating and selectively externalizing my internal understanding; I don\u2019t think by internalizing what\u2019s external. Even my memories of learning to write are hardly verbal at all; they\u2019re very experiential, visual, and physical.\u00a0 I remember the pattern of it becoming intuitive more than the words themselves. Frequently in my line of work, I find myself defending the intelligence of dancers to other people, explaining that you just can\u2019t expect them to be able to communicate much of their intelligence verbally.\u00a0 It\u2019s just not how they work best.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the framework in which they\u2019re approaching the world. But look at their intuitive grasp of physics, space, movement, group dynamics, and the capabilities of the human body.\u00a0 That is just as much intelligence as anything you can measure on a standardized test, and it never stops being astonishing to me. Or, in college I knew an art student who reported that when she\u2019d been painting alone for a long time, she had a really hard time switching back over into speech\u2026like if her roommate came home unexpectedly and said hello.\u00a0 I have a really hard time buying that in those preceding hours, she wasn\u2019t thinking at all just because she wasn\u2019t doing it in words, but in color, shape, and movement. It\u2019s incredibly arrogant, too, the presumption that because this is how you, or even most people, learn to think about the world, that that is how it must be done, and if it wasn\u2019t, then those people aren\u2019t really thinking at all\u2026that thought itself cannot occur in a frame of reference radically different from the one that most people take for granted.\u00a0 Or that nothing of significance could be understood if  it can\u2019t easily be translated to speech or verbal language .\u00a0 And that\u2019s not even taking into account all the conditions by which someone may in fact have a very verbal understanding of the world, but not be able to physically speak for whatever reason (like oral motor apraxia).\u00a0 The prejudice is to assume that they cannot think or understand, rather than to look for ways that they could make their understanding known. What I\u2019m starting to think is that it\u2019s not the autistic who have a theory of mind problem. I\u2019m at my favorite coffee shop again, like I usually am on days when I don\u2019t have to be at work till evening.\u00a0 Patrons are actually sitting outside this morning, because it\u2019s sunny, calm, and 45 degrees instead of 10.\u00a0 A woman smoking at the table nearest the door pushes her last fragment of baklava\u2014shimmering with honey\u2014to the edge of the table for the sparrows to share, and as one alights on the edge of the table to seize it, the sun for just a moment shines through its widespread wings, turning both bird and pastry a translucent luminous gold\u2026like the bird was solidified from light itself. And though I write poetry, there are no words I can find sufficient for the sight\u2026not really.\u00a0 Even the above paragraph feels and sounds klutzy and contrived compared to what it actually looked and felt like. If I had even fewer words than this to describe it to you, would that mean that I didn\u2019t truly see or feel or understand that moment?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.

{"date": "November 1, 2012", "body": "A couple years ago, in one of the most misbegotten autism awareness campaigns ever, named Communication Shutdown, people were asked to refrain from using social networking for one day, November 1, to simulate the communication difficulties of autism spectrum disorders, and that for everyone who pledged to do this, a donation would be made to charity. This was a bad idea, because a whole lot of autistic people rely on social networking for communication and socialization, so getting people off the internet would actually be seriously  counterproductive  for the very people this was supposed to be helping.\u00a0 And immensely silly, because being without Facebook in no way approximates the experience of being autistic. I remember life without Facebook.\u00a0 They\u2019re not the same thing.\u00a0 Not even a little. In response,  Autistics Speaking Day  was founded, to use the internet to amplify our voices, rather than shut them down.\u00a0 This is my first year of participation. ***** One of the things that most enrages me when parents write about their child\u2019s ASD diagnosis is lamentation that they\u2019ll never be normal\u2026as if normal is some kind of unit of measurement of what a life worth having is, above joy, integrity, authenticity, curiosity and passion, love, usefulness, or perception of beauty. One of the things that breaks my heart is when they only ask \u201cwill he be happy?\u201d\u00a0 Because of course no one can say, and though I can tell you lots of things about what it\u2019s like to be this, I can\u2019t either. I don\u2019t think this is my most elegant writing, but it might be the best I can explain.\u00a0 I hope it\u2019s whatever comfort it can be. It\u2019s a sparkling, cool morning, right before fall.\u00a0 I\u2019m watching a little brown sparrow perform some kind of courtship dance and song on the branches of a honey locust tree, right outside of my favorite coffee shop\u2019s window.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tiny, absurdly beautiful thing, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the only one who notices it at the moment.\u00a0 Which I like. I am happier than I thought I\u2019d ever get a chance to be.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t always this way. I live in a city I like, with people I enjoy.\u00a0 I love the job that I do.\u00a0 I\u2019m a proud member of my union.\u00a0 I earn a living in the arts\u2014something that people tell you that real people don\u2019t do.\u00a0 I feel badass for this.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing something that I truly want to be doing with my life. I have good friends, and I have more good friends than I once even imagined possible. I love walks, museums, food, books, writing, music, traveling,  Doctor Who .\u00a0 I yell at the radio a lot during election season. I actually feel like I\u2019m living the life I was meant to.\u00a0 I feel  real  in my own world for the first time in a long time.\u00a0 It feels very strange, and very, very good. A few weeks ago I was running a piano recital, and a little girl who takes lessons where I work got bored of listening and snuck backstage to talk to me.\u00a0 She makes me laugh and I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her she\u2019s not supposed to be there.\u00a0 We talked about books, and the presidential election. Sometimes when I\u2019m opening up the theater, or in the middle of a performance, or putting pianos away for the night, I get this incredibly eerie, but wonderful feeling of \u201cThis really is my life, and it belongs to me, and it\u2019s where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d Last night I went for a walk, and found, in the underbrush of the park that borders my nighttime walking route, a raccoon scavenging food for three feral kittens in the aftermath of the hurricane.\u00a0 My jaw dropped when I realized what was happening.\u00a0 While I watched this scene, a bat flew right by my head, twice.\u00a0 I could hear its navigational clicking.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe that most people don\u2019t see and hear things like this. And also\u2014 Our rent went up again this year, despite the apartment actually being in worse shape than when we moved in eight years ago. Our bathroom is disintegrating from water damage from a leak from the unit above us\u2014 again \u2014that the city is incapable of forcing the landlords to fix permanently.\u00a0 And the mice are positively indestructible. I spent a couple months recently putting groceries on my credit card.\u00a0 One difficult, underpaying job has followed another for most of the year.\u00a0 Then my computer needed repairs I couldn\u2019t afford but couldn\u2019t go without. I just re-qualified through the union for health insurance I can\u2019t really afford either and may lose again in six months anyway. I grew up being told that if I got a good education, I\u2019d be comfortable and secure.\u00a0 But the security that was supposed to be the predictable, deserved reward of this much work is nowhere in sight. No one knew to tell me that I\u2019d go insane in a job in which I didn\u2019t have to work with my hands.\u00a0 No one told me when I was growing up that there were countless ways to succeed in this life, countless right ways to live.\u00a0 That you\u2019re not rewarded with happiness for conformity to a path you weren\u2019t actually made to follow.\u00a0 That authenticity is a good bet.\u00a0 And good thing, too, because it was the only choice I really ever had. Other people my age have houses, children, backyards, dogs.\u00a0 It is hard to watch this happen and know I may never be able to have these things.\u00a0 But then again, this leaves me in not so different a position from that of a lot of people in my industry. I do want a romantic partner, but don\u2019t know how capable I am of sustaining such a relationship.\u00a0 I want a family but doubt my ability to support one. \u00a0\u00a0But if I never get married and have children, that will make me sad; it won\u2019t make my life an unlivable tragedy. I would like to live somewhere else, sometime, but worry about there not being enough work to support even myself. And I\u2019m scared for the future.\u00a0 Of health problems I can\u2019t afford.\u00a0 Of ever losing my self-determination. \u00a0I don\u2019t pretend that I\u2019ll ever be able to retire in true comfort or security. \u00a0I don\u2019t even let myself think about such a thing. All of the above is true.\u00a0 None of it cancels out any of the rest of it.\u00a0 I love my life and I couldn\u2019t wish for a different one. And sometimes I go to bed at night thinking \u201cGod, I don\u2019t know how long I can do this.\u201d But security isn\u2019t happiness.\u00a0 Normality isn\u2019t happiness. Things might not be this hard forever.\u00a0 And they really might be.\u00a0 And either way, I believe in taking joy wherever you can find it.\u00a0 And that being who you are is worth it.\u00a0 That everyone belongs somewhere.\u00a0 That the world is full of so much beauty you might not believe me if I told you. My coffee shop is across the street from the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.\u00a0 You can see the parish building through the front windows, and I love the way the sunlight filters through the leaves of elm and apple trees and plays across the carved stone fa\u00e7ade, faces of saints, angels, and monsters the old oak doors, the copper and frosted glass lanterns. I could sit here and drink coffee and watch the light move across the cathedral buildings all day. But I have promises to keep.

{"date": "October 29, 2012", "body": "Playwright Doug Wright posted a Facebook status the other day that went: I had been thinking along those very same lines myself, with regards to the alarming pattern of statements minimizing rape and its consequences, and advocating depriving women of the option of legal abortion even in cases of rape and abuse, on the part of Republican candidates lately. That frankly, every time I hear someone defend their Republican votes, despite that party\u2019s deplorable stances on women\u2019s and LGBT rights (among a host of other issues), saying \u201cI only vote on economic issues,\u201d what I hear is, \u201cYour rights as a citizen and presumed equality as a human being with control over your own life and body are disposable to me, and here is exactly the amount of the tax break or economic advantage for which I would sell them.\u00a0 Your worth and dignity, your rights to medical care and privacy, are for sale to the highest bidder as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d But rationally, I know that it\u2019s not exactly a fair accusation, because people are neither that simple nor that consistent nor that self-reflective, and really, really talented at double-think. That people are, in fact, somehow capable of seeing absolutely no conflict between believing that they love and respect their wives, daughters, sisters, and their gay, lesbian or transgender children, friends, and coworkers\u2013and voting for candidates whose policies directly threaten our well-being and civil rights. I don\u2019t understand this, but I know that it\u2019s true. My more vexing question for these voters is, \u201cWhat on God\u2019s green earth makes  you  feel safe at the hands of these people?\u201d Because let me tell you something:\u00a0 They are not only threatening me.\u00a0 They are not only threatening women, gay people, trans people, religious minorities, poor people, illegal immigrants, various demographic groups whose voting patterns they don\u2019t like, and the societal resources that make all of our lives richer and more stable. They are threatening you.\u00a0 And they are telling you that they are.\u00a0 And you keep voting for them. How many times have we heard children who didn\u2019t want to be bullies, but who witnessed their \u201cfriends\u201d or ring-leaders bullying others and did nothing, talk about why they didn\u2019t?\u00a0 Because they were afraid that their \u201cfriends\u201d would turn the ugliness on them if they stepped out of line.\u00a0 And indeed, many teenage bullying victims report that this is exactly what happened.\u00a0 That they were part of the clique, part of the in-group, one of the right people, until they weren\u2019t. When someone will do something horrible to other people, ostensibly for your sake, what they are telling you is not that they so vehemently have your best interests in mind.\u00a0 What they are telling you is not that they will go to whatever practical lengths necessary, however hard-hearted they seem, to uphold the beliefs you both share. What they are telling you is that they will do horrible things to other people.\u00a0 They are telling you exactly who they are and how they treat people. And if they will do terrible things to other people for your approval, then know exactly what they will do to you when they decide they need someone else\u2019s approval. I used to listen to Dr. Laura.\u00a0 I was young and thought I was a conservative.\u00a0 But, as a broken clock is still right twice a day, I think she said about two things that are utterly true and brilliant, and one of them was: If they will do it with you, they will do it to you. And when these guys talk about what they think or what they want to take away from the poor, jobless, disabled, and marginalized\u2026and you think that doesn\u2019t apply to you?\u00a0 Ask yourself just how confident you are that you will never be one of the poor, jobless, disabled or marginalized.\u00a0 (And before you decide, recall that a lot of people who thought they\u2019d done everything right were pretty confident of this before 2008.) This is one of those things that I grew up instinctively understanding, and am mystified by people who don\u2019t, who I guess have just never been in a situation in which you  had  to know this.\u00a0 I have always had to know this. When someone threatens any vulnerable person or group of people, they are threatening me.\u00a0 They are coming for me next.\u00a0 They are broadcasting that this is what they do to the wrong kind of people.\u00a0 (In my heart, I\u2019ve always been one of the wrong kind of people.)\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s not you right now.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be whoever they need it to be. They\u2019re telling you what they will do to people.\u00a0 They\u2019re telling you, on the basis of their authoritarian religious beliefs, and with no  economic  reasoning whatsoever, what they want to be able to do to us. They are threatening to take away access to health care. They are threatening to take away our rights to control over our own bodies, and to privacy of our reproductive and medical decisions. They are threatening to invalidate marriages and families.\u00a0 They are threatening to take away from children the securities intrinsic to having legally married parents.\u00a0 They are threatening to turn back the clock on the progression of equal rights under the law no matter the sex of the person you love. Even if you don\u2019t give a damn that this is being done to women and gays, try looking out for yourself and your own self-determination for a minute. They consider themselves uniquely justified in imposing their religious beliefs on other people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 Why do you imagine you\u2019ll be exempt? Why do you think you\u2019ll be safe? Do you seriously think that they\u2019re just morally bankrupt enough to do this to me and the people I care about, but not to you and the people you care about? Think again.

{"date": "September 9, 2012", "body": "So apparently school started again this past week, and (in)appropriately, I ran across  this article  on Salon.com (Americans Want Sex Ed), summarizing a report from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\u00a0 The report presents the seemingly paradoxical findings that while a solid majority of both adults and teens in the United States believe that teenagers should be taught about birth control, and also that anti-abortion leaders should support the availability of birth control, and also that they (teens) themselves have the information they need to avoid unplanned pregnancy\u2026a somewhat scarily large percentage of teens then go on to report knowing little to nothing of contraception methods. But I suspect that the discrepancy obscures, at least in part, a disconnect between the fairly binary way in which we conceive of what \u201csex education\u201d can and should be\u2013either abstinence only or abstinence plus safety and contraception\u2013and the nuances of students\u2019 real lives, or how well what students are taught about contraception does or doesn\u2019t match up with how they really need or want to be educated about sexual relationships. If, for instance, you\u2019re a 15-year-old lesbian, it may be true that you know what you need to about contraception at the moment even if that isn\u2019t very much.\u00a0 Or if you\u2019ve genuinely decided to wait for sex\u2013till marriage or just till you\u2019re older\u2013you might not be wrong that you don\u2019t need to know everything about possible contraception methods right this minute.\u00a0 Or if you\u2019re on the asexuality spectrum and not seeking a sexual relationship\u2026this information might not be taking up space on your hard drive, but you know where to find it if or when you want it\u2026or if, like some students taking this survey, you\u2019re 12 years old. Or imagine how profoundly unhelpful a group role-playing game full of scare tactics about the dangers of promiscuity is to someone desperately trying to figure out how to have one good, safe, physical relationship. It\u2019s also easy to mistakenly think you know everything it\u2019s possible to know, when what you don\u2019t know is what you aren\u2019t being taught. I was, probably unsurprisingly, one of the kids who thought that I knew what I needed to know. \u00a0I\u2019d been through fairly decent classes on what to expect from puberty.\u00a0 I\u2019d been given information on available contraception.\u00a0 (In a totally brilliant move on my mother\u2019s part, one day she had picked me up  Seventeen  magazine\u2019s Environment Special Issue, which she said she thought I\u2019d enjoy, environmental activism being my primary obsession at the time.\u00a0 It also had Your Complete Guide to Contraception in the back of the issue.\u00a0 It was years before I realized that handing that over had probably been deliberate and not an oversight on her part.)\u00a0 I was a biology wonk and already knew more about disease transmission and risk than what was in the health class videos and graphic slide shows. And, for reasons that turned out to be a good deal more complicated than I even thought they were at the time, I\u2019d taken a stance that I was delaying sex\u2026pretty much indefinitely. In this state of affairs, I wound up, despite my protestations that the requirement was insulting, in my school\u2019s \u201cHealth and Family Wellness\u201d class.\u00a0 In which I somehow managed to be continuously stigmatized for the very choices that the class purported to be encouraging, because the ways in which I\u2019d made them did not comport with the core presumptions of What Teenagers Are Like or How Dating Works.\u00a0 At the same time that I did indeed think I knew what I needed to, as far as what I saw available, I felt this gaping absence of anyone anywhere accurately describing how I actually experienced myself or my desires, and how to build a life or be safe and respected in those things. Now I look back and know that I cannot have been the only one experiencing this, because people who were not represented as having sexual or romantic relationships worth talking about included gay people, queer people, trans people, disabled people\u2026so also disabled queer people\u2026any kind of gender fluid or gender variant people, people on the asexuality spectrum, or now that I try to think of it, very many people of color or of cultures other than Normal American Teenager.\u00a0 Let alone any of those people having relationships  with each other. What worked for other people was clearly not going to work out for me, but there were no examples of what would.\u00a0 Or of how to talk about what was true for you, if that wasn\u2019t what was presumed to be the default. There\u2019s a quote from Adrienne Rich that I think of more and more often:\u00a0 \u201cWhen someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world and you are not in it, there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing.\u201d So\u2026not getting pregnant was actually not my biggest problem.\u00a0 The ways in which our school\u2019s sex ed didn\u2019t have much to offer me went way deeper than \u201cI already know all about contraception, this is a waste of my time, and I\u2019d rather be taking art.\u201d\u00a0 But that was all I was able to express\u2014in no small part  because of  the poverty of education or language available about relationships, sex, and gender that went beyond the very superficial.\u00a0 And so I sat in class day after day, feeling more and more alienated from my peers and from how adults presumed I should be treated based on the fact that I was 15 and not much else, being told by unqualified teachers \u201cI\u2019m sorry you think you\u2019re too good to be here,\u201d rolling my eyes at badly produced educational videos, and learning most of what I really knew about love and respect from Mulder and Scully at home alone on Friday nights.\u00a0 (And I\u2019m not the only person I know who says that I learned what love was supposed to be from those characters.) How would I have answered a survey question \u201cDo you feel that you have all the information you need to prevent an unplanned pregnancy at this time?\u201d\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 But it would\u2019ve been a stand-in answer for the fact that the question didn\u2019t address anything real in my life. I can well imagine that if you go to a school in which the name of your sexual identity is literally a bad word (\u201cDon\u2019t say gay\u201d bills have been introduced in both Missouri and Tennessee),  or a subject that faculty feel forbidden to address, up to and including when you\u2019re being violently victimized for it , that you might reasonably feel that your ability to name risks and benefits of five different kinds of contraception is a little bit beside the point. It isn\u2019t that we shouldn\u2019t teach comprehensive information about birth control, obviously, or work to ascertain whether kids feel they have the information they need about it, but I think in the common conception of what sex education is, this is widely thought of as the ultimate question: whether to teach abstinence only, or whether to teach risk management methods.\u00a0 But even the seemingly right answer to that question is misleading and even counterproductive when contraception as risk management is taught without a bedrock of positive and healthy attitudes about sex, real-life examples of all types of healthy sexual and romantic relationships, a vocabulary to describe what\u2019s true and desirable for yourself individually, and knowledge and respect for your own sexual identity and those different from you. Without that kind of knowledge, which should be basic and not controversial, I suspect it may be hard for students to draw easy conclusions about whether the health information they have matches up to the realities of their lives.

The article is well worth reading, and I\u2019m thankful for these parents who make a decision to accept their sons as they are and to not force them to suppress their gender expression, and to get them support in their schools and neighborhoods.\u00a0 I know it does take courage to do it in the face of a lot of misunderstanding and pressure to the contrary.\u00a0 They make me hopeful and thrilled for their kids.

Lots of people have fluid or androgynous gender expression, and young children can be far more self-knowing than we give them credit for.\u00a0 The question I wish a writer for a major, mainstream news publication would address is \u201cwhat the hell is wrong with a society that would treat the most vulnerable of children the way that we currently do?\u201d\u00a0 How is it that ostracism, bullying, ridicule, forced suppression, employment discrimination, and violence are considered the  normal  responses to deviations from it, and acceptance is considered the curiosity?

And they will vote for this president no matter what\u2026These are people who pay no income tax\u2026[M]y job is is not to worry about those people. I\u2019ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. \u201d \u2014 Mitt Romney I am actually not one of the people whose character you insulted the other night at your private donor event, in footage now made public by  Mother Jones Magazine .\u00a0 You see\u2013and this may come as a shock to you, as it does occasionally to people when they learn how much money I actually make, or who think that freeloading is easier to do than it actually is\u2013I pay federal income taxes. I mean, sure, I can barely afford my rent, my health insurance, the steadily rising cost of public transit, and the $300 in unexpected repairs that my computer needs, and may be applying for food stamps this month because even though I worked steadily all summer, the work was chronically underpaid and I\u2019ve run through my savings\u2026but I still pay federal income taxes.\u00a0 I say this not for your pity or anyone else\u2019s; this is just how it is.\u00a0 I pay federal income taxes, and I\u2019m very, very happy to do so.\u00a0 I have a fondness for the trappings of civilization, I think the social safety net is a good and moral idea, and I\u2019m glad to be a contributor to those things. But let\u2019s take a look at some of the people who you did call entitled victims with no interest in taking responsibility for their own lives.\u00a0 Because I don\u2019t think they are who you want us to believe they are. People who find themselves exempt from paying any federal income tax may include, but are not limited to:\u00a0 People who receive tax credits for dependent children, or for being the sole head of a household; people who buy their first home, or an environmentally friendly vehicle; who suffer an initial loss in the course of starting a new business, or who make improvements in energy efficiency to their home or business.\u00a0 People with more than one income source who can deduct half of the self-employment tax they pay on freelance work, or charitable contributions, or the costs of private health insurance or health care if they don\u2019t get insurance from their employer.\u00a0 They include students who still manage (or need) to work part-time during high school or college.\u00a0 They include people who survive primarily on disability or Social Security, or are financially supported by their families, but who volunteer or do other informal work in their communities. They include people who work full-time, and yet still do not make enough money, particularly if they also have children, to be legally liable for federal income taxes under our current tax code. Do these sound like people with no interest in taking care or responsibility for their own lives to you? But no, I have a feeling that images like these, of people who are benefited by the tax code  because they do economically or socially advantageous things , are not what you meant to evoke to your donors.\u00a0 People who in fact are doing the  opposite  of not taking any care or responsibility for their lives. You meant to evoke a bogeyman image of a lazy bum who purposefully refuses gainful employment and would rather sit around collecting government benefits, mooching off the hard work of the rest of us just because they can, and who will vote for anyone just to protect that status. And those people do exist\u2013I\u2019m sure they do, because wherever there is any system of benefits or safeguards, there are people who will figure out how to take unfair advantage of it, among the rich as well as the poor.\u00a0 But that is really, really,  really  difficult to do these days, in our current system of welfare benefits, if you are a non-disabled adult with no dependent children and no work history.\u00a0 (Hell, it\u2019s difficult to get benefits if you  are  legitimately disabled, generally requiring more than one appeal no matter the validity of your claim.) This leaves about two possibilities that I can think of.\u00a0 Either that, one, you don\u2019t know very much about how our tax laws work and how responsible, working people can benefit from them to the extent of winding up owing no federal income taxes, and you don\u2019t know the difference between people who reap tax advantages by working and people who choose not to work, and you don\u2019t know the difference between people who work full-time (or more) and still don\u2019t make enough money to pay taxes on and people who think that the world owes them everything. Or, two, that you  do  know these things, but you thought that you could win some advantage or approval with a few rich and powerful donors by smearing these people, and so you did. You either know nothing about the lives and economic situations of nearly half of our citizens, or you see them only as pawns for your own advancement, whose character, work ethic, and well-being mean nothing. Either one leaves you unfit to be President. I, on the other hand, believe that if we don\u2019t hang together in times like this, we will surely hang separately, so non-freeloader that I am, it doesn\u2019t help you to tell me that nearly half of my fellow citizens are economically or morally disposable moochers.

I am looking for creative, passionate people to help lift this project off the ground. We currently have a budget of $200 dollars, but we will be actively fundraising. I need people who are willing to invest their time into the project to build it up to a place where we can start to earn money. Until then, this project will operate on a volunteer basis. I need sound engineers, writers, producers, and web designers. The podcasts will explore contemporary issues regarding food stories. For example, the first podcast will be titled First Meal and it will be discussing the importance of milk, the issues evolving around industrial dairy farming verses alternative dairy, as well as investigating the raw milk debate. We will host interviews with new and expectant mothers regarding breast feeding and the emotional connection created with their child via mother\u2019s milk. Other podcasts will include, but are not limited to, politics, economics, popular culture \u2013 how do these transitory climates interact with our permanent necessity for food and sustenance? Each individual podcast will explore topics of food regulation and legislation, agriculture, personal stories and more. If you fit the creative, passionate, food lover we represent. If anyone\u2019s interested in getting involved  (particularly with website design/building!) , or knows someone who might be, please get in touch with me, or the Facebook page of the  Alvarado School for Sustainability and Community Development .

{"date": "December 27, 2011", "body": "I think I never intended to write this post.\u00a0 It\u2019s personal, and it\u2019s a hissy fit, but one I felt a certain responsibility, the more I reflected on it, to transcribe. I was diagnosed with  Asperger\u2019s Syndrome  last year, which most of you probably know because I talk about it on Facebook enough, because I decided that it was part of my life that I wasn\u2019t going to make any particular effort to hide, because I had nothing to be ashamed of.\u00a0 (I\u2019d known the truth for several years before I sought out a correct diagnosis; a few people knew, but I didn\u2019t talk about it much, for fear of a lot of things.)\u00a0 I really have no idea what people think of me as a result, because I stopped concerning myself at a pretty early age with what people think of me.\u00a0 Because living in thrall to the opinions of people who don\u2019t have to live your life is no way to live at all. Anyway, so I\u2019d started to think of it as old news that I was autistic.\u00a0 I\u2019d started to settle in to living as a whole person, without an emotional double life.\u00a0 Then last night, I was rather emphatically asking my mother not to describe a young relative, currently in the process of being evaluated for autism himself, as not having a personality, because such language is often used to justify all kinds of mistreatment and prejudice against us, besides not being true. \u201cBut you\u2019re not autistic.\u201d Which is where my brain froze up.\u00a0 Because honestly?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what  else  I am.\u00a0 Everything comes home to that.\u00a0 Everything. Before I understood what AS really was, I didn\u2019t know what I was at all, except for lost and completely alone in the world. \u201cI don\u2019t think of you as really autistic.\u201d This is everything I didn\u2019t have it together enough to say at the time.\u00a0 This is what I\u2019d say going forward: If you can\u2019t see me as autistic, then you need to revise your view of autism. I am \u201cnot like that kid\u201d you saw who runs around screaming, or who can\u2019t communicate at all, because I grew up.\u00a0 And because we\u2019re all different, because we\u2019re all different people, who cope with unique profiles of challenges and gifts in individual ways.\u00a0 I am \u201cnot like that kid,\u201d because, to be perfectly literal, I  am not that kid . We are as unique as the stars.\u00a0 They say autism is a spectrum, but I don\u2019t think that really describes its variety and complexity well.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a simple progression from mild to severe.\u00a0 I often say it\u2019s more like a constellation, or galaxy (which, another blogger pointed out to me today, has the added metaphorical benefit of being a 4-dimensional construct; it changes through time for every person as well).\u00a0 There are people with far more severe problems with independent living than I have, who are smarter, better writers, incredible artists or just incredible people. I am far more fortunate than many, and not as lucky as others.\u00a0 I know this; you don\u2019t need to rub my nose in it. If you can\u2019t think of me as autistic because I have so much personality\u2026actually, we usually do. If you can\u2019t think of me as autistic because you see me as a competent adult, you didn\u2019t know me as a child. If you can\u2019t think of me as autistic because I\u2019m verbal and communicative\u2026read more about AS.\u00a0 Those things are features of the condition. If you can\u2019t think of me as autistic because I\u2019m so good at my job\u2026please consider that it\u2019s a job that largely entails \u201ckeeping track of everything that no one else wants to\u201d (to paraphrase the college instructor who introduced me to stage management as a career option), organizing, color-coding, and working with a collection of people who are  also  socially marginalized, passionate, obsessive, highly sensitive, and reliant on consistency and repetitive and ritualized behavior.\u00a0 (Actors, I adore you all so much.) If you think I can\u2019t be autistic because I\u2019m so good at multitasking, well, I\u2019m not.\u00a0 Good at multitasking, that is\u2026I can\u2019t do it at all.\u00a0 I know I\u2019m taking a certain risk in telling you this.\u00a0 What you see when you see me do my job is the result of copious amounts of planning, mental choreography, scripting, queuing, pre-thinking, mapping out scenarios like computer flowcharts, making Excel spreadsheets, preparation and learning from experience, and excellent assistants being good at their jobs, too.\u00a0 (Stage management and life with Asperger\u2019s are both centered around dealing with a quantity of data that a single human being is not truly equipped to handle.) You get good at anything you do for a long time.\u00a0 I got good at my life when I stopped trying to live one that I realized I could never have. If you can\u2019t believe I\u2019m autistic, what on God\u2019s green earth do you think I am?\u00a0 Because I sure as hell failed at being normal. I\u2019m autistic.\u00a0 There\u2019s not another or a better word for what I am.\u00a0 It\u2019s one I searched long and fought hard for. If you can\u2019t think of me as autistic, it\u2019s not so much for my sake that I care, but watch out that it\u2019s not because you can\u2019t believe that autistic people can be intelligent, kind, good-humored, good friends, good at our jobs, capable of love, highly-skilled or talented, complete human beings.\u00a0 Because if your prejudice is that autistic people can\u2019t be these things, you take chances for jobs, education, friendships, and quality of life away from autistic people who are a whole lot less lucky than I am.

{"date": "January 29, 2012", "body": "So I got a Kindle for Christmas.\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t previously thought that I wanted one, but agreed to give it a whirl\u2026and now that I have it, I really can\u2019t deny its usefulness, even as some features irk me. I had the prospect of a long bus ride back home in front of me, and had learned the hard way on my trip out to Kansas City that Greyhound\u2019s advertised free wi-fi is actually a deeply unreliable prospect.\u00a0 A friend had recommended Gregory Maguire\u2019s  Out of Oz , the conclusion to the series that began with  Wicked .\u00a0 Though tempted to make that my first download and jump right in, it had been a long time since I\u2019d read  Son of a Witch  and I barely remembered its plot, I hadn\u2019t even gotten to  A Lion Among Men  yet, and I was feeling pretty rusty and unmoored in my Oz lore in general, so I figured maybe I\u2019d better start back at the beginning\u2026and read the original, L. Frank Baum\u2019s  The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , which, somewhat embarrassingly for a book-loving girl born in Kansas, I never had. I got the complete original 14-volume Oz series for something like $4.50.\u00a0\u00a0 Okay\u2026I started to admit that this Kindle thing could be pretty great. So, rolling through the desolate wintery hills of Missouri and Indiana, I started reading  The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Baum includes a note at the start of the book: My heart sank; I was sure to be in for a fatally boring read, and I had 28 hours ahead of me. \u00a0Compelling stories require real threats and real stakes; this was, like, the very first lesson of my college dramatic writing class\u2026in which the movie version of  The Wizard of Oz  was Exhibit A. But I was not to be disappointed, because let me just say, for a fairy tale supposedly stripped of nightmare and malice\u2026 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  contains a whole lot of death, dismemberment, and treachery.\u00a0 Most prominent is the origin story of the Tin Woodman, who was once a flesh and blood human being, a poor woodcutter, whose love for a Munchkin girl was resented by the old woman she worked for.\u00a0 The old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, who enchanted the woodman\u2019s axe to kill him off one piece at a time\u2026until having lost all of his original parts and thus lacking a heart, he didn\u2019t die but simply became indifferent to the girl he\u2019d loved. There\u2019s also the Wizard\u2019s frankly admitted tyranny over the Emerald City and enslavement of its population, the complicity of the \u201cgood\u201d witches with this, their rather transparent use of Dorothy as a pawn to regain the power of the silver shoes from the Witch of the West,  that  witch\u2019s enslavement and abuse of the Winkies and flying monkeys\u2026the field of poisoned poppies is still there, and some other nasty stuff, too\u2026it\u2019s a dark tale. Even  trying  to write a children\u2019s story without menace, morals, or survival lessons ( if  we believe that that\u2019s what he was sincerely trying to do; I\u2019m not actually sure that I do), Baum couldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s as if violence and hidden evil are things that must, one way or another, always be addressed in stories for children.\u00a0 Because children know they exist even as well-intentioned adults attempt to deny them; they live in constant knowledge of their own vulnerability, and so a children\u2019s story that attempts to deny or obscure their reality will always fall flat. When we believed, as Baum did in his time, that morals and character were being explicitly and consistently taught to children in school, church, extended families and communities (whether they were or not, or what we might think of what kind of morals were being taught, is another story entirely), did writers for children feel less of a need to write explicitly or realistically about these things?\u00a0 And now that, I think it\u2019s arguable, we feel a widespread anxiety that these things are not being taught to children very well or consistently or at all, do children\u2019s writers again feel an obligation to address them more openly and honestly, even in ways that are graphically, horribly violent? Ironically, when our culture and educational system overwhelmingly address youth as shallow, technology-obsessed, and morally ungrounded, more compelling writing for children and teenagers addresses them seriously and respectfully as thinking, competent people, capable of astonishing empathy and courage.\u00a0 Adults who lack regard for children as whole people who think and suffer and deserve to have their suffering taken seriously, can\u2019t give them what worthwhile literature does:\u00a0 examples of real strength, intelligence, and hope from characters their age. I think particularly of the heroes of two series that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to predict will wind up as the defining examples of children\u2019s literature of our time:  Harry Potter , and Suzanne Collins\u2019  The Hunger Games  trilogy. And when I say \u201cteaching morals and character,\u201d I don\u2019t mean talking down to children about these things, but addressing real problems of existence, conflict (including war and murder), conscience, and ethics in the serious way that children actually crave and are capable of handling, which is far greater than we as a society typically give them credit for. The Wizard of Oz  succeeds as children\u2019s literature, not to the extent that it denies or obscures the reality of violence, evil, fear, and loneliness, but to the extent that it utterly fails to. In her New York Times op-ed from October, \u201c No More Adventures in Wonderland ,\u201d Maria Tatar says that we shouldn\u2019t oppose the current dark and serious trajectory of children\u2019s literature, \u201cit is hard not to mourn the decline of the literary tradition invented by Carroll and Barrie\u2026.No other writers more fully entered the imaginative worlds of children \u2014 where danger is balanced by enchantment \u2014 and reproduced their magic on the page. In today\u2019s stories, those safety zones are rapidly vanishing as adult anxieties edge out childhood fantasy.\u201d But I disagree that there ever was childhood fantasy untainted by adult anxieties.\u00a0 Enchantment isn\u2019t a balance to danger; it\u2019s bound inextricably with danger.\u00a0 Great children\u2019s stories are safe zones precisely because they deal with very real adult danger in a safe medium, not because they make it zany or ludicrous.\u00a0 There is no escapism here.\u00a0 Good children\u2019s stories are still almost always survival lessons, because there is no need for fantasy or enchantment without the reality of evil and heartache.\u00a0 Hook may be ultimately contemptible, but he\u2019s not an interesting character unless he\u2019s a truly mortal enemy. If I look back to the books of my own childhood (rather than the children\u2019s stories I discovered as an adult), of course I\u2019m fond of  Goodnight Moon ,  Make Way for Ducklings , and  The Caretakers of Wonder ; but the book that hands down meant the most to me then and still does now, is  Saint George and the Dragon , Margaret Hodges\u2019 adaptation for children of an episode from Edmund Spenser\u2019s  The Faerie Queene , which spares no gory detail of Saint George\u2019s three battles against a nightmarish dragon terrorizing the medieval English countryside.\u00a0 It\u2019s an enchanting tale, gorgeously illustrated with watercolors of whimsical fairies and English sunsets.\u00a0 And everyone involved\u2014George, Una\u2019s people, the dragon\u2014are fighting horrifically for their very lives and there\u2019s no pretending otherwise.\u00a0 (And I tended to identify with the dragon above either of the human protagonists, but that\u2019s another story entirely.) When Tatar writes that \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Carroll or Barrie coming up with something like that. They were as passionate about their young readers as they were about the books they wrote. In 1856, Carroll purchased a camera with the hope of freezing time through his portraits of little girls. By capturing them in photographs, he made sure they never grew up,\u201d she reveals that the style of children\u2019s literature she mourns says more about the prejudices towards children of its authors, rather than the actual needs or character of children or anything about their world. What happens in a book can\u2019t hurt you.\u00a0 What happens in real life certainly will, if you have no prior example for how to cope with it.\u00a0 People who actually respect children and teenagers as people, trust them to use books to learn what they need to.\u00a0 Abuse, sex, violence, alienation, homophobia, hatred, etc., are things that happen to children and teenagers, and the fact that we think they shouldn\u2019t isn\u2019t enough of an excuse to deny them the emotional resources for helping themselves, and letting them do so privately and in their own time.\u00a0 That is what good stories, especially the darkest stories, provide: precedent in a safe context for dealing with cruelty, the difference of others, and emotional complexity, rage, fear, and confusion. \u201cInstead of stories about children who will not grow up, we have stories about children who struggle to survive,\u201d Tatar writes of our most successful children\u2019s literature.\u00a0 But it was never really otherwise, except in the fantasies of adults.

{"date": "August 7, 2011", "body": "Sometimes when I\u2019m feeling frustrated and pessimistic, I get to wondering if humanity is irredeemably stupid.\u00a0 Sometimes I look around at some of the things we do to each other and the immensity of the problems we\u2019ve created for ourselves through greed and short-sightedness, and the state of politics in this country, and just can\u2019t fathom how we\u2019re ever going to find the unity, compassion, and concerted problem-solving to get ourselves out. But I\u2019ve been watching  TED  talks lately\u2026and this conference has found a really astonishing number of people who have totally brilliant ideas and things to say.\u00a0 You can really click randomly on just about any TED talk video, and people you\u2019ve never heard of before in a hugely diverse range of disciplines are saying and doing incredible things.\u00a0 Which makes me think, instead, that we actually have a nearly infinite number of wise and brilliant people on our side. This talk by Sir Ken Robinson  is actually about 5 years old, but for that I think what he says is actually more urgent now and not less.\u00a0 He says that we\u2019re actually educating kids out of their creativity and natural genius, to our own impoverishment\u2026that we actually stigmatize many kinds of intelligence that simply don\u2019t perform well in a confined classroom environment or on a standardized test. Creativity isn\u2019t just about making art; it\u2019s that misunderestimation that makes it easy to marginalize as impractical or financially untenable.\u00a0 We have environmental problems, health problems, food problems, and budget problems, and they\u2019re all going to require creativity to solve.\u00a0 Balancing our budget will take creativity.\u00a0 Making alternatives to fossil fuels safe and affordable will take creativity.\u00a0  Finding ways to teach kids from the most difficult of life circumstances  takes creativity (like setting up a pirate supply store as a front for a free tutoring center, as Dave Eggers explains here). \u201cIt\u2019s education that\u2019s meant to take us into this future that we can\u2019t grasp,\u201d Robinson says, noting that we\u2019re trying to educate kids for the next 50 years of their lives, but we have no idea what the world will be like in 5 years.\u00a0 We have absolutely no basis on which to say that one kind of thinking, one curriculum or set of skills or knowledge, will be the most important one in the future and therefore to stigmatize all the others. It\u2019s here that I\u2019d like the educational establishment to consider borrowing an idea from the autism community:\u00a0 neurodiversity, or the conviction that there is very broad natural variation in human neurological wiring, in which even difficult differences should be valued on their own terms.\u00a0 It\u2019s become a somewhat contentious term and there are plenty of legitimate criticisms of it, but I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s a denial of the reality of the disabling aspects of this condition, or a denial that people need and deserve help with things that really impede their quality of life.\u00a0 I see neurodiversity as asking us to understand and accept a way of thought and a way of being on its own terms before we devalue it or decide it should be eradicated from the human experience, to see people first for their gifts and the ways in which humanity needs them. As  Temple Grandin says , \u201cthe world needs all kinds of minds.\u201d To me, neurodiversity\u2019s not just about how we value autistic people, but how we value everyone who thinks differently, anyone who\u2019s out of step with what the culture has decided it values and doesn\u2019t value, and whatever is distinctive about every person. Very much echoing what I interpret to be at the heart of the neurodiversity movement\u2019s goals, Robinson says \u201cHuman communities depend upon a diversity of talent, not a singular conception of ability.\u00a0 At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence.\u201d Robinson talks specifically about how dance and performance arts are devalued in the educational system, and I think of the  League of Extraordinary Dancers , as well as all the dancers I\u2019ve worked with, who never stop amazing me with how their brains work in ways that mine doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 Skills like these are probably not measurable by standardized test, but, I mean, they only have the potential to revolutionize assumptions about what the human body is capable of and the artistic potential of technology and the internet. No one gets better or stronger or smarter by being defined and valued according to their weaknesses, but that\u2019s exactly how we educate kids.\u00a0 We sort students out by what\u2019s wrong with them instead of allowing them the resources and freedom to nurture what\u2019s right with themselves. I think of Hogwarts, by contrast, which begins the process of formal education by sorting students according to their most basic strengths: Gryffindor students are courageous, Ravenclaws clever, Hufflepuffs hardworking and fair, and Slytherins cunning and ambitious.\u00a0 Notice how the Sorting Hat doesn\u2019t sort anyone out by their deficiencies.\u00a0 And how it required the gifts of every single House to save the world from Voldemort.\u00a0 (Even Slytherin, reviled by all the other houses\u2026Snape\u2019s cunning obviously being what allowed him to act as a double agent for the Order, and it was Narcissa Malfoy\u2019s loyalty to her own family first and foremost that led her to betray Voldemort.) We all need each other.\u00a0 We all need each other\u2019s brilliance. {I couldn\u2019t exactly weave this in to my thesis, but it\u2019s just beautiful and I wanted to share it:  spoken word poet Sarah Kay  talks about how she found out what she wanted to do, using poetry to solve problems, and teaching self-expression through performance poetry.} ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ted.com/", "http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html", "http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/dave_eggers_makes_his_ted_prize_wish_once_upon_a_school.html", "http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/temple_grandin_the_world_needs_all_kinds_of_minds.html", "http://www.ted.com/talks/the_lxd_in_the_internet_age_dance_evolves.html", "http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/sarah_kay_if_i_should_have_a_daughter.html"], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2011/08/07/a-hope-for-neurodiversity-in-education/", "title": "A hope for neurodiversity in\u00a0education"},

And I\u2019m wondering out of nowhere if anyone else remembers a certain children\u2019s book.

It was told in the style of a series of fables, about a very wise old legal adviser in the Japanese royal court.\u00a0 People brought seemingly impossible cases to him, and like Solomon, he always had the fair and clever solution.\u00a0 One case was about a wiseguy trying to circumvent a progressive tax law that taxed people based on the number of doors their homes contained by building a house with only windows.\u00a0 One was about a court servant who accidentally broke a priceless vase, for which the normal penalty would be death since she couldn\u2019t hope to repay the cost with all the money that she\u2019d ever earn in her life, and one, my favorite, was about a poor man who lived above a noodle shop.\u00a0 He was starving, but said that as he ate his plain white rice every night, he felt like he was eating a more substantial meal because he enjoyed the smells of the cooking from below so much, they flavored his own meal.\u00a0 So the noodle shop guy wanted to charge him for the food he hadn\u2019t eaten, since he claimed he had enjoyed it just as much as if he had. I don\u2019t even remember the actual resolution of any of the cases.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember the title of the book or the author.\u00a0 Googling \u201cchildren\u2019s book wise old japanese guy\u201d gets me nowhere.\u00a0 So for my blog friends and pen pals old and young, a crowdsource question:\u00a0 Does anyone else recall this book?

See, WordPress has this nifty feature whereby you can see which search engine terms are bringing readers to your blog.\u00a0 The following are some of the  actual  phrases that internet surfers have entered into search engines which brought them to my post \u201cReal nerd girls.\u201d \u201creal nerd girls\u201d\u00a0 ( Okay, fair enough. ) \n\u201cactual nerdy girls\u201d \n\u201creal pretty nerd ladies\u201d \n\u201chot nerd girl not real nerd\u201d ( Yeah, well, sorry to disappoint you. ) \n\u201csexy girl in renaissance dress fuck\u201d\u00a0 ( I admit to being particularly impressed by this searcher\u2019s ability to spell \u201crenaissance\u201d correctly. ) \n\u201chot actual nerd girls?\u201d\u00a0 ( The tone of that question mark is just so forlorn\u2026. ) \n\u201cnerd girls in short skirts\u201d \n\u201clive nerd girls looking for me\u201d\u00a0 ( Uh, no. ) \n\u201cromantic girls girls hot sexy just engineers real\u201d\u00a0 ( Dude\u2026  ) \n\u201cfetish pics from women in waders\u201d\u00a0 ( \u2026\u2026.  ) But then there was one that actually broke my heart. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a nerd anymore.\u201d I have no way of knowing who the searcher was who made this request, and I rather doubt that he or she is still reading, obviously having not found the solution here.\u00a0 But, I don\u2019t know, just in case\u2026or in case anyone else comes looking\u2026 Dear nerdling, At risk of sounding patronizing, which is not my intention\u2026I know how hard it is.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 I won\u2019t try to minimize what you\u2019re going through, because I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got enough people trying to do that.\u00a0 I remember only too well what it\u2019s like to feel awkward, ugly, left out, and like no one gives a damn about you. But I can\u2019t tell you how not to be a nerd, because I don\u2019t know\u2026and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d tell you even if I knew.\u00a0 Because here\u2019s what I do know: High school (or, god forbid, middle school?) is not the best time of your life.\u00a0 Do not believe anyone who tells you it is, or that it should be.\u00a0 Life gets far better for nerds after high school in most cases.\u00a0 The adult world is much, much kinder to nerds than the adolescent world is. Nerds are not superficial beings.\u00a0 What makes you a nerd isn\u2019t on the surface, so there\u2019s nothing you can do to yourself cosmetically that will make you not a nerd.\u00a0 Not makeup or prettier hair.\u00a0 Not better clothes, cuter shoes, or any amount of waxing or plucking.\u00a0 Not mani/pedicures, piercings or tattoos.\u00a0 Some of the most sexy and attractive people I know are still nerds.\u00a0 If you\u2019re a nerd, you\u2019re a nerd all the way through. Nerds believe that knowledge matters, that information matters, and that truth matters.\u00a0 You might manage to hide or suppress that belief for social convenience, for a limited amount of time, but I doubt you can make yourself unbelieve it. Nerds are passionate.\u00a0 Nerds are intensely interested in how the world works.\u00a0 Nerds thrive in places where bottomless passion is valued rather than scorned.\u00a0 Nerds  care  about the world around them. Nerds tend to be very, very good at what they do, and doing something they love, because they do it for its own sake and not for what other people think.\u00a0 (And we don\u2019t just do science or technology, but also all the arts and humanities, teaching, politics\u2026anything that takes passion and attention to detail.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let anyone try to push you into science or math just because you\u2019re smart if that\u2019s not what you want.\u00a0 I know dancers and actors who are Ivy League grads with higher SAT scores than me.\u00a0 You don\u2019t owe anyone whatever use of your intelligence they happen to want from you.) Nerds are in touch with their own inner lives. Nerds never lose the ability to be amazed. Nerds are genuine.\u00a0 Nerds aren\u2019t ashamed to be sincere. Nerds aren\u2019t embarrassed to take things seriously, but also know how not to take themselves too seriously. Because nerds aren\u2019t addicted to popularity or social approval, they\u2019re better at standing up for what\u2019s right, and standing up for other people, even when it\u2019s unpopular. And in my experience with people, because nerds remember how hard it was to be young, they make nicer adults. So to not be a nerd anymore, you\u2019d have to somehow smother your curiosity, your sense of wonder, your joy for whatever it is that you love, your empathy, sincerity, and inclination to think for yourself.\u00a0 Now, you MIGHT be able to accomplish that\u2013again, I wouldn\u2019t know how\u2013but my strong suspicion is that, much like the making of a Horcrux, it might seem like a cool idea from the outset, but the actual process would do such violence to the integrity of your soul that it would be  soooo  not worth it in the end. Please reconsider?\u00a0 At least just give it some time.\u00a0 Because all the happiest people I know are the ones who have figured out how to accept themselves for who they truly are.\u00a0 And most of the very most wonderful people I know are nerds.

We are not, as socially conservative preachers often accuse, saying we believe in equality for political expediency, to be popular, to duck uncomfortable criticism, because we\u2019re insecure in our faith or because we don\u2019t know all the same Bible verses from Leviticus and 1st Corinthians that they do.\u00a0 We support LGBT equality, including in legal marriage, as an expression of our faith, not in spite of it. We think that the narrative arc of the Bible is one of an ever-expanding conception of grace and compassion for our fellow humans.\u00a0 It\u2019s a story of each successive generation seeing a new reflection of God in the world and the people around them.\u00a0 We don\u2019t think that that story ended 2000 years ago, but that we\u2019re asked by Christ constantly to see all people anew as creations of God. I do take issue with one characterization of the debate from the article, when it says \u201cYet the passage of same-sex marriage in New York last month, just two years after its defeat here, attests to the concerted, sustained efforts by liberal Christian and Jewish clergy to advocate for it in the language of faith, to counter the language of morality voiced by foes.\u201d Because we absolutely believe that this is an issue of morality as well.\u00a0 We believe it\u2019s immoral for the government to create second-class citizens and second-class families.\u00a0 We believe it\u2019s immoral to withhold civil rights based on sexuality just as it would be to deny those rights on the basis of race or religion.\u00a0 We think that the bigotry enshrined by the Defense of Marriage Act is immoral.\u00a0 We believe that to scapegoat gays for divorce, child abuse, and a host of other cultural problems is immoral.\u00a0 We believe it is a moral edict of our faith to stand up for the most vulnerable and marginalized people in our society. We are not attempting to undermine morality, but to support a morality of compassion and respect for all of our citizens. We believe, as Victor Hugo wrote, \u201cto love another person is to see the face of God,\u201d and that nothing can make that wrong.

{"date": "June 20, 2011", "body": "I feel like responding to a post by another WordPress blogger friend which I like a great deal, although I don\u2019t agree with it in every particular.\u00a0 In  Letter to All You Old People , soozling asks what\u2019s so wrong with not growing up, when grownups are just as petty and insecure as high-schoolers, unhappy and condescending, and screw things up just as badly as kids. I wonder why we have to define growing up to be such a terrible thing. I\u2019ve enjoyed growing up.\u00a0 I like being in control of my own life.\u00a0 I was led to believe as a child that growing up would mean accepting a life revolving around drudgery, conforming and submitting to other people\u2019s arbitrary and stupid rules, and coping without complaint with a job that would probably make me miserable.\u00a0 And so at one point, I swore that I would never grow up.\u00a0 Adults as far as I could see were shallow, unreliable, untrustworthy control freaks, and I would never be one. Thankfully, I figured out that it was a big lie.\u00a0 We do have a say in how we live, how we approach the world, and how we treat people, no matter what age we are.\u00a0 Thankfully, I know both old people and young people who are wise and compassionate (and both old and young people who are mean and incompetent).\u00a0 I do think that (most) people gain depth and insight with age.\u00a0 Adulthood does not consist of unquestioning submission to petty cruelty, daily humiliation, and the whim and insecurity of authority figures. Growing up truly isn\u2019t so bad.\u00a0 But we tell kids all the wrong things about it.\u00a0 When we tell them that their needs, desires and dreams don\u2019t matter; that they just shouldn\u2019t try because they won\u2019t be allowed to succeed; that passion, creativity and joy are unrealistic; that they should expect and accept being made miserable by their job and constantly humiliated by other people, that sensitivity is weak, that hatred of injustice is immature\u2026we actually  don\u2019t  prepare them well for the real world, where there is nothing but possibility; change is the only constant; where there are not two or three academic tracks but a hundred thousand ways to succeed at life, and finding the right one for you is not a matter of passively following dictates or scoring the right way on some test, but of being honest with yourself\u2026of thinking the way  you  think, not how someone else wants you to think; and where very often the people who win are the ones who just don\u2019t ever give up. There\u2019s no reason why growing up needs to mean losing one\u2019s sense of openness, wonder, and hope.\u00a0 I pity the people who choose to live as if it does. Furthermore, the people who teach kids to disbelieve in themselves, that indifference and conformity are easier, that cruelty and humiliation of the vulnerable are normal, that other people\u2019s prejudices count more than their own hearts, that this is what maturity means\u2026these people are not disinterested or objective.\u00a0 They have a huge stake in keeping things the way they are.\u00a0 They are dangerous, we should not listen to them, and we should not teach children to listen to or respect them. I don\u2019t want to unfairly malign all old people, but I\u2019ll say this: Dear everyone who tells my generation to \u201cgrow up\u2026\u201d\u00a0 If you didn\u2019t make it look miserable, maybe we would.\u00a0 But we\u2019re interested in a different kind of life and a different kind of world.

{"date": "October 30, 2011", "body": "There\u2019s been one of those viral status updates going around Facebook for a while, and it goes like this: My dislike for the snideness of the status aside, I dared to hoped that it was just some half-baked, unsubstantiated rumor that there were states about to start drug-testing public assistance applicants.\u00a0 Or that some little bill to that effect had been introduced somewhere by some jerkface, but would never make it out of committee. I hoped wrong.\u00a0 This appeared in the  Times  recently: States Adding Drug Test as Hurdle for Welfare First, I reject the central premise that it\u2019s okay to drug-test employees or job applicants.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay in most circumstances.\u00a0 It\u2019s demeaning and it demonstrates a lack of basic respect of one adult for another on the part of an employer, and a presumption of ownership of your body and non-work hours.\u00a0 If you give an employer no reasonable cause to suspect that your leisure activities are having a negative impact on your job performance, then what business of theirs is your private life? \u00a0The Fourth Amendment guarantees freedom from \u201cunreasonable search and seizure.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t understand how applying for a job constitutes a reasonable suspicion of illegal drug use. Likewise, I don\u2019t understand how having fallen on hard times during a major economic collapse and prolonged period of high unemployment constitutes reasonable suspicion of illegal drug use. Secondly, the purpose of requirements like these is not to keep druggies from receiving benefits, or people receiving benefits from buying drugs with your tax dollars.\u00a0 Sorry, it isn\u2019t. \u00a0It\u2019s for states to keep their welfare rolls artificially low by deliberately intimidating eligible people away from applying in the first place. \u00a0It\u2019s to discourage people from applying for benefits for fear of humiliation or mistreatment. Multiply anyone\u2019s basic, rational fear of humiliation or mistreatment in a vulnerable situation by about 15 for people with communication or cognitive disabilities. Leading me into objection #3: \u00a0Applying for assistance to which you are legally entitled should not require surrendering basic human dignity, privacy, and rights over your own body. Anyone who thinks it\u2019s too easy as it is, probably hasn\u2019t done it. And all of this is aside from whether requirements like these would even be cost-effective, saving more money in denied benefits than they\u2019ll cost to implement and run; or whether they\u2019re a good idea even if they do.\u00a0 My strong suspicions are probably not, and probably not.\u00a0 I mean, does anyone really think that someone without adequate food or shelter is super likely to be getting effective treatment for a drug problem? It\u2019s easy to imagine that we have a problem with people who \u201cjust don\u2019t want to work\u201d beating down the door for \u201cyour tax dollars,\u201d because woo, money for nothing! but the reality is that in every state, huge proportions of people who are eligible for public assistance programs do not access them, either from not knowing that they\u2019re eligible, not knowing how and being too embarrassed to find out, fearing retribution in some other way if they bring their situation to the state\u2019s attention (for instance, if some members of their household are in the country illegally), or because the application requirements are onerous or humiliating. Why are the people whining \u201cbut I\u2019m a taxpayer!\u201d always the ones proposing some new and creative way to humiliate the poor? I\u2019m a taxpayer, and here are some of the things  my  tax dollars pay for: a war that I hate on a country that did nothing to us (now mercifully ending).\u00a0 Airport \u201csecurity\u201d measures that have made it impossible for me to fly.\u00a0 Subsidies for the production of the lowest quality food products that are making us fat and sick, for our continued unsustainable reliance on fossil fuels, and for the very same banks and corporations that ruined the economy for the rest of us.\u00a0 And the now decades-long complete failure that is the War on Drugs. So pardon me that I won\u2019t moan about some comparatively small proportion of our tax dollars going to assist with food and living expenses for some of the most vulnerable people in one of the richest countries in the world.\u00a0 There are lots of things wrong in this country; that we actually try to keep people from starving or dying on the streets isn\u2019t one of them. There will always be a minority of people who will abuse  any  system; that\u2019s an inherent risk of a system\u2019s existence (which of course we should try to reasonably minimize), not an excuse for the rest of us to be smug or cruel.

{"date": "May 18, 2011", "body": "This is probably my most belligerent and exasperated blog post ever.\u00a0 Consider yourself forewarned. I got myself into a couple of Facebook arguments recently, in which I\u2019m not sure how much I accomplished, and which served mainly to undermine my regard for humanity.\u00a0 Apparently, after Osama bin Laden\u2019s assassination a couple weeks ago, it was said by some on the political right that information we obtained by \u201charsh interrogation methods,\u201d  allowed us to find him .\u00a0 And I don\u2019t even know enough about the chain of events to judge whether it\u2019s true or not, but it hardly matters to my opinion: if it is true, then it wasn\u2019t worth it.\u00a0 We paid too high a price in our own humanity and national honor.\u00a0 I would rather never have caught him, and let him die holed up in his little fortress, than have stooped to that level, morally, to get to him. And if it isn\u2019t true, then the argument is even more malevolent for being a lie. So I really don\u2019t care whether the practice of torture allowed us to catch bin Laden. But I\u2019ve already learned the immensely frustrating way that apologists for torture aren\u2019t swayed by ethical arguments, or legal ones.\u00a0 There is always some end that justifies the means or legal loophole or illusory ticking time bomb. I\u2019ve only got one more argument: The use of torture isn\u2019t just weak, unconstitutional, un-American, illegal, immoral, and un-Christian. (Did I miss anything?) \u00a0It\u2019s stupid. \u00a0It makes us as a country look brutish, and it makes its supporters look unintelligent. It demonstrates an utter lack of foresight, of historical memory, and of imagination.\u00a0 You\u2019d have to be totally unable to imagine yourself in the place of an innocent torture victim\u2014swept up in a dragnet in the midst of civil unrest, at the mercy of a regime desperate to quash dissent or inconvenient criticism, the resident of an invaded country whose invaders understand neither your language nor culture very well but are convinced that you  must  know something that they want to know.\u00a0 And while it\u2019s true, practically speaking, that you\u2019re probably fairly safe from those circumstances here in America (for the time being, anyway), that\u2019s only by sheer accident of birth.\u00a0 It\u2019s not by any virtue or deserving of your own that you were born here, and not in Afghanistan or Iraq, or a  Canadian citizen of Syrian descent .\u00a0 It\u2019s luck of the draw. Look back\u2014how do we regard countries and regimes which engaged in torture?\u00a0 As evil.\u00a0 They all had high ideals.\u00a0 They all saw their own goals as ultimately good and so justified ignoring the human implications.\u00a0 But it\u2019s their actions that reveal them for what they really were.\u00a0 So how is the future going to look back on us and this sorry decade in our history? Look forward\u2014what we do to the world and to other people comes back to us, one way or another, over and over again.\u00a0 You have to have not been paying very much attention not to have noticed this, or not been alive for very long.\u00a0 Or maybe I\u2019m just better at pattern recognition.\u00a0 But we do reap what we sow.\u00a0 What if America finds itself in some kind of serious danger in the future; what will it do for our chances of finding support or cooperation from other countries if they know that when push comes to shove, we\u2019ll behave just as badly as our enemies? It\u2019s arrogant, and arrogance is always shortsighted and dumb.\u00a0 It pretends that we know more than we can; I\u2019ve heard the attempted excuse that we only torture people who we  know  are bad guys, or who we  know  (feel the sarcasm) have some kind of vital information but don\u2019t want to give it up.\u00a0 But our record doesn\u2019t support this confidence.\u00a0 See story of Maher Arar above, or look at the US justice system\u2019s record of having to release people who turned out to have been wrongfully convicted of major crimes.\u00a0 And those are people who\u2019ve had a lawful trial in which all available and legally admissible evidence was supposed to have been presented.\u00a0 Most of the people we\u2019re interrogating at GITMO have not.\u00a0 We\u2019re seriously not good at realizing what we don\u2019t know. Anyway, sorry to sound belligerent and angry.\u00a0 It\u2019s tiring and it doesn\u2019t make me feel good.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to explain this stuff, and it makes me really sad.

{"date": "February 28, 2013", "body": "So there\u2019s more than one way in which I\u2019m sick of being told that the way I think and experience the world is a blight on humanity that needs to be wiped off the face of the earth. Recently I had a heated Facebook discussion with a friend over this  Times  Room for Debate entry, which not only argues that religion is not a reliable source of morality, but also posits that  atheism shouldn\u2019t seek to replace religion, but to end it \u2026unfortunately employing a host of unfounded generalizations and leaps of illogic. In the interest of both critical thinking and compassion, can we look at what, practically and humanly, ending religion would mean? Various cultures and government regimes, at various times, have tried, hard, to get rid of religion or specific religions.\u00a0 I do not know of an instance in which it has gone well, in which the attempt didn\u2019t involve egregious violence and human rights abuses, or in which the culture in question was left ultimately better off.\u00a0 Or in which it even remotely worked. Beyond whatever personal spiritual significance or comfort they hold to individual believers, religious thought and traditions are the cornerstones of more than a few minority cultures and communities.\u00a0 Who is anyone to say that these cultures have no value, to put oneself in a position of choosing which other people\u2019s communities, community rituals, values, and devotions, should be suppressed and eliminated?\u00a0 If we\u2019re talking about the distinction between religion and morality, what is the morality of depriving a minority population of its rights of self-definition and community traditions and values? Has anyone really thought about how we would prevent people or communities from transmitting their belief systems to their children?\u00a0 If you knock down every church building, how are you going to keep people from teaching their children to pray alone in bed at night?\u00a0 How are you going to prevent me from hearing God in the wind in the trees or in the silences between raindrops?\u00a0 How are you going to prevent people from infusing art and literature with religious thought? And before somebody answers that the solution to ending religious belief is just to teach people better facts, understand this:\u00a0 Religions are not arbitrary sets of false, irrational, or mistaken beliefs, or collections of simple superstitions of cause and effect or magical thinking or carrot/stick promises of punishment or reward for belief or behavior (though they can contain all of those things), which could simply be undone by giving people better information.\u00a0 (That thunder is the result of colliding warm and cool air masses and not the gods having wrestling matches, for instance.\u00a0 I know what causes thunder.\u00a0 That knowledge has never yet prevented the experience of it from being spiritual to me.)\u00a0 They are complex narrative frameworks of symbol, metaphor, and allegory.\u00a0 They are stories and vocabularies for a class of experiences that you can\u2019t simply forbid people from having.\u00a0 You can\u2019t keep someone from having an experience by denying them the language for representing or coping with it. And so unless you\u2019re going to all-out eliminate storytelling, you\u2019re not going to keep people who are so inclined from finding personal significance and guidance in storytelling, or from using a certain type of story\u2013myth, fable, fairytale, whatever you want to call it\u2013to give shape and understandability to their experiences. It\u2019s not fair or intellectually honest to presuppose that those experiences are false or trivial just because you don\u2019t share them.\u00a0 And frankly narcissistic to declare that, because you don\u2019t understand or share it, that mode of perception needs to be eliminated from the realm of human experience and meaning. There  is  bad religion, just as there is bad music and bad writing, but we don\u2019t talk about doing away with those forms of thought and expression just because a lot of it is of poor quality.\u00a0 There is religion that advances truly terrible values; that doesn\u2019t make religion inherently destructive or wrong any more than  Twilight \u2018s existence makes all teen fantasy literature poorly written and abusive relationship-glorifying.\u00a0 It is a medium, not an end, not an ultimate good or evil in itself. In the same way that the overwhelming (and baffling) success of  Twilight  tells us nothing about teen fantasy literature\u2019s  inherent  quality or worth (the genre also includes the  Wrinkle in Time  quartet,  His Dark Materials , and the  Earthsea  cycle), the popularity of anti-intellectual or violent fundamentalism tells us nothing about what religion inherently is or has to be.\u00a0 It is one manifestation. Religion is not morality, we should do a better job of talking about what both of those things are and are not, and I fully agree that religion can\u2019t be said to be the exclusive or superior source of morality.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t make it either worthless, or worthy of eradication.

Type in \u201cparents of autistic children should,\u201d \u201cparents of children with autism should,\u201d \u201cparents of children diagnosed with autism should,\u201d or \u201cparents of autistic children are,\u201d and don\u2019t hit enter.\u00a0 Let autocomplete do its job. And see what the suggestion for that query is. Here\u2019s what I got: (Search results read \u201c things  parents of autistic children should  know \u201c) (Search results read \u201cparents of autistic children are  often aloof themselves \u201c) That is the magnitude of the difference between the assumptions that society makes about you, and the assumptions that society makes about us.\u00a0 That\u2019s privilege. You may feel like autistic people, or other people who don\u2019t know what\u2019s like to parent an autistic child, judge you too harshly or unfairly, make ridiculous accusations, or hold you to impossible double standards.\u00a0 There are times when you  may be  probably are right.\u00a0 That there is a privilege differential does not mean that you can\u2019t be hurt or bullied or wronged on an individual basis by someone of a less privileged group. But society at large doesn\u2019t wish you would just go away and die.\u00a0 Major charities and research organizations don\u2019t actively seek ways to make that happen.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t a federal law entitled the Combating Autism Parents Act. (There  is  a federal law called the Combating Autism Act.\u00a0 Think about what that really means if autism is an inextricable part of your psyche.) Privilege is not about parents vs. autistics.\u00a0 It is not about which group of us has had it harder, or that we could somehow count, add up, and compare the number of strikes against us.\u00a0 It is not about how we feel about you or you feel about us or whatever personal wrongs or misunderstandings we might have done each other. Privilege is about how the world at large sees you, and how the world at large sees us\u2013and people like your kids\u2013and the consequences of those conditions in who gets listened to and how.\u00a0 And people\u2013including parents of autistic people\u2013are way, way more likely to get listened to seriously when they say that the world would be better off if people like us didn\u2019t exist any longer, than when they say that we are acceptable, that we are not a tragedy, that the value of our lives is not best measured in terms of our financial burden on the country\u2026or when parents like you say that you love your kids the way they are and only want their happiness and acceptance. Privilege is the poisoned water that we\u2019re all swimming in; it\u2019s not about laying blame for who did the poisoning.\u00a0 We all get wet; none of us can help but be affected in our views and the way we live our lives and interact with others\u2026that doesn\u2019t make it the fault of the people who aren\u2019t the targets of the poisoning.\u00a0 But we can all help unpoison the water.

{"date": "September 9, 2013", "body": "(This is partly adapted from comments I\u2019ve already made elsewhere.) There\u2019s no graceful way to write an opening paragraph about how another autistic teenager\u2019s parent tried to kill her.\u00a0 Issy Stapleton\u2019s mother Kelli, only days after Issy had come home from a months-long residential treatment program for aggression, drove her to a secluded location, lit two gas grills inside the family van, and tried to kill both Issy and herself by carbon monoxide poisoning. And there\u2019s a lot to say about how wrong it is to automatically tie crimes like this to lack of services or support for parents and care providers, and how common erasure and dehumanization of the disabled child victims in reporting on these crimes is, that other people are saying better than I could. But twice in a very short span of time, I observed another disturbing tendency that I hadn\u2019t in this context before:\u00a0 The rush to assume that the perpetrator parent must have been mentally ill, or that it\u2019s unbelievable that she would have done this if she were in her right mind.\u00a0 Typically before this, I\u2019d heard a lot of the \u201cthey had to have been mentally ill, why else would they do this?\u201d narrative spun out in regards to mass killings or shooting sprees, while the handy explanation for parental murders of disabled children has tended to be \u201cthey were understandably overwhelmed; we need more services.\u201d\u00a0 This might be the first time in my recollection that explanations for the (attempted) murder of a disabled child has turned so quickly to how supposedly the parent could not have been in her \u201cright mind,\u201d or of \u201csound mind\u201d at the time. And it needs to stop. We do not know that Kelli was mentally ill. Maybe she was. Maybe she was in some kind of acute state of crisis.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t know her. But people do horrible, immoral things to other people every damn day, who are not mentally ill. \nPeople DO NOT only do horrible things when they\u2019re mentally ill. \nI was bullied and emotionally abused for YEARS, on a practically daily basis, by people around me who were not mentally ill. The sum of our behavior towards others is composed of much, much more than our mental health status. Values play a role. \nWorldviews play a role. \nAttitudes about children and the disabled play a role. \nAttitudes about what kind of lives are worth living and who has a right to life, play a role. \nWhat people believe and want to believe about themselves play a role. \nBeliefs about where your rights end and others\u2019 begin, play a role. \nBeliefs about other people\u2019s right to, and ownership of, their own lives and bodies play a role. \nLearned assumptions about what society does and does not accept, and who society does and does not value, play a role. \nConvictions and prior choices about how you will and will not live your life play a role. Saying that the obvious takeaway from this incident is that we need mental illness treated better or taken more seriously, serves to \u201cother\u201d people who do horrible things from the mainstream of humanity, to deny that normal, stable, unimpaired people could ever think to do something so awful\u2026 \u2026BUT THEY DO.\u00a0 They do literally all the time.\u00a0 They do every day.\u00a0 They especially do those things to children, the vulnerable, the marginalized, and people who widespread societal attitudes teach that it\u2019s okay to think of as slightly less than fully human or self-aware.\u00a0 Often they even think that they\u2019re doing the right thing, or at least something that\u2019s okay, when they do. And I don\u2019t understand\u2013I just do not understand how so many people have such an easy time denying that normal, healthy people\u2013people like them\u2013are capable of, and DO,  choose  to inflict incredible cruelty on other people,  because they believe they have a right to . Does it require having never been the target yourself?\u00a0 To be able to not know that? I don\u2019t claim to know what was going through Kelli\u2019s head that made this an option to her, that made murder/suicide look like an acceptable way out\u2026other than that I\u2019d say chances are  low  that she believed in the depth of her being that Issy had an absolute and unilateral RIGHT to her own life. Even if it wasn\u2019t the life Kelli wanted for her. \nEven if Kelli thought she\u2019s screwed it up irreparably. \nEven if Issy really was as difficult as she\u2019s been portrayed in her mother\u2019s blog and in the reporting on her attempted murder (and that\u2019s become somewhat doubtful in my mind). \nEven if her problems were truly so serious that Kelli felt she couldn\u2019t be her parent anymore. \nEven if it meant walking away from her. And that\u2019s not a viewpoint that requires a mental illness or emotional crisis to instill\u2013that\u2019s a viewpoint towards autistic, disabled, and challenging children that is very, very commonplace.\u00a0 That they ultimately have far less of a sacrosanct right of ownership of their own lives than their parents or guardians do. People do not only make evil choices when they are abused, in emotional crisis, or lacking resources.\u00a0 And people also live through unimaginably hard things and still actively make choices, in accordance with their beliefs and values, about what they will and won\u2019t do to other people. It is scapegoating and othering of mental illness, to try to remove accountability for the action from the person. \nIt is incredibly dangerous for the mentally ill, to be assumed incapable by default of making safe decisions, having self-awareness, exercising judgment, or considering the rights of others. \nIt is an attempt to pretend that unimpaired people don\u2019t  decide  to do terrible things to other people. \nThat the people we care about, who we identify as being like ourselves, could never, simply, betray our expectations of them, our hopes, what we believed or wanted to believe to be true. But people do that every day, too. Other reading \n Countering: The Hope for Illumination: Issy Deserves Better love explosions: Where was I when Kelli needed help?

{"date": "March 18, 2013", "body": "Another thing that\u2019s happened to me in a debate more than once recently is that somebody tries to belittle me out of the discussion on the grounds that I\u2019m \u201cover-emotional,\u201d and therefore can\u2019t expect to be taken seriously. It took me a long time to learn that almost whenever someone tells you that you\u2019re being \u201ctoo emotional,\u201d what they mean is that you are being perfectly appropriately emotional about something that they simply don\u2019t want to have to acknowledge or think about.\u00a0 That being emotional is not a disqualification from argument.\u00a0 Being emotional is human. Un-emotionality is not the equivalent of having a rational argument, or a reliable indicator that someone does. \u00a0It is not the same as having a grasp of facts or science or of the actual conditions under discussion. Emotionality is not personal attack. Personal attack is personal attack, and while there is such a thing as lashing out gratuitously or needlessly, the sole fact of someone\u2019s being emotional, is not it. That someone is emotional does not mean that they have not, or are not capable, of considering their own arguments logically or rationally. Rationality and emotionality coexist within individuals.\u00a0 They are not a zero-sum quantity; they are not opposing or mutually exclusive characteristics.\u00a0 Or aren\u2019t there people who are both highly rational and highly emotional, as well as people who are both unemotional and deeply irrational? \u00a0Because an opponent displays emotion, does not invalidate the logical grounding of their argument, and isn\u2019t an excuse from addressing the actual substance of their argument.\u00a0 Emotionality itself is neither evidence nor lack of evidence. To be emotional in argument is not the same as committing the logical fallacy of emotional argument, which is to assert that the emotional consequences, or the intensity with which something is felt, is itself evidence of the rightness or wrongness of a position.\u00a0 Ironically, it is those who would invalidate a position based on the emotionality of the arguer, who are  actually  engaging in emotional argument\u2014taking the position that emotionality alone invalidates a position or standing in a debate, and not the validity of the argument itself. ***** What it probably does mean when someone is emotional is that the topic under discussion means a great deal to them.\u00a0 That they\u2019ve been affected personally by a situation, or suffered serious and personal consequences of how a problem is perceived and debated\u2014often by people who do not know the realities of the situation as intimately as they do. It means that somebody cares, that they\u2019re passionate and invested.\u00a0 And none of those traits precludes the ability to think productively about a problem.\u00a0 Otherwise, you claim that no one who is truly, individually affected by a problem has any standing to talk about it and to be heard.\u00a0 That the poor have no place in discussions of poverty, that the disabled have no place in discussions of disability rights, that racial and ethnic minorities have no place discussing racism, and gender/sexual minorities have no place discussing discrimination and bigotry against those identities\u2014if they can\u2019t be perfectly unemotional about it, to an arbitrary standard set by those who are not personally, directly affected by the topic at hand. Does that sound either fair or rational? ***** Do we really believe that any major civil rights or human rights victory, whether in a court of law or in our culture, was accomplished without emotional engagement?\u00a0 The end of South African apartheid, or Jim Crow laws in the US?\u00a0 The fight for women\u2019s suffrage and enfranchisement?\u00a0 The aftermath of the Stonewall riots and of Matthew Shepherd\u2019s murder in terms of LGBT rights and acceptance? \u00a0The disability rights movement for the rights and inclusion of disabled people that preceded the passage of the ADA? As logically grounded as all of those movements have been, they have all involved intense and even disruptive degrees of emotion.\u00a0 And as certain as I am that their very emotional intensity was probably cited as a strike against their credibility at the time\u2026who, now, would dare to say that the emotional investment of their participants should have disqualified their arguments and demands from serious consideration by the majority? It\u2019s an incredibly unfair standard when only those with the luxury of being able to be unemotional about a topic are granted the credibility to discuss it.\u00a0 Particularly regarding the concrete consequences that the way it\u2019s discussed has for people\u2019s actual lives. When someone claims that you are too emotional to be having an argument, it is they who are refusing to engage with the substance of your argument.\u00a0 They are saying that the only recourse they have is to disqualify you from the debate, because they have no actual refutation to what you are saying.\u00a0 And that the grounds on which they can do so are that you care too much, that you mean what you are saying.\u00a0 That the problem at hand is not purely abstract or intellectual to you, but that it means something real.

{"date": "May 2, 2013", "body": "I meant to write this even before I knew that today (er, *cough cough*  yesterday  *cough*) was Blogging Against Disablism Day.\u00a0 Hey, serendipity! I saw this on Facebook, shared on a friend\u2019s page, a few days ago: Dear Emily, I saw your post on Facebook, through a friend\u2019s page.\u00a0 (I\u2019ve removed your photo and last name.) My name\u2019s Emily, too.\u00a0 And, with some notable exceptions, which we\u2019ll get to, I could\u2019ve written large chunks of your story. You\u2019ve done a lot, and you should be proud.\u00a0 But your note left me worried and uneasy for you more than anything else. ***** I never developed normally.\u00a0 But I was misdiagnosed, and there were no IEP\u2019s when I was in school anyway.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if there were special schools in our area, but if there were, from what I\u2019ve heard from friends who were in special ed, nothing leads me to believe that they would\u2019ve been good places.\u00a0 Speech and occupational therapy existed, but it had been decided that I was just shy and stubborn and didn\u2019t want to talk, not that I was in fact having serious language problems.\u00a0 Far from being told that I would never do things like go to school, live by myself, or get a job, it was just assumed that I should be able to do everything that everyone else did, and so no one thought that they needed to teach me anything.\u00a0 I had to just figure it out.\u00a0 It was fly or die.\u00a0 And that much I knew for sure. I read a lot.\u00a0 Thankfully, my first grade teacher was good at teaching writing, and I loved it.\u00a0 I spent a lot of time outside.\u00a0 I learned to drive.\u00a0 I was in gifted programs throughout school.\u00a0 I graduated from high school with a 3.9 GPA.\u00a0 I was captain of my scholar bowl team, copy editor of my senior yearbook, and editor of the school creative writing magazine.\u00a0 I graduated from college with honors and with two degrees.\u00a0 I learned to stage manage and held office in the college debate society.\u00a0 I worked in a campus biology lab, for the local community theater, and then as a barista for several years.\u00a0 I moved to New York with friends, and I work in theater full time now. And for most of my childhood and adolescence I was in a desperate race to prove, both to myself and others, that I could do anything that I needed or wanted to do, because I was so (reasonably, as it turns out) terrified of winding up not being allowed to live my own life. I\u2019m hugely proud of a lot of what I did.\u00a0 But I also did some fairly horrible things to myself, and it took me a long time to realize that the fact that I had to wage that war in the first place was wrong. Recently I was out with a friend, and she said \u201cYour education sounds like hell.\u201d\u00a0 I had to agree.\u00a0 It was, and no one had ever said something like that before, or told me that yes, it was all real.\u00a0 Most people trivialized it or called me spoiled or oversensitive or assumed that because I was smart, it was all easy for me, not that it was war, day in and day out. ***** Sudden noise, visual over-stimulation, and unwanted touch still hurt me.\u00a0 I\u2019m still very sensitive to texture in my food and clothing.\u00a0 I still walk on my toes, I have a strange gait and an accent that people can\u2019t place.\u00a0 Frequently my emotions don\u2019t connect to my language abilities very well and so there are things I can\u2019t communicate.\u00a0 I worked really hard at developing speech, organizational, and motor planning abilities, but they can still be overtaxed, and I can\u2019t go around expecting to be able to function in the ways a non-autistic person would take for granted, or to push my boundaries for extended periods of time. And none of that is a reason I can\u2019t be happy or productive or ambitious.\u00a0 It does require that I honor how I\u2019m actually built and how I\u2019m not. ***** I\u2019m glad that I had people, who I know and who I\u2019ve never met in person, in large ways and small ones, in words and not in words, deliberately, and not so much so, to tell and show me that it was okay to be autistic.\u00a0 That it isn\u2019t wrong.\u00a0 We\u2019re not wrong, to be this way.\u00a0 That we\u2019re okay.\u00a0 That we\u2019re supposed to be here. I\u2019m glad for all the writing and information from other autistic people that helped me put it together that autism is not what we can and can\u2019t do. \u00a0It\u2019s not how we\u2019re defective or inferior.\u00a0 It\u2019s how we\u2019re configured to process information, to feel, perceive, and use language, to learn and grow differently from most people, and there\u2019s nothing wrong about that. I don\u2019t take pride in the fact that a lot of the time, people can\u2019t tell I\u2019m autistic, because all that means is that most people wrongly equate the condition of autism with prejudices about what we\u2019re not supposed to be able to do, or with bigotries about us being incapable of empathy, love, warmth, or friendship. These days, most people know that I\u2019m autistic.\u00a0 Partly because I write and talk about it, but partly because both my ability and willingness to expend energy on suppressing physical signals of autism have gone away.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad that I\u2019d already read some of Amanda Baggs\u2019s and Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg\u2019s writing, so that I knew what was happening when it started happening to me and didn\u2019t panic or blame myself.\u00a0 My brain gives me fewer choices now about how I can and cannot abuse it.\u00a0 I had to start letting myself feel what I feel and need what I need again. And I\u2019m better off.\u00a0 I mean that.\u00a0 I\u2019m healthier.\u00a0 I sleep better.\u00a0 I feel like a whole person again.\u00a0 I feel like a real person, like I fit in the world again.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incomparable experience, to know that you belong in the world exactly the way you are, that no one can take that away from you again. ***** And the other thing?\u00a0 That whether or not anyone can tell you\u2019re autistic has anything at all to do with what kind of opportunities you have, or what kind of respect or affection you get from other people? That\u2019s wrong.\u00a0 That\u2019s bigotry by definition.\u00a0 If you would be worse off if other people were able to tell that you\u2019re autistic\u2013regardless of your actual, individual character traits, qualities, abilities, and intelligence\u2013that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s something wrong with being autistic; it means there\u2019s something very wrong with how other people see us. ***** By all means, we should tell parents to look for and nourish their children\u2019s strengths, and believe in their potential.\u00a0 But not giving up on your children doesn\u2019t mean putting a premium on them having the most apparently normal life possible.\u00a0  Normal  and  good , or  worthwhile , or  satisfying  are not synonyms.\u00a0 My life is hugely different from yours.\u00a0 Other autistic people will have lives that look very different from mine.\u00a0 And that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve failed.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that they or their parents did it all wrong.\u00a0 It means that they\u2019re different, and made the best choices possible for themselves, and that fighting their autism or any other aspect of their true natures into the ground was just not on the priority list when compared to learning things, or spending time with a topic of obsession, or just enjoying life for what it is. What we did\u2013to survive, to grow up, to have our own lives\u2013is not wrong.\u00a0 But a lot of the ways in which we were forced to were. I think we\u2019re capable of making a world where no one\u2019s success or acceptance depends on how well they manage to look like something they\u2019re not.\u00a0 We all deserve better than that, and so do you.

Then in my senior year of high school, I took an acting class.\u00a0 And to give us an easy day one class period after a long week, we got to watch the PBS video recording of the musical  Cats .\u00a0 \u201cOh great,\u201d I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll finally see what  Cats  is really about.\u201d It was a somewhat mind-blowing moment when those actors, in cat suits and gorgeous cat makeup, started to creep onstage.\u00a0 Because let me tell you something, in case you\u2019re not familiar with the show\u2026 Cats , the musical, is really, literally, about cats. It isn\u2019t  not  about cats just because it\u2019s also about life, death, faith, loyalty, and memory.\u00a0 Like  Watership Down  isn\u2019t not about rabbits, just because it\u2019s also about persecution, oppression, idealism, and hope. Likewise, I was told a lot that \u201cAdulthood is not about just doing whatever you want.\u201d\u00a0 As if the freedom and autonomy to live and work in a way that was acceptable to me was some trivial, stupid thing that I was just going to have to get over. I decided I would never be an adult, then.\u00a0 Because if that\u2019s what it meant, that wasn\u2019t something I was capable of. And then I grew up. As it turns out?\u00a0 Adulthood actually is about doing what you really want. Adulthood really means making your own decisions about what kind of life you want to lead, what kind of person you want to be, what kind of mark you want to leave on the world.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not work, that there are no consequences or costs to those decisions, or that you never have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do, or face things you don\u2019t want to face.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t mean that there are no obstacles or hardships. But the decisions themselves, about what you\u2019re doing on this earth and why\u2014those belong to you. So that\u2019s how adulthood is like the musical  Cats . For some reason, people tell you that it\u2019s not really about  exactly what it is  really about.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that the truth is both harder and  better  than anyone wanted you to know.

{"date": "June 12, 2014", "body": "I don\u2019t re-read books very often, except for the handful that I read more or less constantly, just a few pages at a time before bed, infinitely.\u00a0 The ones that I\u2019ve re-read probably dozens of times apiece in the course of just opening them randomly to read three or four pages\u2026while I have a midnight snack before bed, or wait for tea water to boil, or for my computer to finish processing a printing job.\u00a0 Aside from those, I can probably count on one hand the number of books I\u2019ve picked up again and re-read from beginning to end.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to take the time, which sounds horrible.\u00a0 But there are so many new things to read, and so many things I\u2019ll never get to read for the first time as it is. So a book that I choose to re-read has to be one that I both enjoyed that much, but also realize fairly desperately that I need to understand something about it more clearly that I probably didn\u2019t the first time through.\u00a0 Like that something about it rang an inexplicable bell, but through a murky fog. Native Speaker  was like that for me in college, when we first read it in Asian-American Literature class.\u00a0 Having just read Chang-rae Lee\u2019s latest novel, which is so different from this one in my memory, I was driven to take another look at what had attracted me so powerfully to his writing in the first place, in the story of a first-generation Korean-American professional spy. I didn\u2019t actually remember very much of the plot, still in the grip as I was of my memory of Lee\u2019s fluid, lyrical grasp of the experience of being hamstrung by issues of language and culture.\u00a0 But, unlike the protagonist of the novel, Henry Park, without any identifiable reason or claim as to why I had always felt like a foreigner, a non-native speaker\u2014eternally and irreparably. \u00a0It was baffling. It probably had fallen into a category of things I once held as \u201ctoo perfect to let myself get too close to.\u201d Too close to me in some  almost  tangible way to risk letting myself know or love them deeply enough to eventually be betrayed or let down. \u00a0 I\u2019m an inveterate underliner and defacer of hard copies of books; it\u2019s something I have to restrain myself from doing when I read library books, and one of the hardest things for me about reading on a Kindle, is the inability to mark pages and take notes by hand.\u00a0 My copy of  Native Speaker  was already a several-times used book when I bought it, and there are incidental underlinings and bracketings from several semesters\u2019 worth of Asian-American Literature students before me, in red, blue, and green\u2014ink colors I\u2019ve never used.\u00a0 Notes so pedantic even I would never write them\u2026more like the kinds of observations they felt like they were supposed to make, the facts they were anticipating being grilled on in a quiz, rather than actual personal thoughts or resonances about what the text meant to them. Then there are just a few underlinings of passages, in black, in the kind of pen that I used religiously at the time, in what could be a younger, clumsier, slightly more pretentious version of my own handwriting.\u00a0 Lines that obviously struck me acutely at the time, but I didn\u2019t readily remember the lines themselves, or why; they didn\u2019t form the backbone of my memory of what I loved about the book. You don\u2019t tempt fate; you ignore it completely. Our office motto:\u00a0 Cowardice is what you make of it. I am the most prodigal and mundane of historians. It comes flooding back, though. There are few surprises to my refreshed memory of the book itself.\u00a0 It is as gorgeous as I remembered on the subject of linguistic alienation.\u00a0 (I kind of hate to say that I feel like it\u2019s still Lee\u2019s best book, but I do.)\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t remembered how it ended; I hadn\u2019t had the experience yet for it to mean to me what it does now.\u00a0 But more unexpected is this cumulative, accidental little self-portrait of 21-year-old me:\u00a0 what I struggled with, what I was grasping at language for, what life  felt  like, what I knew clearly and just how much I didn\u2019t know at all about myself. (Reading a book set in New York City is also a vastly more rewarding experience when you live there than when you have little personal experience of the place.) More and different passage of text hit me in the heart this time around.\u00a0 I pick up a pen and start underlining again, this time noting the date in the margin. In ten years I could be astonished to remember who I was now. Stranger. \u00a0Follower. \u00a0Traitor. \u00a0Spy.

{"date": "July 23, 2014", "body": "When I was in college in Athens, GA, there was absolutely nothing as good, when you were sick or sad or cold, as a cup of the chicken and dumplings for $3.00 at Five Star Day Cafe. One of the drawbacks of having lived there is that when you\u2019re hit with a craving for Athens food, there\u2019s precious little you can do about it if you are anywhere else in the world. (Buttermilk feta dressing for French fries? Forget it.) I spent several years pining for chicken and dumplings before it hit me that I could probably make them, and that as my roommate Emily #2 is a southerner, there were probably multiple recipes already in our apartment. \u00a0I tried a few. But no dumpling recipe approximated the Five Star Day dumplings, which, being the first and only dumplings I had ever had, represented the quintessential ideal of dumplings in my head. \u00a0And they were doughy and filling\u2026every dumpling from a recipe I tried turned out like some kind of fluffy  bread  on top of the soup, which to my mind was not the point at all. I don\u2019t make it back to Athens often, but at least, I thought, I could get a bowl on my next visit. And then last\u00a0spring, Five Star Day closed, not even a week before a planned visit to a friend, and on top of all kinds of layers of indignation and grief over the loss of that place, I despaired of ever not eating inferior dumplings. Then this week I had\u00a0a frozen chicken carcass I\u2019d been meaning to turn into a summery chicken soup with mushrooms and green beans (I\u2019d actually wanted asparagus, but asparagus is expensive this late in the summer). \u00a0I was looking for a dumpling recipe I\u2019d used before involving an egg, but couldn\u2019t find it. (The recipe, not the egg.) The  Better Homes and Gardens  recipe I vaguely remembered as being inferior, but I had everything in it except for like six herbs that I never actually have on hand (my herb of choice is thyme, and I use it gratuitously,\u00a0in everything). I was in a  fuck measuring  mood so I wasn\u2019t leveling off measuring cups or spoons. \u00a0I was trying to get soup finished and eaten before my call time that night, so I wasn\u2019t being careful at all. So I was flabbergasted when I took a bite, and\u2026that was the flavor of the Five Star Day dumplings. To the best of my recollection, this is what I did: I think part of the secret is in sinus-clearing, heart-warming quantities of pepper. \u00a0The texture is still not the same, but now I have ideas about that, too. \u00a0Anyone who\u2019s had any further success at recreating Five Star Day-style chicken dumplings, hit me up. Addendum:  \u00a0Hopefully obviously, but I can promise no equivalent results. \u00a0It was an accident. \u00a0I more or less did it again yesterday, but tried again this afternoon and the dumplings practically fell apart in the soup. \u00a0Could be the heat? \u00a0(Yes, I\u2019m the kind of person who eats soup when it\u2019s 90 degrees outside.) \u00a0I made the mistake once of refrigerating dumpling dough and that was the biggest soup disaster I\u2019ve ever caused\u2026 Anyway. \u00a0I wish you luck.

{"date": "March 7, 2014", "body": "Less often than I used to have the time for, but still on a fairly regular basis, I wind up in debates with atheists online, when I protest some ultra-generalized hysterical but maddening mischaracterization of Christianity or of religion in general. Just for instance: \u00a0\u201cBut Christianity teaches that women are subordinate to men,\u201d and I blink confusedly and go \u201c\u2026wait, what?\u201d Because mine didn\u2019t, and doesn\u2019t. I ran across this graphic a while back\u2026. [Graphic reads: \u201cI\u2019m an atheist. \u00a0I believe the existence of any deity has never been proven and is unlikely to ever be proven. \u00a0I believe that good can and should be done without worrying whether or not you\u2019ve done sufficient good to be rewarded.\u201d] And the funny thing is, I could just as easily say the exact same thing as a Christian. In fact, most of the time, most of the things that I\u2019m presumed to believe by aggressive atheists, if I identify myself as a Christian, are not only not the case, but  nonsensical  to what I actually believe. And while what I do believe in is more difficult to verbalize, what I actually don\u2019t believe in is easy. * I don\u2019t believe God is a bearded magical guy who lives in the sky. I don\u2019t believe the existence of God has been proven, or is likely to ever be.\u00a0 I\u2019m not even particularly sure that it should be, were it even possible. I do not believe in doing good or being decent to other people only because some authority tells me to, or offers the reward of heaven or threatens the punishment of hell. I probably don\u2019t believe in heaven or hell as literal places at all. I don\u2019t believe that the way you get sent to either one is by sufficiently appeasing or pissing off God, or for believing or not believing in the right religion or the right deities.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe that because I (obviously) think my beliefs are true, that other faith systems\u2019 beliefs must necessarily be false. I don\u2019t believe in a God who particularly enjoys punishing people for normal experiences of being human, or who rejects people for who they are or who they love.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe in a God who demands an unreasonable level of perfection or obedience to an archaic and unchanging system of rules. I don\u2019t believe in a God who demands that we not question or doubt or use our capacity for critical thinking. I don\u2019t all that much believe in what most people think of as magic or the supernatural. I don\u2019t believe the existence or action of God is necessary to explain what simply isn\u2019t understood by science yet.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe that the wonder or beauty of creation or the natural world is dependent on us just not understanding how it works.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe that what we don\u2019t understand yet is particularly strong evidence for the existence of God. I don\u2019t believe that the reality of evolution is in any way antithetical to anything truly important about my religious beliefs.\u00a0 I really, really don\u2019t. (So I don\u2019t believe, either, that the fact that neurological capacity for spiritual experiences can be shown to have evolved, in any way undermines or contradicts the authenticity or significance of that experience.) I don\u2019t believe the Bible is the inerrant word of God.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe the Bible was written by anyone but people, who had historical and cultural contexts, histories, emotional lives, and agendas of their own. I don\u2019t believe that morality can only originate in religion. I don\u2019t rely on a pastor to tell me what to do or how to think. I don\u2019t need to believe in a heaven or an afterlife to escape fear of death.\u00a0 (Which is not a particularly effective strategy anyway\u2014I still fear death.) I don\u2019t need to believe in an all-powerful protector in order to not fear life. * So let\u2019s go ahead and get past this part of the debate:\u00a0 these are the things I really don\u2019t believe. \u00a0If those are the only terms in which someone else can understand what religion is or what its significance might be to a person or to a culture, that\u2019s not my fault or a weakness in my belief system. \u00a0I am not under any obligation to say \u201cOh, you\u2019re right, of course, my faith system is what you say it is regardless of how little you understand about the actual experience of it.\u201d I\u2019m not trying to convert anyone, to convince you to believe anything you have no genuine inclination to.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not arguing that religion shouldn\u2019t be criticized when it exhibits real problems or when real harm is done in its name or under its influence, but relying on one-dimensional caricature to do that, insisting that religious belief by definition consists of things that for a  lot  of people it really doesn\u2019t, is as unfair as it is unhelpful. \u201c Describe the God you\u2019ve rejected. \u00a0Describe the God you don\u2019t believe in. \u00a0Maybe I don\u2019t believe that God either. \u201d \u2014Timothy Keller ", "outgoing_links": ["https://chavisory.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/im-an-atheist.jpg"], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/this-i-dont-believe/", "title": "This I don\u2019t\u00a0believe"},

For Autistics Speaking Day this year, I want to say something unequivocally.\u00a0 And it\u2019s incredibly rare that I feel qualified to just tell other people what they should do, but\u2014if you are an autism parent\u2014 Please tell your kids that they\u2019re autistic. Or have autism.\u00a0 Or Asperger\u2019s Syndrome.\u00a0 Or are on the spectrum.\u00a0 Whatever.\u00a0 They can make their own choices about language preference later. I don\u2019t know your kid, so I don\u2019t know when the right time or the right age is, or whether the best way is to have a talk and tell them all at once; or slowly, in trickles of information over time; or to simply always talk about it at home so they grow up always knowing. However you tell them, just tell them the truth.\u00a0 It\u2019s worth it. 1. They already know that they\u2019re different.\u00a0 You can\u2019t keep them from knowing they\u2019re different by not telling them. I knew when I was 3 years old. \u00a0I could tell things were harder for me than they were for other kids.\u00a0 I could tell when I didn\u2019t understand things that other people did (and when they couldn\u2019t understand things that I did), that other people didn\u2019t have as hard of a time explaining what they needed and getting it, that I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to do when other people expected me to, that I was expected to know things I\u2019d never been told.\u00a0 That I didn\u2019t know how to dress, that I didn\u2019t get invited to parties.\u00a0 That things hurt my ears, that being touched felt wrong, that I was ignored by every single girl in my 5 th -grade class except one for the entire year. We have very good pattern recognition.\u00a0 It\u2019s very hard  not  to notice, actually, when every single description of the world you\u2019re given\u2026doesn\u2019t quite match up with your perception. And being told by adults that I was wrong, that I was imagining it, didn\u2019t make me wrong about what was happening; it made me not trust adults. 2. They deserve to know.\u00a0 They are entitled to accurate information about themselves. If you had a kid who was gay or transgender, would you want or expect them to go the rest of their lives without the self-knowledge and self-acceptance involved in claiming those labels?\u00a0 Or without the ability to seek out information, history, appropriate health care, emotional support, and community with others if they wanted it?\u00a0 Why should those things be denied to an autistic kid? (I wrote that and then realized that of course there are parents who would deny those things to an LGBTQ child.\u00a0 But I hope you wouldn\u2019t.) That someone is autistic is information about  their  brain, about  their  body, about  their  life, and  they  are the rightful owners of that information. Most people I know who either found out their diagnosis, or received a correct diagnosis as a teenager or adult, were relieved to have the knowledge, but resentful of their parents having kept it from them.\u00a0 I know people who are glad not to have been  diagnosed  as a child\u2014mostly because of the awful things it was considered acceptable to do to autistic kids when we were growing up, not because we didn\u2019t crave the knowledge\u2014but  no one  who was diagnosed and is thankful that the information was withheld.\u00a0 Most people I\u2019ve known have been relieved to know that it wasn\u2019t just their fault that they couldn\u2019t just be like everyone else.\u00a0 To find out that there were other people with similar challenges who were okay. 3. Yes, labels can carry stigma.\u00a0   But it\u2019s the stigma that\u2019s wrong, not the fact that a word exists to describe some facet of how your brain works. Not knowing the word \u201cautistic\u201d will not make your child not autistic, and it will not protect them from the mistreatment that frequently follows being autistic.\u00a0 I carried no label of a disability for most of my life, yet most of the same things happened to me as to people who did. If what you really fear is that your child will be marginalized or mistreated for being autistic, then fight the marginalization, misinformation, bigotry, and dehumanizing stereotypes with us. The burden of a stigmatized identity or disability label is difficult, but the burden of a void of missing knowledge about yourself, is much worse. 4. Knowing how to describe why things are harder for you is not \u201cusing it as an excuse.\u201d Knowing why certain things are hard for you (and other things are easier) is vital to good decision-making about how to use the resources of time, energy, and cognitive bandwidth that you have.\u00a0 And also to constructive thinking about how to come up with workarounds and good strategies for things that you  want  to learn to do. That I didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t tell anyone why things were so hard for me, did not make them less hard.\u00a0 It did not make me magically able to just do things the way everyone else did.\u00a0 It made me a lot more anxious, guilty, resentful, and frightened to ever put myself in a situation in which I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to do what was expected of me. Being able to recognize what\u2019s a productive use of your internal resources, and what isn\u2019t, is a vital skill when you\u2019re seeking to live sustainably with a disability or major cognitive difference.\u00a0 Neurological boundaries don\u2019t disappear because you lack the words to describe them.\u00a0 Disregarding or pushing past those boundaries is a useful thing to be able to do sometimes, but having to do it constantly and relentlessly is no way to build a life. 5. Having community is pretty much the best thing. There\u2019s a lot about being autistic that most professionals, teachers, or therapists don\u2019t know anything about.\u00a0 Or even if they do, they  can\u2019t  know what the internal, subjective experience is.\u00a0 So practically the only way to get perspective or help from someone who knows exactly what you\u2019re talking about, is to talk to other autistic people.\u00a0 From certain sensory, cognitive, and emotional experiences; making self-care skills manageable; organizational strategies; making your habitat friendly and interdependent living; useful use of scripted language; overload, shutdowns; the reality of midlife breakdowns and loss of abilities later in life (because yes, this can happen at any time in our lives, not just early childhood); to differences in how we experience time, memory, sexuality and gender\u2026to just being able to share obsessions and pleasures like cats and trains and things lined up in rows with mutual passion.\u00a0 It is really, really good to be able to talk to other autistic people about things. Sometimes it\u2019s just nice to talk to someone who talks or thinks like you. I also have autistic friends who aren\u2019t part of the online/advocacy communities, and that\u2019s fine. \u00a0Some people decide they don\u2019t need or want that community in the same way, and that\u2019s  their decision  to make.\u00a0 But they can\u2019t make an informed decision if they don\u2019t have the relevant information. 6. They will figure it out anyway. We have the internet, and because autistic people write about our lives all the time, in blogs and books and poetry and song, they will stumble across something that accurately describes what their life feels like in a way that nothing else ever has. At somewhere between 1% and 2% of the population, we are everywhere, and they\u2019ll meet one of us, and someone will tell them the truth. We are characters in books, movies, plays, and popular television shows.\u00a0 There are more and more chances that they will see themselves accurately represented, and put it together. I had to figure it out myself (though not without help, but that\u2019s another story).\u00a0 It took me 28 years, and it consumed me utterly.\u00a0 I could never get on with living my life in certain ways until I knew.\u00a0 I will probably spend the rest of my life trying to describe, trying to tell the truth, about what exactly that lack of knowledge did to me.\u00a0 I\u2019m 31 now and I\u2019m not even close. Walking down the street and feeling like the world makes sense is a feeling I\u2019m still getting used to. Harder to express how that break becomes healed, a bone once fractured, now whole, but different from the bone never broken.\u00a0 And harder still to follow the path between the two . (Eli Clare) \u2026and when they do figure it out, and realize that you knew and withheld the information, both of you will have to deal with that breach of trust. I\u2019m thankful, at least, that my parents genuinely didn\u2019t know, that they were actually misinformed and clueless, that even if I still think they were somewhat in denial, they weren\u2019t lying to me.\u00a0 If they had been, and I had ever learned that they\u2019d deliberately denied the information to me, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d ever forgive them for that. And while I\u2019m as proud of this as anything I\u2019ve ever done, it\u2019s not something I would put someone through if I could help it.\u00a0 You can help it. \u00a0There\u2019s so much more of life to live than having to wrench the most basic facts about yourself out of the fabric of the universe.

{"date": "January 25, 2014", "body": "I was listening to WNYC on the radio recently, as is my habit in the mornings\u2014to a segment on  proposed minimum wage increases in New Jersey .\u00a0 Part of the argument centered on how to balance the original premise of the minimum wage\u2014that a single full-time worker should be able to afford a home and support a family\u2014with projected costs to business and job creation of an increase. \u00a0The host made a suggestion which I\u2019ve heard before\u2014that a possible compromise might be to institute a graduated or split minimum wage, allowing teenagers to be paid a lower minimum wage than full adults or single parents. This proposal always viscerally disturbs me. \u00a0It\u2019s a dangerous message to send to teenagers and young workers, that for no other reason than their age\u2014not the quality of their work\u2014their work is less valuable and less respected. Aside from that we should be increasing, not decreasing, opportunities for teenagers and young adults to build assets and economic stability, it is an invitation to job and wage discrimination on practically every level. What exactly is to keep minimum wage employers from hiring only people they know they can pay a sub-minimum wage?\u00a0 This has every potentiality to backfire and hurt young single parents more, not less. The rationale behind this is also the exact same reasoning which was once commonly used to justify wage discrimination against women\u2014that because men were more often supporting families on a single salary than women, women just didn\u2019t need to be paid as much as men.\u00a0 Or, if we\u2019re going to say that teenagers who are parents would be paid a higher wage than teenagers who aren\u2019t, then we\u2019re punishing teenagers who don\u2019t have children before they\u2019re ready for that choice.\u00a0 If the goal is to convince kids not to have children themselves too young, how can we then justify underpaying them for upholding that ideal? And if we\u2019re trying to instill in teenagers the conviction that higher education is the way out of being stuck in minimum wage jobs for life, how hypocritical is it to then hobble their every effort to be able to afford to get that education? It\u2019s engaging in dangerously utopian thinking to presume that working teenagers are only working for movie and pizza money because their parents are sufficiently providing for all of their actual needs\u2014and not that a teenager\u2019s income is quite possibly significantly helping to support their family, that they\u2019re helping to keep younger siblings fed, or are actually supplying most of their own basic needs and transportation costs because their parents can\u2019t.\u00a0 Or that they\u2019re not a foster kid who\u2019s going to be out on their own the day they turn 18 and are going to need work history and assets in order to not wind up homeless.\u00a0 Or that they know that their parents are not going to be able to help them pay for college and are trying to minimize their future student loan debt. Maybe they just want to be able to put down a security deposit on an apartment and get out on their own sooner rather than later. It\u2019s reinforcing this cycle wherein we infantilize teenagers and young adults by falsely constraining their choices and opportunity, by arbitrarily and prejudicially restricting their autonomy, and then blaming them for the results when they can\u2019t afford to start independent lives.\u00a0 At the same time as we ponder whether young adults\u2019 failure to buy homes, get married, build savings, and have children means that they\u2019re cognitively incomplete, or \u201cemerging\u201d adults, rather than that they can\u2019t afford to meet those expectations, we talk openly of further economically disenfranchising them. What do we even expect if we won\u2019t afford them the decency of the  absolute minimum  that we\u2019d expect anyone else to consider an economically fair shot?\u00a0 What are we telling them when we say that they, and their labor, are worth less than that? The minimum wage should actually be that\u2013the  actual   minimum  that we consider fair compensation for hourly labor, no matter who you are.

{"date": "May 30, 2014", "body": "I\u2019m was in the office at work with my boss and a coworker, and I do not even remember how the topic of conversation has turned to public schooling vs. homeschooling.\u00a0 But it has.\u00a0 My coworker starts in on an anecdote, and I have a bad, bad feeling about where this is going. \u201cWe had a homeschooled girl in my high school chemistry class.\u00a0 She was like 12.\u00a0 She was just so far ahead.\u201d (Maybe not.\u00a0 Sharp intake of breath.\u00a0 Slightly too-long pause.) \u201cBut she was so awkward.\u00a0 And it made the whole class awkward, and it was just awkward to have her there.\u201d And here we are.\u00a0 At the moment in which, prior to this, I had actually thought that my acceptance in this place, to these people, wasn\u2019t based on me passing myself off as the right kind of person instead of the wrong kind. The awkward kind. But it was. \u00a0And I am.\u00a0 She hadn\u2019t realized, in the way that people usually don\u2019t stop to think whether it\u2019s possible that the people they\u2019re about to mock or denigrate are actually the people they\u2019re talking to. Oops.\u00a0 Fuck. And I don\u2019t want to start a really nasty fight right then in front of my boss, so I say something moderate and reasonable-sounding about how what really matters is not whether a kid is homeschooled or not, but whether they\u2019ve been isolated or allowed to have outside social opportunities.\u00a0 How some homeschooling families actually just isolate their kids, and that\u2019s wrong, but as long as they\u2019re giving their kids chances to interact with other groups\u2026choir, scouting, church groups, music lessons, art classes\u2026 \u2026instead of \u201cFuck you very much.\u201d And I didn\u2019t say what I actually should have, either\u2026in the interest of starting my shift on time and also\u2026not having an  awkward  argument in my boss\u2019s office. It\u2019s not a sin to be awkward. Can we stop talking about it like it is? A 12-year-old girl hasn\u2019t done anything to you by being awkward, or by taking advantage of her legal right to a free and appropriate public education while awkward. While we\u2019re at it, can we also stop using \u201cawkward\u201d as a euphemism for incompetent, irritating, immature, overbearing, invasive, inappropriate, or probably autistic but we can\u2019t be seen as scorning someone for being actually disabled so we\u2019re gonna say they\u2019re \u201cawkward\u201d which is obviously just a personal failing that\u2019s fine to use an excuse for their ostracism? Here\u2019s another newsflash:\u00a0 I know a lot of people who in fact went through 13 years of mainstream public schooling, who are still awkward people.\u00a0 Because it actually isn\u2019t being confined in a cell-block building with a limited number of people, exactly your own age, for over a decade, isolated from your community and adult company, and subjected to sufficient peer pressure to just  stop being different , that makes you non-awkward.\u00a0 It\u2019s already possessing a manner of speech, body language, common interests, and gender presentation that\u2019s consistent with those of the vast majority of other people.\u00a0 It\u2019s having a native language of social engagement that is the same as most people around you. I served my full term in the public school system, I went to the second-largest high school in my state, and I followed that with four years at one of this country\u2019s most regularly top-ranked party schools. I am still an awkward person. \u00a0And if you thought I wasn\u2019t, you just haven\u2019t seen me in the right\u2014or the wrong\u2014situation. \u00a0But I guarantee you it wasn\u2019t lack of ridicule or social pressure to be anything other than what I was that caused this. It also isn\u2019t being allowed to do your academic work outside of a classroom setting, at a pace that works for you, that makes you awkward, because plenty of non-awkward people do that. I\u2019d really like people to consider, before the next time they scorn a kid for being awkward, or homeschooling or unconventional schooling for making kids awkward, that they are likely committing a fundamental chicken/egg fallacy. A homeschooled kid probably isn\u2019t awkward because they were homeschooled. They are probably homeschooled because they are awkward. Because they have probably already been forced out of the school system by bullying and abuse or discrimination, or because the school couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t meet their academic needs. (Being academically precocious: also not a sin.) I mean, mandatory, universal public school attendance wasn\u2019t even a widespread thing in this country until the early-mid 20 th  century.\u00a0 Were we really just a nation of incredibly awkward people until the 1920\u2019s or so? Even if it really were homeschooling that caused awkwardness, I would so much rather a child of mine be awkward than a whole lot of other things that are nowhere near as socially stigmatized as awkwardness:\u00a0 Mean, bigoted, superficial, callous, snide and scornful towards people different from or more vulnerable than themselves.

{"date": "April 2, 2014", "body": "To Autism Speaks and its supporters, for Autism Acceptance Day~ There\u2019s a conversation that plays out over and over again, in the wake of the release of a PSA, press release, blog post, or video, painting autism in conventionally negative and dehumanizing terms. Autistic people object that those descriptions do not fairly reflect the realities or value of our lives.\u00a0 That while, yes, often it is hard, that\u2019s not all our lives are. \u00a0That characterizations of \u201cepidemic,\u201d \u201ctsunami,\u201d or \u201cnational catastrophe\u201d devalue our lives, and that  we  suffer when attacks on \u201cautism\u201d fall on  us .\u00a0 Which they do, always, because autism is not separable from us.\u00a0 That we might wish some things were easier, but those issues need to be addressed with the complexity and nuance that they truly require to understand. And invariably, someone will make the excuse that such rhetoric is necessary to raise  awareness , to make the public feel a sense of urgency, to keep people interested, to get lawmakers invested in these issues, to raise money. \u201cBut how does that fit on a billboard?\u00a0 How do you put that into a one-line slogan?\u00a0 Or a 30-second PSA?\u201d Guess what:\u00a0 That is not our problem to solve.\u00a0 It is not our fault, our job, or our responsibility.\u00a0 It is not an excuse for you to malign our humanity and our worth. It is not okay to demonize us and call our existence an epidemic, a tragedy, and a national disaster because that\u2019s easier to fit on a billboard. It\u2019s not okay to instigate pity and fear against us because that\u2019s easier than asking people to work to understand us more deeply. It is morally and intellectually lazy, is what it is.\u00a0  Since when does something being easier make it right or okay? \u00a0 That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying.\u00a0 That it\u2019s easier on you to talk about our lives this way, so you get to, and our objections are meaningless. Only\u2026many, many autistic people have made themselves very clear about how awareness campaigns like this have done us more harm than good. We understand that therapies cost money, that families need insurance coverage, that parents deserve respite, and that school systems need financing for the support services they\u2019re required to provide. But the beliefs about us that are inculcated\u2014in the general public, in our family members, in our educators and therapists\u2014by these kinds of ad campaigns, negatively impact the way we are actually treated by the medical establishment and in schools and therapy programs and by the people closest to us.\u00a0 You don\u2019t make sure a vulnerable population gets appropriate help and support by spreading vicious falsehoods about their condition, presenting them as objects of pity rather than full participants in their own lives, or disparaging their input on the actual effects of what you claim to be doing on their behalf. The words you use about us have real-life consequences for us, and they\u2019re not the ones you claim to intend. This rationalization is arguably even more dehumanizing than the objectionable rhetoric itself\u2014that we and the fullness of our lives are reducible to props for your awareness campaigns.\u00a0 That our objections to misrepresentations of us don\u2019t matter because they\u2019re inconvenient to your ability to come up with billboard slogans.\u00a0 That next to you being able to raise money in our name, the fact that the manner in which you\u2019re doing so  actually hurts us , is of no consequence.\u00a0 That our ability to be treated like real, whole, present, self-aware, not stolen or missing or disappeared people is far less important than you having an easy time coming up with a catchy awareness campaign. It is not our responsibility to be a sound byte for your convenience.\u00a0 It is not our job to be the story the public wants to hear.\u00a0 It\u2019s not your kid\u2019s job. I won\u2019t have to wait long for objections of  \u201dBut the low-functioning!\u00a0 But the non-verbal!\u00a0 But people who don\u2019t have your abilities!\u201d IT\u2019S NOT THEIR JOB, EITHER.\u00a0 They are  people ; they are not storytelling devices, set dressing, blank slates or empty shells.\u00a0 They have thoughts about their own lives; just because you don\u2019t know what they are, does not give you the right to use them like that. \u00a0 Autistic people talk and write a lot about our struggles.\u00a0 Parents and families who are with us about acceptance and respect, talk openly and movingly about their challenges and their autistic kids\u2019 obstacles.\u00a0 We support each other in the hard things as well as the joyful.\u00a0 You  can  do that without devaluing our lives or resorting to antiscientific, eugenicist alarmism.\u00a0 The bloggers, activists, parents, and families of the neurodiversity community prove it every day. Here\u2019s what I think:\u00a0 If you can\u2019t figure out how to portray our issues and make a compassionate case for our support needs, succinctly and without resorting to dehumanizing us or devaluing our lives, then autistic people are not the ones who lack creativity, resourcefulness, communicative abilities, or empathy. And just because I can\u2019t necessarily give you a pat, convenient answer right now, on the spot, of how to best represent neurodiversity and autism acceptance in an easy-to-swallow PR campaign, does not make it an unsolvable problem that excuses your continued public relations war against us. \u00a0I\u2019m not in public relations or marketing because that genre of writing is not my gift.\u00a0 But it is somebody\u2019s.\u00a0 In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure this is something people actually go to college and grad school to learn how to do well\u2014to represent the message you wish to convey to the public cleverly and concisely.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty sure that businesses routinely actually hire and pay large salaries to people who do this professionally.\u00a0 I\u2019d be willing to bet that you already do so, in order to craft the message you have so successfully and insidiously. Better messages  have   been   crafted  in social media campaigns, for the purpose of countering your own, by autistic people, neurodiversity bloggers, and parents with  no budget, training, or free time. \u00a0 Who are disabled, mentally ill, in chronic pain, who work full-time, who are in college or grad school, who are raising high-needs disabled children, or some combination of all of the above. \u00a0 Other   organizations  don\u2019t seem to have a problem, either. So you can do better. The problem is not that the right message is too hard a story to sell; the problem is that the message you actually believe and wish to propagate is wrong.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that you couldn\u2019t do the right thing if you put your minds\u2014and voluminous advertising budget\u2014to it; it\u2019s that you don\u2019t really want to because you don\u2019t believe in it. You have the budget to be making media campaigns like this, if that\u2019s what you wanted.\u00a0 You have the resources to be spreading awareness like this: It\u2019s not as if the truth isn\u2019t dramatic or interesting enough:\u00a0 That we have always existed, but only in recent decades provoked this intensity of mingled fascination and alarm.\u00a0 That our society has quietly and systematically marginalized and excluded us on the basis of our cognitive, movement, and communication differences for centuries, pushing us to survive on the outskirts of society. That with the understanding of these traits as neurologically-based rather than the result of kidnapping by fairies, the stigma and scapegoating has actually\u00a0focused and intensified. That generations of us have been written off as uneducable and incapable of communication, disappeared and institutionalized. That it is still happening even though professionals and policy-makers have had every opportunity to know better by now. \u00a0That we are abused and bullied at devastating rates. That under such hostile circumstances, some of us have been the foremost geniuses of science, math, music, and art.\u00a0 We have made some of the most revolutionarily important contributions to humanity in physics, technology, and engineering. We keep surviving, keep creating, keep loving, keep standing up for each other, keep believing we are actually worthy of a future.\u00a0 We remain  obsessively joyful . That we\u2019ve been so misunderstood and misinterpreted that most popular and professional characterizations of us are practically the opposite of the truth.\u00a0\u00a0 That it is routine and accepted for our families to be taught to fear and  hate  the way we are.\u00a0 That you do not even begin to understand what you would rob the world of, to have it bereft of people like us. I think that\u2019s a pretty fascinating story, and urgent and important. \u00a0I know it\u2019s more astonishing to me than practically anything you could make up. \u00a0It\u2019s just one that requires a bit more self-reflection and active listening from your target audience than the easier one of rallying to defeat a common enemy. As to how it fits on a billboard?\u00a0 I don\u2019t care. If you are listening to our stories, if your intentions towards us are truly good, stop making us the targets of your laziness and lack of creativity. The way we are is not the enemy.

{"date": "May 25, 2013", "body": "I was working on a film shoot a couple weeks ago, and standing around on a break one day, somehow I got to talking with our costume designer and the 12-year-old member of our cast about how much better Nickelodeon shows were in my childhood than they are now.\u00a0 While I was a little embarrassed to have almost no idea what is even on Nickelodeon these days, he was a connoisseur of vintage Nickelodeon, and we wound up talking about shows like  Clarissa Explains It All ,  Doug ,  Rugrats ,  Salute Your Shorts ,  Are You Afraid of the Dark? ,  You Can\u2019t Do That On Television , and  The Adventures of Pete and Pete . And one of the things we realized, in trying to figure out why those shows were so cool, and felt so good to watch, even though they were in some ways ridiculously wholesome, was that they managed to make you feel like they were always firmly on your side as a kid. Although almost wholly non-objectionable in any way, they weren\u2019t family shows.\u00a0 They were kids\u2019 shows.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t so much trying to teach any lessons, or make your parents happy, as they were dealing with the world the way that kids actually have to deal with the world, with all of its petty injustice, anxiety, and ludicrousness.\u00a0 There was lightness in the situations, but there wasn\u2019t trivialization or mockery of kids\u2019 problems.\u00a0 Adults were not always ultimately right, or even good or well-intentioned like they were in other network family shows. And as I thought more about it, I realized something else that day.\u00a0 Those shows weren\u2019t just on the side of kids\u2026they were practically always, as far as I can remember, on the side of vulnerable kids, underdogs, and oddballs. Compare, for instance, the way Sponge is portrayed in  Salute Your Shorts  compared to Screech in  Saved By The Bell .\u00a0 When Sponge is called names and pushed around and valued only for his huge memory for random facts, it is actually wrong.\u00a0 Or Sam the weird neighbor in  Clarissa  and Skeeter the weird sidekick in  Doug  compared to Kimmy the weird neighbor in  Full House .\u00a0 The bullies and jerks were the bad guys in those shows, and while you\u2019re still supposed to have compassion for those characters in their own way, they are the actual  antagonists\u00a0 of those worlds and you are not supposed to approve of their behavior and join in laughing at their victims.\u00a0 There weren\u2019t characters who were  there to be ridiculed. Heroes and protagonists of Nickelodeon shows felt dorky and inferior\u2026and it was okay. And I was thinking about it some more as I was going through an old journal this week (which I almost never do), and re-reading an entry about realizing that the things I\u2019ve tended to really love\u2013music or books or TV shows\u2013were things that made me feel like a person.\u00a0 Things that I liked okay were things that at least  let  me feel like a person. Things that I could never manage to like much at all, even when everyone else around me loved them, tended to leave me feeling like I couldn\u2019t laugh at the characters I was supposed to be laughing at. Nickelodeon shows never did that.\u00a0 And while I was warned all too often that the amount of TV I watched as a kid was going to rot my brain, I\u2019m starting to suspect that the more subtle lessons of those shows may actually have been among the most quietly but deeply impactful sources of strength to follow me into adulthood. (And then there was  this .\u00a0 How many things in life have you really been more afraid of than that?\u00a0 The top comment reads \u201cThis is why we 90\u2019s kids are so intact\u201d\u2026and I think she may not be wrong.)

{"date": "February 11, 2014", "body": "{Moving image depicts Dr. Christina Yang from the show  Grey\u2019s Anatomy , gesturing dramatically and proclaiming \u201cOh, screw beautiful, I\u2019m brilliant! \u00a0You wanna appease me, compliment my brain!\u201d} The title of this might be me at my most inarticulate, but I\u2019ve got some complex emotional history here. I\u2019ve see this screencap from  Grey\u2019s Anatomy  flying around Tumblr a lot lately, with kind of conflicted feelings. And I want to cheer for it.\u00a0 I want to agree with Christina in this scene.\u00a0 I want to clap.\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 I can\u2019t.\u00a0 My heart sinks a little instead. When I was growing up, I was over-appreciated for my brain\u2014or what people wanted out of it\u2014and not much else. And I get why, for a lot of women, so much importance has been placed on physical beauty and a very narrow definition of sexual desirability by culture and media that to be told you\u2019re beautiful can be diminishing, or a denial of any other aspect of personhood as vital or valuable in a woman. But another kind of woman got written off early and entirely in the department of physical desirability, and got told intensely and persistently that our intellect was the only valuable thing about us. And that can be just as objectifying as the inverse.\u00a0 To be treated as if your body, your sexuality, is a mistake, is off limits from being considered an asset or a real and true aspect of our personhood or something we should even like about ourselves. Because my physical experience of the world is as totally intrinsic to the kind of person I\u2019ve become as my intelligence is. There\u2019s not really any aspect or component of a person of which it\u2019s alright to say, \u201cYou may be valued for this alone.\u00a0 This is all of you that matters.\u201d So yeah, I can understand the frustration of other women at being called beautiful as the highest possible compliment, when though that may be what society values, it\u2019s superficial to what they see as their true selves. That\u2019s exactly how I feel about being called \u201csmart.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s the only way I was ever allowed to be valuable or worthwhile, but it\u2019s almost completely superficial to what I actually value most about myself. When I was growing up, it was my intelligence that was made a commodity to other people.\u00a0 And that was all of me that mattered. For a long time, I was resentful that intellect and insight were not valued or celebrated anywhere near as much as superficial beauty or things like athletic talent\u2014by society, by the media, by the school system\u2014because it was all I had going for me. And then a time came when I was so, so sick of hearing how smart I was. In retrospect, a lot of my academic accomplishments feel like stupid human tricks, compared to the qualities that I\u2019m really proud of nurturing. And yes, I was actually proud of them, too, and wanted recognition for them.\u00a0 But on some level even at the time, I knew that they were just the game I could play.\u00a0 They were the game I could win, the hoops I could jump through. In an end-of-the-year Thespian troupe party my senior year of high school, we had a ritual where the whole troupe sat in a circle, and we were supposed to go around one by one, and use one word to describe each one of our classmates. I forbade anyone to say I was smart.\u00a0 I frakking knew that already, and getting told what you already knew wasn\u2019t the point of the exercise.\u00a0 I knew that  ad nauseum .\u00a0 Tell me  anything  else.\u00a0 Prove you know me better than that.\u00a0 Tell me that something about  me  matters to you. People said it anyway. (Our teacher, blessedly, did not.) There\u2019s also this thing that happens where, once someone has gotten the impression that I\u2019m  so intelligent , expects me to not have a soul, a conscience, a sense of fairness, or a heart, and winds up really confused and disappointed when I do. Other people\u2019s perception of my intelligence has been over-leveraged as a survival tactic and bargaining chip for autonomy and personhood, for me to really be able to treasure it much for myself anymore. *** I value my physical beauty now, idiosyncratic though it may be.\u00a0 I love finally feeling at home in my body and the way it moves.\u00a0 That\u2019s a wondrous thing to me.\u00a0 I love being made to feel beautiful by someone who really means it about the way that I really am. I like looking in the mirror and liking what I see. And I won\u2019t feel that it\u2019s some kind of a betrayal of womanhood to actually value that about myself. \u00a0After so many years of having that ability discouraged and confounded in so many ways, I  get  to have that. *** Just as valuation of a particular standard of beauty above all other female attributes both devalues girls who can\u2019t meet that standard, and devalues everything else about girls who do\u2026how is valuation of intelligence above any other personal attribute not likely to devalue girls who don\u2019t meet some conventional, one-dimensional standard of that? I wish we could just stop hacking people up into pieces that are valuable and not valuable, acceptable and not acceptable. I fear that this trading valuation of physical beauty for intelligence, really just winds up telling some girls \u201cYou do not count in this way.\u00a0 Your physical experience of the world and your sexuality aren\u2019t really things that deserve to be taken into account, because you\u2019re a brain, and that\u2019s what matters about you.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["https://chavisory.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/complimentmybrain.gif"], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/i-have-really-complicated-feelings-about-exhortations-to-tell-girls-theyre-smart-instead-of-beautiful-and-also-why-im-not-a-ravenclaw/", "title": "I have really complicated feelings about exhortations to tell girls they\u2019re smart instead of beautiful, and also why I\u2019m not a\u00a0Ravenclaw"},

{"date": "May 31, 2013", "body": "So the chancellor of the University System of Georgia, Hank Huckaby, caused a slight kerkuffle among my alumni community this past week,  when he said , in reference to the fact that apparently large numbers of jobs in Georgia are going unfilled, that \u201cstudents are studying the wrong things,\u201d and that \u201cIf you can\u2019t get a job, and you majored in drama, there\u2019s probably a reason.\u201d Where to even start.\u00a0 Oh, I\u2019ll just start. 1.\u00a0 The point of a university education is not to fill a quota of jobs in particular industries that just happen to be available in the state.\u00a0 The point of a university education is to support and fulfill a student in the long term, not simply as a worker but as a learning, thinking, creating person.\u00a0 College education should enrich an entire society with a liberal range of thinking skills, not simply enable young adults to fill available jobs. If industries with jobs to fill are failing to attract students and applicants by making a reasonable case that the work is worthy of their dedication for the salaries they\u2019re offering, that is not the student body\u2019s fault.\u00a0 Industries with jobs to fill are not entitled to students\u2019 lives or attention.\u00a0 A graduate has no particular duty to take any given job, anywhere, or to train for any given job  just because it\u2019s available. 2.\u00a0 It is so easy to take the stereotype of the undisciplined, flighty, starving actor or artist and say if you studied drama and now you don\u2019t have a job, maybe you studied the wrong thing.\u00a0 But who would look at an unemployed graduate who studied business, marketing, or biochemistry, and say \u201cMaybe you studied the wrong thing.\u00a0 Maybe you should have studied photography or playwrighting?\u201d But maybe they should have.\u00a0 Maybe a kid who sacrificed their true interests to what they were told was more practical, responsible, stable, or lucrative, would have been better off pursuing what they were a natural at.\u00a0 Maybe they would have found that being educated where their strengths and intuition lie is actually more reliable and life-sustaining. 3.\u00a0  People do work in the arts!\u00a0  Maybe this is overly obvious, but I really think that some of these bigwigs who run their mouths off overlook it.\u00a0 People work in the arts.\u00a0 People really do make their livings in the arts.\u00a0 People who quite possibly couldn\u2019t sustain employment in more conventional career fields do so in the arts.\u00a0 People with very specific and uncommon talents find a life in the arts.\u00a0 People study for and work in the arts who damn well know that that path  is  their best bet. And it\u2019s not like the only thing to do with a drama degree is act or direct.\u00a0 There are jobs in management, administration, development, and design, just to name a few areas.\u00a0 There is such a profound ignorance of what it really takes to run the theater world, that, just for instance, I had not even heard of what would become my own job until I was in college. Do too many people study drama expecting to be able to find jobs, or sustain themselves by performing, who then can\u2019t?\u00a0 Sure, probably.\u00a0 But so what if everyone made more practical choices and studied dentistry or engineering instead?\u00a0 Would the economy then have the jobs available to support all of those people?\u00a0 A society can\u2019t absorb an overabundance of nurses or computer scientists any more than it can a glut of theater artists.\u00a0 There aren\u2019t a limitless number of jobs for electrical engineers, either.\u00a0 If everyone who hears Chancellor Huckaby\u2019s speech takes his advice and chooses their field of study based on where job openings in Georgia currently are, who says those jobs will still be so plentiful, or even exist, five or ten years from now, and what happens to those students then?\u00a0 And in the meantime, what happens to a society that decides it doesn\u2019t value the education of its artists and creators? 4.\u00a0 Make no mistake:\u00a0 I am employed because I studied drama. Beyond the fact that I still actually work in the specific career which I chose in college, my education in theater gave me opportunities to develop communication, interpersonal, collaborative and analytical skills that I just would not have had access to otherwise.\u00a0 I found a world in which the kind of person I was at heart wasn\u2019t considered a fundamental problem.\u00a0 I found a niche that demanded my natural skill set.\u00a0 I got told for the first time that the way I learn is a strength and not a weakness.\u00a0 I deeply understood how my own mind worked for the first time when I was taught to use a two-scene preset light board.\u00a0 Somebody taught me how to yell. I really and truly don\u2019t like to think about where I\u2019d be right now if I hadn\u2019t studied drama.\u00a0 And there\u2019s almost nothing for which I\u2019m more grateful to my younger self than the fact that she had the foresight to not listen to people like Chancellor Huckaby.

{"date": "July 28, 2013", "body": "I\u2019ve been seeing  this column  linked, quoted, and excerpted pretty much all over the internet in the past couple weeks.\u00a0 And I wish I were having as positive a reaction to it as, apparently, basically every other woman on the internet is.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not. I was never a manic pixie dream girl.\u00a0 Though it wasn\u2019t for the lack of a couple of people\u2019s trying to make me theirs.\u00a0 Who decided everything about who I was, tried to treat me like I was that person, and then were continually confused and disappointed when I wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 In fact, that\u2019s true of a lot of people in my life, in various contexts, and not just romantically. It\u2019s the kind of thing I can see happening to Amy a lot, too.\u00a0 Not just guys with romantic intent, but people, deciding based on her looks and demeanor what\u2019s behind her eyes. And then it isn\u2019t. And so not many people stay close. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s vacant or empty\u2014it\u2019s that so  much  has happened to her that has no possibility of being put into words that anyone else would either understand or believe.\u00a0 That has no analog or describeability at all within what most people in her world know and accept as the boundaries of reality. She\u2019s tried.\u00a0 And look what happened for her trouble.\u00a0 Four psychiatrists; being told all her life that she was making it up, or delusional, that what she knows to be true couldn\u2019t possibly be. Believe me about the wear and tear that exerts on a person\u2019s psyche.\u00a0 (And I didn\u2019t even have a Time Lord fall out of the sky into my backyard in a police box after my entire family had been disappeared by a crack in the universe.) (Um, not exactly, anyway.) Is it any wonder she doesn\u2019t let much of her interiority slip anymore? I have always, always experienced Amy as the protagonist of that entire story arc of  Doctor Who , not as a function of what she was to the Doctor.\u00a0 Far from being \u201csomehow immortally fixed at the physical and mental age of nineteen-and-a-half,\u201d she always struck me as much older and sadder than she was supposed to be, perhaps even by her writer.\u00a0 She was always the point-of-view character to me.\u00a0 We saw her, and the world from her perspective, first and last in that story. And finally, it was a world that I recognized. That doesn\u2019t mean that the framing of the story, and Steven Moffat\u2019s (and therefore the Doctor\u2019s) treatment of her aren\u2019t  sometimes  often inexcusably patronizing or sexist.\u00a0 Particularly the ways in which people try to protect her by hiding knowledge or information about herself from her, in an inadvertent continuation of the way she had her very existential integrity violated by the effects of the crack in her bedroom wall. Lots of people try to take Amy away from herself, with good intent or bad\u2014Moffat, and the Doctor, her aunt and her psychiatrists, the Silence and Madame Kovarian.\u00a0 But she ultimately chooses the framing of her story that gets told to her younger self.\u00a0  She  ultimately makes the decisions that take her away from the Doctor.\u00a0 The fact that she is put at the mercy of forces much larger than herself, that people who care about her respond rather imperfectly, that she does the best she can\u2014with a stunning degree of endurance and courage if you really stop to think about it\u2014under deeply irrational and frightening circumstances\u2026I am unclear on how that makes her \u201cthe ultimate in lazy sexist tropification.\u201d That is shit that happens to people . This is the problem with proclaiming that \u201cthe girl who waited\u201d is not a real person.\u00a0 She is.\u00a0 I have been the girl who waited.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a part of my story that I\u2019m particularly enamored with sometimes, but it is intrinsically part of my story.\u00a0 It\u2019s not flattering, but it\u2019s true, and not because that\u2019s just the way some man wanted it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been the girl whose life didn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been the girl whose memories didn\u2019t add up.\u00a0 I\u2019ve felt like the impossible girl. Those aren\u2019t just the titles of stories that happened to other people because that\u2019s what girls are supposed to be.\u00a0 Those are stories that  happened to me . I\u2019ve been told so often, in so many ways, that I wasn\u2019t a real person, that I couldn\u2019t exist in the world. And oh, look, here\u2019s another woman, doing it again.\u00a0 (It is usually women.)\u00a0 I guess to some women, being real is only for some women.\u00a0 And not for those of us whose stories are too inconvenient. Even Amy isn\u2019t truly a girl I could be, in various ways; it\u2019s just that elements of her story helped me work out a few important things about my own.\u00a0 I watched \u201cThe Pandorica Opens\u201d and could literally feel aspects of how the universe was supposed to work, turning and clicking back into place for me.\u00a0 (Even as the episode made so little logical sense that in trying, unsuccessfully, to untangle its plausibility in my head one day, I completely spaced out on my subway ride to work and missed my stop.) \u00a0I had a Facebook conversation with a friend one night about how, when you\u2019ve spent most of your life deeply disoriented with no clear explanation as to why, to suddenly  not  be disoriented in that way anymore is its own kind of disorientation.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the most deeply weird things I\u2019ve ever experienced, and that\u2019s saying something, and I\u2019ve never, not anywhere, seen that experience represented more adeptly than in Amy\u2019s episodes of  Doctor Who .\u00a0 (And I very much think of them as  Amy\u2019s  episodes.) You know how people sometimes write letters to their childhood selves?\u00a0 I could never do that.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know what I could possibly say to that little girl.\u00a0 No words would form around the things I wanted her to know.\u00a0 I just couldn\u2019t, somehow, connect the world I know, and the world she lived in, and the things she did and didn\u2019t understand at the time. \u00a0The truth was just too much, too fractured and incomprehensible a thing to try to figure out how to lay on that girl.\u00a0 It felt like there was some kind of glitch in my timeline\u2026in my own understanding of how I\u2019d even gotten from there to here. But when the Doctor closed Melody Malone\u2019s book at the end of Amy\u2019s story in \u201cThe Angels Take Manhattan,\u201d I cried and cried for a long time without being able to say exactly why.\u00a0 And then I did understand, and then I did know what needed saying to that girl.\u00a0 And I could say it.

And no matter what I felt about homosexuality, I couldn\u2019t believe that that was right. It was part of a long pattern, that I identified with the wrong people in the given narrative.

{"date": "October 14, 2014", "body": "It was for this statement that I felt I had to unfollow a Facebook friend recently. It wasn\u2019t the only thing that made the absolutely screwball, back-asswards social justice discourse on Facebook unbearable during the week in question, but it was kind of a breaking point with regards to my ability to not say anything about it. And according to some people, if I were really enlightened about sexism and oppression, or had the right belief system about those things, I\u2019d know I was supposed to take it someway other than at face value, but I\u2019ve never been any good at tests like that, where I fail some ideological standard by taking people seriously for what they say. And according to certain formats of discourse about feminism and privilege and stuff, it isn\u2019t supposed to bother me. But it does, and this is only part of the reason why. See, when you say this, I think about the men who have also been betrayed and hurt by our culture, who already get told that they fail as people, or fail as men, or can never be real men. Not the self-described entitled \u201cNice Guys,\u201d or cat-callers, or murderers. But the truly gentle men. The shy men. The feminine men. The trans men. The men who would never knowingly or avoidably hurt another person or creature. I think about the disabled men and autistic men, men who have suffered rape and domestic violence, men who work to undermine the exact same forms of discrimination and violence that you do, in any way they can, every day that they\u2019re alive. These men are already told that they suck by the very same system that tells women and people of every other gender how much we suck. I think about the men who when they were boys were some of the very few people who treated me like a person. They aren\u2019t perfect people, but like some days I made it home from school not hating myself, and some nights I didn\u2019t cry myself to sleep because no one said a nice thing to me that day. The chubby kid who wore the same clothes to school most days whose locker was above mine in 6 th  grade? The other kids didn\u2019t treat him better than me for being male. The girls in the gym locker room weren\u2019t more careful than he was not to step on my feet or kick me in the head. I think about the men I work with on a daily basis\u2014the actors, directors, choreographers, assistant stage managers, and technicians. Whose work I depend on to make a living, and who depend on mine, because they\u2019ve made it their life\u2019s work to fill the world with beauty and tell better stories. I think of every man hamstrung and violated and disregarded by this culture\u2019s stupid, cruel expectations of manhood. Those men are already getting told that they suck a thousand times a day. I think about the men deciding what kind of men they really want to be, and how they could be good ones, in a society that doesn\u2019t show them a lot of good options. I didn\u2019t think \u201cNo, you\u2019re right, there aren\u2019t any,\u201d was the lesson we were going for. I think about the boys I know who are going to grow up to be disabled men of color, and what kind of chances are we going to give them to do that, who are already so vulnerable from almost every other possible angle? What kind of people are we telling them they could grow up to be? When we tell them \u201cMen suck?\u201d I think about the men whose writing or music or art has healed and sustained me. And when you declare that \u201cMen suck,\u201d you are talking about all of those men, too. I think about the girls who may grow up to be men, and what they\u2019re hearing in this, and the boys who may or may not grow up to be men. What are we telling them about what their choices are? You can be a man, or you can be a person who doesn\u2019t suck, but not both. The culture of masculinity that all of these men are coming from has already declared them worthless and wrong. Are we accepting refugees from that entire way of thinking, or are we just perpetuating it under a different name? What are you telling a child about whether or not he can grow up to be a person you can love and approve of? I thought the point was that we don\u2019t do that to people. I thought we were supposed to be the ones who didn\u2019t attack and devalue people for involuntary factors intrinsic to their personhood. I thought we were the community that didn\u2019t leave people with no feasible way to be an acceptable human being. If I was wrong, if that\u2019s not the case, somebody let me know.

{"date": "September 16, 2014", "body": "The past few years have brought a series of movie and TV series anniversaries that\u2026while I still can\u2019t say I feel old, really put the relentlessness of time into perspective.  The X-Files  turning 21.  The Princess Bride  turning 25. Empire Records  turns 20 next year, making it older than I was when I first saw it. A generation of kids who weren\u2019t even born when it came out are old enough to see it now. This article \u00a0(which is  long , but worth reading all the way through) came up in my news feed recently about the story of its making and total commercial flop in 1995. I first saw Empire Records when I was 15. I was at summer camp, one of the multiple summer academic programs where I spent my summers as a teenager. And literally all of my friends from the previous year had gotten too cool for me and stopped talking to me. It was the final night of camp, and the movie that had been voted on for everyone to stay up late and watch, was  Empire Records . I asked for it for, I think, my Valentine\u2019s Day present the following year, and my mother bought it on VHS for me. I would name it without hesitation as one of my favorite movies for years, without ever being able to articulate why. The article is an incredible nostalgia trip, and suffice it to say, the story of the making of the movie sounds almost as much fun as the movie. It\u2019s comforting somehow to know that the cast of the movie were all truly friends, who loved making it as much as we\u2019ve all loved it as we\u2019ve grown up. Things surprised me (Coyote Shivers was Liv Tyler\u2019s  stepfather ?! And A.J.\u2019s checkered shirt was an \u201cold-man\u201d shirt? I thought it was the sexiest thing I had ever seen, though maybe that was just A.J. in it), and things didn\u2019t (mischief and mayhem on the part of Ethan Embry), but a passage that really gave me pause finally gave me the scaffolding to explain how this became such an important movie to me: See, I actually have to epically disagree with Petersen and the filmmakers about this. I think it\u2019s an immense strength of the movie that those sorts of depictions were dispensed with. Because much as I love the movie, it\u2019s not actually because I can particularly identify with any one character in it, as opposed to characteristics and combinations of traits and struggles of multiple characters (Corey\u2019s academic prowess, with a hint of Warren\u2019s resentment and insecurity and A.J.\u2019s artistic ambitions)\u2026and that even if  I  wasn\u2019t there, the world they inhabited was a world I could inhabit. \u00a0(In some ways, unlike the world I actually did inhabit.) And a huge part of that was the lack of completely rampant drug use and callous language. It\u2019s not even that drug use or abuse wasn\u2019t depicted in the world; it was\u2014in Marc\u2019s spending the day stoned on Eddie\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d brownies, and Corey\u2019s admission of amphetamine abuse to keep up with schoolwork. It\u2019s not, by a long stretch of the imagination, an anti-drug movie, but the world in which Empire Records exists isn\u2019t one that  revolves  around getting fucked up. In some kind of wake of cynicism left behind by Generation X, there was this oppressive sense that real kids with real issues were all doing this stuff\u2014and the movie as it turned out, apparently inadvertently, tacitly rejects that premise. Because believe it or not, kids of my generation not doing drugs or acting out in those ways actually existed. Teenage culture without pervasive drug use\u00a0actually existed, and the outlook that \u201coh this is what teenagers really do, though,\u201d was a hugely alienating aspect of other movies about misfit teenagers for me (like  Dazed and Confused , of which I remember not one single important thing). I would hazard a guess that this aspect has actually contributed hugely to the movie\u2019s long-term success, especially among, as the article notes, an audience slightly younger and more sheltered than that originally intended by the producers. The writing of  Empire Records  treats the problems and internal life of all of its characters with equal sincerity and seriousness, and that\u2019s something that I really felt the lack of in a lot of media aimed more successfully at Generation X (even in things I did like and identify with in some regards, like  Daria ). It\u2019s an unabashedly sincere and hopeful movie. A movie like that, with a PG-13 rating, could be shown for movie night at summer camp, where a desperately lonely 15-year-old could fall in love with a story of hope that belonging somewhere exists. An R-rated movie with all the characters drinking/smoking/cursing for two solid hours, couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not an everyday occurrence that I aim heartfelt thanks to the MPAA for its contributions to a  brilliant  narrative decision, but today I do. Because the themes of love and ambition, and enforced conformity vs. what it means to find a place where you really fit in the world, are pretty universal to teenagers, but contrary to a lot of mythmaking, pervasive drinking, smoking, and drug abuse actually weren\u2019t. That wasn\u2019t what teenagers all just did. If  Empire Records  failed to coherently indict \u201cThe Man,\u201d it did effectively undermine something snide and dismissive that had arisen in factions of teen culture, that very much conveyed that you had to be edgy or cynical or damaged enough for your problems or issues or dreams to matter. Empire Records  is exactly the movie it should have been.

And I was very quiet, very still, very inhibited. I was always in trouble in PE for not knowing what in the world I was doing or being totally unable to keep up with the rest of the class. I was badly coordinated and nowhere near fast enough for any team sport. I never placed in any event in Field Day. I failed out of gymnastics. Kinesthetic learners were generally thought not to do well in school because of their need for activity and movement. I sat quietly in class and got all A\u2019s. I had a photographic memory. Teachers were always scolding, \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to only study the night before and do well on this test!\u201d But I could. I got into the gifted class and kept my hands rolled up in my sleeves. But all the while, I just ached to be taught how to do things. I clawed my skin off from having not enough to do with my hands. And I could feel the terrifying void that existed between the fact that I knew about a lot of things, but I didn\u2019t know how to do almost anything. The scrutiny of other people was literally paralyzing. I resented more than anything as a kid when we\u2019d be told that we were going to learn how to do a really cool thing, but then what we actually got was obviously a fake, dumbed-down version, of making gingerbread houses or uncovering fossils. People told me a lot about how I was never going to make it in the real world, but nobody seemed to want to teach me anything real. But writing is movement, too, and I was better at that than most people. So is beading. So is loading electrophoresis gels. As a child, making tuna salad or cutting up fruit for myself, people try to take knives away from me, sure that I\u2019m going to cut myself, but I never do. ( They  do.) I never fall on steep hills or icy sidewalks when adults are sure I will. I never sprain an ankle toe-walking. I could feel that if I could know a thing in my body, in my joints, in my bones, in how it behaved in my hands\u2026anything I could make a physical habit out of, was a thing I\u2019d always be able to do, that I could never really lose or forget, the way I\u2019ve forgotten calculus almost entirely from disuse, and chemistry, and how I\u2019ve lost my photographic memory to other cognitive demands. (That one makes me mad.) I start stealing opportunities to do that. Time without a well-meaning adult hovering over my shoulder was time to steal fire. We have typing class in 9 th  grade, and once I start learning, my fingers twitch constantly, ghost-typing out any sequences of overheard words against my thigh. I had no idea what was wrong with me, why I couldn\u2019t stop. I was in high school, and may\u2019ve been listening to a lecture from my grandfather about the difference between people who work with their minds and people who work with their hands, and thought silently, \u201cIf I don\u2019t work with my hands, I\u2019ll go insane.\u201d My acting teacher tells me to get my hands out of my sleeves. I turn out to be good at acting. At a new job, I initially panic when I learn that my nightly duties will involve moving pianos by myself. But I quickly get a sense of the individual moods and idiosyncracies of the Hamburg, the New York Steinway, the Fazioli\u2014their resistance and center of gravity. They almost have individual wills, like baby elephants. I get told at a meetup that I have very loud hands, and it makes me so happy. I start teaching myself a little ASL to make up for the apocryphal childhood gesture language I was trained out of, that I have no conscious memory of, and it feels like breathing air instead of doing complicated sorcery.

{"date": "June 19, 2015", "body": "The inspiration for this post emerged somewhat tangentially to an incident on Twitter several months ago, in which a pair of parent bloggers decided that publicly posting sensitive and humiliating information about their autistic teenager was a great thing to do for awareness. Plenty of other people wrote or responded to the inciting incident, so I don\u2019t really feel the need to address it much further. But something else happened in the aftermath that I actually do think deserves to be talked about more. \u00a0It\u2019s not even really about autism or disability itself as much as it\u2019s about language deprivation and identity and the denial of minority experiences as genuine. In a comment on one of the early Facebook threads about this particular series of Twitter posts, I said to this couple, \u201cYou need to read up on what exposure anxiety is, and what its effects are.\u201d \u00a0( Exposure anxiety  isn\u2019t even the central subject of this post, although I  do  recommend everyone to read about what it is.) They said that they weren\u2019t interested in anything I had to say. Nothing new. But a couple of other people were, and there was a conversation about what exposure anxiety is and why it matters. One friend said yes, that makes so much sense as to why the kids she teaches are often able to do some things but not others even though they seem closely related. One friend of a friend said \u201cHoly cow, there\u2019s a word for that?? That\u2019s really a thing?!\u201d and started a Facebook discussion herself about having been so glad to find this out. And it was not very long at all before someone was accusing her in comments of \u201ccollecting labels.\u201d This is a really, really common accusation against people with a diagnosis of some kind. That we\u2019re just \u201ccollecting labels,\u201d \u201ccollecting diagnoses,\u201d and \u201cidentifying too much with a diagnosis,\u201d closely related to \u201cusing it as a crutch,\u201d or in contrast to the ideal of someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t let their disability define them!\u201d But listen, people who make this accusation? People who don\u2019t understand, because you\u2019ve always just felt like a normal person? You also go through life collecting labels. You also have a whole collection of terminology and shortcuts and vocabulary for thinking about how you work and things affect you. The difference is, you grow up with a common language for common experiences with the people around you, for the most part. We don\u2019t. We grow up often in a void of knowledge and vocabulary for how stuff works for people like us, and often deliberately deprived of it. (When parents decide to just never tell a kid about their disabilities? That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.) We try and try and try to make the language that we have available fit our experiences, trying to meld and forge and hammer language around experiences it wasn\u2019t built for. Or we try to shoehorn our experiences into the language available. It never, ever quite works, and the cognitive dissonance can tear you to shreds, or leave you feeling unreal in your own life, or like you\u2019re kind of always walking through the world as a ghost. Or you start making up your own language for things just to have a reference point if only to yourself. (In many instances, I\u2019ve seen it turn out that different autistic people have come up with almost exactly the same language for a certain thing, almost or totally in isolation from each other. Or that even if I didn\u2019t come up with the language, I\u2019ll hear a phrase or piece of terminology and know exactly what it means, the first time I\u2019ve ever heard it, because it describes so well, so intuitively, something that I\u2019ve never been able to.) I think you don\u2019t actually do less label-collecting than we do, you just get to do it in a way that\u2019s taken for granted as normal, from a much earlier age. I mean, unless you just don\u2019t use descriptive phrases for the things in your life or the experiences you have in common with other people, or what your problems or weaknesses are, that help make sense of those things to you. Do you use any kind of shorthand language to describe your needs usefully to both yourself and others in a way that makes it more likely that you will be able to find some kind of solution or assistance? That is what gets us told not to \u201cuse it as a crutch.\u201d Your right to learn how to apply language to your experiences is taken for granted, because your experiences are largely taken for granted as real. (The core belief, at the basis of most prejudice about disability, is that it is fake.) Typically developing kids are widely regarded as having this right. Disabled kids, queer kids, kids who are atypical or exceptional in some other way, are not widely regarded as having this right. We tend to be much older by the time this starts happening for us in a meaningful way, or by the time the crazy patchwork of scattered fragments of information starts looking like a coherent understanding of why everything is different for us. Of course we\u2019re thrilled when we start encountering explanations for our experiences that are more accurate, and useful, than  stupid, lazy, rude, psycho, freak, immature, dumbass, selfish, stuck-up, incompetent\u2026. Because for as much as some people have a problem with us collecting labels, they don\u2019t seem to have such an issue with giving them to us. It\u2019s almost like their problem isn\u2019t with people having labels, it\u2019s with their own inability to accept that any experience of the world is genuinely different than their own and warrants different methods of coping. Or that for once they aren\u2019t in control of what other people get called or whether our experiences are taken seriously. I mean, try picking one thing about yourself, one thing you know intimately from long-term personal acquaintance, either positive or negative or just important, that\u2019s really important to your ability to understand yourself and make sense of how the world works for you. Try imagining that you don\u2019t know any words for that thing, and you never have. And then you find some. In that moment\u2014spoiler alert\u2014you feel like the richest person on earth. You\u2019re rendered speechless with astonishment, or you want to whoop with the thrill of recognition. And then someone comes along and goes \u201cUgh, you\u2019re just collecting labels.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/on-collecting-labels/", "title": "On collecting labels"},

{"date": "December 15, 2014", "body": "This post actually started on Tumblr in a discussion of  The Hunger Games  and the various interpretations and identities that people project onto Katniss, and carried over into a question of how people of the demisexual/gray-ace spectrum can accurately perceive other people\u2019s levels of sexual attraction and where they as individuals fall on that scale, which I wanted to expand on a little bit. Obviously, we can\u2019t ever know fully and objectively what is in another person\u2019s head or internal experiences. So how can demi or gray-ace people know that we\u2019re different, and that we aren\u2019t just arbitrarily deciding that we\u2019re different? Conveniently, there is already a whole body of writing and experience from another population of people who have had the experience of knowing that they were different somehow, in frequently invisible, subjective ways, often in the complete absence of having been explicitly told so or possessing any language to describe how or why\u2014indeed, often even in the face of other people relentlessly insisting on the contrary\u2014and turning out to be right\u2013 Most autistic people who were diagnosed later\u2026say, after age 18\u2026talk about having always or almost always known that they were different, whether or not they could effectively describe how they were different or how they knew. A while back now on Tumblr, a parent who was considering the best way and time to talk to her kid about his diagnosis, asked the autism tag approximately when people knew\u00a0 somehow \u00a0that we were different from our peers. \u00a0Not necessarily when we knew our diagnosis, but when we felt or knew we were different. Self-reports ranged from ages 3-10. This is actually one of the earliest realizations about myself in relation to people around me\u00a0of which I even have explicit memory (I was about 3). But how can we really know that other people don\u2019t (for the most part) share our sensory reactions, our cognitive differences, our difficulty with speech and language? Well, we have pattern recognition. Most people don\u2019t walk around acting or speaking as if they share those experiences on a pretty consistent, everyday basis. \u00a0Our reactions make sense to our experience of the world. Other people punish and shame and decide horrible and untrue things about us on the basis of those reactions. Disabled and neurodivergent advocates have amassed decades\u2019 worth of writing, media, and activism at this point in an attempt to convince parents and professionals that we aren\u2019t just broken, we\u2019re operating in a hostile environment, and most of them still don\u2019t believe us. There is a burden of evidence, at some point, that becomes overwhelming, that other people are not experiencing the world like you do. Other people aren\u2019t just hostile to the way we react to the world, they\u2019re often baffled. Unless I\u2019m supposed to believe that the non-autistic 98% of the population has just happened to build a culture, educational system, and set of social and employment expectations that is just as torturous and awkward for them, but they\u2019re all just pretending that it\u2019s more or less tolerable and manageable? \u00a0And they overwhelmingly do this without ever being instructed to? \u00a0Or that somewhere between 1-2% of us simply missed out on this instruction? \u00a0And that most other people really do have the same level of difficulty and discomfort, but we\u2019re the only ones not pretending otherwise, at devastating cost to ourselves? (And yes, there are people who do go a very long time pretending that things aren\u2019t that difficult for them. \u00a0The stress of which causes midlife burnouts. \u00a0If not young adult burnouts. \u00a0Which again, we don\u2019t see masses of non-autistic people having.) Likewise, there is a point at which the overwhelming amount of information available to me about how most people interact and live their lives, does not suggest that demisexual or ace spectrum people aren\u2019t really having experiences fairly different from other people\u2019s. The alternative explanation I\u2019m left with is that both autistic people, and demisexual/gray-ace people, are just the only ones being honest about our experiences, and everyone else is lying all the time, in such a way as to make the world really painful and difficult for themselves, and everyone knows that that\u2019s true except us. Which still would not explain the downright confusion and bafflement that I\u2019ve gotten, not just in relationships but in health and sex-ed classes, from teachers, when the\u00a0 whole \u00a0set of expectations from other people regarding sexual relationships does not match up to mine, in a \u201clooking in a mirror and seeing nothing\u201d kind of way. \u00a0I could imagine an entire set of societal and relationship expectations being built on a lie, and authority figures or romantic partners expressing displeasure when I defy expectations to uphold the lie, but not just\u00a0 confusion . Are the vast majority of people just pretending to be deeply confused about how the interplay of emotion, physical comfort, and sexual attraction works for them? Or when people go \u201cHa ha, you\u2019re not different, you\u2019re just like everyone else. \u00a0 Everyone \u00a0feels like [total distortion of what I even just described].\u201d You know how obnoxious it is when non-autistic parents go \u201cWe\u2019re all a little autistic! \u00a0Everyone is on the spectrum!\u201d Because no, they\u2019re not. \u00a0I did not grow up feeling inhuman because 98% of the population is really just like me. Likewise, I have a hard time buying that 98% or more of the human population is really just like me with regards to comfort and emotional needs in relation to sexuality, but are pretending not to be to the extent that I can\u2019t even take part because it just doesn\u2019t even make sense to my most basic physical experience. \u00a0And that really I\u2019ve spent this long feeling this incompletely human and left out and lonely because I just didn\u2019t realize that everyone else is lying\u00a0 really, really well \u00a0about their most basic experiences of physicality and attraction? You see how that strains credibility? (I don\u2019t actually think that\u2019s true; I don\u2019t think that badly of either non-autistic or non-demisexual people.) Would you tell a gay person \u201cNo, you\u2019re not really different, that\u2019s really how everyone is. \u00a0How do you\u00a0 know \u00a0that it isn\u2019t?\u201d Demisexuality is a difference not necessarily in who you\u2019re attracted to along the gender spectrum, but in how attraction works. In some way, shape or form, either a strong emotional bond has to precede sexual attraction, or emotional attraction is prerequisite to sexual attraction. We walk around every single day of our lives, for decades on end, seeing and hearing messages that attraction works, or at least is supposed to, in a way that it actually doesn\u2019t work for us. \u00a0You notice after a while. \u00a0You notice that you don\u2019t feel and react in the ways that other people act like you\u2019re supposed to.

{"date": "August 21, 2015", "body": "The Golden Rule isn\u2019t a uniquely Christian stricture. It occurs in a lot of different faith systems and philosophies, in a lot of similar phrasings and formats. There\u2019s the Silver Rule (Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you). There\u2019s the Platinum Rule (Treat others the way they want to be treated). But I think the golden rule has a corollary I\u2019ve never heard articulated before. I\u2019m not sure what to call it, but it\u2019s this: Do unto others as you would have them do unto someone else. The immediate context of this is that, in the past few years that I\u2019ve been blogging, I\u2019ve run into a lot of argument that some really nasty, callous, and frankly, counterproductive, modes of engagement regarding issues of social justice are justified based on all kinds of factors that have kind of blown my mind and not in a good way. But I see these patterns play out in much broader ways, as well. There is a way in which I think people tend to reenact the things that get done to them, and the ways they get treated. Because, unless they just have zero self-worth, the things that people learn are okay for others to do to them, they\u2019re very likely going to naturally interpret to be alright for them to do to others. Because that\u2019s how \u201cthe way you treat people\u201d has been modeled to them. Who then are they going to inflict that behavior on in turn? You have no control over that. And it could be someone a good deal more vulnerable than themselves. Unless someone manages to recognize their own treatment as wrong and explicitly, deliberately, continually decides not to repeat it against other people. Which is seriously hard to do when you have no direct counterexamples of what decent behavior is. So for instance, a thing I hear a lot is a parent saying that their kid is aggressive to others for no apparent reason\u2014pulling hair, grabbing, biting, hitting, etc. A thing I have to wonder, particularly regarding disabled kids\u2014Is someone else doing effectively the same things to them? Particularly someone more powerful, in a position of authority, under the guise of legitimacy? Under the guise of therapy or education? Are they in a situation in which their own bodily integrity or autonomy can be violated at will by another person and it\u2019s perfectly allowable? Where they can be touched or have their body controlled without their consent, where teachers or therapists can do all manner of aggressive, invasive, unfair things to get or keep their attention? Then you\u2019ve got a hard case to make if you\u2019re trying to teach a kid \u201cYou have no right to do this to someone else. But other people do have a right to do it to you.\u201d And really, is that a case you want to be making? The thing is, it\u2019s not just that the ways we treat other people will be the ways they treat us right back. It\u2019s that the ways we treat others, including\u2014probably especially\u2014children, will be the ways that they go treat someone else entirely. Here\u2019s a story. Once when I was a kid, we had some friends of my parents over for dinner one night. They had a daughter a little bit younger than me. And we\u2019d been told that she was afraid of big dogs, so our big, friendly yellow lab was shut up in a bedroom while we were all outside. And at one point, I took it upon myself to show her that dogs weren\u2019t really anything to be scared of, and went and got the dog, put her on her leash, and brought her outside. Total screaming, crying mayhem ensued, of course. It was a shitty thing to do even if I was trying to be helpful. Why would I even think to do such a thing? Well, because that\u2019s how everyone around me treated me, day and night. Day in and day out. Things I was afraid of or physically uncomfortable with were things I just needed to be forced into. Or compelled to force myself into. Or berated or shamed or even tricked or double-crossed into\u2014all by people with undeniably good intentions. All by people who were totally convinced they were  helping . Why on earth would I think it wasn\u2019t okay to do the same thing to someone else? When adults did the same thing to me all the time and no one objected, and my objections meant nothing? And maybe it seems like a leap, but I truly think this has application to the kids of civility and respect that I actually believe are important in advocacy, in debate, in difficult conversations and in the ways we treat people generally, even when they\u2019re in the wrong. Here is something I see over and over in online arguments. If you just keep an opponent talking for long enough, they  will  tell you exactly what their issue or mental block is with understanding a concept, or giving up a prejudice, or admitting that something being done to another group of people isn\u2019t fair and shouldn\u2019t be condoned. Quit insulting them and just keep them answering questions about their logic holes, and they will take you right to the bottom of their objection sooner or later. And the frequency with which it turns out that they feel they\u2019re being held to a double standard is pretty stunning\u2014that they feel that something is being demanded of them that isn\u2019t being asked of other people around them, or of another group of people towards whom they\u2019re being asked to change their behavior or thinking. If they\u2019re getting told that it\u2019s not cool to treat other people in the same way that it\u2019s always been acceptable for them to be treated (or still is), and they may have come to terms with that treatment in order to preserve their self-worth, or in order not to believe that someone they care about has hurt them, or because they are justifiably proud of their own accomplishments in the face of unfairness or deprivation\u2026if they\u2019ve had it inculcated that this treatment is acceptable towards them, they\u2019re not just suddenly going to believe that it\u2019s not acceptable towards somebody else. Changing those beliefs can take a lot of self-forgiveness and self-compassion. Telling someone that they\u2019re unworthy of those things because of their demographic membership isn\u2019t going to get you far, and it probably shouldn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t shore up empathy for stigmatized or marginalized people just to be told that you deserve that bad treatment instead. The point is that no one deserves it. What I see so many of these arguments boil down to is, \u201cBut this exactly is how someone else treated people like me and it was okay then, so why is it not now for me to hold someone else to the same standard?\u201d Because, of course, it was never okay in the first place. It wasn\u2019t okay when someone else did it to them, either. The golden rule, and its silent corollary, have the power to unravel these double standards. It\u2019s not okay for you to treat people in certain ways, and it\u2019s not okay for others to treat you badly, either. If you\u2019re trying to make an argument that \u201cIt\u2019s not okay for you to treat others this way, but it is for me to treat you this way\u2026.\u201d People don\u2019t tend to buy that, for very good reasons, unless they already have terrible self-worth or have been driven really far towards seeing themselves as un-people. (And that should not be what we\u2019re aiming to accomplish.) Which is one reason why it\u2019s not true that the only serious harm you can do is down a power gradient on some singular axis of privilege. Privilege is practically never one-dimensional. People who are in fact vulnerable in some way that you\u2019ve failed to see or consider are not likely to take well to assertions that their being attacked or insulted is justified on the basis of their disproportionate power. And I really don\u2019t think they\u2019re obligated to. So whether you\u2019re arguing that it\u2019s okay to call someone an asshole or a piece of trash, That it\u2019s okay to force someone into a fearful situation, To control their body, to assert your entitlement to their attention or compliance, To insult or dehumanize someone. To tell them to go die. To decide that some group of people is okay to be prejudiced against. To mock their identity group for existing, Based on their opinions even when they\u2019re wrong and offensive, their skin color, their background, their disability, their sex or gender or sexuality, their privilege or your perception thereof\u2026 Don\u2019t be surprised  when they internalize the message that the same behavior towards someone else is also acceptable. And yes, there are people who can\u2019t distinguish criticism of their positions from attacks on their personhood. Just because those people are going to get their panties in a twist whether you\u2019re nice or not, does not make it meaningless how you have actually treated them as people. That some people will make those accusations practically no matter what, does not  obligate  you to make them true. It\u2019s not about sheltering the feelings of oppressors, or not challenging members of privileged groups in their perspective and assumptions. It\u2019s not even just about the damage you can inflict on a single person\u2019s soul. It\u2019s that you reinforce messages about how it\u2019s okay to treat people, by how you treat people. If the treatment of someone else that you\u2019re justifying will force them into choosing between believing \u201cIt is okay to treat other people this way\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not really a person, at least not one who matters for anything\u201d or \u201cI deserve this because of some categorical generalization about a group that I belong to,\u201d that\u2019s a justification I would seriously question in any context. We shouldn\u2019t be constructing different hierarchies of who it\u2019s okay to do shit to. We should be undermining values systems that say that  anyone  is acceptable to do shit to. Whatever you\u2019re thinking about inflicting on another person, consider: Would I find it acceptable for someone else to treat me this way?    Would I want this person to go treat someone else this way, if I have  no say  in who that might be?  No? Then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be running calculations to try to figure out if it\u2019s okay to treat anyone that way. Maybe, probably, it\u2019s just not. Just changing the direction in which insults, abuse, and dehumanization flow isn\u2019t going to change shit.  Stopping  it is.

{"date": "April 30, 2015", "body": "I used to write more about educational issues than I have been for the past couple of years. Partly due to the fact that as I\u2019ve known more of my own friends who have become teachers, and more parents especially of kids with complex educational needs, my feelings have moderated a bit. So many people are doing the best they can with not enough time or money. Perhaps I\u2019d been too strident. I was actually wondering recently if I might more or less give up the topic. Maybe I was a little bit crazy. Well, the  New York Times \u00a0has come to the rescue  with this story of school districts that\u00a0require students who opt out (or whose parents have opted them out) of New York\u2019s state assessment tests to sit at their desks and do nothing  while their classmates take the exams. With sadness, I conclude that I was\u00a0not crazy. The article details that while many districts have relented to parental pressure and allow test-refusing students to either do other work, read quietly, or go to the library, some are sticking to policies\u00a0of prohibiting them from doing anything but sitting and staring. \u201cWe were not going to reward them by having them do something that other students may perceive as either fun or more interesting than taking the assessment,\u201d says one superintendent. Either fun or more interesting than taking the assessment, as in doing other assigned homework or reading a book quietly. I\u2019m just going to throw this out there, school administrators: If you sound like a villain from a Roald Dahl book, you should possibly reconsider your life choices. Funnily enough, when this story came to my attention, I\u2019d just been telling a friend the story of how my middle school assistant principal had tried to disallow me from reading at lunch. It actually started with A., a new student that year, who was sitting at a table behind me quietly reading a book one day, when I overheard her being told to put it away by Assistant Principal Jones. A. complied and didn\u2019t say anything else about it, though I asked her later if what I thought just happened really just happened, and she said yeah, she thought it was really odd, too. Already a lot of things about the way things were done in this school felt stupid, mean, and unfair to me, but this was above and beyond. Not long afterward, having a book I was eager to finish, and not so much trying to be deliberately snarky but definitely curious as to whether I\u2019d draw the same reaction, brought my book to lunch. Sure enough, Mr. Jones was along shortly to tell me that I needed to \u201cput that away, young lady.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a school library book, it was mine, so the objection couldn\u2019t have been that food would get spilled and ruin it, or that I was reading and not eating, because I\u2019d eaten and had my empty lunch cooler to prove it. And this doubly didn\u2019t make any sense, because Mr. Jones was also the person who, every other day or so, was selecting for punishment whole entire classes of sixth and seventh graders for supposedly being too loud. If we were reading, we weren\u2019t talking, so shouldn\u2019t he be thankful for our not contributing to the noise? In telling Sparrow the story, I finally figured it out. He didn\u2019t like us reading because then we were proof that he was just picking tables randomly to punish\u00a0without a care in the world for whether we\u2019d actually done anything wrong. If we were reading\u2026we were obviously innocent of being part of the discipline or noise problems, and he wasn\u2019t thankful at all because that undermined his excuse-making ability for the bullying and scapegoating he enjoyed. Collective punishment of whole classes was common, and treatment of everyone as guilty was justified because \u201cwe can\u2019t always tell who the troublemakers are and aren\u2019t,\u201d but now that was demonstrably not true. And this development was not appreciated. I know this sounds like childish reasoning, but if that wasn\u2019t what was behind it, somebody else solve this for me, because I haven\u2019t come up with a better answer in nearly 20 years. (Long story short: Our gifted teacher was enlisted to protest to the principal, and before long there were about five of us participating in defiance, and he actually kept fighting the issue, like we went through two or three rounds of this, but eventually our right to  read at lunch  without further harassment was established.) Is it self-evident enough that when school faculty would rather kids actually do nothing than read or be tempted by having to see another kid reading, that something is extremely wrong? I mean I\u2019m just inarticulate at the logic that if they can\u2019t control how you use your time, you won\u2019t be allowed to use it at all\u2026but not disbelieving. Because the effect isn\u2019t only to not make refusing the tests look attractive, it\u2019s to prevent any kid\u00a0from showing that they can and will use their educational time more constructively. \u00a0And they can\u2019t be allowed to generate any evidence that their time  is  being ill-used, that they know it, and that they do know how to do better with it. It\u2019s almost like the people implementing these policies are more interested in safeguarding their own ability to see their students as the problem. Their interests aren\u2019t served by their students\u2019 taking an opportunity to prove that they aren\u2019t the problem, by  reading  on their own initiative. Now where have I seen that before? (I know, I know\u2026somewhere down the line it all comes back to funding. School districts ultimately need kids to take these tests for reasons of funding and school quality rankings. I humbly submit, though, that when growing percentages of students are saying  No, this is not a good use of our time and we\u2019d like to be educated as people, not test scores , that maybe schools should try standing up for their students.) In point of contrast, my senior year of high school, some new set of standardized tests was introduced for which we were a test group for the state of Missouri, and for some reason that made sense at the time, they had half the class take it in the fall, and half in the spring. This left half of us with nothing to do for four hours a day, for two full weeks. They put us in a spare classroom with only the typing teacher to keep an eye on us, but otherwise left us alone, to do whatever we wanted as long as we could do it in that room and without being heard too far down the hall. People did homework, or just talked while sitting on the combination desk-chairs in contortions not normally allowed, and I have a vague memory of some Hangman getting played on the blackboard. I finished reading  Les Mis\u00e9rables  and started and finished  The Three Musketeers  and I think also some Kurt Vonnegut. And as much as part of me decried the waste of time that we were required to be there when no one cared what we did, part of me was actually pretty overloaded with AP classes and happy enough for a chance just to read a book which has turned out to have stayed with me in a lot of ways besides being how I passed the time while stuck in a room so half my classmates could take a test run of a test. I remember  The Three Musketeers . I don\u2019t remember one single thing about that test. It\u2019s an absolute blank in my memory. I\u2019m not making this stuff up, and I wish I were. I don\u2019t actually enjoy being obsessively critical of the American educational system more than anything in the world, but it just keeps going to inane lengths to show that it doesn\u2019t really love it when kids independently demonstrate, like, enjoyment of literacy, or ability to act in their own best interests. I think it might not be a coincidence that those are things we\u2019re supposed to believe that kids don\u2019t have. If I can boil anything down from this, maybe something like \u201cIf school officials\u00a0 can\u2019t fucking stand  the sight of a child reading\u2026there is something else going on, and it\u2019s probably nothing good.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["https://chavisory.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/gaston.png", "http://nyti.ms/1yYdUHZ"], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/when-schools-hate-it-when-kids-read/", "title": "When schools hate it when kids\u00a0read"},

{"date": "February 9, 2015", "body": "I am oh so glad to see the anti-vaccination movement finally seeing some serious public blowback, and very, very sorry that it has taken a lot of sick kids to do it. \u00a0And alternately thankful at writing like this ( Vaccines Don\u2019t Cause Autism, But That\u2019s Not the Point. \u00a0Stop Being Ableist .) being all over my Facebook feed, and ambivalent about some of its logic. \u00a0(It is still well worth reading.) IF vaccines caused autism, even in some tiny percentage of vaccinated children, then whether the tradeoffs were worth the risk might be an ethical discussion worth having. (In which I would still give a hell of a lot of weight to \u201cMeasles encephalitis will straight up kill you, autism won\u2019t.\u201d) But it isn\u2019t. Vaccines don\u2019t cause autism, period. A hypothetical situation: If there were some form of medical treatment that carried a risk of turning me non-autistic, I would be deeply hesitant to take it, whatever the risks of not taking it were. Not because I think being non-autistic is the worst possible fate. The experience of the 90% or so of people I know who are non-autistic suggests to me that being non-autistic is not the worst possible way to go through life. But that\u2019s not why I wouldn\u2019t want to be non-autistic. It\u2019s because, as the neurodiversity movement has gone to great lengths to attempt to communicate to the neurotypical majority, the patterns of how we innately experience the world on a neurological level are intimately entwined with our identities as people. I don\u2019t know what about being non-autistic is so compelling to non-autistic people. I don\u2019t know how many of them could even articulate what it is if you asked them, but they seem attached to it, and as someone not sharing that experience, I don\u2019t get to assume that they are wrong to be so. Likewise, if there were some form of medical treatment that carried the risk of turning a gay kid straight, I think we would rightly express serious ethical concerns about that possibility. Not because being straight is the worst possible thing that could happen to a person. But because, as the gay community has spent decades trying to tell us, sexuality for most people is as intrinsic to identity and their sense of personhood as things like gender, ethnicity, language, or spirituality might be. Try it: If you\u2019re cis-gender, would you readily embrace some kind of medical intervention that, whatever its positive effects, carried the potential side effect of turning you into a member of another sex or gender? Even if you chose to accept that treatment because not dying was worth it to you, would you do it with no sense of fear or conflict? Why not? Because the fact that being autistic or not, a man or a woman, gay or straight, cisgender or transgender, isn\u2019t a bad or wrong thing unto itself is kind of beside the point when we\u2019re talking about altering deep-seated characteristics that are so profoundly tied to our identities. If vaccination could cause autism, even if we overwhelmingly decided for good reasons that the tradeoff was acceptable, that would be something we\u2019d have a responsibility to know. It\u2019s not because it doesn\u2019t. In fact, a great deal of research  has  been dedicated to finding out whether vaccination can cause autism, and I\u2019m resentful of that not because autism isn\u2019t something that should be feared (though it isn\u2019t), and not because Andrew Wakefield turned out to be wrong, but because he committed fraud and every variety of ethical malfeasance and objectified autistic people in the process, for personal gain, with no remorse whatsoever. Being wrong and eventually discovering that you\u2019re wrong isn\u2019t a sin, scientifically, but that\u2019s not how we got the myth that vaccines cause autism. It wasn\u2019t just bad study design or misinterpretation of data, it was a knowing act of fraud and selfishness that set both acceptance of autistic people, and public health, back by decades. *** And don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I am really appreciative and glad to see so many of my friends, so many writers and bloggers that I respect, going \u201cYou know what, I would really rather my child be disabled than dead. \u00a0I would really rather have a living autistic child.\u201d Because it\u2019s still commonplace for parents not to feel that way, and it gets kids mistreated and killed. But the thing is, the two things aren\u2019t connected. \u00a0You\u2019re not risking your child becoming autistic by getting them vaccinated, because there is no relationship between the two things. \u00a0And I\u2019m honestly a little uneasy about reinforcing the link in people\u2019s minds  at all  by saying \u201cOf course I\u2019d take the chance of\u00a0my child becoming autistic to protect them from life-threatening\u00a0disease,\u201d because you\u2019re  not  taking that chance. Vaccinations don\u2019t cause autism. \u00a0And autism isn\u2019t a death sentence. \u00a0And those facts are unrelated. And whether autism is a horrible affliction or an expression of human diversity with advantages and disadvantages like any other, has nothing to do with whether it\u2019s okay to make autistic people boogeymen or rhetorical pawns, because the answer is \u201cno\u201d regardless. Let\u2019s take another example, of something that is generally agreed, including by the people who have it, to be pretty awful, like ALS, Parkinson\u2019s, or Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2026all of which are also not caused by vaccination. Would it be any less wrong to fearmonger about vaccines by using a popular fear of something that is pretty awful in its own right? No\u2014the people coping with that condition deserve just as much as autistic people not to be made pawns in an ideological skirmish, to not have their lives and struggles be made the symbols of somebody else\u2019s irrational fears. Would it make any  sense  to say, \u201cVaccines don\u2019t cause Parkinson\u2019s, but anyway, Parkinson\u2019s isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world?\u201d Because here\u2019s another thing\u2014you can run the risk of being \u2018splainy to someone who has less positive feelings about their own condition. Autism isn\u2019t a degenerative and pretty much universally loathed condition like Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s, but there  are  autistic people who really hate it. Who attribute a great deal of the pain in their lives to autism, who wish they weren\u2019t, who would take a cure if one were available, who really feel that it is the worst possible thing to happen to them. Usually when I talk to these people, I have to question whether it\u2019s the difficulties of autism itself that makes them feel this way, or years and years of being mistreated for being autistic, which can be a very difficult distinction to make when you have no standard for comparison. But sometimes it is the former and not the latter of those things, and ultimately people have a right to feel the way they do about their own lives. I hope that they come to a better place eventually, but they also have a right to do that on their own time and in whatever way they need to, not by being told by someone who doesn\u2019t know anything of their experience that they should just accept it. And they still deserve not to be made objects of fear in the wholly irrational campaign against vaccination\u2026because whether a subjective experience of autism is the worst thing in the world or not, is logically, factually disconnected from whether or not vaccines cause it\u2026and they don\u2019t. Something else that actually happened: A few weeks ago, after the release of a Danish study purporting to establish a link between circumcision before age 5 and development of autism, a Facebook friend of a friend said something along the lines of (I\u2019m paraphrasing) \u201cObviously it\u2019s totally ridiculous, but if it scares people out of circumcising, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d Which to me was actually far more offensive on its face than the persistence of fear that vaccines have anything to do with autism. \u00a0Because that\u2019s not just an irrational fear; that statement expresses a conviction that it\u2019s okay to choose a group of people and use our existence as a scare tactic for your own ends. That if a group of people is presumed sufficiently voiceless, you can strip them of agency and the right to self-representation and use them to promulgate a falsehood that\u2019s convenient to your own beliefs just because it\u2019s easy. (I don\u2019t actually have a lot of blame for people who admit to still being afraid even though they rationally know that the connection is unfounded. Certain people and certain organizations have spent a lot of time, money, and effort to  make  them afraid.) In this, it doesn\u2019t matter how sympathetic I am to the cause of pushing back against routine, medically-unnecessary procedures on newborns. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter how good I think that or any other issue is. \u00a0We are not your rhetorical props. \u00a0We are not your scare tactics. \u00a0Our wellbeing and acceptance as full and not defective or broken human beings are not your pawns for whatever your own pet cause is, no matter how good unto itself it might be. There is one more way in which the anti-vaccination movement puts autistic people at risk that I rarely if ever see mentioned, and it\u2019s this: Vaccination protects autistic children, too, not just non-autistic ones. Non-autistic children are not the ones who need and deserve protection from preventable disease while autistic children are the risk we run to do so. Further, most people at this point know that autism involves communication difficulties by definition, but what is less well-known is that autism often involves  particular  difficulty in communicating about pain or illness or other things involving body awareness. Also that pain or illness can take a particularly high toll on the communication and coping abilities of autistic kids compared to other kids. Autism is a complicated disability, and one thing that an autistic kid doesn\u2019t need on top of everything else that they are dealing with\u2014is the measles. The anti-vaccination movement treats consequences to autistic lives of preventable, serious illnesses as a non-issue (and the lives of immune-compromised and medically vulnerable people as utterly disposable, but that\u2019s a whole other essay). I actually find \u201cVaccines don\u2019t cause autism, period,\u201d to be a perfectly acceptable assertion. If you do feel the need to add an \u201cand furthermore\u2026,\u201d some things to go with could be \u201cVaccines don\u2019t cause autism, and vaccines also protect autistic people, whose lives count as much as yours,\u201d or \u201cVaccines don\u2019t cause autism, and autistic people are not appropriate scapegoats for your fears, so stop it.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bellejar.ca/2015/02/05/vaccines-dont-cause-autism-but-thats-not-the-point-stop-being-ableist/"], "link": "https://chavisory.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/we-arent-your-scapegoats-end-of-story/", "title": "We aren\u2019t your scapegoats.
