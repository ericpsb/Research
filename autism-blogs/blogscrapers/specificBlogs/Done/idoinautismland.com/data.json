It is a film based on a book by the same name written by Norman Doidge. I recommend both. They address the developing area of study in neurology of neuroplasticity. This is an important development because for too long scientists have assumed that the brain was fixed in its wiring and that certain conditions were permanent. The film shows how some innovative neuro-scientists have discovered that this is not the case. They show how, with the proper training, some people with severe challenges have literally rewired their neural pathways\u00a0 and overcome incredible things. They call this neuroplasticity because the person\u2019s brain developed new neural pathways when those pathways biologically intended for a particular function were damaged beyond use. This alternate neural highway gained in competence and ultimately adapted to function normally. One scientist compared it to being stuck in traffic on the main highway, not moving, or taking an alternate side route that, slow at first,ultimately developed over time into a new super highway. \n One scientist described his belief that autism is caused by an excess of neuroplasticity. He works at trying to reduce the overload of information that enters the brain of people with autism and creates in them behavioral loops. I found the film fascinating and hopeful because it emphasizes that the brain remains plastic throughout adulthood. I encourage you to watch it.

{"date": "December 29, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t The post you will read by guest bloggers, Laurence Le Blet and  Karen Hatungimana , and a linked essay by Nicolas Joncour, are about the situation for nonverbal autistic people in France currently. I was unpleasantly surprised to learn how behind France is in educating people who have autism or in supporting children and families. I have many complaints about the system here in my own community but I know that I have been very lucky too. While an unwelcoming school or an incompetent aide has been part of my experience and has negatively impacted me, it has not been my entire experience. The opportunities I have been given to get a normal education, to have a trained aide with me in school, to have the chance to get a college degree and even to become an advocate for people with autism has been a blessing I cannot take for granted. It is time to change the paradigm about autism in France. \n \u201cThe Right to an Education\u201d, Article Typed by Non-Verbal Autistic Piano Student with\u00a0Dyspraxia \n \n \n Guest Post \n \n by Laurence Le Blet and  Karen Hatungimana \n The situation in France for autistic people has progressed very little for many years. The professional orientation of case-managing organizations, medical-social institutions and specialist doctors is still largely psychoanalytic. The National Health Authority, (HAS), does not recommend psychoanalysis, and specifically condemns the \u201c\u00a0 le packing \u201d treatment (in which a patient, wearing only underclothes, or naked in the case of small children, is wrapped in towels and soaked in cold water for the stated goal of enabling the child to rid himself of \u201cpathological defense mechanisms.\u201d \n \n Despite these recommendations, these treatments remain widely present and the national institutions have not caught up with new recommendations for autism treatment. These archaic and outmoded approaches are found in all institutions: justice, health, schools and in society in general. In fact, societal ignorance regarding autism is so pervasive that reports made on parents and subsequent social placements are many; children are always  at risk of being removed  from their parents custody. \n Although autism has been officially recognized as a disability since 1996, the training of nurses and special educators is still mostly based on psychoanalysis and autism is widely seen as a psychosis. Consequently, children with autism are not encouraged to attend regular schools with their same age peers. Despite the legislative Act of 11 February 2005 on Equal Rights and Opportunities, Participation and Citizenship of Persons with Disabilities, the educational situation for autistic children has barely changed. Only 20% of autistic people are enrolled in regular schools, mostly not full time, and parents have to fight for their children to be and remain in ordinary primary school. Most autistic kids are referred to medical educational institutes or day care hospitals at a very early age (from kindergarten), where the right to schooling and the ability to participate in society is limited. Medical-educational institutes and day hospitals are supervised by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Health ) \n Another factor negatively affecting the ability of autistic children to attend regular school is due to the fact that many children do not have the necessary trained support. Children may wait a long time to obtain a personal assistant and until then, must remain at home. However, many assistants are not adequately trained nor do they have a good understanding about autism. Additionally, most schoolteachers believe that students with autism suffer when they attend a regular school and they believe the child should be removed from the school and referred to specialized institutions. When parents are not well informed of their child\u2019s potential to learn, as well as their basic rights, (and most of the parents are not), they are pressured to enroll their kids in medical-social institutes. Those parents who believe in their kid\u2019s potential and capabilities are accused of making their child suffer in a regular school, or are told that his presence in a regular school makes the teacher and other students suffer. Thus inclusion is strongly discouraged. There have been a few lawsuits by parents, however this is rare. \n There is a lack of understanding of integration and inclusion concepts. Parents of children with autism who strive for inclusion have to overcome innumerable obstacles including: delayed or obsolete diagnosis, absence of proper care advice, fighting for financial support, and most significantly, the permanent anxiety of the  psychiatric hospitalization  of their children after their death because nobody would be there anymore to fight for them. \n The Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNO) has issued its conclusions on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. \n Here is an excerpt: \n \u201c The Committee urges the State party to take immediate steps to ensure that the rights of children with autism, , And that these programs are in conformity with the recommendations of the High Authority are authorized and reimbursed. The State party should also ensure that children with autism are not subjected to forced institutionalization or administrative placement and that the parents are no longer subjected to reprisals when refusing the institutionalization of their children. \u201c \n In France, despite there being laws and recommendations for good autism treatment, most are not widely known and they are not consistently implemented throughout society. Money that is designated to medical-social institutions would be better applied to education. Inclusion should be effective throughout the entire life of a person with autism. \n France \u2018s motto \u00ab\u00a0libert\u00e9 , egalit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9\u00a0\u00bb \u00a0should be for all. \n \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://hennyk.com/2016/09/26/the-right-to-an-education-article-typed-by-non-verbal-autistic-piano-student-with-dyspraxia/", "http://http://researchautism.net/glossary/605/packing-therapy)", "http://e-include.eu/news/324-undue-placement-of-children-with-autism-in-france", "http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/1221/755500-france-son/"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=565", "title": "Autism in France"},

I can\u2019t tell you how horrible it was to live in my body during that brief time, and horrible for people to be in my company too. I am sure I was helped by medication that stabilized my system. It is a lifesaver to have it, that\u2019s for sure. It frightened me to have so little control over my emotional regulatory system, but I am getting back to normal.

{"date": "September 9, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t  \n I started writing my book when I was twelve. I finished when I was fifteen. Now I am sixteen and it is close to publication. It has been a dream of mine for four years. When I started it I had no idea I would write a book. I was sad when I was twelve. I needed an outlet. I started attending regular school then. I was the only non-verbal autistic guy in any of my classes, except the autism room. I was adjusting to a surreal experience. On the one hand I was the only kid in my regular classes who didn\u2019t speak. On the other hand, I was the only kid in the autism class who could type, so I felt unique and a bit alone wherever I was. \n \n I saw a need to help people understand autism better. There were so many misconceptions. Inside I felt the urgency to help change things for my autistic classmates who saw me communicating daily but could only watch. No one thought to try to teach them too. I think I was regarded as unique, a \u201csavant\u201d for communication, and that what I did was irrelevant to them. Many days I wept in that year when I was twelve out of frustration for them. \n \n When I wrote I started to think how I could change things. It was a relief to ventilate my loneliness or anger but that was not going to help them. I started to think about my symptoms. I realized that so many theories about autism are based on external observation by experts who interpret our behavior according to their theories. \n \n My entire education up until I entered regular school was built on these external observations and theories. Lots of them were completely wrong. The real problem was that the non-verbal recipients of this education were too locked in to correct anyone. Not being able to speak, gesture, or write limits your ability to show your true capacity to learn. \n \n So I decided that maybe I was an expert in non-verbal autism because I could explain symptoms from my own experience. The result was that my explanations were different from what my old teachers told my parents, and different from what the expert advice books told them too. My expertise didn\u2019t come from a Masters degree in psychology or a class in Applied Behavior Analysis. It came from my own struggle living with autism since I was born. When I heard experts explain why I did things the way I did, before I could type, communicate, and tell them my opinion, all I could do was write my book mentally and hope one day I could communicate and tell my story. \n \n My book is nearly here at last. Just a short time more and it will be available on amazon.com. It is my story but it is also a window into severe autism. I hope it offers a key to help other severely autistic people out of their prisons too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=51", "title": "My Book"},
{"date": "January 13, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t \n I am so delighted to have the opportunity to speak to you today. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to professionals and parents who are willing to listen to a non-verbal person. Often I experience the opposite, and I get to listen to the professionals trying to explain to me what I am like. Then I get to wonder how they know. The problem with this, for many non-verbal people, is that because so many cannot communicate what they think, they are unable to express when they disagree. Their thoughts remain trapped inside because the neurological connections don\u2019t work as they should. The thoughts are there, but they can\u2019t come out. They stay stuck behind a body that is not responding.  \n This may be really different from what you have learned in college, especially if you studied in certain programs that perhaps taught you that people like me have a receptive language disorder, a social skills deficiency \u2014 meaning I can\u2019t understand human behavior\u2013 a lack of theory of mind or empathy, and perhaps even cognitive delay. After all, that\u2019s what data and science prove, right? And that\u2019s what everyone assumed about me when I was younger, before I could communicate.  \n So, these theories may not be totally accurate in my case, or maybe many are totally inaccurate in my case, and perhaps in many, many other people\u2019s cases, but that doesn\u2019t stop the theories. \n In science, theories are supposed to change if new data emerges. When Barry Marshall tried to show that stomach ulcers were caused by a bacteria, not stress as everyone believed, he hit a brick wall of scientific opposition and was discredited as a \u201ccrazy guy saying crazy things.\u201d Twenty years later he won the Nobel Prize in Medicine and doctors now treat ulcers with antibiotics, not antacids. But it was a hard fight for 20 years. \n This is why it is really a credit to the Autism Society to give me this opportunity to be heard and to you for being open to having some of your ideas about severe autism challenged. \n In the beginning, when I was seven and I first began communicating, my entire ABA team dismissed my being able to communicate sophisticated thoughts as impossible because according to their data I had not mastered all their drills.  \u00a0 Also, they insisted I had to communicate with everyone equally or my communication wasn\u2019t scientifically valid. I think they hoped I would spontaneously erupt in song and dance in between my drills. My elementary school teacher thought that I didn\u2019t know what a number was because I couldn\u2019t coordinate my hands to pick up the number of straws she instructed. Every day for years I got a remedial education in school when inside my head I was multiplying and dividing and reading. It\u2019s clear to me why they assumed I didn\u2019t understand. All my mistakes were a confirmation to them of my internal delays. But there is a big neurological misunderstanding in their logical idea. Getting answers wrong doesn\u2019t always mean you don\u2019t understand. Sometimes it means you can\u2019t get your body to obey your mind. When a person with Tourettes yells out an offensive word, it is not because they want to and don\u2019t understand right from wrong. It is the opposite. The mind is pleading to stop and the body charges forward. \n The key idea I want to convey is that my form of autism is like this: my brain is not slow or impaired linguistically. I do not talk, not because I do not understand. I don\u2019t talk because I don\u2019t gesture because I don\u2019t have facial expressions because I can\u2019t hold my book to read it because I can\u2019t turn the pages because I can\u2019t scan a shelf because I can\u2019t pull a blanket on in my bed. Why do people assume that I can\u2019t do these things because I don\u2019t understand or because I am not cognitively aware of my surroundings? It is a theory that has trapped me and countless others in lessons that bore us to the point of despair, and a school education of calendar, the weather, and 1 + 1, and ABC, year after year.  \n I suggest that you try to imagine another cause for the deficits that isn\u2019t based on intelligence or language processing. What do you think could cause my delays, explain my troubles controlling myself in sitting still, or controlling my emotional equilibrium? What could cause me to flap my hands when I want to be still? \n If you try to imagine that you are totally paralyzed but can still think, it\u2019s a scary thought. Imagine that the paralysis includes your ability to speak. How will anyone know that you are intact inside? It would be very hard to show. This is the story told in the film, \u201cThe Diving Bell and the Butterfly\u201d. It is the true story of a man who had a severe stroke. He had the most severe kind of stroke which causes a paralysis called locked-in syndrome. No one knew he could think because he had no ability to show that he could think. His mind was active but everyone assumed his brain was dead. Then a perceptive nurse figured out that he was trying to communicate by blinking his eyes. He wrote an entire book by blinking as she pointed to letters on a letter board. \n Now, my condition isn\u2019t as severe as that because I can move, but I have to tell you, it is not that different. My body moves, but it doesn\u2019t always move the way I like. It moves how it wants, or it moves part of the way I want, or, if I am lucky, it listens to me. I would describe this as a moving paralysis. It is frustrating to a high degree. \n It is frustrating all by itself without the additional frustration of being thought to be receptive language impaired and low functioning and bored in toddler programs by nice, well-meaning people. \n It is time to revisit our diagnosis of autism and time to change our way of helping severely autistic, non-verbal people. Now, I know what I say is different from many professional opinions which state that I am at the end of a spectrum opposite Asperger\u2019s Syndrome \u2014 \u00a0  or what was formerly known as Asperger\u2019s  \u00a0 \u2013in the DSM. But in a spectrum we are the same, different only by degree. \n Temple Grandin is probably the best known person at the other side of the spectrum from me. She is an important spokesperson for autism. She has described herself as being a visual thinker. One of her books is called, \u201cThinking in Pictures.\u201d She is pretty good at independent body control. She drives, rides horses, designs complicated engineering systems, and holds a pencil to write and graph neatly with no help, because her body listens to her mind. She has social problems because people and their behavior and ways of interacting confuse her. She told Oliver Sacks that she feels like \u201can anthropologist on Mars,\u201d trying to understand alien, human behavior. \n I wonder if you think I am the same, just really, really severe?  \n We do have eye contact impairment in common. But a lot of what she describes is the opposite of me. I have insight. I have theory of mind. I have empathy. I get jokes. I think in letters and spelling, not pictures. I can\u2019t control my body\u2019s movements, write or graph neatly, and I need constant help to do normal everyday tasks. \n In the search for a cure, or to find the most effective treatments, we have to see things the right way. I mean Aids and head colds both are viruses, but no Aids researchers try to find a cure for Aids by exclusively focusing on the sniffles. They know they are different, not polar ends of a virus spectrum. \n What I have in common with people with Asperger\u2019s is a sensitive sensory system, poor eye contact and shyness. \u00a0  But  \u00a0 people who are out of shape, and people with asthma, and people with heart disease, and some people with cancer all may experience shortness of breath but that doesn\u2019t give them a Breathless Spectrum Disorder. \n It is important that the DSM not miss the differences. I believe there may be different, discrete types of autism. I don\u2019t claim to understand every form of autism at all, but I do claim to \u00a0  understand mine and the differences between me and what people compare me to. \n What I believe that severely autistic people, like me, need is instruction in communication early\u2014teach typing or communication by pointing to letters on a letter board. Non-verbal people need special methods to do this. They cannot break through on their own. In my case, I was helped by working with Soma and RPM. This opened my world. Others may be helped by her techniques as well, or there are different methods that have also had success. The key was that she presumed I was intelligent and offered me grade level lessons right away, and I rose to the challenge. She did not wait for me to type before teaching me interesting topics. \n This is important because her methods helped me to focus and break through my internal and external distractions. Her support helped keep me on track, to scan, to look at all the letters and to touch the one I wanted. And all at the fast pace of my racing mind. If we are denied the support that makes this breakthrough possible, it often fails to occur. The danger is that then people misinterpret poor performance as a reflection of cognitive capacity, rather than as a need for a different kind of support or teaching.  \n Another important treatment is that we need exercise to wake up our mind-body connection. So many autistic people never exercise, which is disastrous in a body that doesn\u2019t listen to our minds. We also need access to a normal education. Smart, trapped people need support to emerge from their internal prison. Assume intelligence and look for the signs of it. I think a lot of kids would be grateful if you spoke to them normally. A lot would be grateful to get grade level lessons in school, or listen to interesting books in school, even if they cannot yet show on the outside what they think on the inside. \u00a0  Together we can begin to change things for the most misunderstood form of autism. \n \n Since I was asked to talk about the future, I want to begin by saying that I hope for the same future that any 16 year old boy would want. My hopes include college and career and a girlfriend one day. The whole thing. Am I frightened that I will never get to achieve the things I want? Very, very, very. The support I get now dries up after high school. My aide needs to be exceptional. And trained. \n It takes time to develop a common rapport. Not everyone is a good match. If I get an aide who isn\u2019t too bright\u2014sorry, it\u2019s blunt, but true\u2014or isn\u2019t intuitive, or is not flexible, it all collapses. Bad aides are the worst, because people think I am getting help because I have someone with me, but the fact is that the wrong help keeps me trapped. I need the right kind of support to succeed in high school, and I will need the same to go to college and to work in a career. If I can\u2019t get this, what then? I will have to depend on my mom to support me. As my courses get more advanced, my aide has to be not only good at helping me control my behavior, keeping me focused, and skilled in communication, but also someone who is comfortable in higher math, or literature, or whatever subject I am taking. This is far different from a babysitter. My hope is to have at least several hours daily of properly trained support after high school so I can learn and work, and make my own way in the world. \n I fear getting stuck with someone who is not well trained for my intellectual or communicative needs. I am \u201clow functioning\u201d in independence, but \u201chigh functioning\u201d in intellectual ability, which means that I will need lots of support to go to college or work, but with the right support I can achieve at a high level. Stephen Hawking has a pretty good aide who helps him to achieve at the fullness of his capacity, despite severe disabilities. \u00a0  There are programs today that simply don\u2019t know how to deal with people like me. They divide autistic people into groups of either practically independent, or \u201clow functioning\u201d and remedial. How will the system adapt to people like me, as more of us emerge? Do you have any ideas? \n My ideal future would be to work every day part-time as an autism consultant, to write every day on autism and other topics, and to earn my living this way. \u00a0  Exercise has become important to my life. I need it daily to help my body/mind connection continue to improve itself. Somehow, any future programs will need to include some way to help me get connected with friends. \u00a0  My autism is very isolating. The assumption that I am not interested in people is way off. My problem is that I get overwhelmed in crowds, noise, and visually over stimulating environments. Since I cannot talk, socializing requires an iPad, effort to type\u2014which is slower than talking by a lot\u2014and an aide to keep me focused.  \u00a0 This makes socializing hard, but not impossible. I hope any programs for the future think of the social needs of people with these kinds of challenges. \n How will the system help me to find an Annie Sullivan? The concept is old. Helen Keller stayed disabled all her life, but she got terrific and intelligent helpers, so she was able to thrive, and she inspires people to this day. But if she had not? \n I want to let you know that speaking before a large audience is very anxiety provoking for me. I may need to step out at times. Answering questions before an audience is very stressful, so I have a film for you of me answering many frequently asked questions. If my body is calm, I will try to answer some questions today, however, if you are interested, my book, which is on sale outside, should answer most of your questions. I describe in detail my journey into communication, my early remedial education, and my current general education in a regular high school. I also describe many puzzling autism symptoms which I try to explain from the inside out. I talk about how it is possible to understand correctly and get the answer wrong. I explain stimming, impulsivity, motor issues, anxiety and many other aspects of severe autism. There is an interesting conversation at the end between me and the neuro-researcher who wrote the foreword of the book about my internal language and other issues.

Want my sea that sings to me to come and take my hand. \n And so I\u2019ll wait as patient as the birds up in the sky for warm\u00a0 sunny days, and a sea that plays, to return.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Ido-Autismland-Climbing-Autisms-Silent/dp/0988324709/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1354649107&sr=1-1&keywords=ido+in+autismland", "http://www.amazon.com/Purple-Tree-other-poems/dp/B008A8XJT8/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1354650085&sr=1-2&keywords=sydney+edmond", "http://www.halo-soma.org/about_soma_tito.php"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=34", "title": "Autism Poetry"},

It is frustrating to me to need to show them the obvious, but researchers, in my opinion, seldom pay attention to non-verbal autistic people. Even when those non-verbal people who can communicate by typing describe physical symptoms different than Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, many researchers look to Temple Grandin and others, not to Tito, or Carly Fleischmann, or me, or other non-verbal people who type to explain our experience of autism. \n Let me help the APA. \n \n Temple Grandin \n *Independently drives, rides horses, shops, cooks, etc. \n *Lives alone. \n *Initiates actions throughout her day. \n *Excellent fine motor control.

{"date": "May 9, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t \n \n \u00a0by guest blogger, Michael Ramirez \n www.special-fit.com \n Recently I received a call from a parent asking if I could fitness train an autistic child. I\u00a0had been a high school baseball coach for over 10 years. Much of my expertise in fitness\u00a0had come from various experiences in working with athletes in strength and conditioning\u00a0programs, working in fitness centers, through textbook study, and apprenticing other\u00a0fitness experts. I also had 10 years of experience working as a behaviorist with autistic\u00a0children. I had a sound understanding of both areas, but this was an opportunity to\u00a0combine the two. I quickly discovered that despite the fact that people with autism face\u00a0many physical challenges, there wasn\u2019t much information out there or programs that addressed this area. In order to work with this child, I would have to start from scratch\u00a0and develop a program tailored specifically for him. \n When I began my research, I started to think about what was available to the autism\u00a0community. School programs, like Adaptive PE, really didn\u2019t address the issues I was\u00a0going to try to work on. One problem I saw with APE, during my years as a behaviorist,\u00a0is that it focused too much on teaching how to play certain games or sports, which I\u00a0found to be too abstract, with not enough focus on getting the kids to move and use their\u00a0bodies. Instead of focusing on functional movements, these programs produced more\u00a0frustration because of the slow paced activities. I then questioned why people with autism\u00a0don\u2019t go to their local gym or just hire a trainer. This was obvious. First, even if a parent hired a personal trainer to work out their child, there was no guarantee that the trainer\u00a0would have any understanding of autism and the challenges that accompany people\u00a0living with this condition. Secondly, therapists like myself, don\u2019t always have the fitness\u00a0background to be able to work on the fitness side in a safe and knowledgeable way.\u00a0Needless to say there weren\u2019t many resources out there, so I was going to have to develop\u00a0a program through the combination of my two experiences in both the fitness world and\u00a0as a behaviorist. \n I began to think about all of the different children I had worked with in the past and the\u00a0physical challenges they faced each day. Many of the kids I had seen shared many similar\u00a0physical characteristics like low muscle tone, poor coordination, lack of strength, lack\u00a0of flexibility, balance issues, and overall limitations in their movements. Then there was\u00a0the neurological aspect that impacted their physical functioning. Challenges with motor\u00a0planning and sensory integration (proprioception and vestibular) were the most evident.Communication and behavioral challenges are also common among children with autism.\u00a0Taking this into consideration, it became clear why there weren\u2019t many programs\u00a0out there for people with autism. There were so many issues that made it difficult to\u00a0produce such a program. Safety was the first thing came to my mind. Initially I was\u00a0uncertain how I was even going to get a child with autism to perform the basic functions\u00a0of fitness. Although I had a great deal of experience in working with kids with autism\u00a0on the behavioral side as well as many experiences working with neuro-typical people\u00a0on the fitness end, I had never combined the two. Many autistic people are very out-of-shape and have significant gaps in their strength and mobility. With this in mind, I began \n imagining the process of getting one of my clients to do a burpee, or a deadlift or to run\u00a0for an extended period of time, or to be willing to exert themselves in a way that would\u00a0get them the types of results that would be necessary for a physical transformation. This\u00a0is hard for anyone beginning a fitness program, but is particularly challenging for an\u00a0autistic child who may not be used to engaging in any kind of exercise. I knew that if I\u00a0was going to get anyone in shape, they would have to be exposed to \u201creal fitness.\u201d I had\u00a0worked alongside occupational therapists for many years. I had seen how they struggled\u00a0to get children to do some of the things they demanded. What I was going to require was\u00a0not like putting a child on a swing. I was going to demand real workouts with the goal of\u00a0fitness and progression. \n \n A couple years back, I had been exposed to the concept of CrossFit through a family\u00a0member. I had trained in CrossFit for a couple years when I began to train my first\u00a0client with autism. When I started to think about all the experiences and knowledge I had\u00a0from the therapeutic and fitness side, CrossFit was a good match as a means to structure a\u00a0program specifically tailored for children with autism. CrossFit scales exercises to the\u00a0individual. This seemed to connect to the \u201cI\u201d in Stanley Greenspan\u2019s DIR Floortime\u00a0Model which stands for \u201cindividual differences.\u201d Since no two people are alike, no two\u00a0people with autism are alike either. Children that I would be working with needed a\u00a0specific program to fit their needs. CrossFit allowed people to progress based on their\u00a0current fitness level. CrossFit was developed by Coach Greg Glassman. CrossFit ,com\u00a0states that Glassman defined \u201c fitness in a meaningful, measurable way (increased work\u00a0capacity across broad time and modal domains). CrossFit itself is defined as that which\u00a0optimizes fitness (constantly varied functional movements performed at relatively high\u00a0intensity).\u201d \n \n Many children with autism struggle with flexibility and range of motion. Proprioceptive\u00a0Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) was a good answer to this. Of course I needed to\u00a0modify its application. PNF was a good way for me to facilitate stretching without having\u00a0the student do the work. The combination of this type of stretching routine and the\u00a0CrossFit structure, gave me the necessary components needed to design a good program\u00a0to fit the needs of people with autism. All I needed to do was test it. \n \n I began to work with the family who was in search for a personal trainer. It was my first\u00a0opportunity to test my concepts and ideas. There were many bumps in the road, but the\u00a0road to success is not always straight, as they say. It took a while to figure out how to\u00a0elicit certain movements, capture attention, and promote motivation. I relied heavily\u00a0on my experiences working with Dr. Arnold Miller, who created The Miller Method; a\u00a0cognitive systems approach to working with kids on the spectrum. The basic philosophy\u00a0that I took from his teachings, in the application to this program, was the use of children\u2019s\u00a0aberrant systems and transforming them into functional, relevant activities. For example, \n one of my athletes likes to take string like objects and twirl them around. It is a self-stimulatory behavior. I used his motivation to stim on these objects, to introduce a heavy\u00a0rope and create a system of functional movements that can be repeated. It turns \u201crituals\u00a0into repertoire\u201d, also a title of one of Dr. Miller\u2019s books. His philosophy in working with\u00a0people with autism shifted my view about how to use certain behaviors that are common\u00a0to people with autism. I was fortunate enough to have worked closely with Dr. Miller\u00a0for several years before his passing. His techniques worked well in combination with\u00a0CrossFit methodologies. They simply complimented each other. \n \n The philosophy of this workout program is based on three principles: Neurological/Physical/Individual Based (NPI). Neurological Skills, as it refers to fitness, describes\u00a0functions like agility, accuracy of movements, coordination, and balance, as well as body\u00a0awareness. Physical Skills include characteristics like strength, flexibility, endurance,\u00a0stamina, power, etc. The last part takes into consideration the differences between each\u00a0individual. Everyone has their own set of skills and abilities. With children and teens with\u00a0autism, I needed to consider many different things, primarily communication (receptive \n and expressive), cognitive ability, socio-emotional skills, sensory processing, behavioral\u00a0challenges, and learning styles. Scaling and modifying exercises, using the CrossFit\u00a0methods allowed us to tailor a program specifically for each individual, while helping\u00a0them progress through each movement at their own pace. \n \n The physical components of exercise in relation to people with autism needed to address\u00a0the student\u2019s areas of weakness as well as their strengths. My research emphasized the\u00a0five basic fundamental movements of fitness: pushing, pulling, bending, rotation, and\u00a0locomotion. These foundational movements allow us to work on basic movements, and\u00a0build up to more complex and compound movements, through the use of scaling and\u00a0prompting. Many autistic kids have difficulties with these movements. For example, one\u00a0of my clients has a big frame and was fearful of certain movements. In our assessment, he\u00a0was fearful of bending his elbows to lower his upper body because he thought he would \n not be able to support his own weight and might flop down and smash his face into the\u00a0ground. As a result, he was unable to do a push-up, so for weeks and months we worked\u00a0incrementally toward this goal, first by getting him vertical and pushing off a wall, and\u00a0then by progressively lowering him horizontally towards the ground. Today he can push\u00a0off the ground, and with a little assistance, he can get his hips up. I know it will be no\u00a0time before he is doing a full push-up on his own. He has also made big strides in his\u00a0ability to bend and squat. Initially he would bend his knees only very minimally. This\u00a0impacted on his ability to perform daily functions like picking up an object from the floor \n or even sitting down at a desk. A few weeks ago he got his rear end below his knees for\u00a0the first time, when doing an air squat, with some support to maintain balance (holding\u00a0his hands out in front of his chest). This was a great accomplishment for him. \n \n When I began to work with some of my first clients I noticed many common \n characteristics. Many of the children had bodies that had low muscle tone, very weak\u00a0posterior chain and core muscles, tightness in the lower half, and very soft upper\u00a0bodies (Physical). Some of the kids I met had difficulties with balance, coordination,\u00a0motor planning, agility, the ability to perform compound movements, and be accurate\u00a0in movements (Neuro). There were also deficits in communication, attention, and\u00a0behavioral issues, which made it difficult to motivate them to perform for an extended\u00a0period of time. Let\u2019s face it; exercise can sometimes be painful and hard, especially in\u00a0the beginning. To get the best results in each workout I focused on strength, compound\u00a0movements, strengthening a specific muscle groups, and work on the constant varying functional movements at a high intensity. \n It takes time to get the kids accustomed to the workload, the pacing, and to gain confidence in the movements. There are times when I need to be more of a motivational\u00a0coach, than a fitness coach. It is definitely a process. All of my students are making gains\u00a0in one way or another. Working on physical fitness has its obvious advantages when\u00a0you consider the health benefits but when it comes to people with autism, the benefits\u00a0are even greater. I have received feedback that fitness training has impacted things like:\u00a0sleep patterns, energy levels, mood, attention, communication and behavior. One of\u00a0my students expressed that exercising helps him to feel his body better. He also feels \n it has been helpful with his pointing (typing). Exercise gives kids with autism added\u00a0satisfaction and increased self-esteem when they connect their brain and their body and\u00a0even strategies to deal with excess energy. Recently, the mother of a client told me that\u00a0her son requested to do some pull-ups in the middle of a behavioral therapy session.\u00a0He then proceeded to continue to perform his own routine of sit-ups and push-ups in\u00a0combination until he relaxed. \n Fitness is an area that has far too long been under utilized in the lives of people with\u00a0autism. My mission is to change that, through my company, Special-Fit. I want to thank\u00a0all of my students for inspiring me and helping me develop this program. It was because\u00a0of the relationship I\u2019ve created with them and their families, that forever changed the way\u00a0I view people with autism. They have taught me more about breaking through limitations\u00a0than any other individuals I have met in my lifetime. \n Michael Ramirez \n Special-Fit \n Owner and Head Trainer \n \n For more information about Special-Fit, visit our website at www.special-fit.com \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=18", "title": "Creating a Fitness Program for People with Autism"},

I think it would help to be served new foods early and often to prevent the tradition of eating just one item from developing.\u00a0 \n Ido \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=164", "title": "Me and the Great TV Chefs"},

They tolerate, accept, love, and never judge. It isn\u2019t a dog\u2019s character to reject someone because he can\u2019t talk well or because he stims. In this way dogs are our superiors. They are not judgmental. They don\u2019t harbor prejudice. My old dog used to sleep in my room if he noticed I was sad. My sweet shepherd really watches me to see I\u2019m with the group. If I lag she stops walking til I catch up. \n \n I also think dogs force me to deal with noise and unpredictable actions. I am sure this has helped me in life. I think they have taught me a lot. It is interesting how many autistic people have dog phobia. If you are autistic I think dogs should be introduced when you are young. Then the symptoms of terror never develop. I think if we didn\u2019t have dogs when I was so young I would be phobic too. Now I can see how they helped me. It\u2019s interesting in so many ways how they did. \n \n The truth is cats are cool too, but not as loving. I didn\u2019t learn so much about me from cats, but I did learn worlds of stuff from dogs. I learned toleration of noise and change. I learned that I am loved in spite of my disability by them. I learned that loyalty is important, to love long walks, and that I can control a large dog on a walk.

The experience was a meeting at my home with a neuro-scientist who researches autism. He lives far from me so we have e-mailed but never met in person. He asks me a lot of hard questions about my thinking processing, my visual perceptions, my ability to control my body, and so on. \n Overcoming autism means we people with the ability to describe it from the inside out to people doing important research is only right. It is sort of an intense experience to hear about new theories about what they think may be wrong in my brain, but I\u2019m thrilled to meet an open-minded thinker. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=163", "title": "The Open-Minded Autism Researcher"},
{"date": "May 19, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t I am autistic, as you may have figured out by my restlessness and the obvious fact that someone else is reading my words. The question I have for you is if it surprises you that a non-verbal autistic person writes well?\u00a0 This was mentioned a lot by professionals as I began communicating. People who thought of me as the \u201clow-functioning\u201d sort could not adapt to my intellectual abilities. This led to a rough time, to put it mildly. It\u2019s a real problem. Truthfully, many theories made my early life challenging. \n \n Theory One told my parents that I couldn\u2019t understand speech, so I was talked to like this: \u201cGo car\u201d, \u201cAll\u00a0 done\u201d, \u201cHands quiet\u201d, \u201cGood job\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cSay hi\u201d, \u201cGo school\u201d, and so on. I would have preferred if they had just spoken more normally. \n \n Second Theory said that because I couldn\u2019t understand speech, I needed super basic books. So, I was denied really interesting stories. Just last year an autism teacher I know gave me a cardboard toddler book as a gift. It is a comical notion because she was well aware that I was mainstreamed in my classes. Still, she thought, \u201cNon-verbal autism/toddler\u201d. I have to laugh it off, but what is she really implying? Is it this bias that really denies non-verbal people an exposure to interesting ideas? I read interesting, challenging books at home. This teacher thinks \u201cPokey the Lost Puppy\u201d is better. \n \n Theory Three was that because I didn\u2019t show I understood, I didn\u2019t. This meant that school was really a total bore. The teachers refused to teach interesting things because they knew we couldn\u2019t understand. Like the teacher I just described, though well-meaning, they bored their students to a point of emotional withdrawal into stims or indifference. I think this is really sad. \n \n \u00a0This leads me to Theory Four which says that there is an 80% chance that I am mentally retarded. In fact, a psychiatrist recently reminded me that most autistic people are mentally retarded. So I ask you this- is Stephen Hawking also mentally retarded? After all, he can\u2019t speak, is locked internally, and needs constant support. Or is not speaking different than not thinking?\u00a0 \n \n There are a lot more theories, but I\u2019ll stop here. \n \n The problem was that these theories were not true for me at all, but when I was little I had no ability to show otherwise. My inability to get my body to do what I wanted was interpreted as a learning and thinking problem. Even as I emerged into communication, a majority of teachers and others I worked with were initially rigidly stuck in seeing my efforts as the imaginings of an over-zealous mom, rather than an intelligent, understanding non-verbal autistic boy finally finding a way to escape his prison. \n \n So I was bitter for a long time. My journey was made harder by those who were in a position to help. They refused to see what was true. Good theories were better than reality. I felt really angry for several years because no one seemed even happy to help me grow. They were skeptical to the point of cruelty. \n \n An example was when my first speech was published in a newsletter for The Friendship Circle three years ago. The only negative feedback came from a teacher of autistic kids who stated that in twenty-five years  she  had never met a non-verbal autistic person with such advanced thinking and writing skills, so therefore  I   couldn\u2019t have such advanced thinking and writing skills. This way of thinking not only insulted me, but it meant that she was unable to see the potential in her own students. This needs to change, I think.\u00a0 \n \n Thanks to my persevering parents, we let go of the folks who thought like her because that was hindering my education. This led us to find people who were more open-minded. In the last four years I have had a much happier education. The School District has energetically supported me in mainstreaming since I began Middle School. They have provided me with my aide from an agency so that I can access my education. \n \n The truth is, the changes set me free. Once people saw me in a new way, gave me opportunity and a chance to improve myself, and supported me- you can see what is possible. Next year I will go to a regular high school in all regular classes on a diploma track, and I will continue to do the same work as everyone else. \n This is thanks first to Soma who taught me how to get my thoughts out in letters and typing, my physical fitness trainer who woke my sleeping body, and the many other professionals who help me achieve this. \n \n Like all kids in middle school I have some great teachers and some lousy teachers. That\u2019s OK. I\u2019m not complaining. It\u2019s a normal education, but only four years ago I was still in an autism class that showed me ABC movies every day, one plus one math, how to find stuff in play dough, and other thrilling lessons day after boring day. \n \n To the credit of those who gave me the opportunity to learn at grade level, I am trying hard to do well. It can be lonely. Middle School is not a kind and compassionate age for any kid and I am the most different kid imaginable. I am far below the social pyramid. Still, I will be a successful man in my life. Disabled or not, I am determined to have a meaningful life. \n \n The future is unknown to me like it is for everyone. I don\u2019t know if I will have an improvement in my symptoms. I don\u2019t know the path I will have in college or a career, but I know I will aim to achieve for myself some kind of job and intellectually stimulating work. I can\u2019t stim my life away. Only I will need support to do this. I have a wonderful aide in school. She is helping me focus and communicate to the class. Without her I couldn\u2019t access my education. She helps me function in society. \n \u00a0  \n I will need smart, trained aides like her in college and after. The truth is I will always need someone, like Stephen Hawking does or Helen Keller did, but I will try to keep working on skills. I\u2019m not sure where I will want to live. I see a lot of slackers still at home- ha ha, but I never, ever want to be in an institution or a place that patronizes me. I want to live as normally as I can. \n \n Now, if my parents had not started to look at my illness in a new way, I might never have emerged from my prison. I would still be bored to death in a remedial autism class in high school, where my former classmates all are. I want to know if you think I am the only intact mind in all of them, or could it be that some of them are also intelligent and understand everything? I think the sad thing is, many will die and we will never know. \n \n I used to come home from school in 6 th  grade, and I would weep so much for them. I was partially mainstreamed then and doing grade level work in the other subjects in the aut class as I adjusted to a longer and longer mainstreaming day. The other autistic students would watch me communicate and learn, though they were not doing either.\u00a0 \n \n Isn\u2019t it possible to at least teach them some interesting lessons, even if the kid can\u2019t communicate well yet, in the chance he is trapped internally, as I was? I wrote before that boring people to death is like denying them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u00a0 \n \n I also think that autistic kids need more exercise than they get. Look at flabby, weak autistic kids who have poor body control. Don\u2019t you think weights, coordination exercises, and cardio fitness would help? It did for me. \n \n Communication is essential. To answer how, \u00a0will require a new way of working with autistic people. I feel non-verbal people will be heard from more and more. Will you be open to listening? \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=162", "title": "My Speech at the Autism Society Conference"},

It\u2019s a big deal in my life. \u00a0My middle school was the first real opportunity I had to learn in school. I know 6 th  grade was like an experiment. They watched to see how I could cope in middle school. I went in to math and science only, and did regular work in the other subjects though I wasn\u2019t mainstreamed in them then.\u00a0 It was a very big adjustment to sit so long in self-control and quiet. The schoolwork was simple compared to sitting in a classroom all day. I was determined to get a decent education, so I tried. It was not always easy for me or my aide, but I got more capable each year. This year I am doing better. \u00a0I am mainstreamed practically from eight to three. I go to P.E. with autistic kids, but otherwise I am staying in a regular class all day. My school is big. I switch rooms. \n \n Next year my high school will be bigger still. It has thousands of students, so many clubs I couldn\u2019t believe it, and a track and football field. It is a real big school experience. It\u2019s scary for new freshmen, I know. I\u2019m really nervous. I worry that my sensory system will be overloaded. I worry that students will be mean to me. Then I tell myself, \u201cOK, it\u2019s just worries and I am going to be fine.\u201d I will be with some kids I know. I can walk in the halls five minutes early to avoid the mob- but I can\u2019t stop my worries. \n \n My aide is the best. It\u2019s wonderful to work with her. She is kind, smart, and good at working with me. I don\u2019t know her plans next year. I hope she can stay to start me off, or even longer. Now I worry that getting a new aide and a new school will be too much. Some days I get overwhelmed by worry. I wish I didn\u2019t, but I do. \n I worry about the teachers. Will they accept me or think I am an odd nuisance to them? I worry about the students. Now I am in class with kids who are used to me. Next year there will be new kids. I always visit school before the year starts to meet all the teachers and tour the campus. That helps a lot. I also wrote a short speech that is read to the class on the first day of school to explain my behavior and communication style to the class. That helps put them at ease, but I am still so nervous inside. \n \n I realize I am lucky. It\u2019s a great high school. It\u2019s a dream of mine to graduate and go to college. I will need to overcome my fears about high school. It\u2019s a big shift in my life. It\u2019s the third big change I\u2019ve had in school. I went from remedial class in elementary school to a \u201chigh functioning\u201d autism class in 5 th  grade. Then in 6 th  grade I went to my middle school. This time I really don\u2019t need to prove I\u2019m smart to a school of skeptics. I think I\u2019ve done that, so that is one big relief to me. It\u2019s wonderful that they believe in the need to educate me, so I no longer need to worry about that. \n \n I feel next year could be good. Unfortunately it\u2019s unknown, so I worry too much.

{"date": "April 20, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t Moses  couldn\u2019t talk well yet he was the man God selected to liberate the Hebrew slaves. Why did God choose an imperfect man to do the job?  Moses  pleaded with God to choose someone else. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t talk well. How can I speak to Pharaoh? How do I make my point heard?\u201d God insisted it be  Moses  in spite of his speech disability. \u201c Moses ,\u201d he told him, \u201cYou must use your brother Aaron as your spokesman.\u201d \n Why did God do this? I think for several reasons. First of all,  Moses  was a great man, perfect in spirit and values. He fought for justice. He yearned for fairness, and he was a free soul inside. He was a slave\u2019s son  and  a prince. He knew freedom and he was not limited by fear of the whip. \n I think God also wanted to show that perfect in His eyes is not the same as perfect in man\u2019s. That is, God looks to the core, not the shell.  Moses  was not sure he could do it because he saw the shell. The core was revealed gradually as he led the slaves to freedom. \n Moses  amazed the world in his challenges. Who was he, this speech impaired shepherd, to challenge Pharaoh, thought to be an embodiment of the gods at that time?  Moses  assumed he was right when he insisted on freedom because God insisted it was right. Pharaoh assumed he was right when he insisted on slavery because no one dared challenge Pharaoh. That is, until  Moses , the reluctant spokesman stuttered, and Aaron repeated the command to let the slaves be freed. \n Moses  taught the world that God rejects slavery. No matter how this idea has been ignored, no one can argue after the Exodus, that God approves of enslaving others. This was the first time that humanity saw a mass liberation movement and it has inspired people for thousands of years to aspire to be free. \n There is also a lesson in mutual support.  Moses  had a helper, and this, I think, shows that we should not take too much on alone. Aaron and  Moses  are a team. I am sure Aaron needed  Moses  as much as  Moses  needed Aaron, and God relied on both of them to convey his instructions of liberation. \n The message of  Moses  is that one leader doing what is right, with the right support, can change a terrible situation to one of hope and promise. I get inspiration from  Moses . I faced a terrible situation without hope in my childhood. But, despite my inability to speak, I have reluctantly seen that if I don\u2019t say the truth it may be years before change occurs. So, I face  my   pharaohs- autism experts- to see if we can\u2019t find a way to liberate autistic people from the solitude they face. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=174", "title": "My Moses Speech"},

My early years had to be my hardest because I had no voice at all. I want to challenge you to be open to teaching those who may currently lack the ability to show their intelligence, but who still deserve the opportunity to learn. \n \u00a0  It is hard to be a teacher of kids who don\u2019t communicate. The kids don\u2019t have writing, or gestures, or speech, or facial expressions, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t think.

The first is by Tami Barmache, lovely friend, and mother of a son with autism. \n I remember meeting Ido\u2019s mother, Tracy, at a mom\u2019s night out. She was describing that while Ido was unable to speak, he was communicating by pointing to letters on a letter board. I had never heard of such a thing, was fascinated and wanted to learn more. I, too, had an autistic son who was not able to speak. \n As the mother of a child who often cannot communicate his thoughts to me, watching Ido on the letter board, and now his iPad, has always been nothing but a pleasure- liberating. It is sometimes difficult to reconcile the differences between how Ido presents himself to the world, and the words and ideas that he spells out on the letter board or keyboard. There is something that tugs at you and says, \u201cIt just can\u2019t be.\u201d But then you see him, over and over again, spelling out his thoughts that are clearly his. It is not Ido\u2019s job to prove himself to us. His challenge of remaining in control of his body to the best of his abilities is enough to face every day. We are the ones who have to find a way to overcome that incongruence, and kick through the barriers and limitations that skepticism creates. \n Ido has many strengths, but the one that stands out for me is his perseverance. He says that his mom was relentless in her efforts to bring communication to his world. He was along on that ride, and was hungry to learn and communicate. He is strong, determined, and wise beyond his years. \n I would imagine that Ido would say his greatest challenge was living a life without communication. Now he is able to convey his thoughts, feelings, struggles and successes. He has the ability to find his way through difficulties with the help of those who love and believe in him. He continues to face other challenges, such as gaining better control over his movements, and reaching other families and professionals. \n So little is understood about autism in general, and specifically about individuals with limited communication.  \u00a0 Ido is very articulate, and has a vivid and clear way of describing his experience with this very difficult disability. With these insights, we can go beyond all of the technical terminology and the need to \u201cfix\u201d everyone. Ido can give us a window into the world that we, as parents, long to know so much more about. Professionals owe it to their students, clients, and patients to listen to what Ido has to say. \n One day I was sitting under a beautiful tree in a park with Ido and his mom. I was frustrated and confused about what might be going on with my son. I always turn to Ido as my \u201cgo-to guy\u201d in order to get a little bit of insight into my little guy\u2019s world. After patiently answering some of my questions, Ido spelled out on his letter board: \u201cAutism is a deep pit. Don\u2019t give up.\u201d I think of those words regularly and they give me strength. I will never give up.

Today I am sharing what my friend, Cathy Gomez, wrote. Cathy was my aide in school for the past two years. \n \n As Ido\u2019s Behavior Interventionist for four years, I was initially able to see him communicate with his mom every time I did a home session. It was very fluid and natural. I also went through the process of training to communicate with Ido. It was very difficult at the beginning because we had to build trust and a relationship. Ido was so anxious, but that slowly lessened. We practiced every other day and each time we got a little better until we reached the point that he was able to fluently communicate his thoughts to me. I was able to see the progress as well as Ido\u2019s frustration when I misunderstood him. Recently it has been so exciting to watch Ido type on his  iPad.  The  iPad  will allow Ido to become more and more independent in so many more ways. \u00a0\u00a0 \n Ido\u2019s greatest strength is that he is resilient. He wants to experience and do things, just like you or I, even if they are more difficult for him. It takes a lot of courage to be mainstreamed in all regular classes, knowing that he will be the only student like him. Ido\u2019s greatest challenges are controlling his emotions and body. He has a more difficult time managing feelings because they tend to quickly escalate. However, even when emotions are high, Ido is great at staying reasonable and listening to logic. \n Working with Ido for the past four years, particularly the past two, when I was with him throughout the school day, has affected me significantly. He changed everything I knew about autism and people with disabilities. I was supposed to be the educator, but he has taught me more than I could learn from a professional.  \u00a0 In college I learned that autistic people can\u2019t have empathy, which is a ridiculous notion. I now view people with autism or other disabilities the way I would anyone else. Ido has shown me that he isn\u2019t held back by his disability. He goes hiking, likes to joke around, wants to learn new things, and reads faster than I do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=7223419216614966652"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=44", "title": ""},

Why I have to say this is obvious. Many theories I have encountered teach that I have no ideas, feelings, or theory of mind. Until I could communicate I couldn\u2019t correct people, but now I can.\u00a0 \n \n When I was 12 I decided to write about my symptoms, my education, and my life. I wrote for 4 years until I wrote a book about autism. It has just been published.  \n \n My book is like an autism diary. I tell my story. I write about my feelings. I teach the truth about my autism. \n \n I decided a few years ago that experts had made a lot of mistakes that everyone just accepted as gospel. Not to offend anyone, but how does everyone know for sure? Hard to know absolutely if the people you are dealing with are silent and can\u2019t write or gesture.\u00a0 \n \n My early life was extremely frustrating because I did not have a means to communicate. I listened to my experts day after day say that I had to keep working because I didn\u2019t know nouns, verbs, pronouns, categories, emotions, my relative\u2019s faces, and so on and so on.  \n But I did.

If you don\u2019t know who he is,  Nick Vujicic  is a man who has no limbs at all. He was born this way, but despite his challenges, he is freer inside than most people. I so relate to his struggles though mine have been different in many ways. Still, key challenges have been identical. How do you find peace with faith? How do you accept the situation and stop the sorrow? How do you overcome limitations? How do you deal with other people who stare, or don\u2019t know you\u2019re normal inside? \n It is more a decision to live fully than anything else. Nick had a tough time as a kid. So did I. He had to fight to get an education in school. So did I. With no limbs, independence is impossible. With severe autism, independence is impossible too. But he learned that the road to freedom is not in having no challenges, it is making the most of the reality life has dealt you. The life he got is harder than average, by loads, and he had to live bigger than\u00a0 normal to just keep up. He is not ashamed, embarrassed, or hiding. He lets people get comfortable with him. That is a great gift. \n I had a chance to meet him briefly. He has a cool wheelchair that is tall. It brings him to eye level, more or less. I gave him my book. It inspired me a lot to meet a man who bravely lives life fully, and does good, important work, even though he might have given up. Giving up is the easy way to run from pain but he decided that his life had a higher purpose.

{"date": "November 4, 2011", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t I am honored to speak here today. I know some of you are professionals working in autism, and some of you are parents, and even a few of us here actually have autism. So I will represent the point-of-view of someone who has unfortunately lived with autism since the first moment of life. \n It aint easy. \n It\u2019s hard on parents and I see the sadness and struggle of them all the time. It\u2019s a true challenge to have a child who can\u2019t do normal tasks, does odd self-stimulatory behavior in all the worst moments, can\u2019t communicate in words, signs, or even gesture their deeper thoughts, and needs constant supervision. So I have empathy for what parents go through. The worst for parents is never knowing if your non-verbal child is understanding and thinking at a normal level. It leaves parents talking simply- as they have been advised- to help their child with basic concepts. The child is never fully communicating in sign, or Pecs, or even speech, so it is a really hard situation for families. \n The autistic person has a different challenge. Recently the news was about an Israeli soldier held prisoner in a dungeon in Gaza for nearly six long years with no communication with the outside world at all. I thought about how awful it would be to be a captive cut off from life and sun and kindness with no certainty of surviving or being freed. \n Now, autism isn\u2019t a matter of life or death, but it is a prison that won\u2019t let us talk to the outside world and we have no certainty of ever being freed. I brought up the analogy because I think people can imagine more easily being a captive of cruel terrorists than of being a captive of your own body. So, you need to try to imagine my situation as a young non-verbal boy with no way to express my ideas and see that it was like a nightmare. Not only was my mind fully present and understanding everything, but I read fluently. I thought of retorts, jokes and comments all day long in my head. Only no one else knew. \n So, I was talked to like a toddler, not given a real education, and kept bored and sad. This changed when I was finally taught how to get my thoughts out. The liberation was as remarkable as the freeing of this poor captive. \n It\u2019s true that I stay tied to autism still. It is with me every moment of my life. It is not a liberation from autism to be able to communicate or get an education. However, it is a liberation from its isolation. My typing and my pointing to letters have enabled me to be a free soul. \n I go to a regular high school all day. I go to regular classes too and I do regular homework, and so on. I may challenge the teachers because I behave oddly at times, though I am actually working super hard, but I learn, get good grades, and intend to graduate, go to college, and live a kind of, sort of,  normal life. Kind of, sort of, because autism is a barrier to normal anything. \n Being autistic is a major challenge. It is the biggest hurdle because it is pervasive, very misunderstood, and incorrectly worked with in too many cases. \n When I was twelve I started writing about living with autism. Soon I hope my essays will be available to you in a book that will explain a lot of the behaviors and inner experiences of the person with autism who can\u2019t communicate.  \n If you check out my blog, www.idoinautismland.com, or follow me on twitter or facebook, you will be alerted to when it is ready to purchase. My goal is to help you parents connect to your children in real communication, and to help professionals understand the real experiences of your clients, and to burst open the prison door of my fellow travelers in Autismland. \n Thank you for your time today. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=115", "title": "My Speech at the Vista del Mar Autism Conference"},

I think it is hard to imagine having a disability even for a few hours, so it is much more difficult to imagine living with severe limitations life long. I have not lived one day without autism. It is hard to imagine my life without it because I\u2019m part of autism and it is in me. My mind is intact. My soul is free, but my body is the property of something else. This \u201celse thing\u201d is called autism. It looks like this: weird body movements, noises, lack of responding at times, a mask of flat expression on my face, impulse problems, and an overly sensitive sensory system, which is why I sometimes wear headphones.  \n But perhaps more difficult than all of the above, \u00a0  \u00a0 is the attitude of others. It is obvious by my actions that I\u2019m not smart, right? OK, not right. But you know my limitations make me  appear  not smart at times, and then people assume. It\u2019s not so bad now because I type on an iPad , so it is obvious that I think and read, but I still need to prove myself to each person I meet. This is life with a disability like mine. People don\u2019t know or understand, and there are a lot of misconceptions. \n \n It is more lonely to be autistic than not, especially for people who can\u2019t communicate. I have an exercise for you. Imagine that though you think just fine your mouth is unable to speak your thoughts. This means no phone conversations, no singing, no long talks (or short ones), no calling your dog, no telling people your ideas, how you feel, or your needs. In other words, very quiet and very stuck. You listen all the time to the conversations of others, but you can\u2019t join in. Ever. Not for an hour, but forever. Now imagine that your hand is wobbly and doesn\u2019t obey your thoughts either, so the option of writing is gone. That is isolation. \n \n Now it gets tougher. Your body doesn\u2019t stop doing odd movements. You behave oddly because of that. Now you have a taste of autism. But I think one more taste will help you get it. Imagine all this, and put yourself as a kid into school with others like yourself  \u00a0 and see yourself in a class doing the same boring lessons day after day, year after year, such as the days of the week, the weather, the ABCs, the 1+1s, all because your outside has fooled people into concluding you are dumb. Then the school tells your parents you don\u2019t understand. \n \n So now you know about my early life. I was lucky to escape my internal isolation because I was taught how to communicate, first on a letter board and now on an iPad. This enabled me to leave my special education environment and enter a general education one. My old classmates still remain in the same special education class. None have been taught to communicate yet. \n \n In autism we are thought to be limited rather than trapped. I think the number of so-called mentally retarded autistic people is greatly exaggerated. How smart would you look if you couldn\u2019t talk, gesture, write, or control your movements? It is a true frustration living like this with society\u2019s misunderstanding, so I am grateful to begin changing perceptions. \n Maybe we can work together to change the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=74", "title": "From My Speech, \"Imagine Having Autism\""},

I wish I could do more to stop the bursts inside because I may behave in a way I regret outside. The choice is to fight the intense feelings inside with so much effort (like fighting back the urge to vomit), or to have the feelings burst out.

High five,\u201d she said to him over and over. \n Ido has nonverbal autism and can\u2019t speak. At that moment, due to the nature of the activity, he did not have immediate access to his letterboard or iPad, so he had no means to tell the nice, well-meaning young woman that he hates being told, \u201chigh five,\u201d and \u201cgood job,\u201d and that he hates being spoken to as if he were three (he is seventeen), and to please talk normally to him. \n \n I thought, \u201cOkay, say something now before this becomes a pattern and he becomes insulted.\u201d As tactfully as I could, I mentioned to her that Ido doesn\u2019t like \u201chigh five.\u201d He wants to be spoken to normally. \u201cBut this is how I talk to everyone,\u201d she replied. \n \n Really? She goes to a party, walks up to her friend, or the attractive young man she wants to meet, lifts her palm and says, \u201chigh five\u201d in that particular tone of voice?  \u00a0 She palm-slaps friends she passes at work, the cashier in the market, her doctor? I didn\u2019t think so. Perhaps if she hung out exclusively with two year olds she talked to everyone like this. Otherwise, let\u2019s assume she gives people with autism or other special needs, special communication.\u00a0 \n \n My son, Ido Kedar, is a high school junior, and despite his severe nonverbal autism, he is the author of a book,  Ido in Autismland; Climbing Out of Autism\u2019s Silent Prison , is a  blogger , is an honors fulltime general education high school student, and is a frequent guest lecturer at universities and autism conferences. His vocabulary is huge, his intellect, fully intact. \n \n Knowing this, or even a small bit of this, I had to wonder, why would  anyone  talk to Ido in this infantile manner? Why talk to  anybody like this? The answer is that many people with special education training have been programmed to believe that autistic people need speech broken down to simple components to help deal with the assumed receptive language or cognitive delay. Talking in this way is deeply habituated for many people who assume it is the right thing to do for every person with special needs. Otherwise, why say, \u201chigh five, good job,\u201d instead of, \u201cexcellent effort. That was outstanding.\u201d Hear the difference? Autistic people do too. \n \n Recently, Ido had an unexpected encounter with a professional who spoke to him like this; \u201cHe knows I know he\u2019s smart, right, bud? We\u2019ve got a thing, right, bud?\u201d Enduring a situation he found pointless and patronizing and which pulled him away from an academic class which mattered to him, Ido stewed and finally replied as an irate teenager would and typed, \u201cF\u2014 \u00a0  this.\u201d \n \n The question is, would this professional talk to  any  other high school student like this, let alone a high achieving honors student? We all know the answer is no. Professionals too often talk  about the person (\u201cHe knows\u2026\u201d) and not  to the person (\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d). \u00a0  They talk in childish tones and reduced vocabulary. The message is, \u201cI say I know you\u2019re smart but I treat you like I think you\u2019re not.\u201d To which Ido says, \u201cEnough!\u201d \n \n In his book,  Ido in Autismland , Ido wrote in his essay,  How   I Would Have Liked to Have Been Taught , \n \n If I could educate the specialists, the first thing I\u2019d recommend is to talk normally to autistic kids. No more, \u201cGo car,\u201d \u201cClose door,\u201d \u201cHands quiet,\u201d or the like. It\u2019s stupid to talk this way. Some teachers used tones to make words more distinct or over-enunciated sounds, like \u201cletter\u201d made with a \u201ct\u201d sound, not a \u201cd\u201d sound like we use in America. They sounded so silly I often rolled my eyes inside. (p 55) \n \n When Ido was little, before he could type and we didn\u2019t know what was locked inside, we used to speak to him in this simplified way, as we had been instructed to by autism professionals. We went through a terrible episode when he was small when he grunted continuously every few seconds all day long. He couldn\u2019t stop and we tried all the traditional behavioral techniques of extinction, or telling him, \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cmouth quiet,\u201d to no avail. Finally, in desperation, I told him in totally normal language before a car drive that his grunting was distracting to me while I drove and I told him that he needed to make every effort to not do it for the duration of the drive. To my amazement, he did. From that point on, even before he had communication output, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and the respect of normal communication input. \n \n Regularly, Ido gets letters from parents telling him that they now speak normally to their child with autism, thanks to his advice, and that their child is responding positively. Ido has asked professionals to ponder, if you had duct tape over your mouth and around your hands, would that mean you couldn\u2019t understand speech? How would you like people to talk to  you  if you were in that situation? How do  you  talk to a nonverbal autistic person? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Ido-Autismland-Climbing-Autisms-Silent/dp/0988324709/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1381874824&sr=1-1&keywords=ido+in+autismland", "http://www.idoinautismland.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=12", "title": "How Do You Talk to a Nonverbal Person with Autism?"},

{"date": "December 20, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t  \n Guest Post \n By Tami Barmache  \n \n We live in an exciting time! A time when people are starting to think that maybe the children and adults that we were certain were receptively and cognitively challenged are actually bright, literate, capable, and gravely underestimated. As a mom of one of these underestimated children, it certainly feels like change is in the air. The tide is turning!  \n It may be like turning the Titanic, but maybe once we start to build momentum and inertia takes over, there will actually be a paradigm shift that will change the lives of countless incredible, bright and often misunderstood individuals. We are missing out on so many gifts and insights. If people only knew! \n My heart is beating fast just thinking about how I feel every time my son, Dillan, shares his thoughts with me. Everything from simple opinions, to funny stories, and profound insights. It\u2019s life changing for all of us. He feels like his life began when he started to communicate. That\u2019s not an easy thing for a mother to hear, but it\u2019s honest, and I can only imagine how limited his world was when he had no way to express himself.\u00a0 \n \n Dillan began his journey to communication when he was 10 years old. I fought hard within myself to dig deep and follow through with the practice, but Dillan\u2019s resistance, and mine, often led us astray. We were fortunate to have Tracy and Ido to re-motivate and inspire us along the way. I remember sitting in the park with them one afternoon looking for some words to propel me forward again. Ido told me that \u201cautism is a deep pit\u2026don\u2019t give up.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n I never gave up. I urged his teachers and therapists to see who he truly was, to raise the bar, to give him the opportunities he deserved. I don\u2019t know if my desperation was apparent from the outside, but inside I was screaming. \u201cDon\u2019t you see????\u201d I showed video of him doing math and writing stories, explained the process, and tried so hard\u2026so hard. But sometimes a journey has it\u2019s pace, no matter your plan. It took several years and the right support in place to finally achieve the daily communication and learning opportunities that Dillan has now. \n Today, things are finally moving in the right direction. I must admit that it is taking Dillan a bit longer to become fluid in his typing with me than it has with some others.\u00a0 That being said, we are getting \u201cour groove\u201d and improving every day. We will have to work together to sort through the pain, frustration and hopelessness that Dillan experienced all of those years, but it\u2019s never too late to find a voice\u2026never too late!\u00a0 \n \n   \n The  documentary \u201cWretches and Jabberers\u201d features two incredible men who began typing later in life, and I\u2019m sure many other have been able to communicate after years of silence as well. It\u2019s never too late. As parents, there are a lot of intense feelings to face in this process, but none of them compare to their sentence of silence, so we have to take a deep breath, support them, push for them, and celebrate who they are and have always been. It\u2019s painful. But we can do it. We must do it\u2026for them. But we don\u2019t have to do it alone. We can build a community to support each other, and to provide opportunities for learning and practice.\n We all need communication. Real communication. \n As Larry Bissonnette (from \u201cWretches and Jabberers\u201d) said so well at a recent event: \u201cOperating pictures on a board brings you cheeseburger, typing lets you create the menu.\u201d \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=10", "title": "Turning the Titanic"},

{"date": "December 31, 2013", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t By guest blogger, Tracy Kedar \n \u00a0A few weeks ago my friend\u2019s elderly father was hospitalized. At the time he was confused, agitated and had worrisome physical symptoms. A doctor told my friend that she should place her father in a hospice, that his death was imminent. \u201cWhat?\u201d she responded, \u201cHe was driving just last week!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor abruptly, \u201che isn\u2019t now.\u201d  \n Today he is back home, back on his feet, and more active than he has been in months following the correct treatment of his symptoms by a different doctor. \u201cWhat that doctor did was rob me of my hope for my father. I was crushed by his verdict and he turned out to be completely wrong,\u201d she told me. \n How can we fight when we are told something is hopeless? When there is no point in hoping we must be resigned and accept. When Ido was around six a doctor we saw who specialized in autism said that over the next few years it would become obvious whether Ido would be able to improve or would spend his life as a \u201clow functioning\u201d autistic person. This was prior to him having any communication and his true potential was totally unknown to us. She was preparing us to accept the low remedial, low expectations prognosis she saw as inevitable at that point. \n \u00a0I was thinking about these stories, and so many others, of professionals advising people to abandon what they saw as false hope, and then having their dire predictions turn out to be wrong. These professionals advised false deprivation of hope, in my opinion. \n \u00a0I have heard a few people suggest that Ido\u2019s book may cause disappointment to parents whose children with autism may not learn to type as he does. Perhaps they believe that people with autism who have the potential to learn how to communicate their ideas are such rare exceptions that it is better if they keep silent and not give parents a chance to dream that their child too might have that capacity. Better to have low expectations, this reasoning goes, than to strive for more and have hopes dashed. Keep expectations low like this and you guarantee disappointment. \n \u00a0Every autistic person I know who now can express his or her ideas through typing was once thought to be receptive language impaired and low functioning intellectually. No teacher would have looked at them as children and said, \u201cThat one will be a fluent eloquent communicator.\u201d That is because their outside appearance belied their inner capacity. Every parent of these children gambled and decided to pursue letterboard and typing without any guarantee of success. \n \u00a0Since Ido began typing a number of children we know personally also began to get instruction in use of letterboard and typing on an iPad or other assistive technology, either by Soma Mukhopadhyay at halo.org or in another method. And every single one of them has proven themselves able to communicate. Some are more proficient than others, but none had zero capacity. (This is different than rote drills of typing and copying done in many schools. This is specialized training in typing as a form of communication). \n \u00a0How would it have been compassionate to these children and their parents to lower their hope to the point that they would not even try these methods? Shakespeare said. \u201cBetter to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.\u201d In this case I would change it to, \u201cBetter to have tried and not succeeded than never to have tried at all,\u201d because success may very well be the result. \n \u00a0Ido describes his experience of autism as being trapped in his own body, with a mind that understands and a body that doesn\u2019t obey. Every nonverbal autistic communicator that we know of has expressed the same thing. How many more are waiting to find a way to express their thoughts and receive an education? Diminished expectations helps no one. I do not believe hope in this case is false, but rather, the denial of hope through misunderstanding and low expectations is what is false. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=7", "title": "False (Deprivation of) Hope"},

{"date": "July 17, 2012", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t I wrote the essay below several years ago when I was fourteen. It is published here for the first time. I hope to engage you in a dialogue about what autism is and how it is seen\u00a0 by many people. It is my hope that we can change the way we understand autism. \n What is Autism?  \n \n What is autism? It\u2019s a long list of behaviors, or is it more? A diagnosis of autism is made only by looking at symptoms. Eye contact impairment, hand flapping or social delay only describe my outside actions, not what is wrong in my brain. Which part of my brain is the source of hand flapping? Why is my motor control erratic? Is my lack of speaking a sign of retardation or is it something else? (It\u2019s something else I assure you). Is it a hint of what\u2019s wrong that my hands aren\u2019t coordinated or write legibly? How about my calm, flat face? Is it a sign of an empty shell or could it indicate a muscle/brain communication problem? \n \n In a condition that is diagnosed solely on behavior, it would be nice if experts asked these questions, but mine never did. They looked at my outside deficits and concluded that my inside was equally impaired. I was assumed to not understand language, to not recognize my parents from a stranger, to not have a thought more advanced than a toddler no matter my chronological age. It was supposed that my brain could be molded in increments by drilling me in basic material like nouns or people in my family\u2019s names or by telling me to jump or sit or touch my nose over and over. This was the educational model I grew up with. So, I am telling my experts what I couldn\u2019t tell them when I was stuck in my silent prison for so many years; you were wrong. Worse, you were treating the wrong symptoms.  \n \n I didn\u2019t need to be taught to understand. I understood everything as well as any other kid so I didn\u2019t need flashcard pictures of trees for my brain to understand a tree. What I had was a body that needed to learn how to listen to my brain\u2019s commands. I got answers wrong, not because I didn\u2019t understand concepts, or was too retarded and limited, but because my hand and my body didn\u2019t obey my brain consistently. I challenge those who study autism, and those who dictate our lives in school and home programs and in speech therapy and in OT and on and on, to imagine that the non-verbal autistic kid you see is not a mentally challenged person, however retarded he may appear, but is a thinking, interesting, understanding person whose body is a source of imprisonment. It is a new way of looking\u00a0 at the illness, but I tell you, hard as it may be to see it this way, it is the true illness- not the observed symptoms. \n \n My body is a source of frustration. It doesn\u2019t respond when it needs to. It does mindless stims instead of purposeful action. It traps me in silence. It is a true puzzle. But despite this, my thoughts are true and clear and I can think and think and think. I believe that now that more and more non-verbal autistic people are learning to communicate by pointing to letters and by typing that we need to determine our own educational needs. It is time to end educations determined by experts who see only our strange outsides and refuse to inquire about our normal insides. It is time to force experts to open their eyes to a thing called the truth. It\u2019s time because the devastating illness called autism can\u2019t be cured as long as experts don\u2019t see it in the accurate way. \n \n I want a cure and I want communication now for all those still trapped in silence. This is why I wrote my book (to be published soon) and it is my dream that it may help my friends and so many other autistic people and their families to be liberated too. In my essays I explain autism from the inside out. I challenge widely accepted theories and beliefs about autistic people and I explain where they are incorrect. I describe my early education so people can learn how it felt to be on the receiving end of this kind of instruction, and I will share my emergence into communication and hope.

It was like a fire in me. I felt so lost in a way because I lived a life of isolation since I was so limited in my ability to make friends. I felt really misunderstood in my dealings with professionals, and I was the only severely autistic kid in my general education classes. I wrote to help me deal with a miserably hard disability. I wrote to educate about incorrect but widely believed ideas about autism. I wrote about my weird early years in an intense home program that really missed the boat and left me terribly frustrated. I wrote about my journey to communication from total silence, and I wrote to help me accept myself.   I wrote on and off for three years. My mom felt my book was really important because it exposed the inner truth about autism. It took my dad longer to adjust to the idea of me being published because I would be scrutinized by everybody and he was wary of biased reactions- something I had encountered so much in my life. After lots of delays, we will finally have a book later this spring and I won\u2019t be alone in my message. I think at least three other books by non-verbal autistic people will be published too. It is a new trend. I am happy I will be part of it.

I started communicating on a letter board, a low tech way to point to letters. I still use this method often because it is fast, portable, and if I mess up a board there is no loss of expensive equipment. Here are some types of letter boards.\n \n \n   And mine has a math side too.\n \n   Now I have been using a dynawrite also with word prediction and voice output.\n \n   Some kids use a fusion,\n \n   or an iPad. Recently many non-verbal kids I know switched to iPads and like it. It shows their work in stored memory which is good for school.\n \n \n \n   The thing is, any method involving letters needs to be taught because autism limits the motor planning to do typing or pointing clearly. None of us learned this skill in school. We all went to someone who had to patiently teach us how to express our thoughts in this modality. Then our moms worked really hard with us at home.

I got together with a group of autistic friends who are all non-verbal and all communicate by typing. I guess sometimes it is necessary to see others do what you do to realize it is really not okay. I tend to grab appetizing things sometimes, even if it is from someone else\u2019s plate. I know it is bad manners. I have been told this many times, but impulsive behavior is not thinking behavior. I saw that my actions are really not acceptable when I saw others do the same. One mom had a drink that looked colorful. Two kids drank from it before she could stop them. The mothers of the drinkers were embarrassed and I thought, \u201cI do that.\u201d Then another family arrived and in seconds the son grabbed my mom\u2019s sandwich and took a bite. Too fast for her to stop him. At first she said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d when the embarrassed parents apologized. Then she said, \u201cI actually don\u2019t like it when people tell Ido it\u2019s okay because it\u2019s not. I want them to correct it.\u201d The parents agreed and said that people take more offense now that their son is older, so after that my mom told the boy that he shouldn\u2019t bite her sandwich and it\u2019s not okay to take food from her plate. I think people need to do this more.  My feeling is that people shouldn\u2019t excuse our bad behavior because we are disabled. When we are rude we need to be told that clearly and not enabled by understanding, polite tolerance of something that isn\u2019t acceptable. My mom wouldn\u2019t have let a dog snatch her food, let alone a human, but we tend to be too forgiving if people have autism. Don\u2019t worry.

It is like an alcoholic who runs to a bottle whenever he is sad or tense. It is a way to avoid working on things. It really makes the situation worse though. It is also unfair to the rest of the people who interact with the stimming person because he puts his challenges on them. In my Health class we are learning about drug abuse and alcoholism. I can\u2019t help but see a similarity in autistic stims. \n In the first place, a stim is a sensory trip of enjoyable feelings. It may start small but it can take over your life- not so much life, but all you do is less important than the stim itself if it is compelling. So, it is an escapist drug and it is addictive. I used to stim a lot as a young boy, especially before I could communicate. Now I stim less because I am engaged in life at a normal level, so I stay in the world as much as I can. I am thrilled about that because I don\u2019t want to live in Autismland flapping, tensing, and twirling my life away. It is hard but I am happy in school listening and learning.

I saw they were lost trying to find their way around, and lots of them were shorter than the older kids. Just like them I was nervous and had a hard time in school. I hope I am not sounding whiny when I say I can\u2019t cover up my feelings in the same way most people do. \n This week I watched the blind athlete, Erik Weihenmayer, compete on the adventure race TV program, Expedition Impossible. I wrote how his race was harder because he did it blind. His teammate, Ike, had a serious injury. His race was harder too. They came in second in spite of it. I never saw them stop in self pity or expect the race to be made easier for them. The victory was that they did so well.  I would love to meet them. I think it is a triumph because Erik is showing people that being disabled doesn\u2019t mean not living fully. \n He is a lucky man because he met Jeff. Jeff is his climbing partner; his eyes in a way. I would love to have a guide like Jeff to help me in my challenges too. He is optimistic and positive and calm so everyone else stays optimistic, positive and calm- and motivated. I have had the pleasure of some terrific support in school. The reason I can accomplish the goals I have set is thanks to people like Cathy, Katie, and others. I see how their relaxed demeanor helps me. It\u2019s important because I am nervous in school. \n This year I had a nervous aide for five miserable days. She was not a relaxed woman at all. I saw how everything got her tense. I saw how small things became big things because she over-reacted to them. I saw how she made my mom worried and me panicky. \n I think Erik needs calm, thinking Jeff to achieve his great accomplishments, like climbing Mt. Everest. Someone who leads with tension really hurts morale. I see it blocks thought too. It becomes about how they feel, not about working things through. I am sensitive to people\u2019s state of mind. I think nervous energy is transferred one to the other. In autism we are all easily flustered, so a person working with autistic people needs to be a calm type. \n Besides being a calm type, Jeff was also a leader because he got his team to work hard. No Limits was a sort of ambitious group. No one wanted to let his teammates down. So, I meander in my flow of thoughts and I reach this conclusion: Ike and Jeff respected and believed in Erik. They believed he could do it even though he was blind. They went on the adventure for joy, and the experience, not just to win. By their support of Erik, he was able to achieve amazing things. It didn\u2019t seem to be a bother to Jeff. He did it in stride. He would advise, \u201cDuck here\u201d, \u201cRock on the right\u201d, and so on. So Erik was calm and secure to the extent he could be. \n As I said earlier, in high school all freshmen are anxious. The school is so big and intimidating. In autism we all have anxiety issues when it\u2019s good, so when we are scared it is so much worse. If we are also being monitored by people with notepads, it is even more anxiety provoking. And if our support is not a relaxed person, guess what happens? \n Helen Keller had a calm Annie Sullivan to support her endeavors.  The people who assist the disabled must be a special type of person. I have mostly been lucky. I am eager to begin the next phase of my high school experience with a friend at my side helping me.

I push against the door to be let in to have a decent education, but I get in and find I\u2019m still stuck outside. What do I mean? I mean it\u2019s not easy to struggle against attitude. Maybe I need to develop a sense of humor about it. Maybe I\u2019m too sensitive for my own good. \n I gave a talk yesterday. A lot of my writings were read. In the Question and Answers at the end a nice lady asked if I really understood everything. Then after she was told yes, she incredulously repeated, \u201cEverything?\u201d The funny thing is, if I write smart ideas I must understand English, right? In the moment I felt mad, I must admit, but now I don\u2019t. I believe she expressed the doubt of many, actually, especially if she is a special educator or something like that. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t fit the model that people expect for a limited-verbal, hand-flapping oddball. Ha ha. I laugh at myself too. \n I have to assume that I kind of challenge assumptions about autistic people. I have to prove to people over and over that I really am communicating. They stand next to me, or behind me, or near me, and watch me type or point on the letter board. They find I move my own arm, react to their questions, and communicate for real. How many people have I done this for? OMG, it seems like thousands, but it is only dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens\u2026 \n They are professionals, and parents, and friends of my parents, and I have to prove myself to everyone so they know I am smart. I get it and I accept it. Maybe I need to get a movie of me typing we can put it on an i-phone and show them. Then I won\u2019t have to be observed like that. On the other hand, it is fun to see their skepticism vanish. I have sat with medical doctors, neuro-scientists, psychologists, and skeptics of all kinds. After a few minutes they stop doubting and I can relax. I suppose I need to laugh, but it\u2019s the people who assume I don\u2019t communicate or don\u2019t do my own work that bug me most of all.

Sometimes the weather is mild and we eat outside. This year it is already the wettest Thanksgiving season I can remember. I seasonally enjoy all my holidays. They get so associated with weather and seasonal foods, if I moved to Alaska it would be weird to have a snowy holiday, or in Hawaii, a beachy one.  \n The thing is, being the serious sort I am, I like to think about the reason for a holiday. In the case of Thanksgiving, it is to stop and remember that we have good luck in the fact that we live in a beautiful and free land. Often people forget to notice good fortune. They notice bad right away because they assume good fortune is the norm in life. It\u2019s not. In fact, few people are as lucky as we are with no hungry nights, a full pantry, school, choices in life, and the freedom to have a say in and even dispute our leaders. There are a lot of people who enjoy none of that, so I try not to have a too casual appreciation of my luck in that. \n To have autism in this land is even luckier. I am fully aware of how my life would have been if I had been born as strange as I am, in desperate poverty in a place that stigmatized the disabled as cursed. My shame would be to be hidden from sight, or tied to a rope, or institutionalized. In many places this occurs today.

It is sort of like travel into space, or time, or into a cartoon, in between the crowds and the long lines. The last time I was there I was so sensory overwhelmed I had a feeling of real fear. I saw dark tunnels in the lines, darkness in the rides with sudden bright colors bursting out.  In the really kiddy-oriented ride, Winnie-the-Pooh, I was so bombarded by bright colors in the darkness, I almost panicked. I had to control myself from fleeing. \n The Pirates of the Caribbean is so dimly lit I couldn\u2019t bring myself to even get into the boat. I know the people I was with were disappointed, but I couldn\u2019t do it then. I wish I could because I rode it when I was little and it is a cool experience of animation in moving figures. \n My favorite ride is the Jungle Cruise. It is mellow in a visual sense because it is naturalistic. I enjoy pretending I\u2019m on a safari. \n I also love the Autopia because I can pretend I\u2019m driving even though it is easily the loudest environment imaginable. I need my headphones all day in Disneyland. I like Tom Sawyer Island too. It is fun but my sensory system is always stopping me from doing things. I can run on the paths, bridges, and so on, but I balk at entering the caves. My mind knows they are safe. My system says, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d \n Somehow I did the Indiana Jones ride. I can\u2019t believe I did, in retrospect.  It is dark, scary and fast- all things my system hates, but it was really exciting and I was entertained by it. It was not in bright colors so my visual field could cope. I would do it again, believe it or not. \n The roller coasters scare me so much. I have the fear of flying out so I can\u2019t ride the Matterhorn or Big Thunder Railroad. I know I won\u2019t fly out, but I feel almost panicky even thinking about these rides. \n It\u2019s a Small World is a really terrible ordeal. The colors, lights and incessant song drive me bonkers. \n The Haunted Mansion is creepy. I can do it though. It is not dark in the beginning so I can go in. Once it\u2019s underway I am fine and it is super creative and well done. \n I think I shouldn\u2019t go to Amusement Parks because money is wasted on me. I want to do rides I can\u2019t get myself on. I hate crowds of people and noise. I think I need the beach or trails to relax. My sister is a huge fan of Disneyland and went this week. I remember my last trip there vividly. It was so hot, crowded and noisy. I tried to cope but I struggled to enjoy myself. The conclusion I had is I can\u2019t go if it is crowded or hot. \n I know some autistic kids who love the sensory high of Disneyland.  They go on roller-coasters over and over. They have sort of a drug-experience on some of the rides. In my case it is not a stream of sensory pleasure, it is an assault on my overly sensitive system. It is an amazingly creative place, but on a scale of one to ten it is an eleven in terms of sensory challenges. To give you a hint of my experience, imagine all the rides at deafening volume, the colors at dizzying intensity, the dark shadows ominously terrifying, the heat oppressively scorching, and the sea of humanity incessant. Well, that was my last trip there two years ago. Disneyland is a test of autism endurance, but it is a cool place in any event.\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-prVna3ZJZwI/TmG7inzl9BI/AAAAAAAAACY/W0n592OgNPg/s1600/disney-parade-2.jpg"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=128", "title": "Autism in Disneyland"},

This is a quote from Gabrielle Giffords new book about her brain trauma and rehabilitation. \n \u201cIn the first weeks after Gabby was injured, she couldn\u2019t say anything at all, which left her terribly scared. She felt trapped inside herself. By mid-February, Gabby had begun formulating words, but they were often delivered haltingly or incorrectly. Her speech therapist handed her a photo of a chair and asked her what she was looking at. \u201cSpoon,\u201d Gabby said. \u201cSpoon.\u201d When shown a lamp, Gabby said, \u201ccheeseburger.\u201d  She also got stuck on random words. No matter what she meant to say, the same word, \u201cchicken,\u201d often came out in a burst: \u201cChicken, chicken, chicken.\u201d  For Gabby it was almost unbearably frustrating.\u201d \n Oh, does this ever sound familiar. It is interesting how Gabrielle Giffords got the benefit of the doubt. Pretty soon she got better too, so she is extremely fortunate. In autism we kind of live there all our lives. Each neurological challenge is different, but autism does not get the benefit of the doubt. People assume we get the word wrong because we don\u2019t know the word. It isn\u2019t true in my case.

The challenges are why I am easily the most different kid you have in your classes. I have a serious neurological difference. Recently a neuroscientist I know told me that it is theorized that autistic people have a surplus of neurons. Our brains don\u2019t prune properly. The result is a communication interference between thought and action. This is why I don\u2019t speak with my mouth or why my writing is messy. It is also why I am impulsive or emotional with poor brakes. It is awful for me to sometimes be the follower of my actions. I am struggling daily to master them. \n The second challenge is attacks of anxiety. In autism we often are anxious, nervous, and worried. That\u2019s when things are good. In real stress we sometimes are overwhelmed. Starting High School was really overwhelming and I lost my self-control. I am trying so hard to do well and I hope you see I am improving. I regret any disruption I caused and I will try to be a more relaxed student in the future. \n One additional stress was that I was not with the right aide at the start of the school year. I think I need to work on finding good matches who help me stay calm. I have this now with Cathy. I did not have that before so I became stressed and even frightened. \n I want you all to know that my education is a thing I value very much. It is challenging to be the only autistic kid like me in school. I know other students have autism but they are verbal or with less severe symptoms. Now I struggle to show that people like me can be educated too. I think the vast majority of people with my degree of autism have only a simple and very basic education of alphabet, arithmetic, and not much more. It was my good fortune that I was able to learn to communicate on letter board or computer with my one finger. Thanks to that, my education is possible. It liberated me from total isolation. \n I know you are all busy and I appreciate you welcoming me to your classes. I realize you may get worried about whether I do my own work.  I do all the thinking work but I don\u2019t do the hand-writing.  I invite you to watch me on my letter board and see for yourself how it is done. I have had several teachers do this. It is helpful to see I work on my own assignments, moving my own arm, and not being manipulated. I would be happy to show you any time you wish to observe. \n Sincerely, \n Ido \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=125", "title": "Letter to My Teachers"},

It stops us from doing the normal social things and it makes people want to avoid us too because we are so different and so hard to engage. \n I have a few suggestions for how to be a friend to an autistic person. \n -Don\u2019t patronize, even if the person seems \u201clow-functioning\u201d. Who knows what is trapped inside? \n -Stay friendly and say \u201chi\u201d even if the autistic person is not animated in expression or doesn\u2019t say \u201chi\u201d first. \n -Try to imagine what non-verbal messages the person is communicating in behavior. \n -Help them stop if they get too stimmy. \n -Connect in the ways you can.  \n  I see some people are able to reach through the barrier with autistic people. They are energetic, friendly, not putting up with aggressive or bad behavior, positive and calm.  The worst traits for an autistic person to be around are the opposite; lazy, grumpy, weak and afraid to set limits, negative and tense. I mean, who likes being with negative, grumpy people?

He is overwhelmed and scared and being watched. It is hard to be scared and overwhelmed and scrutinized. In his case he suffers more because he can\u2019t communicate with his one-on-one.

The weather turns bad and he and his partner are exposed on soft snow they can\u2019t hang onto. The snow blocks their vision and the partner accidentally lowers Simpson over a ledge. He is hanging in the air pulling his partner off too. The partner decides to cut the line. Simpson falls into a deep crevasse. \n From there I can only tell you he endures super-human challenges.  I watched how he did it.  First, he focused on what to do, not on how he felt. If he panicked, he re-focused on his task rapidly. He had no one but himself to rely on, but he was thinking constantly, not in self-pity but on how to keep moving forward. One strategy he had was to make small goals that he had to achieve by a certain time. Once he reached his goal he immediately made a new one. This kept him moving forward all the time, but with small goals he could achieve, rather than a seemingly impossible huge goal. In this way, inch by inch, he crawled off a mountain to life. \n I couldn\u2019t help reflect on autism when I saw this. Working out of a neurological illness is kind of like being in a crevasse.

They try to help by talking slowly and giving me high-fives. They are well intended. I am not angry at not knowing and being kind.

I feel the presence of God and it gives me hope. \n \n In my silent years I was dialoging internally all the time with God because he was filling my lonely days with hope.

The blindness of neuro-typicals is to miss the spiritual too often, and my blindness is in self control. I guess I have to be grateful for this pipeline that autism has given me to a rich relationship in faith and not just empty rote actions.

I think I need to say thanks to the school. \n In my education, I never had the chance to show my knowledge until middle school. It was the first school that accepted me as a student who could learn at grade level. They accepted me as a person who was different but not who needed to be kept from regular education.

Classes were interesting or boring, like any other student\u2019s experience. It was normal boring, not a mind numbing denial of education boring. I am grateful to my middle school for that. Some teachers understood me and my situation better than others. Some were not very insightful at all. Some were open-minded and some were probably annoyed to have a disabled student crowding their classroom with an aide. The truth is, they all gave me a chance. Some people really never have this opportunity. It was hard, but a great thing to learn and be part of regular classes. \n I think some people were amazingly helpful so I want to to acknowledge them. First, I want to give special thanks to my wonderful aide, Cathy, for the patience of a saint, her lovely disposition, reliability, and wonderful communication skills.

{"date": "January 28, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t \n By Edlyn Pena, guest blogger \n \n As a researcher who studies ways to support the access and success of students with autism in higher education and a mom to a handsome six-year old son who uses an iPad to communicate, I aim to help Ido advance his message to educators, professionals, and caregivers. My objective here is to provide context and encourage you to learn more about approaches that enable nonverbal individuals to spell and type to communicate. I\u2019ve received criticism for endorsing approaches like Rapid Prompting Method (RPM) because they are not evidence-based. There is still much speculation in the autism community about the legitimacy of RPM and other approaches that teach pointing to letters and typing. Research on these methods are lacking. I understand that professionals will continue to question these methods until they are rigorously studied and published in peer reviewed journals. I am the first to believe in well-designed research studies. As an academic, I also believe in being open to new possibilities, ideas, and presuming competence in individuals on the spectrum. Without this openness, I would have never exposed my own son, Diego, to RPM. He would not be where he is today with regard to sharing how autism affects him daily (e.g. \u201cPaying attention is tiring\u201d) and to articulating unusual ideas (e.g. \u201cEight elephants play in a new kind of ecosystem\u201d). I would not know the level of depth of thought and curiosity hidden in his mind. Diego\u2019s voice is now being heard. \n Ido is a pioneer in advancing our knowledge about autism and people with complex communication challenges. Ido\u2019s book,  Ido in Autismland , is by far the most powerful book I have read about autism. Other authors write compelling books about autism, prompting us to think about those on the autism spectrum. But Ido is different. He is extraordinary because he   changes   the way we  think  about autism. He disrupts our misguided notions that lack of speech equates to lack of intelligence; that students with autism are impoverished of expressing or recognizing emotions; and that all students who are non-verbal belong in special day classes without the opportunity for inclusion. Contrary to many of the messages the world receives on a daily basis about people with autism, Ido\u2019s book tells us that the minds of people with autism are as complex, creative, and intelligent as yours and mine. \n \n On a personal level, reading Ido\u2019s book was transformative and allowed my relationship with my son to turn a corner. I now talk to Diego like I would any other smart and capable 6-year-old. I make efforts to talk  to  Diego, not  about  him, when he\u2019s in the room. Ido, Diego, and children like them are nonverbal, affected by autism, and brilliant. By typing to communicate, they blow us away with their complex insights, imaginative ideas, and witty humor. \n If you are a professional in the autism field, I invite you to think outside of the box about what \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d on autism tells us. Without doubt, this takes courage. It means acknowledging that we do not know everything about autism. You might learn, as I did, that our perceptions about the capabilities of non-verbal individuals are wrong. Rather than dismiss RPM or other approaches to support typing, I encourage you to educate yourself about the approaches. Interact with individuals who have learned to type. Read Ido\u2019s book or watch videos of children and teenagers who point to letter boards or type independently. For example, \n \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvn7kYJyOFM \n And, of course, Ido has posted great video clips of him typing on this website. For example,  \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLtQWXdDCFo \n From one professional to another and from one parent to another, I urge you to take a chance to learn more before dismissing approaches to support our children who otherwise have limited means to communicate. We have the power to make real change by enabling the individuals we care for and serve to communicate in rich and meaningful ways. \n -Edlyn Vallejo Pe\u00f1a, Ph.D. \n www.EdlynPena.com \n Assistant Professor \n Graduate School of Education California Lutheran University \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvn7kYJyOFM", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLtQWXdDCFo"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=5", "title": "Challenging and Changing Perspectives"},
{"date": "February 16, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t \n The theories regarding autism have been based on observation of our odd behaviors. Lists of these behaviors make a diagnosis. I have limited independence in selfcare. I have limited eye contact. I have flat affect often. I can\u2019t express my ideas verbally. I have poor fine motor control. I have impaired initiation. I have impaired gross motor control. I have difficulty controlling intense emotions. I have impulse control challenges and self stimulatory behavior. \n \n Whew. When I write that it sounds pretty bad, but I function adequately in this world. I am now 17 and I am a fulltime high school student in a general education program. I am in Honors Chemistry, Honors US History and Honors English. I am in Algebra 2, Spanish and Animal Sciences. I get straight As. I work out with a trainer 2 or 3 times a week to get fit. I study piano. I hike, cook, and help take care of a horse. I am invited to speak at universities and autism agencies. I am the author of  Ido in Autismland , and a blogger as well. I have friends. \n \n I say this, not to brag, but to let you know that people like me, with severe autism, who act weirdly and who can\u2019t speak, are not less human, as Dr. Lovaas suggested, and are not doomed to live lives of rudimentary information and bored isolation .( \u201cYou have a person in a physical sense \u2014 they have hair, a nose and a mouth \u2014 but they are not people in the psychological sense,\u201d the late Ivar Lovaas, a UCLA researcher, said in a 1974 interview with Psychology Today). \n \n   \n \n I communicate by typing on an iPad with an app that has both word prediction and voice output. I also \u00a0  communicate by using good, old-fashioned letterboard pointing. If I had not been taught to point to letters or to type without tactile support, many people would never have realized that my mind was intact. \n \n My childhood was not easy because I had no means to communicate at all, despite my 40 hours a week of intensive ABA therapy. I pointed to flashcards and I touched my nose, but I had no means to convey that I thought deeply, understood everything, but was locked internally. Meticulously collected data showed my incorrect answers to flashcard drills, but the limitations of theory are in the interpretations. \n \n My mistakes were proof to my instructors of my lack of comprehension or intelligence, so we did the same boring, baby lessons year after boring year. How I dreamed of being able to communicate the truth then to my instructors and my family too, but I had no way to express my ideas. All they gave me was the ability to request foods and basic needs. \n \n Here is what I would have told them if I could have when I was small. My body isn\u2019t under my mind\u2019s complete control. I know the right answer to these thrilling flashcards, unfortunately my hand isn\u2019t fully under my control either. My body is often ignoring my thoughts. I look at my flashcards. You ask me to touch \u2018tree,\u2019 for example, and though I can clearly differentiate between tree, house, boy and whatever cards you have arrayed, my hand doesn\u2019t consistently obey me. My mind is screaming, \u201cDon\u2019t touch house!\u201d It goes to house. Your notes say, \u201cIdo is frustrated in session today.\u201d Yes, frustration often occurs when you can\u2019t show your intelligence and neurological forces impede communication between mind and body and experts then conclude that you are not cognitively processing human speech. \n \n In my childhood I feared I would remain stuck forever in this horrible trap, but I was truly fortunate to be freed when I was 7 when my mother realized my mind was intact, and both my parents searched to find a way to help me communicate without tactile support. \n \n Thousands of autistic people like me live life in isolation and loneliness, denied education, condemned to baby talk and high fives, and never able to express a thought. The price of assuming that nonverbal people with autism have impaired thinking is a high one to families and to people who live in solitary confinement within their own bodies. It is high time professionals rethought their theories. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Ido-Autismland-Climbing-Autisms-Silent/dp/0988324709/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1390458886&sr=1-1&keywords=ido+in+autismland", "http://www.latimes.com/news/local/autism/la-me-autism-day-one-html,0,1218038.htmlstory#ixzz2tWwMPs7m"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=4", "title": "A Challenge to Autism Professionals"},

It is really nice because the students care for the animals. Over vacation we have to feed them. There are rabbits, hens, sheep, goats, a horse and a llama. The goats are intelligent and eager to escape to eat leaves. They have the same lock the sheep have on their pen. The sheep can\u2019t open it but the goats open it with ease. To stay in, they require an additional chain and clasp lock and if it isn\u2019t on just right, they escape. \n \n Today was my turn to feed, water, clean and exercise the animals (that is, I exercise and clean the horse and feed and water the rest). We went to give the goats fresh water and in a flash they opened the gate and rushed out to eat leaves. They group up and run away and resist you too so it can be a struggle to get them back in, and the first ones you catch only want to escape to get back to the leaves and their friends. \n \n I was watching this because I was with my mom who asked me to help her with the gate. I am able to do everything I need to do, more or less, but it felt frustrating today because I saw that I still react so slowly in a moment that required speed. I knew I needed to move fast because she had a goat at the gate and didn\u2019t want to lock up the gate completely since there were more she had to put back in the pen. They struggle to get back to their leaves with great intensity and it is a pain to hold a struggling goat with one hand and fumble with a lock with the other. \n \n Autism is an initiation disorder too. I see where I should go and I stay frozen. Doing new tasks is tough because our bodies need to learn the steps. The steps in this moment would be clear to a neuro-typical body, but not to mine. Though my mind knew what to do, it just wasn\u2019t ready to react in time. This is frustrating personally, but perhaps even worse is that our difficulty initiating certain responses confuses many specialists who then assume we don\u2019t understand logic and basic problem solving. \n It isn\u2019t the thinking that\u2019s the problem. It is the ability to react and follow our thoughts that we struggle with. I see my skills have improved, because eventually I got to the gate and held it against goats pushing with all their might to escape again. In the end, we got them all back in. Maybe next time we should let them out on purpose so I can get more practice reacting to emergency situations more quickly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=6", "title": "Autism and the Challenge of Rapid Motor Planning and Initiation in New Situations"},

Chemistry was fascinating too. Learning how our universe is composed is thrilling to me. Me gusta aprender espa\u00f1ol tambi\u00e9n. I learned a lot about math and animal science too. All this is thanks to my index finger and typing my thoughts. \n I have the desire to pursue a college degree. One more year of high school and this dream will be a reality. Over spring break I visited many colleges with my parents. It will be different than all day, every day, of high school in one place going room to room. But I will have the opportunity to get more education in biology, neuroscience and other fields, and maybe I can help improve our understanding of autism in more ways. \n I push myself to get good grades. It matters to me that my grades show my intelligence. My teachers were great. They pretty easily adjusted to my mode of communication and welcomed me warmly. My life is so rich now. I have friends in school. I love to go. \n My message is to parents who wonder if their child can learn. Only the most determined parents will find out. If you are working with experts like those from my early life, they limit your child in low expectations. They tell you that being impaired in body is being impaired in mind. They let you work on skills that barely progress and tell you that your child isn\u2019t advanced enough to write. \n If you keep on listening to them they will keep low expectations for a lifetime. I know it is hard to be the parent who disagrees. I watched my mom try to deal with my ABA team when I began to communicate at seven. I have\u00a0 watched our friends fight school district attitudes. They went through a big hard slog. They also got their kids typing and into general education. More than anything else, the parents believed in the possibility that their child had more in them than they were told. Parents, you have to trust your guts. You see your kid all day in real life. They see a drill or a lesson, and these moments where the motor issues of severe autism are at their worst. \n Professionals, I have a message for you too. I used to think you were all clueless and control freaks. This is not to say that people were not warm or kind because I liked my clueless teachers as people but resented their attitude of certainty. If you work with autism, be prepared to accept that a degree in psychology or sociology or speech pathology or occupational therapy isn\u2019t giving an insight into more than symptoms. My brain and how it\u2019s impaired is a guessing game, even for neurologists, so I think the certainty that many practitioners have when it comes to autism is really puzzling. Being open-minded and admitting that the brain is vast and mysterious is required, in my opinion, by anyone who works with severely autistic people. \n Now I have a message for people with autism who can\u2019t yet communicate, and I ask parents to read my essay to their kids, Have hope. More than anything, have determination. Life outside your head and stims is really worth striving for. I believe soon there will be too many people with autism who type to keep insisting we are one in a million. I am fighting for your freedom and so are others.

It is a reminder that advocates can be high school students or politicians, or anyone else. We just need to care deeply about a cause. \n As you look at me, some of you must be wondering if I really wrote my speech. \nAfter all, you\u2019ve probably heard that most nonverbal autistic people have low cognition, no insight, no theory of mind, no inner world and poor receptive language. \n Guess who told you that? It wasn\u2019t people with autism, that\u2019s for sure. \n I have a very misunderstood condition. My disability is caused by my brain\u2019s faulty linkage to my motor system. So truly, I think and understand though I may look like I don\u2019t. Add to that a sensory system that is malfunctioning, and you have an idea how tough it can be. \n The truth is, autism itself is easier than the incorrect assumptions by the so-called experts and specialists out there. A locked-in, motor impaired, sensory overwhelmed child cannot escape this on his own. Consequently, few nonverbal autistic people learn to communicate. Experts comfort themselves that we can\u2019t communicate because we don\u2019t understand. \n I got fed up with this, because all around me are smart autistic people dying of boredom and loneliness, not able to communicate one idea more sophisticated than a basic need. \n My decision at twelve was to speak out and correct this misinformation. \n I was denied an education in elementary school because of the expert opinion that an academic curriculum was beyond my intellectual abilities. Now I am an AP student in 12th grade, ready to go to college next year. If my parents had listened to my experts I would still be stagnating in 1+2=3 expectations. \n Things are changing gradually. Other autistic typers are speaking out too. We face resistance by people who believe theories over truth.

{"date": "March 19, 2015", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t I believe it is time to look at severe autism in a new way. The theories that determine treatment for young children are based on long held beliefs that autism is a processing problem of language and conceptual thinking.According to some theories we cannot recognize emotions, we cannot visually distinguish relatives and friends from other faces, or know right from wrong. Some have even declared that we even cannot recognize a human being from an object.That\u2019s pretty bad, huh. \n Is this iPad living, or an object? Maybe incessant drills on flashcards will clear that up.\u00a0Perhaps I have been introduced to all of you by an object, not a person. How can I tell that a person is not a machine? The same way that all of you can tell. \n I guess the solution for decades has been flashcard drills to drill on nouns, verbs, people\u2019s names, commands, and on and on. It is a familiar start in life for a lot of us.\u00a0But why should I be drilled on what I already know as well as everyone else? From my point of view, it\u2019s a pretty insulting premise. \n To base a person\u2019s education on these assumptions is risky because a boring day of \u2018what is the weather?\u2019 drills, or touch your nose lessons, does not teach what one needs to learn. I suppose if people really don\u2019t understand, or cannot recognize the difference between mom and dad, or mom and a table, these common methods might help. \n But autism is not that disorder. \n The autism I have is not a language processing problem or a lack of understanding anything. I want this point crystal clear. My mind is fully, totally intact. In fact, my experience is that most nonverbal autistic people have intact minds too. \n Here is your challenge. Stop looking at our weird movements, blank faces, lack of speech, trouble handwriting, poor self control, and on and on, as proof of intellectual delay. It may look like it, but I think looks here deceive.\u00a0Believe me when I tell you that if I could look normal on the outside I would do it immediately. I am normal on the inside. \n That\u2019s different than what people with Asperger\u2019s say, or what Temple Grandin writes in her books. But that\u2019s because Asperger\u2019s Syndrome in severe form is not what I have. \n I hope that\u2019s clear because it confuses many professionals. Different neurological problems have the same DSM diagnosis. That\u2019s confusing. I think it would be like putting AIDS and head colds under the same heading because they\u2019re both viruses. Too much is covered under the heading, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and this misleads an understanding of what I have. \n So now, let me tell you what I have. Autism for me is a severe problem. \n How would you like it if your thoughts didn\u2019t reach your body consistently? What I mean is that your thoughts are intact but internally neurological forces block them from your motor system so that messages get messed up, or ignored, or occasionally they get through. That can resemble not understanding, but it is not. \n Nevertheless, the person cannot necessarily demonstrate intact thinking due to the motor issues that block speaking, handwriting, gestures, facial expressions, initiating actions, and more. So, smart intact people may spend years, or even their whole lives, in a body that traps them behind weird movements and unreliable, inconsistent responses. More than that, neurological forces may affect the sensory system, making sounds too loud or visual stimulation overwhelming.\u00a0The frustration is compounded by autism experts who dumb down learning because of their belief that autism is a language processing problem. \n When I was young I did ABA. No offense to any ABA people here, but for me it was a horrid experience. I found those early years of drills and reinforcements an exercise in boredom because I already knew the vocabulary they taught. I just had unreliable hands to point to the flashcards accurately. The baby talk, and most frustrating, the supervision sessions that never worked on my real challenges, made me feel frustrated and angry. Worse, the theories probably delayed my mom\u2019s ability to recognize my true potential by several years, at least. \n No offense to any Floortime people here, but I never got much out of my sessions because my play was so delayed when I was small. I craved more than the games I got. But my Floortime was minimal. I was drowning in ABA drills instead. \n No offense to OT people here, but what I desperately needed was motor control and physical fitness, and I never got that. I got swings that spun me. Once until I barfed. \n No offense to special ed teachers, but when I couldn\u2019t show my intelligence, I still was thinking. But all I got was one plus one, ABC and the weather. My recommendation is to teach at least some age appropriate lessons and books, even before the student can express his thoughts. Who knows how much is locked inside? \n My helpers were kind and well meaning, but the way I was taught missed my real needs for communication and motor control simply because the methods assumed I did not understand spoken language\u00a0and therefore needed a rudimentary lifestyle. \n What helped? Soma did. She gave me the ability to type on a letter board when I was seven through her method, Rapid Prompt Method, or RPM. This has progressed to a keyboard and ipad. Because of this, I am a general education student, college bound, on the high honor roll in AP classes and even learning a foreign language. I work out with a trainer and I hike and run and row on a machine at home. I also took piano lessons. These things helped me. \n To all the professionals I offended earlier, sorry. I admire your devotion, compassion and caring. I challenge you to see your nonverbal autistic students differently and with high expectations for learning. \n Parents, don\u2019t give up hope. If you see intelligence, even if brief, then intelligence is there. It\u2019s most likely inconsistent because of those frustrating neurological forces I mentioned. \n Communication is a blessing. Lack of communication is a curse. Let\u2019s give kids the blessing of communication and a real hope for tomorrow. \n Thank you. \n www.profectum.org \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=317", "title": "My Speech at the Profectum Conference"},

As bad as I feel about our understanding of autism here in the US and how hard it remains for so many people, I now understand how much worse it is in other countries.

Most significantly, my school district allowed me to be educated in regular classes once I proved my intelligence by typing on a letter board.

{"date": "January 26, 2015", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t \n One of the big complaints of skeptics who refuse to believe nonverbal people with autism can communicate is about support. They have significant doubts if anyone receives tactile support. In fact, if anyone receives tactile support they are sure the communication is fake. I think, to be fair, that sometimes it is hard to tell how much is the autistic person and how much is the aide, just by looking, but sometimes it is quite obvious that the support is just there for emotional support or anxiety control. It is minimal, a light touch far from the hand or arm and totally not prompting movement. My good friend likes a hand on his shoulder when he types. It gives him stability. If someone put a hand on your shoulder could you write accurately in a language you don\u2019t understand but the other person could? I doubt it, but try and see if it\u2019s possible. \n But skeptics aren\u2019t even satisfied with independent typing. I type with no tactile support, no prompts at all except for a reminder to keep going or to pay attention if I get distracted or pause too long. Still skeptics are concerned that someone sits a foot away from me and imagine that through some magical means I am typing their thoughts. If I was alone in the room, they say, then they could believe I was really typing my own thoughts. \n I am somewhat fed up with this because they do not understand the nature of neurological instability and anxiety in autism. They have an innate bias in believing that autistic minds are not capable of understanding language. If that\u2019s so, why bother to drill us with flashcards? \n How many times have nonverbal people emerged from an inability to communicate, often due to a body movement problem, to show that they were hearing and understanding all along but were trapped and unable to show it? \n My father, who is a scientist, talked about the unknown impact of emotional support on anxiety and performance and he shared the example of King George in the film,  The King\u2019s Speech . King George suffered from a terrible stutter. He was unable to speak in public without stuttering and stammering continuously and with great anxiety and humiliation. Forced to become king when his brother abdicated the throne, George had to overcome his speaking problems to deliver speeches to the British people as Britain entered World War II and to help keep up their morale throughout the war. \n His speech therapist, Lionel Logue, was always with him when he spoke to provide emotional support. He never left the room. So, looking at the situation skeptically, should we say that the king lacked the ability to deliver speeches and was Lionel Logue\u2019s puppet? If judged by the same standard as people with autism who type, perhaps we can determine that he was not capable. \n Let\u2019s keep an open mind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=306", "title": "Communication, anxiety and neurological instability."},

{"date": "October 27, 2015", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t I believe exercise is one of the most important early interventions for autism. In so many cases I see people with autism who barely walk ten feet and have no muscle tone, yet no one works on fitness with them. In a mind/body communication disconnect, early exercise programs can help forge a better communication network between body and brain. I\u2019m sure the kid gym classes I took as a toddler and a young boy helped me be more coordinated, though I wish I had had more intensive help in several areas I will discuss. If I had received that support when I was younger I would have an easier time now in fitness. \n In no particular order I recommend early intervention in: \n 1. stretching, \n 2. coordination\u2013especially bilateral movements \n 3. cardio work, such as hiking and running \n 4. strength training. \n My biggest motor obstacle today is that I have tight muscles and tendons.

I feel that it should have been noticed by adaptive PE teachers, or occupational therapists, or other professionals working with me physically, but they never said a word. Physical assessments looking at \u00a0the areas I mentioned should be standard because catching problems early makes them easier to fix. \n Since professionals may miss things, parents should be vigilant and try to work on stretching, cardio, strength and coordination with their kids starting when they are young and making it part of their lifestyle.

{"date": "November 3, 2015", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t Last year I was asked by two neuro-researchers to describe my mind/motor problems to be part of a scholarly research paper they were publishing in a neurology journal. My personal experiences helped support their clinical findings. In other words, their data was validated by my life experiences. Unfortunately, papers get rejected all the time in scientific journals. I believe and hope their findings will still be published, however my essay will not be included as the editors determined that what I wrote was too personal and unscientific for their venue (meaning not research based). This is true. My essay is not research based. It is biographical. My essay is merely a description of my life and struggles that I hoped would intrigue more researchers to look into motor issues and autism. \n I figure, why waste a perfectly good essay? The editors suggested I find another venue to publish my essay and I decided that my blog is the perfect venue to share \u201cMotor Difficulties in Severe Autism.\u201d \n Motor Difficulties in Severe Autism \n by Ido Kedar \n Most theories about severe autism that are used today by educators and other professionals are based on the premise that severe nonverbal autism is a learning problem with receptive and expressive language delay, low cognitive capacity, concrete thinking, lack of humor, lack of empathy, lack of theory of mind, and often even an absence in basic awareness of the surrounding world. The expressionless faces, inability to make eye contact, the sometimes bizarre looking self-stimulatory behavior, and the inability to speak can make intelligent people appear not to be. As a person with autism, this is deeply frustrating. When I meet strangers for the first time, they often presume I need baby talk because of my outer presentation. I cannot stop my neurological forces from camouflaging my real essence. Inside there is a person who thinks, feels, jokes, and has a lot to say. On the outside, people see my odd movements. \n If I had not been taught how to control my hand enough to type with my index finger on a keyboard, iPad or letter board, my ideas, jokes and thoughts would have been known only to myself. This is how it is for thousands of people with autism who cannot communicate. Their outside appearance is compromised by strange compulsive movements like hand flapping, waving strings, carrying random objects around, pacing, impulsive actions and odd vocalizations, and beyond that they may have difficulty following directions to simple tasks or questions, adding to the impression that they are intellectually delayed. The challenge for professionals is to imagine that in spite of a person having these very visible external challenges, for many, these behaviors have nothing to do with intelligence but rather are due to a disconnect between the brain systems responsible for thought and movement. \n I hope to prompt a conversation among professionals, researchers, parents and others to reconsider current treatment trends. It is my hope that more and more severely autistic people receive a normal education, be able to express their thoughts and ideas and be able to live full lives, as I struggle to do every day. \n Not Speaking is Not the Same as Not Thinking \n If a person cannot speak, cannot control his hand to write, cannot control his facial muscles to express his feelings at will (hence the flat affect of autism), cannot gesture, and cannot hold a pencil to write, how can this person prove that he understands? Why is it commonly assumed that a person with these challenges has cognitive delay when everything I mentioned in the previous sentence can also be seen as an example of a motor issue? When I was a small child I had ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) therapy forty hours a week. I sat at a table and I was asked to demonstrate my understanding of basic concepts by pointing to flashcards arrayed in front of me during drills. My instructors took data regarding whether I pointed to the right card or not. They thought they were collecting data on my receptive understanding of language. They were not. I understood everything, as any other child my age would. The data they were collecting, though they did not know it, actually measured my poor ability at that time to get my hand to touch with accuracy the card I wanted, and did not reflect an accurate measure of how much I understood. My mind might be screaming, \u201cTouch tree! Don\u2019t touch house!\u201d and I would watch, like a spectator, as my hand went to the card my hand, not my brain, wanted. And down in the data book it would be marked that I had not yet mastered the concept of tree. This is the neurological force that needs to be studied. \n The inability I had to express my ideas verbally, in addition to these motor difficulties, meant that I was locked internally. Unlike Stephen Hawking who lost his motor control progressively as an adult, but who is widely recognized to be an intelligent person despite being unable to speak or control his hand, I was born with my speech problem. From my earliest education, the presumption was that I was limited and didn\u2019t understand. How could I prove otherwise when I was never taught to communicate until years later? If Stephen Hawking had been born with his current communicative disability, would the experts who assumed I was unable to understand language, have believed the same about him and never given him his assistive technology? I argue that many nonverbal autistic people are intellectually normal but are locked internally in bodies that do not obey their minds, making them appear to not understand. They deserve the opportunity to learn how to communicate. \n Body-Mind Disconnect \n When I was young my body rarely obeyed my mind. If I wanted to say no, my mouth said yes. If I wanted to say yes, my mouth said no. For example, I remember going to a restaurant with my family when I was small. I wanted to eat chicken. My mother asked me if I wanted to eat beef. In frustration I heard my mouth say \u201cyes.\u201d I had no way to correct this and got stuck with a dinner I didn\u2019t want. This kind of frustrating experience happened often because of the unreliability of my verbal responses. I had similar unreliability with my motor system. As I described in the previous section, if I wanted to point to a flashcard in an ABA drill my hand often went to the wrong card against my mind\u2019s wishes. My mind would tell me to walk to one room. My feet would insist on taking me to another. My mind wanted to open the car window. My hand repeatedly went to the door. My hands could not count the right number of straws or forks, though my mind knew the right number. This frustrating experience is is like gambling by rolling dice. My dice might land on my body not listening to me at all, or perhaps it would land on enabling me to do an action partially and inadequately, or perhaps it would land me on another neurological tangent altogether in self-stimulatory movements, or if I was lucky, the dice might land on enabling me to do exactly what I wished to do. \n In my book ( Kedar 2012 ), I describe how when I was small we visited relatives and my mother instructed me to give my aunt a bouquet of flowers. The problem was that my aunt was behind me and my other relatives were in front of me. What does a kid do who cannot initiate a search motorically? I gave the flowers to the person I saw, knowing it was not my aunt. If I grabbed the wrong can from the shelf after being instructed to get an item, it was not because I lacked the knowledge of what tuna fish was, it was because at that time I lacked the ability to search and scan. I still cannot adjust my blankets in bed or even initiate moving to get another blanket if I am cold. Does that mean I\u2019m too stupid to identify how I feel? No, it means I can\u2019t get my body to do what I want it to do, when I want it to, with reliability and consistency. This is entrapment. It is not receptive and expressive language confusion, and most definitely not a lack of thought, emotions and awareness. In my opinion, this is like a paralysis of intentional responses. When it comes to self-stimulatory behavior, I often cannot get my body to stop moving to its internal impulses though I may desperately want it to, and at other times, such as when I lie in bed unable to move to my desire to pull on another blanket, I cannot get my body to listen to me at all. \n Finally, there are times when impulses completely overcome the mind like a lizard brain overcoming my intellect. I found cotton candy nearly impossible to resist when I was young and I seldom got it because it was so full of sugar and food coloring. My family and I might be walking through a crowded fair, and if I spotted a kid eating cotton candy, I might quickly snatch off a piece and pop it in my mouth, if no one was fast enough to stop me. The kid would glare at me and my family would be embarrassed and apologize. I did this despite knowing right from wrong. The lizard urge to grab cotton candy defeated the intellectual knowledge of manners. These kind of overwhelming urges can be hugely hindering in the life of a person with autism. \n \u00a0 \n Improvement through Communication and Exercise \n My skills, though far from perfect, have improved a great deal because I can type now on a letter board or iPad. Each year my motor control becomes more under my own control. I communicate by one finger typing and that is the best I can hope for. Still, my one finger typing or pointing to letters is the difference between stagnation in a low remedial autism program or receiving a general education. It is the difference between being thought to be a concrete thinker and being known to be funny, kind, compassionate and intelligent. My one finger typing is the equivalent of sign language to a deaf person. It is my modality of communication and it gives me access to the world and control over my life. \n Since I believe my mind/body disconnect is a key to my odd movements and body apraxia, I have found that a vigorous exercise program focusing on strength, coordination and flexibility has helped me with my motor control tremendously, because the fitter I am physically, the more my body obeys my mind. Exercise also helps with my emotional equilibrium and helps to reduce the constant anxiety that so many people with autism experience. \n \u00a0 \n  A Human Rights Issue \n Communication is a basic, innate human need and humans have an innate capacity for understanding and expressing language. The assumption that people with severe autism all have impaired thinking has resulted in the underestimating of the true abilities of thousands of individuals, lack of adequate educational opportunities, isolation, loneliness, boredom, frustration, hopelessness, and a life of entrapment within one\u2019s own body. This price is too high. \n My recommendations are many. The first is to stop assuming one knows what is in the mind of a person with severe autism simply because of what he shows externally. My outside is not my most flattering presentation because of all my odd movements and behaviors, but I believe I am a smart person who deserves opportunities in life. The educators and many professionals I worked with before I could type were limited by their low expectations of their students. Applying the same words they used to describe their students, they were resistant to new ideas, resistant to change, and rigid and concrete in visualizing the possibility of their students having greater potential. \n In my book ( Kedar 2012 ), I wrote about how I would have liked to have been taught when I was young. Here are my recommendations. \n Give people with autism the benefit of the doubt. \n Speak normally to them. \n Teach grade level lessons in school. \n Work on real physical fitness early. We need smart fitness trainers more than swings. \n Look at people who have successfully taught typing to severely autistic people. Do their students progress and become increasingly independent in their communication? Does this not demonstrate something worth exploring? \n Finally, listen to those people with autism who have broken through their silence to be able to describe their experiences. We offer insights from the inside. This is valuable because our outsides mislead and theories can go astray as a result. \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n References \n \u00a0 \n Kedar, I. (2012).

My good friend\u2019s mother, Barbara Johnson, had the courage to tell her story. Her son was with me in remedial autism class when we were small and no one knew how much was inside. I am happy to say he is at last able to express his thoughts. His story tells parents to not give up, even if your kid has grown to adulthood. \n Good afternoon.\u00a0 My name is Barbara Johnson and I have the \nprivilege of being the mother of two sons, Chad and Connor Johnson, \nboth of whom have autism.\u00a0 My son, Chad, is the focus of my speaking \ntoday however, because he is typing with a keyboard and his IPad \nutilizing the Proloquo voice feedback word program for communication \nand academics. \n I was asked to speak today because Chad basically started typing \nmeaningful communication and academics at 18 years old. He is now \n20.\u00a0 Chad did began typing earlier with me and with his home therapy \nprogram provided by Verdugo Hills Autism Project using an Alpha \nSmart keyboard,\u00a0 but most of the typing consisted of nouns\u2013 usually \nwhat we were having for dinner, or his name, address and phone \nnumber.\u00a0 He did not progress much from there, because looking back \nnow I believe we were not emphasizing the typing enough. \n Chad had been using PECS most of his time at home and in \nschool because it seemed to be the only form of communication other \nthan verbal that appeared to connect with him and what he also \ninitiated with.\u00a0 He tried typing and sign language when he was very \nyoung, but these forms of communication at the time did not seem to \nregister well.\u00a0 I truly believed they did not make sense to him. \n I was informed by the experts, that Chad had severe receptive language \ndifficulties and that was the reason why he would not always respond \ncorrectly to ABA drills or requests I made of him.\u00a0 The many books \nand articles I researched only backed up this theory.\u00a0 It was described \nto me with the analogy of a radio receiving static, sometimes the \nmessage comes through, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 I have never \ndoubted Chad\u2019s intelligence, and I have always known he is extremely \nbright. \n If only I had realized Chad\u2019s body was not responding to what his \nbrain was telling him to do, this theory of receptive language problems \nwould not have shaped how I pursued his education and therapy. \nWhat is so ironic and upsetting is that a great deal of Chad\u2019s learning \nhad been and continues to be auditory; he has understood everything \nall along.\u00a0 The experts were wrong, I was wrong. \n I have dear friends in Tami Barmache and Tracy Kedar who \nencouraged me to pursue the typing communication with Chad.\u00a0 I still \nhad my doubts because of past experience, but I started to inquire \nmore.\u00a0 The pivotal moment for me that changed my perspective was \nspeaking directly with Ido Kedar.\u00a0 Chad and Ido have been friends \nsince they were about 6 years old. They both met in an autism class in \nelementary school.\u00a0\u00a0 I was talking and crying to Tami and Tracy about \npursuing the typing and I was feeling like I had failed Chad and had him \non the wrong path for years.\u00a0 Ido approached and typed on a letter \nboard to me that I was a very good mother to Chad and I had been \ngiven the wrong information, that is was not my fault.\u00a0 Well, I totally \nbroke down after that, but it changed things forever for me and for \nChad. \n The meaningful typing initially started at school with the assistance \nof Verdugo Hill\u2019s BID, Cheryl Umali and BII, Jim Rodehaver.\u00a0 Chad \nhas used the letter board and IPad, but he prefers the IPad because \nhe can see what he is typing and can also utilize the word bank.\u00a0 He \nrequired a great deal of support in the beginning, but over time the \nsupport has greatly diminished. Tracy Kedar also worked with Chad using the letter board to teach him to point independently without being touched.\u00a0 This helped Chad have more ease with the keyboard with less support.\u00a0 Chad also \nreceives communication therapy once a week through REACH with \nKatie Anawalt and Lindsey Goodrich. \n For the first time Chad is fully included in general education in high school.\u00a0 He is on an alternate curriculum. However, so far he has not had modifications in the academics, only accommodations for his typing and additional time requirements. \n Chad was previously in the autism class for almost his entire \neducation, mainstreaming only for electives or going to a vocational \ncampus for a job skills program for a couple of periods during the day. \nEver since Chad started the academic general education curriculum \nthis last August, his writing has greatly improved surprising everyone \naround him. \n I have tried to encourage other parents to investigate typing for their \nchildren because it has been life changing for our family.\u00a0 For the first \ntime, my husband Chris and I are hearing Chad\u2019s voice and his \nopinions.\u00a0 We do not have to guess anymore what he wants, we can \nask him and he can reply.\u00a0 Many parents have conveyed to me that \nChad, Ido and Dillan are exceptional and their child cannot do the \nsame.\u00a0 Every child with autism is exceptional because they are the \nbravest souls I have ever met, but Chad, Ido and Dillan are no \ndifferent from your children, students, or clients.\u00a0 Other people with \nautism can also be successful using typing communication; they just \nhave to be exposed to the same opportunities. Most of all, you have to \nbelieve in their intelligence, perceptiveness, understanding of \nlanguage, concepts, and emotions. Do not let their physicality get in \nthe way of you believing in them. \n In closing I am going to read something Chad wrote in his government \nclass that I believe says it all. \n A cause that is very important that I think of is the rights of people  \n without voices.\u00a0 I have autism and I don\u2019t talk.\u00a0 That makes it hard for  \n people to know I can think and learn.\u00a0 So I and other do not get true  \n education.\u00a0 We cannot help ourselves to speak up.\u00a0 But we  \n deserve a fair chance to learn real knowledge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=434", "title": "Words from the Parent Panel at Spectrum of Opportunity Conference"},

{"date": "March 22, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t My good friend, Samuel Capozzi, wrote this fine and informative speech for the all-day conference on nonverbal autism held at California Lutheran University last weekend. I am delighted to share his powerful message. \n I once read that \u201cGod often uses our deepest pain as the launching pad of our greatest calling.\u201d I believe this is true in my young life. Good morning, my name is Samuel Capozzi, and I\u2019m a freshman at Cal State Channel Islands \nin Camarillo. I am also pleased to be on the board of Autism Society, Ventura County. I have a diagnosis of moderate autism, and I\u2019m considered non-speaking and non-writing. I only began typing to communicate about four years ago. A lot has happened in that short span! As a matter of fact, my entire life changed. \n My communication breakthrough happened in the middle of high school. At that time, I was unable to expressively communicate all that I was taking in, all that I learned, and all that I hoped to achieve. I was reading Dick and Jane readers and doing double digit addition at 16 years old. This was a dark, dark time for me. After more than sixteen years of silence, I felt like I might never be heard, like I might never be understood, and like I might be treated as a toddler \nfor the rest of my life. To say that my hope was realized in May of 2012 would be a huge understatement! \n I think it\u2019s important to know that I didn\u2019t suddenly learn everything with RPM, I was learning all along. I\u2019m thankful my mom read to me at higher levels and showed me educational videos. I also did a lot of incidental learning. It\u2019s a very hard thing to be deprived of rich, age-level learning experiences\u2014experiences most people take for granted. \n Life changed when my faithful parents took me to Austin, Texas to learn RPM\u2014the method I use to communicate. Needless to say, many tears were shed in the Capozzi home upon the realization that not only do I understand what is being said, but that I also have excellent reasoning skills and a keen sense of humor! \n I decided to stay an extra year in high school to earn a diploma and to become a college-bound student. With hard work and many sacrifices by my loved ones and me, I did it! My favorite class was Latin, and I enjoyed taking the National Latin Exam. I managed to score Maxima Cum Laude two years in a row. My school challenged the students to \u201cDo Hard Things\u201d, so I did, but not only for myself. You see, I understand that my success is my misunderstood and marginalized peers\u2019 success as well. \n My remaining high school years were jam-packed with academics which I thrived on! I was even my Mock Trial team\u2019s journalist. It was a whirlwind of an experience, as I responded unusually quick to learning RPM. My high school counselor and teachers were extremely excited about and supportive of my new found means of communication. This was so important as I \u2018spread my wings\u2019 in my new world of communication, conversation, and academics. My Latin teacher \ntook a real interest in my journey, and this made me feel so supported and encouraged. She even read Ido\u2019s book out loud to her family! Just one teacher can make a big difference. \n By God\u2019s grace and pure grit, I graduated with honors and managed to take the SAT. Not only was arranging for the necessary accommodations difficult and time-consuming, but I also sat for the test for over 6 hours! So did my friend, Ido. Nonetheless, I am thankful the College Board was willing to work with us on this because I know it will benefit others who face complex communication challenges in the future, and hopefully some of you here today! \n As our understanding of autism evolves and increases, I am optimistic that accessing an appropriate education won\u2019t be as challenging for others who communicate differently. \n I was accepted at all three universities that I applied to, including Cal Lutheran, and offered scholarships based on academic merit and community service. In the end, I chose Channel Islands because I believe they were the best prepared for a student like me. Go, Dolphins! \n Since attending CI, I love learning, walking the halls of a university, and obtaining higher education. As I understand it, I am CI\u2019s first non-speaking, non-writing student. I simply can\u2019t say enough about Disability Resource Programs at CI. I am truly embraced, and my presence is celebrated on campus. It\u2019s a nice change! What inspires me most is my professors\u2019 delighted \nresponses and even shocked responses when they hear my cogent answers and read my strong essays. I hope to pioneer a path for other students who communicate differently that may come after me. Knowing this helps me forge on when I become overwhelmed! \n Life with autism is challenging and difficult in ways most of you could never understand. So, my efforts in high school and now that I\u2019m in college are hopefully not only for my benefit but also for the benefit of my peers and society as a whole. \n Autism is now a big part of our society with the prevalence at 1 in 68 births. With what we know, now is the time to re-think autism and give it a new face. Yes, life with autism has caused some of my deepest pain; however, living victoriously with autism is also my greatest calling. I am profoundly grateful to have meaningful communication, and I hope that I have helped some of \nyou to better understand its importance for everyone. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=430", "title": "Words from a College Student with Autism"},
{"date": "March 31, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t My tenth grade English teacher, Amber Tesh, had never had a nonverbal, non-writing student in her class before. She said, in her speech at the Spectrum of Opportunity conference at Cal Lutheran University, that she already had more kids than she was supposed to have in her Honors English class when she was approached by a counselor asking if she could take on another student. \u201cHe\u2019s really intelligent,\u201d she told her, \u201cOh, and he has nonverbal autism and he communicates by pointing to letters.\u201d \n I had a great experience in her class because she connected directly to me, not my aide (called a BI,\u00a0 behavioral interventionist, in her answers). Before she spoke on the educators panel at the Cal Lutheran conference she was asked to address the following questions and these are the answers she wrote out. I hope that her suggestions help other educators of neurotypical students who might be surprised to find themselves suddenly\u00a0 dealing with something unfamiliar so that it can be a positive experience for everyone.. \n Below are the suggestions of Mrs. Tesh. \n 1.\u00a0 What has worked?\u00a0 What have you learned? \n \n Speak to your class beforehand if possible. Ask the student (which I did with Ido) if he was okay with me talking to the class about why he typed and why he needed to communicate in that way. I think if we hide the obvious, the class becomes left out or confused, which in turn causes chaos.\u00a0 \n Relinquish control to the BI. Allow them to handle issues that might arise. Give them the control to excuse the student or step outside. Try not to step in or\u00a0interfere\u00a0with their job \u2013 even if you think \u201cthey CAN\u2019T leave now!!!\u201d \n Form a relationship with the student and BI. It\u2019s hard to wait for a student to type out an answer, especially if the entire class is eager to respond or are\u00a0calling out. Have a special signal or gesture so that the teacher knows when the student is typing out an answer. Make it clear to the class if the wait is a bit longer than expected \u2013 I would often\u00a0say, \u201cI am waiting for Ido on this one\u201d and the class just stopped\u00a0and waited.\u00a0 \n Seat the student by the door if they need to step out or take a break.\u00a0 \n For the first few group activities (if you do group activities) \u2013 the teacher should form the groups. When students form groups they pair up with who they know and where they feel comfortable. Students get very uncomfortable quickly when they don\u2019t know how to act in a certain situation or with a certain person. For many students in your class, this might be the first time they have been in a class with someone with autism or someone who types. Their first reaction is going to be to group up with friends, and then students get left out. Once students realize how smart and communicative the student is, they are eager to form groups. This happened with Ido. After a few weeks, I had people asking him to join their group.\u00a0 \n Allow the student to finish things at home. Certain things are just too hard to get done in a class period.\u00a0 \n Ask the student\u00a0\u201cenough\u201d questions to ensure they got it. Then you will feel okay with them finishing at home.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n 2.\u00a0 What supports do YOU need/find helpful/valuable to YOUR success? \n \n A good BI \n \n A place for them to go to work if it\u2019s not the best day or need extra time \n A strong support\u00a0system at home \n A strong counseling staff that places the student where he/she would be most\u00a0successful \n Information about previous classes \u2013 what worked and what didn\u2019t? \n Advice on how to give / space out / time assignments (might come from IEP, counselor, BI, inclusion specialist) \n \n 3.\u00a0 What advice do you have for other teachers? students? administrators? \n \n Teachers \u2013\u00a0#1 is giving it a chance. As teachers we tend to be scared or thrown off by the unexpected or what we don\u2019t know\u00a0\u2013 and to be honest,\u00a0having a student who types to communicate is a bit unexpected and scary. If we are nervous about something before we even try it, we tend not to do the best job. So, if teachers just give it a chance it\u2019s actually just everyday business. \n \n Teachers \u2013 As said in question #1 \u2013 talk to your students. There is no point in hiding the obvious. It might not be the most comfortable conversation, but they have to be able to\u00a0recognize\u00a0and accept differences. \n Teachers \u2013 Make sure you feel comfortable that the student is actually doing the work. My biggest challenge was \u201cIs Ido actually doing this writing / work\u201d?\u00a0 I mean you have this young man, who at first didn\u2019t participate at all and would often times have to step out of class for long periods of time \u2013 and then he would turn in this work that even my brightest honors kids couldn\u2019t do. So you have to come to a confident place that they are listening to you and completing the work on their own \u2013 even if someone else might be writing it down for them.\u00a0  *Ido note: This is handled by observing the student communicating, typing and answering questions. It also becomes clear by relating directly to the student in conversation and questions and answers, but at first it is a novel experience for the teacher and seeing that the student is communicating is essential for teacher confidence. \n \n Administrators\u00a0\u2013 need to talk to their teachers. Ask them which class would be the best for the student. Lets be honest, as teachers there are just certain classes that are better or more \u201cequipped\u201d then others.\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=438", "title": "Tips for Teachers Integrating a Nonverbal Student with Autism into their Class"},

{"date": "April 3, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t The panel of educators at the Spectrum of Opportunity conference at California Lutheran University had two high school teachers, one elementary school teacher, a BI, Debbie Spengler, who you saw in Dillan\u2019s two films in my last post, and it was led by Adrienne Johnston, who is an inclusion specialist for the Los Angeles Unified School District. \n I met her when I was just starting to get a general education in middle school. I was the first nonverbal autistic kid in general education. I was not behaving like a normal kid and I was trying so hard to get my opportunity to be educated. Mrs. Johnston was an expert in the school district and she came to observe me in class and right away she knew I had no business being in general education. I was so scared and my aide was alarmed. When I got home I told my mom what happened and she called Mrs. Johnston. After the conversation, Mom was sort of worried because pretty clearly Mrs. Johnston didn\u2019t believe I was typing. My mom invited her to our house to get to know me better. To her great credit, she came. But more importantly, she had the ability to acknowledge what she saw; that I was really communicating by typing and that I thought for myself. \n I don\u2019t mind people having skepticism. It\u2019s only natural and logical because outer autism makes us look inattentive, disengaged and infantile. How do people look at that and see our potential to be in general education, especially when they have been taught theories that interpret the outer behavior as a reflection of the inner world? So, Mrs. Johnston\u2019s conversion to seeing that I was smart and that I did communicate was huge. Over night she became my ally within the school system, and my cheerleader. Her interacting with my teachers helped them to understand autism and to be open to teaching me, and this helped pave the path for my friend, Dillan, and other students with autism who entered general education. She bravely confesses that she \u201cknew it all,\u201d until she discovered she didn\u2019t. But being open to learning a new way to look at autism made her a better expert than she ever imagined. \n Below, Mrs. Johnston addresses why professionals must be open to learning. \n I was a \u201cdoubter.\u201d I was a special educator with all the knowledge of an expert, who had worked with students with autism for many years, and Ido had to prove to me that he was really communicating.\u00a0 Ido was the first person I met who challenged my assumptions about autistic people.\u00a0 I always assumed that what \u2018these\u2019 kids needed was an opportunity to be included and exposed to general education curriculum, but mainly for appropriate social skills modeling and learning alongside their peers, rather than actually gaining content knowledge of age and grade appropriate curriculum.\u00a0 After all, how could a child with a severe presentation of autism (in Ido\u2019s words, \u201ca limited-verbal, hand-flapping oddball\u201d) have such advanced cognitive and academic abilities?\u00a0 Our students have to prove themselves over and over again because, let\u2019s admit, seeing one thing and believing another about them is very difficult\u2013\u00a0 especially for us professionals who have built a \u201ctheory\u201d of autism based on our interpretation of what we see! \n Since I first met Ido, in August of 2010, and his mom invited me to his house to see his typing and discover for myself his true abilities, I have had the privilege to support several more students with autism who type to communicate.\u00a0 I see it as my job to support students in general education classes and work with their teachers and administrators to explain what each student\u2019s capabilities are and how each one is able to learn grade level curriculum if given the opportunity and individualized supports needed; specifically, the ability to communicate what \nthey know.\u00a0 I have noticed that some educators have a tendency to place students like Ido in a \u201ccookie cutter box,\u201d (as I did) based on preconceived notions about students with autism.\u00a0 If teachers will see \u201cthe Idos\u201d in their classrooms as individuals and resist this need to put them in a limiting box, often disguised as compassion, there is a much greater chance that our students will be successful and prove themselves behaviorally and intellectually. \n I can inform teachers about students\u2019 needs, abilities and challenges but sadly, it is next to impossible to educate them about how to be kind or respectful.\u00a0 What is critical is that teachers not necessarily know everything about the student, but are willing to learn and be open to the fact that difference is not deficiency!\u00a0 In other words, it is ALWAYS safest and most respectful to make \u201cthe least dangerous assumption.\u201d\u00a0 Simply put, attitude changes everything!\u00a0 In Ido\u2019s words, \u201cIt really takes so little to be cheerful and warm and supportive to \na student, and what different results can be achieved!\u201d \n As you hear from the teachers on the panel, I think you will notice a theme:\u00a0 each of these teachers is supportive, accommodating and believe in our students\u2019 abilities despite their limitations.\u00a0 These are key ingredients to any student\u2019s success!\u00a0 And, yes, I know it is challenging as I work with our kids every day and some days are not good\u2026some days I doubt.\u00a0 But, I remind myself how hard kids with a label of autism have to work, and the battle they have to fight to prove themselves \u2013 over and over again.\u00a0 It takes great courage on their part to \nwork through their fears, obstacles and challenges that they face every waking minute of every day. \n For example, one of my students typed recently when having a particularly difficult time sitting in class: \n \u201cMy mind is going so fast. My head is moving all the time with thoughts and sounds. It\u2019s so hard to focus. I may forget to be in control of my body and suddenly I\u2019m in the trash eating something. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m antagonistic. I just know that I lose focus and then I make bad decisions and I feel like my mind is not working. When I\u2019m silly I don\u2019t think I\u2019m funny. I can\u2019t settle down and my whole body goes crazy. My single-minded persona takes over and I get all bored and silly and I can\u2019t stop laughing.\u201d \n When I asked if I could share his words to help teachers understand his behaviors, he said: \n \u201cYes, I am feeling emotional. I am working on myself so much. I know I can be annoying but I want to be an inspiration for others. I am honored that you want to use my words and I am nervous about it but I want to be all that I can be.\u201d \n He, and all the students like him, are the reason I do what I do.\u00a0 They are my inspiration! \n In conclusion, what I have learned from students is that I need to listen to those I purport to teach and to their families who know them best.\u00a0 How do I listen? Again, \u201cattitude changes everything!\u201d \n * First, I must have an open attitude and let go of any preconceived notions about students with autism.\u00a0 Like Ido has said, \u201cpeople with autism are not all variations on a spectrum and do not fit in neat little boxes!\u201d \n * Second, I must have a teachable attitude, that is, acknowledge my need to learn \nfrom my students.\u00a0 Because once I learn to listen I can begin to listen to learn. \n * Third, I must have an attentive attitude towards each individual\u2019s needs and creatively look for opportunities to give non-verbal students ways to communicate.\u00a0 I understand no method of communication will work for every student.\u00a0 The challenge is to find some method for each student to have active participation and a voice in grade level curriculum.\u00a0 Communication is a very basic human need.\u00a0 The lack of it can lead to complacency, frustration, social withdrawal, or severe behavior creatively look for opportunities to give non-verbal students ways to communicate. \n * Finally, I must have an expectant attitude and anticipate many, many more students\u00a0 who will surprise us with their words of wisdom if given the chance! \n I want to leave you with this quote from a boy with autism: \n \u201cTo each autistic person living without a voice, I hope you find a person in your existence that will believe in you, try to connect with you, and most importantly, do it always with respect and belief in your abilities to think.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dillan \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=441", "title": "Insights from the Educator Panel at the Spectrum of Opportunity Conference: The Importance for Educators to Have a \u201cTeachable Attitude\u201d"},

I recently posted his son, Samuel\u2019s speech, and here Sam\u2019s father tells the story of from a father\u2019s point of view. Importantly, he seems to have no interest in regret or in feeling down about the time his son didn\u2019t communicate. Rather, he rejoices in the miracle of his son going from silent and unable to communicate and believing his son had no ability to understand basic concepts, to a son who types his thoughts and is now a freshman with a 4.0 GPA in a university. I hope that many parents take his message to heart and rethink autism. \n Good afternoon! My name is Duval Capozzi, I\u2019m Samuel\u2019s dad, and I am in the honored role of being a Dad\u2019s voice! As involved as I have been, I must say\u2014most of these moms, my wife included are \u201cNavy Seal Moms!!\u201d \n Samuel\u2019s name means, \u201casked of God\u2019, and boy, did God answer! He\u2019s been our biggest blessing, and his life has enriched ours in incredible ways. We have delighted in him all the days of his life! \n Samuel started to communicate using the letter-board and iPad at the age of 16 \u00bd in May of 2012. To some that would be late in the game while for others maybe not. Either way, it was perfect timing for us\u2014perfect timing for him. He was so ready; he took off like a rocket! As far as I understand, his response to learning and implementing the method was quicker than most. I\u2019m not sure why, but it was. \n A year before that, my wife Kathy started to research and pursue RPM (Rapid Prompting Method) and suggested that we visit Austin, Texas and visit Soma.Now, at first I was very cautious and not as excited as her (tried many things and have spent lots of money on things that gave little results). \n So we saved up, got on the list and made the trip in May 2012. Initially, we were hoping to get some novel phrases from Samuel\u2014something that truly came from him, not something memorized. Boy, did we get the shock of our life! \n While we were there, Samuel was able to share several personal feelings that we never heard or knew about him, and his communication started taking on a whole new meaning during that week. We were shocked. We are his biggest fans and advocates, yet even we had no real idea of what was going on in our boy\u2019s mind. We knew he was capable of so much more than he was able to articulate or demonstrate, but we had no idea! \n We came home and within two weeks, Samuel was spelling out simple conversations, explaining what his faith in God meant to him and that he wanted to get baptized. First things first! \n He began asking questions about marriage/girlfriends. Could he learn how to drive? And he wanted a cell phone and Facebook account. We laugh because he was after all a teenager, but this is stuff we had no idea he either understood or cared about. We were continually surprised at what had been hidden inside of him. We sometimes still are. These are things we were resolved to not know\u2026to never hear this side of heaven. Can you imagine our shock? Our joy? Our relief? We could ask him if he was in pain. We could ask him how he felt. We could ask him what he wanted to do, eat etc.! \n Our understanding of him, of autism, and how to support meaningful communication with him was so misguided, was so wrong. As you can imagine, our hearts and minds were elated! Our life as we then knew it what was forever changed! \n We have homeschooled Samuel since 2nd grade for a number of reasons. As he described, he went from VERY remedial math to pre- algebra from May to August of the same year. My wife sat with him all summer remediating and discovering any gaps that he may have had. In high school he took 3 years of Latin (Why) He said, \u201cBecause I want to be a lawyer!\u201d Talk about a shock! \n To give you an idea of where we were at this time, we had no idea that he even knew what a lawyer was. I think this is key\u2014key because no matter which direction you go as a parent, educator, therapist or otherwise\u2014just because someone is non-speaking doesn\u2019t mean they are non-thinking. My son taught me that\u2014in a new way\u2014in a life changing way. He told us over and over that, \u201cI was ALWAYS LISTENING.\u201d \n He was learning, as he describes as \u2018incidentally\u2019 all the time. How we think. How we act. What we expect from our kids and loved ones MATTERS. We won\u2019t speak to our loved ones as if they understand if we don\u2019t believe that they DO understand. We won\u2019t invest in someone if we think they\u2019re not understanding-they are. I hope this is a Take-Away for someone today. \n Again, Samuel graduated high school last June and is nearly finished with his first year of college at CSU Channel Islands as a Political Science major. Samuel believes he has a calling in his life to be an advocate for those who have special needs, for those he believes are marginalized and misunderstood. He says \u201cI want to be a voice for the voiceless\u201d \u2014I know what that\u2019s like. \n Frankly, for 16 \u00bd years Samuel was unable to tell us what he really wanted, what he thought, or how he REALLY felt. He didn\u2019t have a voice. He was trapped. Now we can, and do, have deep conversations about life and his future. It\u2019s priceless. \n As you can imagine, it has been such a healing time for him and for us. This has made an amazing impact on our son\u2019s quality of life and on our family\u2019s life, and I am so glad I listened to my wife and went to Texas back in 2012. \n He still deals with the various trials of having autism, living with a diagnosis of autism is very difficult for most people. But now he can learn and communicate like others even if in a slightly different way. \n I truly hope this has helped some of you to understand our son\u2019s journey to meaningful communication. What a joy to be sharing our Samuel and his breakthrough with you today! \n *Afterthought- not every person\u2019s response will be exactly as my son\u2019s was. Nonetheless, searching for a reliable means of communication for your loved one is important. \n \u00a0 \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=451", "title": "More from The Spectrum of Opportunity Conference, Parent Panel"},
{"date": "April 18, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t Guest post by Tracy Kedar \n I have been asked many times by parents how to develop resources to support their children with autism who communicate by typing in order to access a regular education, or how to find supportive agencies or how to create other services where they live. I wish there was an easy answer. Each resource we have out here took legwork and advocacy work by someone, as I\u2019m sure so many of you have already experienced and accomplished, and we have a long way to go! Based on the kinds of questions I often receive, what I can offer are some tips\u00a0 that hopefully will help parents in developing resources where\u00a0 they live. \n School : \n The general education system is still not set up for typers. By and large, unless you encounter an extremely rare and open-minded individual in your school, or others have blazed the trail before you, you will virtually never walk into a school that is familiar with autism or ready to integrate autistic students into general education classes Thus, parents are, as always, thrust into the role of advocate for their child and become de facto outreach educators regarding autism to the schools. Since so many special educators have been taught that students with autism have low cognition, parents of autistic children who have broken through the communication barrier and who are trying to get their children into general education, must come to IEP meetings armed with evidence of their child\u2019s ability. Often times those early meetings are emotionally challenging for parents because panels may be biased or even hostile. However, films of their child typing, reports and assessments from private, preferably school-district-recognized, augmentative communication specialists, psychologists, and others, which show their child\u2019s true capacity, may help. \n Beyond this, parents may need to be ready to explain that their child has a legal right to be educated, according to federal law, in the least restrictive environment, despite communicating in a different modality and sometimes displaying odd behavior. Since many people have never even heard that a nonverbal autistic person can communicate by typing, parents can help the IEP team by reassuring them that with a  trained  aide for behavioral support and as a communication partner, autistic people have successfully been integrated into general education and have done well. \n With luck, there will be in attendance at the IEP meeting someone from the school who recognizes that the child is truly communicating and who consequently recommends allowing the child to enter regular classes, but this may not be the case. If it seems necessary, parents may want to invite independent professionals to the IEP as well, such as augmentative communication specialists, educational psychologists, and so on, who can help advocate on behalf of your child\u2019s abilities. Though there may be no one in your area specializing in, or even familiar with testing autistic kids who use typing to communicate, just finding someone open-minded may be good enough. \n From our own experience, when Ido was young and I was trying to get him out of autism class, I searched for an educational psychologist who was willing to let him be tested while he answered questions via letter board. I found someone who was willing to try. She carefully observed throughout the testing to make sure he was communicating without being manipulated or prompted, however, she had no prior experience testing a child who communicated in this modality. Other parents looking for someone to do an assessment are eager to hear who can do a fair or adequate job and word may spread among parents that this person is capable of testing a nonverbal typer. \n Should a school refuse to allow an autistic student to be integrated in spite of educational psychological evaluations and films demonstrating ability and aptitude at age appropriate level, then in some instances parents may be compelled to seek additional support. It is generally better to not have legal professionals (lawyers, paralegals) in the room in the introductory meetings since at that early stage you are trying to educate school personnel and forge a partnership. However, if you determine that it is necessary, it may be helpful to convey that you are consulting with a legal professional and are aware of your child\u2019s legal rights. A lawyer\u2019s presence may be useful in future meetings but is certainly not the place to start as teamwork and a non-adversarial relationship is always best, if possible. \n Once a child is out of the autism class and mainstreamed, the student often finds the academics to be an easier hurdle than the learning to sit still and control his body, emotions and impulses all day. Because these are self-control skills, many students begin mainstreaming gradually, perhaps leaving an autism classroom for only a few periods a day until the self-control improves. For example, in Ido\u2019s middle school there was a self-contained autism class where he sat when not in general education classes, though he did independent study there for the other academic classes he was missing. His integration began gradually. In 6 th  grade he went only to two general education classes, math and science, and as he learned how to function in a regular class he was able to last longer and longer. By 7 th  grade he was mainstreamed for three classes and by 8 th  grade the school recommended that he be on a full general education schedule, which he maintained throughout high school. \n Another strategy we found useful was to hire a private tutor to work on grade level material not taught in the autism class before Ido was mainstreamed into general education so that he could get used to do doing regular coursework. He was sitting in the remedial autism class at school all day, but we hired a graduate student in education (not special education) with no prior exposure to autism, whose lesson plans no doubt helped ready Ido for general education. Another advantage is that each of these people, formerly unfamiliar with nonverbal autism and typing to communicate, becomes part of a wider network of support and may in turn provide support to other parents and students. \n It is important to note that for most of the typers we know, they didn\u2019t walk into a school that had a program ready to mainstream an autistic student. Since Ido was the first mainstreamed, nonverbal autistic student in every school he attended, this was a completely new experience for teachers and administrators. It is important to know that individual people can make a huge difference. We were helped enormously in middle school by an open-minded administrator, an assistant principal, who was willing to work with us and be supportive to Ido in the school setting. As he told me, \u201cI always just assumed he was smart and just communicated in a different way.\u201d By presuming competence he helped forge a path for success. This was a pleasant surprise. We saw how, by his lead, he influenced others in the school to be receptive to having a student with autism in regular classes. \n To help smooth out potential obstacles, prior to the beginning of the school year I met with the administrators to explain who Ido was, how he communicated, his abilities and challenges, and I did the same with all of his teachers after contacting them by email. Ido came to these introductions and introduced himself to the teachers. This is an essential step. Many teachers have never met a person with autism before. They may know nothing about autism. They have huge classes and they already feel overwhelmed and harried, so they need to know that they have someone to bring their questions to, whether it\u2019s the parent, aide, administrator or inclusion teacher. With a good collaborative relationship, supportive administrators can help place the child with teachers they know will be the most open and capable. Many teachers rise to the challenge admirably and really embrace educating the student with autism. They are great gifts to our children. Other teachers accept the presence of our kids with no special passion for reaching out. No problem. They educate them and accept them as they do any other student. Each of these teachers becomes a resource for those students with autism who follow. \n There are, however, some teachers who are a terrible fit. They may resent the child\u2019s presence, do not know how to deal with autistic behavior including disruptive noises, outbursts or poor impulse control, be poor teachers in general, or they may exhibit hostile skepticism. In certain instances, finding a different teacher may be warranted. Teachers should be encouraged to observe the child communicating and answering questions to put their mind at ease and to reassure them that the student is doing his own work. From our experience, the more independently the child is able to communicate, the more receptive the response. In our experience, the majority of teachers I met were cooperative and some were outstanding. .However, in spite of all your efforts, you may still encounter people in the schools who are less open-minded, or who are convinced a nonverbal, autistic child does not belong in general education. It is never easy being a pioneer, and unfortunately, both parents and the student have to be ready for these challenges and for the difficult people who make the process tougher, whether teacher or administrator. \n Parents may find that certain systems are unfixable. When Ido started high school, after a successful middle school experience, he initially went to our local high school hoping to continue his positive experience. This school proved to be a bad fit. A few administrators created a hostile climate for disabled students. Since it is hard enough having autism, no student deserves to be bullied by administrators and made to feel unwelcome at school, in addition to their everyday challenges. I concluded that the administrators of this school were not reasonable or compassionate people who were willing to work with me, but rather, were obstructionist and mean-spirited. I realized that because of this, the environment could not be changed for the better for Ido. I felt that the hostile climate was sufficiently bad that I had to remove him from the school and find another high school with a more welcoming attitude that would be willing to enroll him midyear. \n The second nearby high school I found did not have any experience mainstreaming autistic students into the general education classes. Ido was the first. But they had a different attitude of, \u201clet\u2019s try,\u201d \u201clet\u2019s make it work,\u201d and significantly, they had respect for the student. This enabled him to thrive. What happens without planning, then, is that word of mouth spreads among parents to avoid the first school and to look into the second, and so perhaps more typers enroll in the second school and none into the first. But, it is not as if a program of integration, training, or special services for the students with autism existed or exists in that school. Rather, it is a school with some kind people willing to give a student with autism who types a chance to be educated and it becomes an option for parents looking for resources. \n One friend of mine was having terrible experiences with a teacher/administrator in her son\u2019s elementary school. The mom is a strong advocate but it became clear that she was dealing with a closed-system, much like Ido\u2019s first high school, which didn\u2019t want things to work out. Staying in schools like this is actually harmful to our kids. She was struggling to cooperate with an individual who had strong negative biases toward her son\u2019s abilities and who would not, and possibly could not, change. As painful as it may be to see people who reject or underestimate our children, sometimes we simply have to recognize a hostile system and not continue to bang our heads against the wall trying to fix things. It becomes essential in these circumstances to look for greener pastures elsewhere. After changing schools, this little boy is now thriving in his new school where he is fully integrated and welcomed. Once again, this life-changing experience was made possible simply thanks to a few open-minded individuals in the new school who his mom reached out to and who were willing to listen and learn and the negative experience was shaped by one powerful individual in the first school. \n The bottom line is that a successful general education school experience is created one teacher, one counselor, and one administrator at a time and parents must reach out to all of them. One of our most successful collaborative relationships was with a teacher who initially was skeptical of Ido\u2019s abilities. To her great credit, she came to our home, observed Ido typing and changed from being someone I feared might impede his progress to an indispensable ally and supporter who has since helped other students with autism who type in the school setting. Outreach is incredibly important. Some people are open to change and some are not. One individual, like this wonderful teacher, can help foster a successful experience for your child, and for those who follow, at school by influencing other staff. \n Agencies : \n Beyond schools, our children get help from autism agencies, which provide their aides, adaptive skills training, and other services. There are only a few agencies in our area that are eager to support kids with autism who type. They do not specialize in this population, though they are interested in exploring it more. They became enthusiastic after they got a client who was a student with autism who typed and who had a parent who educated and advocated to the agency staff or supervisor. 100% of the agency staff did not get behind the concept. Rather, once again, a few individuals got on board. In many instances, these are individuals who have no particular expertise or training in typers or typing to communicate, nor did they know initially how to support the children and their communication. However, significantly, certain individuals on their staff showed a willingness to listen to parents, to observe how the students learned, and finally, an openness to learning more. I know several parents who even trained agency staff who were working with their kids on communication techniques and strategies, planting a seed of interest and helping their own children as well. Once again, parent led and parent generated advocacy coupled with a few open-minded individuals in an agency, can begin to make a systemic change. Families that follow will enter into an agency that is more receptive, thanks to the efforts of these motivated parents. I will confess that I stayed on far too long with an agency that had a very inconsistent ability to support Ido. I urge you not to make the same mistake! \n Other Resources : \n As you look for the supports your child needs, it may take some time to find the right match. When we wanted someone to help Ido with fitness, he worked with three trainers over the span of a few years. The first did a very good job but had no interest in specializing in autism and moved on to other things. Still, he was able to help Ido with fitness and it was a positive experience for both. The trainer who followed him was clearly not excited about trying to help a person with autism get fit, so the search continued. We found Ido\u2019s third trainer, Mike Ramirez, through a friend, a mother of a child with autism. She said Mike had worked with her son through an autism agency for years but on a personal level was a Cross-Fit devotee and fitness buff. For Mike, putting these two hats together, autism and fitness, was ideal and he decided that what he wanted to do professionally was to concentrate on the fitness of kids with special needs. Ultimately, he created his own company to do so. What I am saying is that if no Mike exists where you are now, remember,  Mike\u2019s program  didn\u2019t exist here either when we started! Ido was the first kid he trained, but from word of mouth other parents began to request a service that he was good at and interested in providing. As Mike says, his services are parent driven and the parents, in many instances, are driven by the demands of their kids who type. Once our kids can communicate, they can tell us what they want to learn and then motivation is much higher. \n Whether the person is a tutor, a running coach, a fitness trainer, a piano teacher, an art teacher or any of the many talented professionals who may not have originally been familiar with autism, or who may be familiar with autism but never thought to teach these particular skills, resources can be created for your children and community in this way. Once our kids type they can let us know what they want or need. \n Networking: \n Finally, finding like-minded parents is crucial. I can\u2019t begin to list the good tips I got from other parents and hope that I have been able to do the same for them. \n Creating options, advocating and being brave pioneers walking into the unknown is what the reality is for those of us now on the forefront of creating educational opportunities for our kids with autism who type. Our children bravely walk into the classroom ready to take on those opportunities in spite of the challenges they face, but change is still one child, one parent and one educator at a time. One by one, with each person forging a path for those who follow, we can move mountains. \n Good luck to all pioneers! \n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http://www.special-fit.com/"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=463", "title": "Tips for Parents: Creating Resources and Educational Opportunities for Students with Autism who Type"},

He was a horse in the early 1900s who looked like he was doing simple math equations by stomping his foot. Turns out he was just picking up cues from his handler. \n \n Horses have no innate propensity to develop language, understand complex language or communicate in language. I love horses, but they are horses, not humans. Humans have an innate propensity to develop language, understand complex language and communicate in language; therefore even humans who lack typical access to verbal communication because of a disability still have the capacity to grasp language (except in extreme circumstances). \n Humans who are deaf develop sign language. \n \n Humans who can\u2019t speak verbally type or use augmentative communication. \n \n Humans with Down Syndrome understand and speak utilizing the complex patterns of language. \n \n So, why is it so hard for some professionals to believe that humans with autism have innate language capacity? \n \n For example, here is a course in the Applied Behavioral Analysis department at a university (instructor\u2019s name removed), which is described this way: \n Ever since Facilitated Communication (FC) crashed onto the shores of the U.S. in the early 1990s, remarkable claims of sophisticated communicative abilities in otherwise nonverbal people with autism have proliferated. FC itself has morphed into other forms, including the so-called Rapid Prompting method. However, regardless of the name, all of these techniques have one thing in common: They claim to show that previously nonverbal people with autism are in fact highly verbal and expressive so much so that the diagnosis of autism is sometimes questioned. This is not the first time in history in which remarkable claims of communication have been made about nonverbal individuals. Perhaps the most famous case was that of a horse in Germany around the turn of the 20th century, named Clever Hans. In this talk, Dr. X describes the story of Clever Hans, including the experiments carried out by the German psychologist, Oskar Pfungst, which revealed the nature of Hans\u2019 cleverness, and its lessons for recent claims of remarkable communicativeness in people with autism. Dr. X urges the same level of\u00a0scientific scrutiny regarding these claims as with Clever Hans, and suggest (sic) that all stakeholders in autism should approach remarkable claims skeptically and scientifically. \n I will analyze this paragraph sentence by sentence. \n Ever since Facilitated Communication (FC) crashed onto the shores of the U.S. in the early 1990s, remarkable claims of sophisticated communicative abilities in otherwise nonverbal people with autism have proliferated. \n When I was in high school I learned in my English class about loaded language intended to bias the reader. FC \u201ccrashed on the shores.\u201d Its claims of success are \u201cremarkable,\u201d because the typed communication of nonverbal people is \u201csophisticated.\u201d Ha ha. You see, autistic people thinking and typing is a joke already. \n  FC itself has morphed into other forms, including the so-called Rapid Prompting method. \n Here RPM is lumped with FC , the method that \u201ccrashed\u201d on our shores, in an apparent attempt to discredit it. RPM is actually a different teaching method than FC, and though it is referred to as \u201cthe so-called Rapid Prompting Method,\u201d that is the actual, copyrighted name of the method. \n However, regardless of the name, all of these techniques have one thing in common: They claim to show that previously nonverbal people with autism are in fact highly verbal and expressive so much so that the diagnosis of autism is sometimes questioned. \n This sentence is packed with disinformation. Nobody questions the autism of people who type except for those who don\u2019t believe that severely autistic people understand language. By their logic, if an autistic person types he can\u2019t be autistic. This is circular logic. \n My old ABA supervisor said exactly this about Tito Mukhopadyhay because he communicates by typing independently. He stims. He has every autistic symptom in the books but since he is obviously communicating sophisticated thoughts he  can\u2019t  be autistic. Ha ha. What would his correct diagnosis be then, and why was he diagnosed with autism as a young child before he typed? It is intriguing that these particular professionals don\u2019t question whether their understanding of autism is correct when someone with autism comes along who challenges their theory. Rather, they claim that it\u2019s the person who is incorrect.\u00a0 My book  actually explains pretty thoroughly what it is like having autism. \n \n This is not the first time in history in which remarkable claims of communication have been made about nonverbal individuals. \n No, it is not. How can we present autistic communicators as a joke? \n Perhaps the most famous case was that of a horse in Germany around the turn of the 20th century, named Clever Hans. \n By comparing autistic people to animals. How witty. \n In this talk, Dr. X describes the story of Clever Hans, including the experiments carried out by the German psychologist, Oskar Pfungst, which revealed the nature of Hans\u2019 cleverness, and its lessons for recent claims of remarkable communicativeness in people with autism. \n As I mentioned, I think a horse is an animal with no innate capacity for language and a person with autism is a human with innate capacity for language despite being severely hampered by bad theories, bad instruction and a severe mind/motor disconnect. (For more information on the mind/motor problem, please see my essay  Motor Difficulties in Severe Autism . \n Dr. X urges the same level of\u00a0scientific scrutiny regarding these claims as with Clever Hans, and suggest (sic) that all stakeholders in autism should approach remarkable claims skeptically and scientifically. \n By all means, skepticism is good. I have dealt with and convinced skeptics for many years. Biased, hostile people are not skeptics, nor scientists.\u00a0 (See  Scientific Un-Query   and  More on Scientific Un-Query ). By the way, people who have autism are stakeholders too, as are their parents. \n Science is filled with stories of people who introduced new theories only to be treated with scorn by professionals who toed the line of the day, but the theories were ultimately\u00a0 proven to be correct. Now we laugh at the obtuseness of the critics in these cases, but they actually ruined lives and reputations. \n I\u2019m an autism expert. I didn\u2019t study it in class. I didn\u2019t teach ABA to kids. I did however live and breathe it. I learned that experts and professionals can be well meaning but wrong. I learned that I, and others who type, have much to teach about the truth of the disability. My expertise is solely based on empirical evidence and anecdote. I never ran tests on myself. Nevertheless, I know my nonverbal autism inside and out. My autism is a mind/motor disconnect. It isn\u2019t a language processing issue. It isn\u2019t cognitive delay. It is a real disability, hard to live with, and mostly it is painful to be unable to speak, but not speaking is not the same as not thinking. \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Ido-Autismland-Climbing-Autisms-Silent/dp/0988324709/ref=sr_1_1"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=473", "title": "No, I\u2019m Not a Horse: A Refutation of the Clever Hans Comparison to Autistic Typers"},

I have known him a long time, and he has given me advice, hope and footsteps to follow in my time as a communicator. I don\u2019t know if I would have had the same success now that I have achieved in my struggle against silence without him to forge a path before us. I would like to think I could have, and I wonder how much it must have been so frightening to make those paths without his own guide ahead. Ido gave me a lot when he had so many of his own trials to face. We all have to fight so hard to beat autism, a school system that doesn\u2019t know what to do with us, and expert behaviorists who denounce our accomplishments as a hoax. Ido still found it in himself to take the time to help me in this struggle, and he even wrote to me in his book. I hope a younger version of me can look at my story and I can do for him what Ido has done for me. \n The process of bringing true education to people with autism is as complex as the condition itself. In my school, Ido was first down that road, and I was able to look at his experience and know the challenges ahead and what mistakes to avoid. And further down the road, the next student will be able to refine the process. We keep building and learning how to learn. There will never be a perfect way, and that is good. Always adapting is the perfect way, and Ido began that all in my school. It is most important to be open to knowing that there are undiscovered modes of learning. Already many teachers are fixed in their ways and unwilling to admit to a need for change. Our presence in the classroom will show them an example they cannot ignore.

{"date": "February 10, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n I watched the movie,  The Martian , last weekend. I found it challenging to sit through initially. I felt the astronaut\u2019s isolation from people so deeply. People may watch this movie for its adventure and ultimate triumph over adversity. This is true. The hero doggedly persevered, problem solving and focusing on challenges rather than on his feelings. It is pretty much the only way to overcome insurmountable obstacles. \n For those who haven\u2019t seen the film, it tells the tale of an astronaut left behind by his crew, alone on Mars. Due to a sudden storm they had to preempt their expedition and they erroneously believed he had died. His job was to survive until he could be rescued, which meant getting enough food and water to live, and staying sane. \n My perception of his experience is skewed because of my own isolation due to autism. With autism I may as well be on Mars sometimes because the inability to talk is isolating. It creates a barrier from other people because I may think ideas but I can\u2019t speak them. Yes, I type, but it\u2019s slow compared to speech or I may not have access to typing the instant I want. So, I feel like I\u2019m on Mars\u2013not the way Temple Grandin described in Oliver Sacks\u2019 book,  An Anthropologist on Mars , in which she said she couldn\u2019t understand human behavior. That is her point of view from her Asperger\u2019s brain. \n My Mars is like the astronaut\u2019s. I understand people, but I\u2019m going to have to get nearer to them. In his case he had to make water, grow food and find equipment to travel, all while combating loneliness and discouragement. He had hope and he had trust in himself. This is essential. My Mars is similar in that I must battle against giving up or even feeling sorry for myself because these are the emotions that hurt progress most. In so many ways autism is like being stranded on another planet alone, but it is possible to problem solve to get closer to \u201cearth.\u201d The problem with autism is the initiation deficit. Unlike the astronaut in the film, we cannot move on our own ideas consistently or independently. But, like him we can set many small goals and doggedly work on overcoming our obstacles. \n It is obvious to me that being able to control our response to feelings is enormously important. It is necessary to not rage against or fight the forces that are beyond our control. The astronaut probably would not have survived if he had raged against his crewmates or despaired his unique isolation, but he instead focused on doing and solving. Doing and solving in autism involves gaining control over motor movements and impulses as well as control over intense emotion. Each problem can be worked incrementally. It may be slow going but in time the \u201caut-stronaut\u201d may be able to come home. \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=419", "title": "The Autstronaut"},

I\u2019ve described the motor problems, especially between mind and body. Now I\u2019d like to address some issues related to sensory processing. \n We have the major senses of sight, hearing and touch. I love taste and smell, but obviously they are not the primary senses.  Soma  includes kinesthesia, or movement, as a kind of sense. It includes body awareness. Normal sensory processing is generalized, meaning it is adaptable and can cope in a variety of contexts. It is what you do automatically. For example, if you converse in a noisy room you automatically tune out the background din, but a person whose auditory processing is global is blasted equally by all sounds. Then processing become overload. On the other hand, a person who micro processes might get locked into tuning\u00a0 into the same sounds over and over. Sometimes people who are overloaded due to global processing\u00a0 may try to cope by obsessively listening to micro-selective, familiar tunes. \n The same applies to sight. You focus near, far, or on what\u2019s necessary while ignoring non critical sights. The TV program,  Brain Games,  showed how normal brains are fooled easily in visual processing. We call it  optical illusions , but it\u2019s really proof of our processing selectivity. In fact, our brain is selective to protect us from overload. But when our brains can\u2019t control the overload, which can happen with autism, we can be overwhelmed or scattered in perception or alternatively, we can pick a minute visual target to distract and comfort us. I am guessing you know people who have watched the same movie or cartoon thousands of times to cope with sensory overload, though it may be beyond boring. \n I do believe these skills improve with practice. Mine have\u00a0 very much, but it is a lot of work to change this kind of neurological pattern. However, I have hope in neurological plasticity and in the determination to improve. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.halo-soma.org", "http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/brain-games/", "http://www.moillusions.com/rotating-circles-optical-illusion/"], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=402", "title": "Sensory Processing Issues in Autism"},
{"date": "June 22, 2015", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t Guest post by Dr. Edlyn Pena, Department of Education, California Lutheran University \n As a faculty member and parent of a non-verbal child with autism, I think about the unequal opportunities that students with autism have in life.\u00a0 Too few students on the spectrum from under-resourced and ethnic minority backgrounds receive early intervention.\u00a0 The typical method for educating students on the spectrum, especially when they are non-verbal, is to place them in segregated special education classes, though that is slowly changing.\u00a0 My own research shows that the students with autism who are gaining access to college are almost always the ones from middle to upper income families with college educated parents.\u00a0 High school graduates with autism who come from low income or first generation backgrounds rarely get the opportunity to go to college.\u00a0 Where do we start to make this world a better place for students with autism? \n Focus More on Systems \n When my son was diagnosed with autism at 2 years old, autism professionals told me what I could do to \u201cfix\u201d him. Rarely did people engage me in conversations about transforming our school systems, our therapeutic approaches, employers, or our social policies and laws.\u00a0 For as much energy as our society spends on treating the symptoms of autism, I challenge us to spend \nenergy on thinking about and putting resources into improving our schools, universities, and places of employment to make real, significant change. \n Develop a Vision of Inclusion \n So, then, what would it mean to support students on the spectrum to be educated in inclusive environments, to gain access to college, or obtain successful employment?\u00a0 First, we must have a vision of inclusion. Admittedly, the word inclusion is thrown around a lot and is used in different ways.\u00a0 What I mean by inclusion is not that we place a child from a segregated special education classroom into P.E. and art for part of the day.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that we employ someone to push a broom or wipe counters for the sake of a company hiring someone with a disability.\u00a0 I want to quote two inclusion advocates, Buie Masuku and Nicole Eredics, to illustrate my point. \n \u201cInclusion is about a sense of belonging, about feeling respected, valued for who you are. It is an all-encompassing practice of ensuring that people of differing abilities related to, for example, sex, age, and race, feel a sense of belonging, are engaged, and are connected to the goals and objectives of the whole wider society.\u201d \u2014 Buyie Masuku \n \u201cThe successful inclusion of children with disabilities and special needs in our school system relies on the belief that all children have equal access to a quality education. Inclusive education isn\u2019t a program, a place or a classroom. It is a way of understanding and living in the real world. Because, in fact, this is a world that has people of all different sizes, shapes, colors and abilities.\u201d \n \u2013Nicole Eredics \n I\u2019m challenging you, I\u2019m challenging us together, to do something very difficult.\u00a0 It means redefining our social and educational norms.\u00a0 It means challenging the messages we hear or we speak ourselves about people with disabilities on a daily basis. \n Learn About Real School Inclusion \n Inclusion is not just a utopian vision; it\u2019s real and can be successful.\u00a0 CHIME Institute, a public charter school in Woodland Hills, CA, educates general education students, students with disabilities, and gifted students all in the same classroom.\u00a0 How do they do this?\u00a0 They use a co-teaching model in which general education teachers co-teach and collaborate with special education teachers to meet the needs of all students.\u00a0 A number of highly-trained paraprofessionals work with children in the classroom to make sure they are supported.\u00a0 And rather than pulling students out for speech therapy or other therapies, the school therapists work with the students in the classroom, during lunch, or on the playground with their peers to work on therapeutic goals.\u00a0 I have visited CHIME and watched with tears in my eyes as non-verbal students with communication devices like my son and typical peers accessed the same teachers and curriculum together.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t questioned, it was the norm.\u00a0 The implicit message is that all \nstudents belong and are deserving of a quality education.\u00a0 CHIME Institute and other inclusion schools (like SWIFT schools) are trailblazers.\u00a0 The leaders of these schools did not give in to misconceptions that the standards or the curriculum would be less rigorous just because students with disabilities were included.\u00a0 In fact, research has refuted the idea that academic performance \nsuffers for students without disabilities who are educated in classrooms with students with disabilities (Ruijs, Van der Veen, & Peetsma, 2010; Sermier Dessemontet & Bless, 2013. And of course, the benefits to students with disabilities who are educated in inclusive settings are numerous, with increased outcomes in math and literacy skills (Cosier, Causton-Theoharis, & \nTheoharis, 2013; Dessemontet, Bless, & Morin, 2012) \n CHIME Institute is living proof that we can foster an education system that is accessible to all children of all levels of ability.\u00a0 And why not?\u00a0 All children do better in an inclusive environment.\u00a0 It strengthens the moral fabric of our community and more rigorously prepares students with disabilities for higher education and future employment. \n Learn About Real Inclusion in the Work Place \n Now, this is a good time to talk about companies and employers who have launched strategic efforts to employ people with autism and other disabilities.\u00a0 Take, for example, Germany-based software giant, SAP.\u00a0 This tech company sees autism not as a disability but as an asset.\u00a0 They realize that people with autism have an attention to detail and can be savvy in computers and technology.\u00a0 SAP first piloted the idea of hiring people with autism in India, Ireland, and \nGermany.\u00a0 After hiring six workers on the spectrum to test software in India alone, the company reported increased productivity.\u00a0 Now, SAP has extended employment opportunities to people with autism in the United States. \n We have so much to learn from places like CHIME Institute and SAP.\u00a0 The people behind these ideas had the courage to change the way we do business as usual in education and in industry.\u00a0 It can be done! Given the growing needs of students with autism, there has never been a more critical time in our history that we gain the courage to envision and create alternative approaches and structures to include students with autism in meaningful, long-lasting ways.\u00a0 Please join me on this journey. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=341", "title": "A Pitch for Inclusion"},

They have read my book and see the child has the potential to understand, but they cannot influence the parents to change the way they interact with the child or \u00a0teach communication. It is painful to read these letters because I know the kid is trying, they are trying, and the parents aren\u2019t ready to hear the message. So they ask me how can they change things. \n I wish I knew. The parents or teachers must be open to new ideas. If they\u2019re not, what can one do who has no guardianship? You can treat the child differently yourself, talk to him normally, perhaps even see if the parents will let you introduce a letter board just for practice, but beyond the steps people have told me, it cannot be forced. \n I guess one argument to the parents could be, what do you have to lose by trying? Like I\u2019ve written in the past, how is it harmful to read someone an age appropriate book or speak in normal speech tones? This is modeling for people who have never seen their child treated like that. \n I know several parents personally who were not open to teaching their kids how to type in the past because they couldn\u2019t see their potential, but after many other kids they knew began typing they started to become more open. They had lots of conversations with other parents and gradually it helped them. \n I don\u2019t blame them.

The reason I look and act like I have autism is because this is what autism is. These issues affect my movements and lock me into motor pathways that may become embedded and intrusive and affect my presentation of myself to the world. I may write more in the future about what I have learned about autism and sensory processing and how it affects us, but today I want to address theories. \n The obvious treatment for a sensory and movement disorder affecting all motor issues like handwriting, facial expressions, gesture, speaking, ability to sit for long periods, feel your own body, make eye contact, get out of perseverative motor patterns called stims, initiate, visually scan for items, and \u00a0be able to show our innate intelligence, would be to focus on movement and to address sensory challenges. Few professionals do this, but some do, like Soma, as well as movement and exercise specialists. \n Theories about autism by people who have degrees, titles and prestige but little understanding of autism have been the norm. I have recently learned that in France where I can eat a baguette and enjoy a caf\u00e9 aux lait in the shade of the Eiffel Tower, I would also be treated with psychoanalysis for my \u201cmental illness\u201d because in France my symptoms are due to my emotions, not my neurological disorder. In psychoanalysis I would lie on a sofa mute, because I can\u2019t talk, but my silence would be blamed not on my motor/mind communication, but on my parents, specifically my mother. They will say she created my autism by coldness and rejection of me, despite all evidence to the contrary. Moreover, treatment will include \u201cLe packing,\u201d wrapping me tightly in cold, wet sheets for some bizarre reason. I may only be a person with autism, and not a brilliant French psychoanalyst, but I would like to try this treatment on you, you arrogant know-nothing. \n Here in ABA-land, theories are equally misguided, but less cruel. Still, 40 hours a week of touching flashcards won\u2019t help a toddler who may have an inability to focus visually, or hear speech distinctly in a sea of sounds, or be able to move the way he wants, to gain the sensory control or muscle control he needs to be able to communicate or show his intelligence. That\u2019s because ABA believes autism is a severe learning disability that is treated by drills, rewards and baby talk. This makes recognition of the motor challenges nearly impossible because all the \u00a0data from the child\u2019s success in performing the drills is interpreted as a measure\u00a0of how much\u00a0the child understands speech, and not of whether the child can get his body to move correctly. Therefore if a child is told to jump and he doesn\u2019t jump because he can\u2019t get his body to move at that moment in that way, his failure is chalked up to a lack of understanding the word \u2018jump\u2019 even if he damn-well understands the word \u2018jump\u2019 and everything else. To interpret data solely based on the\u00a0\u00a0belief that a person\u2019s actions are\u00a0an accurate reflection of their\u00a0comprehension of speech, leaves out the possibility of helping this motor trapped person address his real needs. \n Did I mention it\u2019s 40 hours a week? \n Autism treatment is big business, here or there.

{"date": "July 31, 2014", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t Guest post by Tracy Kedar (my mom) \n When Ido was small he was in an ABA program that carefully documented all of his responses to discrete trial drills. In a huge logbook divided by the specific drill outcomes being measured, the exact number of his correct responses, incorrect responses, number of trials, and whether prompts were needed was recorded. The data clearly indicated the exact number of words Ido understood, which they measured as not being very many, with the belief that the only way he acquired new vocabulary was by being taught it in drills. The proof of mastery was the accurate pointing to the word on flashcards consistently. \n When Ido began to express coherent ideas in normal English via writing, the scientifically gathered drill data made his ABA team convinced that this was simply not possible. It was inconceivable to them that Ido could understand and express grammatically correct, vocabulary rich English because their data evidence proved all he knew was far less. \n Autistic kids I have met and seen communicate by iPad, keyboard, or letter board, without tactile support, still face dismissive letters whenever they appear in the media written by total strangers who are absolutely certain that the journalists were derelict in publishing a fraudulent story. The reporters are accused of not doing \u201cdue diligence\u201d by telling the story of a nonverbal autistic kid who \u201cmiraculously, overnight\u201d can communicate, despite the process leading to typing fluency being one of years. \n Not long ago a skeptic professor in our area from the psychology department of one university spoke to an audience of university students studying ABA at another to show how unscientific and improbable it was that autistic people could communicate fluently by typing. He scoffed at RPM which he called \u201cdangerous,\u201d and laughed at how unscientific it was. He was alarmed at stories of kids like Ido appearing in the media. \n This scholar, like so many of the writers of the skeptical letters, stated that he spoke on behalf of scientific methodology. He was firm in his belief that the data collected in discrete trial drills proved the fallacy of these severely autistic communicators, since data didn\u2019t lie. I agree with him that the data collected in Ido\u2019s old ABA drills were completely accurate. The recorded notes accurately indicated whether he got answers right, wrong, how many trials, and whether a prompt was needed. Where I differ from the professor is what it means. To him, the data was clear proof of Ido\u2019s low receptive language processing, limited cognition and the impossibility of advanced comprehension. To me, the data simply reflected his ability at that time to accurately point to the card requested. \n Those nonverbal autistic individuals who have learned to type are consistent in describing themselves as having a frustrating mind body disconnect. They state that while they understand what they hear, they cannot get their bodies to obey their minds with the kind of consistency and reliability that is necessary to prove it. Ido devoted several chapters of his book to describe and explain this challenging neurological experience and he describes how instruction and practice, using very particular techniques, helped him to develop \u00a0the ability to overcome these challenges enough to be able to communicate his thoughts, first by pointing to very large letters on a letter board held at eye level, and ultimately, as control improved, by typing on small ones on an iPad or keyboard on tabletop. \n So yes, the drill data is accurate. The question is whether their hypothesis explaining why this occurs is correct. If the scholar and skeptics are correct and the drill data is a reflection of all the cognitive understanding that lies within a person, then of course children once thought to be low functioning who now claim to type and read and write fluently are to be viewed with alarm. Their achievements are viewed as \u201cclever Hans\u201d phenomena and any support they receive is seen as suspect. \n On the other hand, if what the people with autism say is true, then the data is useless in those cases because all it measures is whether they could get their hand to obey their mind at any given trial and doesn\u2019t reflect their capacity or knowledge. Consequently, the efficacy of the treatment becomes the issue. \n Given these divergent possibilities, one would think that those who state they are proponents of science and scientific methodology would be lining up to meet those people with autism who have known histories as \u201clow functioning,\u201d complete with videos, reports, and school records, who now communicate fluently by typing, often with no tactile support at all, and who receive and thrive in general academic educations. \n How is possible for anyone to determine that a person is not really communicating solely from reading a newspaper article or watching a television news short? Rather than showing the kind of scientific inquiry that is supposedly the hallmark of science, these folks seem to treasure data collection to confirm an existing theory over a willingness or curiosity to explore whether there is more that could be learned, even if it means that some of their ideas have been incorrect. That doesn\u2019t seem scientific to me. It\u2019s circling the wagons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=269", "title": "More on Scientific Un-Query"},

He is non-verbal and outwardly behaves in a way which would lead people to believe he lacked intelligence/understanding. The Rapid Prompting Method (RPM) has enabled Chris to show us, through pointing on a letterboard, that he is a creative and intelligent young man. \n Ido has been an inspiration to us \u2013 his book particularly helped me to understand and to discuss with my son the issues he faces with his motor control/purposeful movement. When people see students like Ido using his iPad independently it is only natural that they aspire to getting their own children to this stage as quickly as possible. There is often a lack of appreciation of the amount of work that may need to be done before getting to that stage. \n People say to me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get Chris to type straight onto a laptop?\u201d- if only it was that simple! It is important to understand that the amount of time it will take to develop the pointing/typing skills will vary greatly between students and, as Ido has already explained in his book, the belief of the people who surround the student will also have a huge impact on progress. \n I am sharing parts of our journey here primarily to help give some more perspective on this skill building process as, for us, it has taken a long time and is still a work-in- progress: \u2014 We first saw Soma in 2011 for six RPM sessions (and have seen her each year since then). Chris started pointing on the 3 large stencils and each day we saw how Soma built his skills through verbal and air prompts until he was able to point on the single A-Z stencil. We were also able to observe other students who were at different stages of RPM \u2013 some who had more motor challenges than Chris \u2013 some were already using iPads. It was clear that everyone had their own rate of progressing. \n These first sessions were all a bit of a whirl wind. At the time it was difficult to fully appreciate exactly what Soma was doing and why \u2013 as a parent you find your emotions run high and it is hard to detach yourself and analyze what is happening. \n It was hard to replicate Soma\u2019s success at home. Chris was \u2018all over the place\u2019 \u2013 how had he been able to have a conversation with Soma? I had a small team of people working with Chris and we realized that we needed to first build our own skill levels before we could help him to move forward. How did we do this? \u2013 by analyzing and studying the videos of the sessions : how did Soma pass the pencil? What angle was she holding the board at? etc, We transcribed word-by- word Soma\u2019s sessions \u2013looking at how she phrased her questions and how she gave verbal prompts. Then we practised, filming ourselves, writing up our sessions in detail and giving each other feedback \u2013 continually setting improvement goals for ourselves. \n Our learning never stops \u2013 constant analysis needs to happen even now as issues are always coming up e.g. Chris may spend time with his hand wandering around the board before getting to the letter he wants. When this happens we need to work out how to help him with the skill of getting straight to the letter. \n One aspect of RPM which I feel is particularly important to appreciate is that it works using academics. Learning the skill of accurate pointing on a letterboard would be exhausting and tedious without a context. The teach/ask part of RPM lessons not only provides intellectual stimulation by giving Chris interesting information but also, when he is giving us \u2018known\u2019 responses, we can identify his motor challenges and the issues/skills we need to work on. We present a wide variety of age-appropriate topics \u2013 history, biology, physics, poetry, current affairs, art. \n We also work on the skill of open communication \u2013 beginning with single words and gradually increasing to longer outputs. This is another important point \u2013 all of Christopher\u2019s most creative and expressive work has been as a result of an academic lesson. There is a skill to this \u2013 we don\u2019t just say, \u201cnow how do you feel about that?\u201d We instead explore something related to the lesson and maybe discuss it in the third person eg. \u2018if you were living in that era and writing a diary entry what would it say?\u201d \n \u2013 Once we had built up our skill levels on the stencil it was time to push Chris forward onto the laminated letterboard. This was after six months of practise on the stencils \u2013 (three sessions a day) and it was gradual transition \u2013 sometimes just a few letters on the laminate. At first we held this vertically and gradually began to tilt it. This process will vary greatly with different students -some need lots of \u2018mirroring\u2019 from one board to another, others can transition in a few sessions without a lot of help. \n When you find a way to hold the board that works for your child at an angle that suits their ability to point accurately and have open communication it would be easy to stop and think you have achieved your goal. However this will always leave the child reliant on a skilled facilitator \u2013 I am always looking to move Chris on to the next skill to enable him to eventually become fully independent. \n \u2013 So five years into our RPM journey Chris is currently pointing quite confidently on the laminated letterboard when it is held nearly horizontally. He can also point on a QWERTY keyboard which is held at a slight angle. He still needs verbal prompting to \u2018keep going\u2019 and his tolerance can vary greatly from day to day (he is also affected by some ongoing health issues). \n We are working on his independence by mirroring words to either the laminate or keyboard flat on the table or held by him. I have learnt that it is not a great idea to compare Chris\u2019s progress to others \u2013 e.g. some students can easily move from one board to another, some have the ability to \u2018match\u2019 so can easily touch a letter on the laminate and then on a keyboard. Chris, on the other hand, has to learn this all through muscle memory so requires continual practice and repetition \u2013 and lots of verbal/air prompting. I have helped other students to get started with RPM and learnt that every student is different and will progress at their own rate \u2013 so there is no rush. \n Over the years we have done lots of skill work outside of the RPM academic sessions. I believe that all of these things also contribute to his improving letterboard skills. Skills have included physical exercises (including participation in Special Olympics events), horse riding, playing games, learning to draw, helping around the house. \n Everything we teach is focused on helping Chris to move his body purposefully and independently. Each action has to be broken down into small component parts, explained and motor-modeled so his muscles can learn how the movement \u2018feels\u2019. Just to explain further , Chris cannot just imitate an action -I have to physically lift his leg, touch his thigh muscles telling him to engage them to show \nhim how to step over a hurdle. Then we have to practise, practise, practise and practice until he has the muscle memory to enable him to move onto the next skill \u2013 running over the hurdles (he can do this now!). I believe it is possible to teach him anything \u2013 but it will take longer than for other people. \n In a recent discussion with Chris he wrote, \u201cMANY PEOPLE \nDO NOT REALISE THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING SKILLS. I DIDN\u2019T REALISE THE IMPORTANCE MYSELF UNTIL I BEGAN TO WORK ON THEM. BUILDING SKILLS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS \u2013 RUNNING, SPORTS, CRAFTS AND GAMES \u2013 IS HELPING ME TO CONTROL MY BODY, LEARN NEW THINGS WHICH BRINGS ME ENJOYMENT AND HELPS ME TO BE ABLE TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY.\u201d \n Here is a short clip of us discussing skill building in relation to his pointing \n \n IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY. EVERY DAY I HAVE TO PRACTISE. \n How do you feel about using the keyboard/ipad?  \n IT IS HARD TO LEARN NEW SKILLS. I AM SLOWLY IMPROVING BUT IT TAKES A LONG TIME. \n What Chris said above I can equally apply to myself. I am constantly learning with him, developing my own skills and know that I still have so much to learn. Some days it seems that the journey is insurmountable \u2013 but breaking it into small achievable goals makes it more manageable \u2013 one day and one step at a time! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=501", "title": "Harder than It Looks: Learning to Type on a Letterboard and Keyboard is a Process"},
{"date": "May 1, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t \n Autism Spectrum Disorder is pretty broad. I met a young woman today who has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. She seemed totally like every other neurologically normal person I\u2019ve met in terms of motor, speech and social skills. Maybe I\u2019m missing something she suffers from, but why on earth do we have the same diagnosis? \n \n If I get a paper cut and you amputate your leg, people don\u2019t say we have a Laceration Spectrum issue. But it\u2019s worse with autism because autism is so many different issues lumped under a huge umbrella. \n \n I have written my opinion previously that I believe that my autism and Asperger\u2019s Syndrome are different neurological conditions with the same name. This confuses people. Temple Grandin is unable to read people, thinks visually, speaks, and needs no 1:1 support to get on with her life. I am her opposite. I have great insight into people, think in words, can\u2019t speak to save my life, and need 1:1 help. \n Somehow the brilliant minds looking into autism haven\u2019t noticed that the opposite symptoms might be different conditions, not a spectrum. Her condition may primarily be a neurological difficulty reading people while mine is primarily a mind/motor disconnect, though both of us may have problems of self-regulation and sensory challenges. \n Would it make sense to call a heart problem and asthma a spectrum disorder because they both lead to shortness of breath? Not possible because doctors identify heart issues and lung issues medically. Brain issues are the most unknown, so doctors look only to the external behavior. That\u2019s observational, not medical. \n \n Temple Grandin has poor eye contact. Me too. She talked late. Me too\u2014to the point of still not talking. She has some things similar to me, but they are superficial similarities, in my opinion. So, I have decided to help out the professionals. I am happy to abandon the diagnosis of autism and give it to Temple Grandin and those with similar symptoms since it really isn\u2019t the most helpful term to give people an insight into my medical problem. In fact, maybe we can have a contest to come up with a new name for my kind of autism. I have a few ideas: \n Severe Motor Dyspraxia \n \n Mind/Motor Communication Linkage Disorder \n \u00a0Self-Regulatory Motor Control Disorder \n You get the idea, no? Maybe a new name would lead to a better understanding and treatment of this neurological condition. \n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=496", "title": "Spectrum or Different?"},

{"date": "September 23, 2016", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t I have received a lot of questions about exercise and autism since my last post. From my own experience, when I was small one of my OTs looked at me and remarked that I had low muscle tone like most people with autism. She then did nothing to work on fitness. She loved the swings, however, like most of my OTs to vestibular and propriocept me. \n In school my APE teacher followed a routine I believe must have been designed for a different motor disorder than mine. The movements were too hard for me to motor plan at the time which led to frustration. \n Most people don\u2019t imagine that people like me have the potential to be fit. I know it\u2019s possible. It takes longer than a normal motor system to improve but it can still improve. It can be hard at first, so persistence through resistance is essential. You have to be aware of real challenges like motor planning, muscle and tendon tightness and other issues common with autism that can interfere with success. For example, bilateral movements, moving arms and legs simultaneously in an exercise, and transitioning movements can be really hard for some people and frustrating until more motor control is achieved. People make a lot of adaptations to compensate for the motor difficulties. For example, if jumping sideways is hard to plan, a person might consistently turn forwards. You can build up to the skill incrementally in many ways, such as stepping sideways at first, stretching the hips and working on jumping in general. If someone can jump forward with ease but takes many seconds to jump sideways or backwards, you are likely looking at motor planning challenges which can improve with practice. \n The goal is to make moving fun as well as a key to emotional balance and fitness. \n Good luck! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://idoinautismland.com/?p=545", "title": "More on Autism and Exercising"},

One of the ways I do this is through exercise. \n I believe exercise is incredibly important in helping people with autism. I use exercise often to help me control my feelings or my energy level. Of course, it also helps me to have better mind/motor communication, better motor planning, better fitness and even to participate in certain physical activities or sports I never could do before. \n I exercise in a variety of ways including hiking, bicycling, riding a scooter, jogging on a treadmill, swings and trampolines, as well as working out with\u00a0 trainers. \n I share below a few short film clips of me working out as well as a photo of me sawing a tree branch on a two-man saw with my dad. \n Parents: Don\u2019t be afraid if your kid isn\u2019t fit yet or even into moving.
