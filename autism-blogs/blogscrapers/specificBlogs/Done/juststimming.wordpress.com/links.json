It is not an essay.So!I haven\u2019t really written\u00a0anything since October. This is because I am Autistic, and I am inconsistent and cannot communicate on anyone else\u2019s schedule\u2013or even one of my own. I do\u00a0have some essays planned to finish and go up soon. I actually have dozens of drafts on my computer, ranging from the rest of Metaphors Are Important to whole new series and a bunch of other things. But they aren\u2019t ready yet, and that\u2019s okay.I say \u201cthat\u2019s okay,\u201d mostly to remind myself. I have a lot of anxiety surrounding my writing, and in particular this site.Which brings me to my next item of business\u2026I cannot usually answer comments. It\u2019s in part an access issue, as well as a matter of anxiety, discipline, and time, and it\u2019s also a protective mechanism\u2013my language isn\u2019t the best for\u00a0brief\u00a0comments, and I have no desire to start a comment war. It\u2019s my general internet policy, which I try to follow with varying degrees of success. I have similar issues answering emails. I wasn\u2019t going to ever explicitly state this, but it turns out that just because I\u2019m not writing doesn\u2019t mean people aren\u2019t reading, and since Quiet Hands (and more recently, Obsessive Joy) exploded, I\u2019ve gotten more comments than I ever thought this blog would see.A lot of those comments have made me cry, as much as the attention has made me want to run away. I am planning on posting a more\u00a0specific\u00a0response tomorrow, but for now I just want to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you for reading, thank you for listening, thank you for taking action, and thank you for letting me know that all three of those happened. I cherish your comments.In the interest of directing you to something similar to read, an idea that needs to go viral, I\u2019d like to link you to The Unbroken Spectrum: Stockholm Syndrome, over at Shift Journal. I did not write it. It\u2019s important.I\u2019ve been working on several projects since October, all related in odd ways, which you can expect to hear more about soon.I also participated in ASAN\u2019s ELSI \u00a0symposium at Harvard Law this weekend, which was fantastic. I don\u2019t have words for this experience, and I don\u2019t know that I ever will, beyond too much excitement and\u00a0optimism\u00a0to be contained.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll link to the youtubes when they are\u00a0available. I spoke briefly about the gap between theory/law and what actually happens\u00a0to autistic people. I actually spoke much more briefly than I would have liked, since my vision cut out about halfway through my response and I could no longer read what I\u2019d scripted out. Perils of being a self-advocate.And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve missed since October! Hopefully things will be back to normal here tomorrow.

Currently, we are raising money towards the creation of our first and foundational anthology (Loud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking) and accompanying website.\nLoud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking features essays, long and short, by Autistic authors writing on autism acceptance, neurodiversity, Autistic pride and culture, disability rights and resistance, and resilience (known collectively by the community as having loud hands). Questions posed to the contributors might include what does autism mean to you; why does Autistic culture matter; what do you wish you had known growing up Autistic; how can the Autistic community cultivate resilience; what does \u201cloud hands\u201d mean to you; and how do you have loud hands? The anthology is the first of a projected series featuring contributions from Autistic writers stressing the preservation and celebration of Autistic culture and resilience. The website will host shorter and multi-media submissions along the same lines, along with additional materials and videos, and serve as a focal point for the project and community.\nOur Impact:\nThe Loud Hands Project is about survival, resilience, and pride. The Loud Hands Project is necessary because autistic youth face systematic oppression, abuse, and bullying every day. It does not \u201cget better\u201d for us\u2014typically, upon graduation, it actually gets worse. This must change.\nThe Loud Hands Project is a structured, multi-facetted response by the Autistic community to the systematic disenfranchisement, bullying, and abuse experienced by autistic youth, young adults, and self advocates. Taking the form of a publishing effort by the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and spearheaded by Julia Bascom, The Loud Hands Project consists of multiple prongs organized around the theme of what the Autistic community refers to as \u201chaving loud hands\u201d\u2014autism acceptance, neurodiversity, Autistic pride, community, and culture, disability rights and resistance, and resilience. \u00a0We focus on cultivating resilience among autistic young people and empowering us in building communities and cultures of ability, resistance, and worth. To quote Laura Hershey: \u201cyou weren\u2019t the one who made you ashamed, but you are the one who can make you proud.\u201d\nHow You Can Help:\nWe need to raise ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to help cover the initial costs of putting together and distributing our first anthology and launching our website. Please consider making a donation here\u2014every little bit helps!\nSpread the word! Check out the share tools on our page, and please use them! You can visit our Facebook page, tumblr, and twitter too, and tweet about the project using the hashtag #loudhandsproject.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.indiegogo.com/The-Loud-Hands-Project?a=351448", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://www.indiegogo.com/The-Loud-Hands-Project?a=351448", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Loud-Hands-Project/111548155631555", "http://theloudhandsproject.tumblr.com/", "http://twitter.com/#!/loud_hands"], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/12/26/the-loud-hands-project/", "title": "The Loud Hands\u00a0Project"},

{"date": "February 16, 2012", "body": "First, a story. (A little Christmas story. I call it: the story of Schmuel. Tailor of Klimovitch.)*****\n(The best part of the story is what I leave out.)\n*****\nI met a mini!Kurt the other day. He was very blonde, with intense brown eyes, but he was very particular about his hat, and his dad was Burt Hummel in all the ways that counted. I\u2019d guess he was about four\u2013his voice was still all exclamation points.\u201cI\u2019M MATT!\u201d he said, hiding his face from me, and then trying to run out of the waiting room. It was cool though\u2013I don\u2019t know if I even managed ahi.He was at the stage where he was still mainly echolalic, but he was learning how to store and recombine and modify phrases to work for him. I was excited for him, and almost proud, because he\u2019d mastered two essential skills for that\u2013swapping pronouns, and prompting other people to remember their lines. His dad, trying to bundle him into his coat, was not playing along at first.\u201cI\u2019M SO CUTE!\u201d mini!Kurt reminded him, trying to make his arms go into the right sleeves. \u201cI\u2019M SO CUTE!? I\u2019M SO CUTE?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Dad sighed, wrestling with the zipper. \u201cYou\u2019re cute.\u201d\u201cSO CUTE?\u201d\u201cSo cute, that\u2019s right.\u201dMini!Kurt, satisfied that everything was going according to plan, was ready to leave. \u201cBYE!\u201d he called, waving his hand backwards at me, a perfect mirror image.I waved. Had my mind been more together, I would have flapped.\n*****\nEcholalia is metalanguage.*****\nEcholalia is an unexpected treasure hunt. You can be watching a bootleg musical you never thought would be any good, but turns out to be beautiful, and suddenly they\u2019re going up the scale singing hot hot hot hot, and you\u2019re back with Kimba, and he\u2019s saying hot hot hot hot\u2013only he\u2019s got this elaborate metaphor about fire and anger going on right now, and here it means I think you\u2019re mad at me, so I\u2019m mad at you, don\u2019t touch me. \nAnd then you\u2019re back at your laptop, wondering when he started watching musicals and rethinking half the things you thought you knew.*****\nEcholalia is what you use when language is too much. It\u2019s just also what you use when it\u2019s not enough.\nThese things are not opposites.\n*****\nWalt knows my name, but he\u2019d rather call me Mulan. We\u2019re on the swings, trading movie titles.\u201c101 Dalmations?\u201d I offer.\u201cMulan no thank you!\u201d He chides. Considers. \u201cRio, with Jesse Eisenberg?\u201dI grin. I\u2019d only said that once, but he\u2019d picked up on my crush, and he offers it back to me when I am having a hard time with the conversation. I try to remember his favorite, as a peace offering. \u201cKung Fu Panda II, in theaters now?\u201dI get it right.Months later, it will still be the best conversation of my life.*****\nEcholalia, from Echo, of Greek mythos, cursed to speak only through the words of others.\nWe make it work though.About the cursed: opinions aren\u2019t the same as facts, and no one ever asked Echo.\nTo be fair, no one would have listened, either.\n*****\nAs much as I can hate words, I delight in them, too. When I\u2019m echoing, referencing, scripting, riffing and rifting, storing and combing and recombining, patterning, quoting, punning, swinging from hyperlexic memory to synesthetic connection, words are my tangible playground.Make me talk like you, and you\u2019ll get a bunch of syntactically sophisticated nonsense. Let me keep my memories and connections, my resonations and associations and word-pictures, and if you slow down enough, you might hear something ringing true.These are the words I\u2019m using right now. It\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t see the picture yet; I can\u2019t either. It\u2019s coming together though, the more I practice them.Ethnography of robotics.Neuropoetics.Girls like you always get to see Ireland.Send my love to the leprechauns.Please don\u2019t special-episode me.Why don\u2019t you trust me? Because, honey, you keep setting things on fire.The first rule of tautology club is the first rule of tautology club.I think they might be four separate pieces. The joy is how they come together.The bestworst part is no one ever knowing.\n*****\n(The best part of the story is what I leave out.)\n*****\nI don\u2019t trust my words on my own.\nThat\u2019s not why I echo though.\nI know it\u2019s tempting, but, listen.\n*****\n\nOr maybe I\u2019m lying, because I\u2019m not brave enough to explain.\nDon\u2019t worry though. I know that Kimba loves musicals now, and Walt named me after a warrior.\nWe\u2019ll get there.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2012/02/16/an-ethnography-of-robotics/", "title": "Metaphors Are Important: An Ethnography Of\u00a0Robotics"},
{"date": "December 13, 2011", "body": "When I was a little girl, I was scared.That sentence has taken two months to write.When I was a little girl, I was scared.When I was a little girl, I was a lot of things. I was functionally blind, and other kids teased me about my huge, staring eyes. When I was a little girl, I was somber. When I was a little girl, I was remote. When I was a little girl, I was devout.When I was a little girl, I was scared, and I was alone.*****I don\u2019t know how to tell you about growing up scared and alone, except that I don\u2019t want to, and maybe that says enough. I can tell you, though, what changed. What changed is that I was fifteen, and I found\u00a0this.I was fifteen, and I spent months circling Amanda Baggs\u2019 site, skimming the front page (the background and url were different then,) afraid to click on any of the posts, testing and tasting the words autism\u00a0and autistic\u00a0and okay\u00a0over and over in my mouth. I had found someone like me. I had found someone like me, and they were fine.It was months before I could look at this straight on, accept it, and click a post to read. Eventually I was brave.When I was fifteen, I stopped being alone.When I was fifteen, I stopped being alone, and that meant I could stop being scared.*****A little more than a month after I wrote Quiet Hands, I woke up and found that the number of hits on this site had erupted. Quiet Hands\u00a0had gone viral, and there were a dozen comments waiting in moderation, links all over facebook, emails. I was bewildered\u2013it was a stupid, personal post I\u2019d written in the middle of the night to process a flashback a terrible character on a wonderful show had triggered\u2013and overwhelmed by the attention. My friends can attest to my state that week\u2013head-banging, bewildered William Schuester did something good by accident,\u00a0obsessively\u00a0relaying the ever-increasing hit-count as my words died out. I told one of them:\nThe irony in writing about what I write about is that you write about not-existing, and then you very suddenly exist.\nI\u2019m not so good at handling that.\nBut as I adjusted, as I pieced together the history of what happened and approved comments and somehow, strangely, kept existing, I started being able to read what people were saying. I started getting emails from parents who wanted me to know that they\u2019d brought the piece into IEP meetings and had it written into the IEP that their child would be allowed to stim and move, from parents who\u2019d talked to their child and asked if this had happened to them, told them to come and tell if it ever did, from teachers who\u2019d thrown away their Quiet Hands posters.I get a couple of these a week, now, and I\u2019ve never been able to respond because I cry every time I read them.*****When I was a little girl, I wanted more than anything for someone to tell the loud, looming people to stop.*****(No one ever did.)*****There\u2019s another class of responses I\u2019ve gotten.

{"date": "October 14, 2011", "body": "\n\u201cI\u2019m in a wheelchair, but I\u2019m still a guy.\u201dFirst, an awkwardly personal moment.Several months ago, I was outed by another teacher to several speech pathologists at work. One of the women was completing her practicum, and her supervisor and instructor were observing her session with our pupil. I was there to keep him calm, as being watched by five or six teachers as you complete a speech exercise when you are working through selective mutism can be rather stressful. I wasn\u2019t doing anything to draw attention to myself, just sitting nearby and redirecting or reassuring him when he needed it. I was dressed appropriately; I made sure to sit just like the women around me; I kept out of their conversation but smiled and nodded and was polite and quiet. I\u2019m not sure exactly when it was that I made my fatal mistake. I kept my hands in my lap, but it might have been when I answered a question about his AAC device a little too knowledgeably or with a little too much enthusiasm. Perhaps it was when I noticed the tightening of his movements and suggested he have a quick break. Either way, eventually one of the women wanted to know what my job was, exactly. \u201cOh, she\u2019s our intern,\u201d the teacher said, and I smiled and nodded and then she kept talking. \u201cShe\u2019s like our translator for half these kids. She has a really unique understanding\u2013she\u2019s also autistic, like them.\u201dAnd I was out.It\u2019s not the kind of outing you were expecting, was it?Would you believe me that it was more terrifying, more humiliating, with worse consequences than when I was outed as a lesbian in that room earlier that year?That\u2019s one anecdote. Here\u2019s another.As a simultaneously queer and developmentally disabled fan, one of my great struggles last season was watching the ship wars between Brittana and Bartie fans. There weren\u2019t a whole lot of Bartie fans in the first place, and I quickly figured out that, as a lesbian, I was supposed to ship Brittana. It was practically compulsory. Their relationship was\u00a0groundbreaking\u00a0and I was supposed to be excited and moved and relate to it and no, no one wanted to hear my thoughts or see my excitement on seeing a couple with disabilities navigating high school together. Who cared?I wanted to know why only one story, one half of myself, counted. No one could explain.A third story, and then to the point. Perhaps you can see it already.I went to a college, for a while, infamous for its lesbians. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a more decorous way to put it; I never cared to learn. It was a completely and utterly different world from the one I grew up in, and I loved every last queer second of it. Finally, being a lesbian wasn\u2019t an issue!Having disabilities still was.I mean, how was anyone supposed to navigate a relationship with someone who didn\u2019t like to talk, who sometimes couldn\u2019t, who wore massive noise-blocking headphones at dinner and who couldn\u2019t manage parties or groups of people or sometimes even just one person? What were the rules for that? Did that even happen? How do you flirt with someone who won\u2019t make eye contact?It\u2019s important that I am very clear here. It\u2019s not that my classmates were horrible people. It\u2019s not that at all. With few exceptions they were nothing but kind\u2013and that\u2019s a loaded phrase, but there\u2019s not time for it here\u2013and universally they\u00a0did\u00a0know how to relate to someone who could geek out about the neuroscience (and cognitive science, and\u00a0philosophy) of vision, who could help with their linguistics homework or sing along to\u00a0Last Friday Night\u00a0or mix screwdrivers with alchemical precision. They just didn\u2019t know what to do when that person wore glasses because she\u2019d damaged her eyes banging her head repeatedly against walls, or who sometimes needed to pause in the middle of a conversation and diagram a sentence so she could understand it, or who learned music so quickly with the same ears that also made her scream when she wasn\u2019t warned for a fire drill. There weren\u2019t any stories about girls who went to college already well-verses in mixing drinks because they\u2019d gotten so good at mixing 125 mls of Zoloft into eight ounces of pineapple-orange juice every morning.There weren\u2019t any stories about people like me. I was not something to be conceived of, I was not expected. There were no scripts. I didn\u2019t exist.(So I didn\u2019t count.)Now, to the point.I am a lesbian with disabilities. I am an autistic lesbian; I am a lesbian with bad brains.Glee\u00a0fandom has taught me that exactly half of this identity is acceptable.I am sure I should be grateful for this. It is an improvement, after all\u2013outside my bedroom door, I\u2019m not allowed any of it. Being a lesbian is a good way to get myself raped or killed in my, in this, town. I know this. So I apologize for my ungratefulness, for my stubborn, bratty selfishness, when I point out\u2026\u2026being half a person means that I\u2019m still not actually a person at all.Here\u2019s the thing. I can\u2019t actually turn my disability off. I can pass as less disabled, sure\u2013not as non disabled, but less, of course, in some circumstances, if I\u2019m prepped enough. Hey, did you catch that? I can\u00a0pass. Passing is a concept that applies to ability too, not just sexuality or race? Did you know that?Probably not, actually.The\u00a0Glee\u00a0fandom, at least the parts I\u2019m in where I encounter this problem, seems fairly knowledgeable and progressive and all those other nice, soothing words about a lot of things. People generally know what I mean if I say\u00a0Kurt can\u2019t pass\u00a0or\u00a0Blaine passes as white. It\u2019s not perfect, of course, but I\u2019m far more likely to be understood than if I say\u00a0Artie can normalize himself\u00a0or\u00a0Brittany has become increasingly unable to pass.Pass as what? She\u2019s bi, everyone knows that, what else could she possibly be passing for?(Well, actually, she\u2019s written and played as disabled, the actress has said so.)No she\u2019s not. You\u2019re giving the authors way too much credit. That must have been an accident. Sloppy characterization, bad writing, lol Glee\u2026no. They wouldn\u2019t write that. She\u2019s not.(And then this is where I finally, finally, get nasty.)Am I an accident?Am I sloppy?Am I not supposed to exist?Is my story worth telling?It\u2019s not supposed to be personal, except for all of the years I\u2019ve known the answers to those questions.\u00a0Yes, yes, no, no.I think the casual impersonality of it is what makes me feel unsafe, actually. It rests on the assumption that\u00a0people like that\u00a0aren\u2019t reading or participating in these discussions (how could they, they\u2019re retarded) and that our stories don\u2019t even exist to be told. I mean, do disabled people even\u00a0have\u00a0sex drives?And yes, to be clear, I absolutely do mean it when I say I feel\u00a0unsafe. I\u2019m not sure how else I\u2019m supposed to feel when I realize that I do not exist to large swaths of people.A great deal of the time,\u00a0passing\u00a0means passing as nothing at all. I don\u2019t exist. And you know, still, I automatically typed\u00a0and that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s whatever\u00a0after that last sentence, because you\u2019re not supposed to make an issue of it. Not supposed to draw attention. I don\u2019t exist.I\u2019m not in your stories. When I see myself, I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019m bad writing. I\u2019m not in your stories, and I don\u2019t get any stories of my own. I don\u2019t exist to the greater world, and ultimately I\u2019m not allowed to exist to myself.But that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s whatever.There\u2019s a violence in invisibility, you know.There are little speech patterns that creep in when we talk about Brittany, sometimes. About who\u00a0deserves\u00a0her, as if she has no agency, as if she can\u2019t know her own mind.(Do I? Do I get agency? Or do I just need to be\u00a0grateful\u00a0for whatever affection and attention I do get? Should I find the boys from ninth grade again and apologize to my abusers for kneeing one of them in the balls? Should I have known it wouldn\u2019t get better?)There\u2019s a violence I\u00a0still can\u2019t talk about, in the end.Let me take the focus off me.\u00a0I\u2019ve been debating whether or not to leave that sentence in.\u00a0Let me take the focus off me, because this is not how you stay invisible. But\u2026but keep the focus on me, because isn\u2019t that the point? Isn\u2019t that what this show, or at least this essay, is about?\u00a0Keep the focus on me, because there are so many different ways to be invisible.Quinn. Quinn and her slow, silent breakdown all last season. Quinn and\u00a0Lucy. Blaine. Blaine and looking back and realizing that some needy, broken sophomore was trying to\u00a0mentor\u00a0an older, stronger kid, because he can be\u00a0however you want him to be. Mercedes, swallowing a crush she knows goes beyond all reason, but reason never had much to do with it. Mercedes, good old reliable Mercedes, realizing that the moment she\u2019s not so reliable, the moment she wants more, the moment she\u2019s\u00a0visible, is the moment she\u2019s no longer wanted.I\u2019ve been all of those kids. I\u2019ve lived all of those stories. So, so many of us had.And when we hear that these stories don\u2019t exist? That they\u2019re just bad writing? Just lazy plotting, poorly executed versions of better, real, worthy stories? That they\u2019re not worth telling on their own merits, that no one wants to see that?We don\u2019t argue, usually. How are you supposed to argue when apparently a story you\u2019ve lived is just some hackneyed, inferior attempt at something worth attention?We don\u2019t argue, because our stories are judged\u00a0unacceptable\u00a0and by extension so are we, and that\u2019s a conversation we don\u2019t actually need to have again.\u00a0Glee\u00a0tells a lot of stories, and they aren\u2019t usually the ones the real people want, and of course, we already established this, we aren\u2019t allowed our own stories. No, of course not, and should they somehow be written and acted and shot\u00a0anyways, they can still be grabbed and labeled as something different entirely, graded against an entirely different narrative, and thus still easily found wanting, derided, and thrown out.And that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s whatever.

It\u2019s one day of the year where social media and the blogosphere are reserved for the Autistic community to speak out in a concentrated effort.Today is Autistics Speaking Day.Today I am silent.Part of being autistic is that things do not always go according to plan. Part of being autistic is that I can\u2019t always synch up with everyone else. Part of being autistic is that I can\u2019t, in fact, deliver meaningful content and communication whenever I\u2019d like\u2013or, really,\u00a0whenever other people want me to. Part of being autistic is that I can go months without anything much to say at all, really.Part of being Autistic is knowing that that\u2019s okay.Most of my writing and thinking this past month has centered on the things I\u2019m interested in\u2013Glee, Phineas and Ferb, Community. Mostly Glee. I\u2019ve been doing other stuff, sure, but much of the thinking is still pre-verbal. I have thoughts I can feel\u00a0stitching\u00a0themselves together and lining up about college and developmental disabilities, about quite hands, about the power and terror of words like \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cI need help\u201d and \u201cno,\u201d about abuse, about when autistic people are listened to, and about autistic vs Autistic\u2026.but they aren\u2019t ready yet.

{"date": "May 1, 2012", "body": "Author\u2019s note: Yesterday in the blogosphere there was an Autism Positivity Day Flash Blog, sparked by one author noticing that someone had found their blog by searching \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have Asperger\u2019s.\u201d Due to my own situation, I couldn\u2019t participate, but today is Blogging Against Disablism Day, and I still have something to say.Sometimes in the morning I am petrified and can\u2019t move\nAwake but cannot open my eyes\nAnd the weight is crushing down on my lungs\nI know I can\u2019t breathe\nAnd hope someone will save me this time xDear \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have Asperger\u2019s,\u201dI want you to know that I understand.That\u2019s the first thing. This isn\u2019t going to work if we aren\u2019t honest with each other, so, let me be honest. I\u2019ve thought a lot about that mythical cure, and there have been days, many days, when I didn\u2019t have to think at all\u2013when I knew that, if I had a chance, I\u2019d take a cure in a heartbeat.I need you to know that I understand.I do. I do. I want the things a cure could give me.  I want to have the leading role in my own story, and parts in others\u2019. I want to be able to do the same things everyone else can do in the same way without any extra effort. I want to not feel like a freak. I want to feel safe. I want to be someone my parents can love. I want to know I have a future, and I want to not have to blaze that trail by myself. I want to have worth. I want other people to not think they have a right to me and my space, or else I want it to stop bothering me. I want my words and experiences to make sense to other people, and I want their words and experiences to make sense to me. I want to have to work just a little less hard. I want to have a college degree, a job, and a house of my own, and I want to be able to live wherever I want. I want to be able to assume I\u2019m a person. I want to not have a month out of the year dedicated to my brokenness. I want to be able to assume that it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s them. I want to wake up and not be terrified or already tired.I want a lot of things.It\u2019s not a bad thing, to want things.Check in: can you see, now, that I really do understand? I hope you can. I get a couple of visits from you, or someone with the same keyword search, every week, and I want you to know that you aren\u2019t alone, and you aren\u2019t wrong.Okay. I\u2019ve been honest with you. Now I want you to be honest with me. Can you look at the list of things I want, and tell me if you see a pattern?I\u2019ll wait.While I wait, I figure, I might as well tell you some other things I\u2019d like to stop being. In addition to no longer being autistic, I\u2019d also like to be cured of-being a lesbian\n-being female\n-being so obscenely tallReally. I\u2019d like to get be able to get married to someone I love in every state. I\u2019d like to be able to walk down a dark street without fearing for my safety. I\u2019d like to be able to sit in a chair designed for someone of my height. And none of those things are happening right now, so I guess I can either fight for them to change, or try to change myself.Okay. Did you find the pattern? It\u2019s okay if you didn\u2019t. It took me awhile to understand it. It\u2019s subtle. Every single one of those things I want?Have nothing to do with being autistic.Really. Not a single, solitary one.I should have a leading role in my own story. When I don\u2019t, it\u2019s because other people aren\u2019t treating me like a person. That is not my fault. Pretty sure the one in the wrong there is the one who thinks that a disability means you aren\u2019t a person.Why do I want to be able to do the same things as everyone else? Why is that important to me? If I lived in a world where it was recognized that there are multiple ways to do something and that this is okay and the things I do and the ways I do them are valid and important, would I care? Would I even realize this was something to care about at all?I would know that I have a future, and that it\u2019s a bright and near and real one, if I knew growing up that autistic adults existed. Guess what\u2013they do, they have for thousands of years, and on the whole, they\u2019re doing just as well as anyone else.I want to have worth\u2013okay. See, if I had a friend who felt worthless, I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t tell that friend \u201cyou\u2019re right, you\u2019re pathetic. Please change everything about yourself.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure I would tell that friend that the people making her feel worthless were abusive assholes, that she was good at plenty of things, that she was a fantastic person I was lucky to know, and that human worth isn\u2019t some tangible thing we can gain or lose. And if I can say all of that to a friend, and mean it\u2026why can\u2019t I say it to myself? I\u2019m not special. I work by the same rules as everyone else. And that means I am worth something, whether I believe it or not.I can keep going through these. I do make sense to a few people, who take the time to listen to me the way I need to be heard, and they make sense to me. That is how relationships work, and there are lots of different ways to communicate. I can have a job, a living situation I am in charge of, and all the education I want, with the correct supports, just like everyone else. It is not my fault that the supports I need differ from the majority, and that is not an excuse or invitation to mistreat or discriminate against me. Etc etc etc.In the end, there are really two things I want when I say I wish I wasn\u2019t autistic or I want a cure. I want to not feel like a freak, and I want to feel safe. Those are hard, scary things to feel and to admit. And, because I\u2019m being honest, I have to ask something even scarier.What if being cured didn\u2019t fix those things?Because ultimately, if I took a cure, I\u2019d be surrendering. Instead of fighting for my right to be treated and valued as a human being regardless of disability, I\u2019d be letting go, giving in, and letting myself be changed into someone easier, someone acceptable, someone convenient. And I want to be clear\u2013there is nothing wrong with wanting things to be easier or wanting to feel safe or accepted or just being done fighting. That just means that you\u2019ve been asked to be much, much stronger than everyone else for much, much too long.But if, in order to be safe I have to stop being me?Then I\u2019m really not safe at all.As long as being disabled means being unsafe, then no one is safe. Not really. Disability is a natural part of the human experience according to the ADA. Most people will experience some form of disability, for some period of time, at some point in their lives. So long as we as a society keep permitting exceptions to rules like everyone is a person and treat people like people, none of us are safe. Safety earned by staying within acceptable margins isn\u2019t safety at all.I promised to be honest. Part of being honest is looking at what my words actually mean, what lies beneath them, what ideas are controling what I say. And underneath every I wish I wasn\u2019t autistic is a I wish people would stop hurting me or a I wish the world had room for me or a if I blame myself, I can feel like I\u2019m in control.And it\u2019s okay that I feel this way. Well, it\u2019s not okay that anyone ever has to feel this way, but I\u2019m not bad or wrong for feeling it. Neither are you. But feelings aren\u2019t the same as reality, and in the end, if we weren\u2019t autistic anymore, there would still be people hurting others just because they can and just because no one ever told them to stop, and we\u2019d still know that it takes only the slightest deviation before we\u2019re vulnerable again. A cure won\u2019t ever be able to change that.What will change that is something a lot harder than a magic pill. What will change that is enough people saying enough is enough and doing the hard work of making our world one where everyone is welcome, all communication is honored, and everyone is safe and valued. And that is going to take time, and there are going to be days, still, as we work to make that happen, where you, where I, will wish we weren\u2019t autistic, because sometimes it just hurts.But it will change. It\u2019s changing now. And you shouldn\u2019t, and don\u2019t, have to. You are amazing and sufficient and lovable just the way you are, and I really, really hope you\u2019ll stick around so that one day the rest of the world can know it, too.", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismpositivity.wordpress.com/", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2012/05/blogging-against-disablism-day-2012.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7N-0I8Y1rk"], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/truth-is/", "title": "Truth Is"},
{"date": "January 17, 2015", "body": "There\u2019s a new person in my life, so we\u2019re having the how-my-body-works talk.It\u2019s a conversation I don\u2019t think nondisabled people have. It goes like this: this is my body. This is how it works. It moves this way. These parts of can feel, and these can\u2019t. This will hurt me, and this won\u2019t. I want you to know these things. This is my body, and this is me.\u201cWe should have the conversation about physical contact, but I don\u2019t know how it goes,\u201d she said.\u201cWell, fortunately, I\u2019m really good at this conversation,\u201d I said. \u201cI have it all the time.\u201dI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the kinds of intimacy my disability forces me into. Most people don\u2019t have to brief half the people they meet on what they can and can\u2019t see. But the truth is that my body works like yours right up until it doesn\u2019t, and if you aren\u2019t ready for that, you could get hurt\u2013or I could. So I have this conversation with dates, new doctors, friends, coworkers who are filling in and giving support. I have had this conversation on the grass, in bed, in exam rooms, on kitchen chairs. It goes like this: I have autism. That means my brain and my body have a hard time talking to each other.Sometimes I give examples: I move funny, and I can\u2019t always control it, and maybe most importantly, I can\u2019t always start moving when I want to. Sometimes my skin can feel things; sometimes it can\u2019t. Usually it comes and goes in patches. A lot of the time, I can\u2019t figure out how to move. Sometimes I notice pain, and sometimes I don\u2019t. Sometimes my body tries to pull itself apart. Sometimes I know in advance when I\u2019m going to have a bad body day, but usually I don\u2019t until I\u2019ve dropped something all over the floor.Some of the conversation is important: I feel pain differently, but I do feel pain. I can\u2019t feel my body and use words at the same time. Being around other people is physically painful, always, every time, but sometimes it\u2019s worth it. I don\u2019t always realize I\u2019m hurt or sick, but every time a doctor has found a part of my body shredded to bloody pieces by my own fingertips, it\u2019s meant that there was something seriously wrong happening underneath\u2013my hands knew before my brain did. Before I can stand up, I have to find my legs, but sometimes I get stuck. Here is how to prompt me. Here is what kind of power having those passcodes means.Some of the conversation is weird: my body language doesn\u2019t work like yours because I may or may not be able to move those muscles at any time\u2013so I need you to look at me and make different assumptions. I move typically, until one minute you look at me and you see the way my hands hold a cup like a toddler, until my body twists and jerks back in joy, until I don\u2019t move at all. I was born functionally blind, and then I gained a lot of vision, and then I lost some of it again, and now there are a lot of things I can\u2019t see, for two different reasons. If we go into a new room, I will need you to tell me where to sit. I will ask to borrow your eyes, your hands, your brain.It\u2019s not a big deal, I say, and I need it to not be a big deal to you.These are conversations I am good, or at the very least practiced, at having, but they still make me want to crawl out of my skin. Insisting on having these conversations, instead of pretending my body works in all the standard ways, means taking up space and focusing attention on myself as a disabled person. We aren\u2019t supposed to do that. And because my disabilities aren\u2019t necessarily visible, are easy to miss or to misinterpret at first as something else, my conversation partner might not understand why I want to have this conversation in the first place. It can be awkward and fraught\u2013please understand this thing about me, please understand me\u2013and there\u2019s not much precedent. There isn\u2019t a standard social script for this. There\u2019s a temptation to just learn to avoid the need for the conversation entirely\u2013just blend, just let yourself get hurt, just avoid other people entirely, rather than subjecting them to a litany of all the things that make your body different.I still feel that way, sometimes, and sometimes I think I can get away with not having the conversation. And I can, right up until someone reaches out to me, and in the time it takes my brain to process what\u2019s happening, decide to reciprocate, and send the necessary signals down and out to my body to start moving, the other person has paused, seen my lack of movement, and withdrawn, shuttering.\u201cHere is the thing about me and hugs!\u201d I write, later. Here is the thing about me and touch. Here is the thing about me and my skin. Here is the thing about me and my eyes, me and my hands, me and my disability, me and my body. Here is the thing about me.It\u2019s a weird conversation. But I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the years when I didn\u2019t know how to have it. There were whole years when doctors and parents knew that I couldn\u2019t see, that my leg muscles were knotted and my torso was floppy and my body didn\u2019t listen to my brain, but no one told me, and so I thought I was bad. \u00a0My body didn\u2019t work, I thought. I didn\u2019t work. But that wasn\u2019t true\u2013it\u2019s just that no one had taught me how my body worked, let alone how to talk about it. You shouldn\u2019t have to be a stranger from your body. And I\u2019m not, anymore, and I don\u2019t want you to be, either.This is my body, I say. Look what I found out. Look what I know now.I want to share this with you.\u00a0\u00a0", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2015/01/17/the-talk/", "title": "The Talk"},
{"date": "December 21, 2014", "body": "There is this thing that happens sometimes.Parent has an autistic child. Autistic child doesn\u2019t speak, or their speech isn\u2019t an accurate window into what they are thinking. Autistic child is presumed to be very significantly intellectually disabled.Years later, a method of communication is found that works for the child, and it turns out that they are in fact very smart. Very smart! The parents are overjoyed. They begin talking about presuming competence, the least dangerous assumption, that not being able to speak is not the same as not having anything to say.They are so, so excited.And they start talking about all the incorrect assumptions they had. If we\u2019d known, they say, we wouldn\u2019t have done X. If we had known they could read, think, hear us.And it\u2019s a big problem, because the way they talk\u2026..they think the problem was that they treated their child like they were intellectually disabled, and they weren\u2019t. But that\u2019s not the problem. The problem is that they thought their child was intellectually disabled, and so they didn\u2019t treat them like a person.These revelations, about presuming competence, human dignity, and the least dangerous assumption\u2014they don\u2019t apply only to kids who are secret geniuses. They apply to everyone. They are the most important for the kids who really do have intellectual disabilities, who really can\u2019t read or use full sentences and who really do need extensive support. The people who came up with these terms came up with them for a population where there is very little doubt that significant disability is a factor. These terms don\u2019t mean assume they aren\u2019t actually disabled. These terms mean assume they are a person, and remember what you don\u2019t know.When the neurodiversity movement first got its legs, oh so many years ago, we got a LOT of pushback from people who thought we were denying disability. And we had to be clear that we meant everyone. And I worry, more and more, that certain very academic circles have left that behind, in practice as much as in theory. It makes liars out of the rest of us, and it makes a lot of work very, very difficult.If I told the parents in question that I am thinking about this, they\u00a0wouldn\u2019t understand. They\u2019re\u00a0not saying intellectual disability doesn\u2019t exist, they\u00a0would say. But the truth is,\u00a0they\u2019re\u00a0either saying that, or they\u2019re saying\u00a0thank god, it wasn\u2019t my kid.And it\u2019s a slap in the face, every time.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2014/12/21/dangerous-assumptions/", "title": "Dangerous Assumptions"},

Well, every other girl like me never seemed to make it to womanhood, it only stood to reason.At some point, and I\u2019ve told this story so many times and it never stops making me want to cry, I started hearing about other disabled people. People who were older than me, people who weren\u2019t about this thing is going to kill me one of these days, people who weren\u2019t about living with, living with, living with, not dying from disease, people who were disabled and alive and not\u00a0sick, not dying, but raising hell and building lives and screaming, screaming, screaming when we were being killed.\u00a0People who used words like we.I thought, we, yes. We. Okay. We can make this work.\n\nlol conflating disability and DEATH so casually that nobody but disabled ppl notices.\n\nWhen you are disabled, when you are traumatized and vision-impaired and autistic, even and maybe especially when you haven\u2019t been given those access codes yet, you learn to see yourself as the walking dead. You are vast swathes of\u00a0nonexistence, cut off and left for dead at every missed milestone and swapped pronoun and bruised shin and scar on your face. There are Other People, Normal People, People, and then there is you, \u00a0and you are defined by the parts of yourself that match to everyone around you, and then the vast swathes of nothing. Disability is absence, disability is inability, disability is death, and you are a woman in a\u00a0refrigerator.\u00a0It takes you a while to learn that you aren\u2019t the one who put you in the refrigerator.\u00a0It takes longer to learn that it wasn\u2019t your body, either.A lot of us never get to the point where we can say it was you, you tried to kill me, you made me think I was dead, you screamed about the\u00a0injustice\u00a0of putting me in a\u00a0refrigerator\u00a0while you, you were the one killing me.\n\nlol conflating disability and DEATH so casually that nobody but disabled ppl notices.\n\nAnd you made me think it was my fault.One day, I will write a speech that isn\u2019t this one, this choked and untitled remixed stew of you tried to kill me, and you made me think it was my fault, and now you will listen.When you\u2019re disabled, you see death everywhere, and it isn\u2019t because your body stands out or doesn\u2019t stand at all, it\u2019s because everyone talks about you like you\u2019re in a\u00a0refrigerator, like you\u2019re not real, like you\u2019re dead.And it kills you.They kill you.\n\nlol conflating disability and DEATH so casually that nobody but disabled ppl notices.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that of course, of COURSE, of fucking course we notice, because we can\u2019t not, because the bioethics conference has one day for beginning-of-life issues, where they try to cut us out, and then a day for end-of-life, for those of us who slipped by, because last week twins in Belgium asked the state to kill them because no one ever told them that they didn\u2019t have to go into the\u00a0refrigerator.\u00a0What I am trying to say is, my friend has a friend who uses a wheelchair and didn\u2019t get screened for breast cancer because she\u2019s already dead, right?\u00a0And you,\u00a0you,\u00a0every single one of you who said we are helping, we are saving you, something cruel and\u00a0unjust\u00a0has been done, and then you made disability mean death and shoved us into the fucking\u00a0refrigerator. You killed us.I didn\u2019t know how to die until you taught me.\n\nlol conflating disability and DEATH so casually that nobody but disabled ppl notices.\n\nQuestion: if nobody but disabled people know that disability and death are distinct and not\u00a0overlapping\u00a0concepts, does anyone really know? Or are we just trees in the forest, falling (well, growing, would be the point,) with no one to hear?What I am trying to say is, I am now Someone Who People Meet, and I know that there is a vast\u00a0we\u00a0out there, and I know that I am living and a woman and disabled and that none of these contradict, and I dragged myself out of the\u00a0refrigerator\u00a0by the skin of my teeth and said you will listen to me now, and this evening I felt sick when some friends offered to transcribe something for me, and I still can\u2019t see myself making thirty.And what I am saying is, this thing is going to kill me one of these days, and what is going to kill me isn\u2019t going to be my back screaming at me or my eyes turning off or my head going through a wall, it\u2019s going to be everyone who says we\u2019re just trying to get you out of your\u00a0refrigerator.\u00a0I pulled myself out of the\u00a0refrigerator\u00a0you put me into the day you started grading people into people and cripples.

See, C knew something that Julia did not.C knew that Abed Nadir existed.Now, there are a couple of things you, gentle reader, must know about Julia in order to appreciate what happens next. First, you must understand that, ever since she had been born and maybe even before, Julia had been autistic. And second, you must understand that, because of this, Julia had spent her whole life watching and learning stories where she had no part, no point of entry, and no value. Julia was trained to imagine herself in stories as someone she was not and could never be, and to define the story of her own life in terms of how it failed to be reflected back to her. And sometimes, most of the times, Julia forgot that she was a person. Stories are important, and she didn\u2019t have one. You are a mistake isn\u2019t a story. It\u2019s barely even a sentence. I must warn you now that this is not a story of how C or Dan Harmon or Abed Nadir or even Julia herself saved or healed Julia. It\u2019s in the script, but Julia wouldn\u2019t have a voice in any of those stories, either. No, gentle readers and vicious tumblr-ers, this is a story of what it means to start a new story and see on your screen, for the first time, someone who moves like you.Do you understand what that means?It\u2019s probably not something you\u2019ve ever really had to think about. But how someone moves is the first thing telling you whether or not they might be able to be you, and you them. And for the first time in Julia\u2019s life, she looked at a character on television and saw a yes.Abed Nadir walked onto Julia\u2019s laptop screen, and nothing and everything changed.For the next seventh months, there was a lot of CAPSLOCKING IN GOOGLE CHAT at C about Community and Abed Nadir, but very few words elsewhere. Which was odd, because when Julia liked things, she tended to talk about them too much. This was one of many things she and Abed had in common.Except, here\u2019s the funny thing. Abed said \u201cI just like liking things,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t just not-punished, it wasn\u2019t just okay\u2014either of which would have been remarkable and unbelievable\u2014no. It was good.And Julia, who had endless words for a great many small and unimportant things, couldn\u2019t say anything more about Abed beyond he moves like me.Abed Nadir, you see, is an autistic character.There\u2019s a difference between TV Autistics and autistic characters on television. TV Autistics\u2014Bones, House, Sheldon, Sherlock\u2014are caricatures, and, not coincidentally, all fan-diagnosed. They are socially awkward/anti-social/socially maladapted, eccentric geniuses free of any serious adaptive functioning limitations, motor issues, sensory sensitivities, or language differences, able to manage independently in all major areas of daily living, with a bonus side of savant skills and the empathic range of a rock. They\u2019re awesome, but they\u2019re a stock character, and they manage to simultaneously hint at the autistic experience without actually meaning it. It\u2019s like that poster about gay subtext in popular that was going around a while ago the irony being, of course, that for a show that is \u201cso gay,\u201d it\u2019s actually not gay at all. The people in charge have found the perfect ratio of homoerotic subtext (all of it) to actual gay characters (none of them) to keep the fangirls creaming their pants and the money rolling in. No one involved has any intention of meaningful inclusion or exploration. You avoid any potentially unpleasant consequences, because the choice to have a gay character was never actually made.It should be noted that autism isn\u2019t the only reason Julia grew up without People Like Her on television, and it\u2019s not even close to the only reason she has a Thing about stories. And that\u2019s the curious thing about these TV Autistics\u2014someone who\u2019s watched one of them in action is much more predisposed to assume that since Julia is autistic, and since she\u2019s got this extended metaphor (bonus points if you say perseveration) about stories going on, stories must be her Special Interest, the framework through which she filters the world, the poor half-human thing.And they are, but that\u2019s because Julia is, shockingly, a person at her core. And people need stories.Which brings us back to Abed.It\u2019s entirely possible Julia over-identified with Abed, just a tad. Which struck her as first a bit odd\u2014they\u2019re nothing alike, Abed thinks The Breakfast Club had a plot and likes falafel and his mom had the decency to leave\u2014 and then as more than a bit precarious. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.(Somewhere, fiddling with her contacts, C arched an eyebrow and said \u201cit wasn\u2019t?\u201d and Julia cyber-kicked her.)Abed Nadir walked around like a bird or a giraffe, and he couldn\u2019t do thumbs-up and he talked too fast and knew too many things and he was sharp and suspicious and easy and trusting. He did things that were simultaneously uncanny/creepy and sweet/thoughtful, and he couldn\u2019t do bills or read clocks but he could tell psychiatrists to fuck off and he could fight with his best friend when his best friend tried to take charge, and he was jealous and sharp with his crushes. He had friends and private worlds, and all the scars that come from growing up a mistake, and things were imperfect and messy and painful and visceral but he always emerged okay.Abed Nadir said \u201cplease don\u2019t do a special episode about me\u201d and Jeff Winger promised he \u201cwouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201dAnd then he told Abed to pick one reference, and Abed picked 16 Candles, so they sat on the counter and ate chicken.(And Abed didn\u2019t mind who he was kissing so long as he got to be Han Solo, and also he delivered several babies and got to be the good cop and the bad cop and used his diagnosis to get rid of an unfortunate lab partner and took advantage of a stranger in a bar\u2019s patience so he could talk about Farscape.)And stories are a scary and messy business, full of magic and demons, taunting possibilities and rules-that-aren\u2019t, things we can\u2019t have and altogether far too many opportunities for a sad little girl\u2019s heart to be ripped out of her chest, and Julia kept watching, every week. And you must understand that asking Julia to pick one Abed moment is liking asking Abed to pick one reference.You must understand that one story is infinitely bigger than zero, and it may still be very small and nowhere near enough, but it\u2019s something.And yes, her heart was eventually forcibly extracted when Dan Harmon broke his promise and Virtual Systems Analysis was the dreaded Special Episode. And Julia remembered how to breathe, and stitched herself back up, because she hadn\u2019t really needed that heart, anyway. And when it turned out that someone else would be in charge of Abed next year, she remembered what she had always known to be true about happy endings and said goodbye, mourned more than she had for any corporeal person (which was still not very much,) and folded away that part of herself and went back to not existing.But for seven months.For seven months, she had.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/someone-who-moves-like-you/", "title": "Someone who moves like\u00a0you"},
{"date": "October 31, 2012", "body": "(This post could be seen as a self-narrating zoo-exhibit with bonus spot-the-theory-of-mind. I hope you\u2019ll take it as a follow-up to The Obsessive Joy Of Autism, as equally about the experiences of visual processing impairments and synesthesia as about ~autism, and as a case study in the inadequacy of traditional verbal language. If I\u2019d been taught earlier that experiences which exist independent of words are still meaningful and sufficient, I never would have had to write this.)(This whole essay represents a dozen years of heartache, a fractured self-image knit back together, and the entire reason why I will never, ever talk about the instinctive simplicity of video editing.)(Note: as is typical of my writings, pieces are rarely finished in the same day they are started. The voice lesson I refer to as \u201ctoday\u201d is in reality long past; in fact, due to circumstances regrettably beyond my control, it turned out to be my last. I have been unable to further explore the discovery my voice teacher and I made, and it aches.)(This entire piece is written in a voice I don\u2019t very much care for. My apologies.)(I can either keep apologizing in parentheses for a lifetime, or just tell it to you.)A fifth is two sine curves, and this is the most beautiful thing.I\u2019ve had a dozen years of classical musical training, and I\u2019ve been playing with calculus for about the same amount of time. I don\u2019t talk about either of these things with much frequency. I don\u2019t like to sing in front of people, and I have a passionate love affair with math but hated and barely passed my classes in high school. I drink up geometry videos on youtube, and once a week I go to my voice teacher\u2019s house and sing for the best hour of the week, and these things are secrets. Very few people know how important music and math are to me, and that\u2019s been a deliberate choice on my part.I don\u2019t talk about the most sacred things, because it\u2019s the fastest way to destroy them.I have an intense and embodied relationship with music. Music is a lot like people, and songs are linguistic and therefore social exercises. Music teases and tells and remembers and reflects and transforms and encodes and transmits. I experience music kinesthetically, emotionally, and intimately. It is shattering.I know a lot about music. I hate talking about it, because the things I know aren\u2019t the same as the things you know.My left hand doesn\u2019t have enough coordination to permit me to play any instruments. I can, and do, sing, and I\u2019ve spent 12 years learning to do so with surgical precision. I can\u2019t sight-sing\u2013I can peel apart the layers of a piece for theory, no problem, but identifying pitch and tempo and dynamic and a note\u2019s place in the overall piece, and integrating those elements, factoring in timbre and placement, and singing them, in realtime, is simply not possible with my visual processing impairments. I rely on an ear I\u2019ve spent years training\u2013if there\u2019s one other singer, or a pianist accompanying, I can do a passable imitation of first-time sight-singing even pieces I\u2019ve never heard before. Ever since I first joined an (auditioned, highly-selective, then-prestigious) youth choir at age eight, I\u2019ve known that I do music wrong. At first, that took the form of being shamed for moving when I sang\u2013music shouldn\u2019t be a physical, embodied, tactile experience. In later years, my inability to process visually rapidly enough to sight-sing, and my difficulty holding a harmony, made rehearsal a living hell. Yet I was never kicked out, because I could still sing circles around 2/3 of the other singers, and it wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t harmonize, just that I might sing any one of a range of acceptable harmonies and not necessarily the one I was arbitrarily assigned (or the one the composer had written,) and as long as I didn\u2019t talk about it, no one knew I couldn\u2019t sight-sing. (I did, of course, talk about it; lying didn\u2019t occur to me until later years.) I trained my ear, led the 1st sopranos because the melodic options are necessarily restricted and usually sensical, kept my joy at things I had the wrong words for to myself, and kept singing.(My life goes on\nin endless song\nhow can I keep from singing?)It destroyed me. I loved this, I was so good at it, it felt good and right and perfect, and yet any attempts to communicate about this were miserable failures. Singing is the only time I ever feel at home in my body, and yet I felt like a fraud; sure I could learn a new song faster than anyone using only my ear, but I couldn\u2019t sight-sing. Clearly this was some elaborate hoax I\u2019d engineered, clearly I didn\u2019t have any real aptitude, and clearly, my decision not to pursue college or career in music or performance was the only ethical option.Despite this, despite the guilt and shame and confusion, I\u2019ve kept going to weekly lessons. It\u2019s an hour, just me and my teacher and a piano, and as we pull songs apart and test what my throat can do, the songs resonate between my ribs. It is, essentially, an hour of breathing exercises,  so it\u2019s the most effective therapy I\u2019ve ever had. And I\u2019ve kept going, and today, finally, after 12 years, we figured it out.There were signs. The music teacher at my high school had almost worked it out; he\u2019d play two notes, and I\u2019d hear a third, and not every student could. He talked about harmonics and melodic structure; I listened, and adored him, but had trouble talking to him. With my voice teacher, I complained that the standard system of music notation was nonsensical, bearing no correspondence to the way music actually worked, and relied on a flagrant disregard for basic arithmetic. I struggled with the idea that a fourth is supposed to sound \u201csmaller\u201d than a fifth, and though I could sing any note back perfectly, I couldn\u2019t tell you which notes were higher or lower. None of the language used to communicate about music made any kind of sense to me. The spatial metaphors simply would not map. I had my own rich, dynamic, embodied and  visiospatial experience of music, I could feel and see the music move, and sheet music couldn\u2019t come close.I\u2019ll tell you what my teacher and I learned today, but first I need to give away my other secret: math.My history with mathematics is, if possible, even more tortured and rapturous and bewildering than my relationship with music. As a small child, I was in love with arithmetic; my mental calculation abilities are noted on my earliest evaluations (and dismissed, of course, as splinter skills.) One of my earliest memories is of not being able to explain to a concerned teacher why 2+3=5. \u201cBecause it is,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s beautiful. It just fits.\u201d Manipulatives were meaningless for me\u2013my eyes couldn\u2019t process them easily, and they didn\u2019t bear any relation to the ladders and scales of numbers in my head. I simply had to close my eyes, and think of an equation, and I would feel myself swing from number to number, landing effortlessly and securely on the answer. Easier than walking.(There\u2019s a hint to the eventual reveal, there.)While I had some small troubles learning the language for arithmetic (especially for fractions, which are fun and clever enough as pointless rituals but beautiful when you realize that they actually signify multiplication and division, that you are performing meta math,) mathematics was an easy joy. Note, please, that I am talking about the art of mathematics, not the drivel and formulas we\u2019re drilled on in school. Mathematics really is an art, and it\u2019s inherently playful. It\u2019s a game of \u201cwhat if\u201d and \u201chow can I.\u201d And when I was eight years old (and still now,) what I wanted most to figure out was how I could model, and therefore predict, events in the world around me. In particular, I was fascinated by the rate at which raindrops crossed and accumulated on my car window as my mom drove me to therapy.So I invented the fundamental theorem of calculus. I didn\u2019t know I was doing this at the time, of course. I didn\u2019t know what algebra was yet; if I\u2019d heard of calculus, I thought it was about calculators, which I found woefully inefficient. I\u2019d never heard of Liebnitz, and Newton had only been hit on the head by a terrifying apple, as far as I knew. I didn\u2019t use the greek alphabet or sigma notation; I didn\u2019t use any notation at all. I just ran some dimensional transformations in my head, checked my model for accuracy, and had a nice visual to keep myself comforted when my hands needed to be still.Eight years later, my AP Calculus/Physics class was asked to prove the relationship between derivatives and integrals, and I got up and drew the model, and not a single one of my classmates understood. After a moment of studying what I did, Mr. Morris said, \u201cspoiler alert, Julia just skipped to the end of the lesson and proved the fundamental theorem of calculus.\u201dI can\u2019t draw it for you now; I lost the image, along with some of my more unusual human-calculator prowess, when my psychiatrist put me on the anti-psych medication regimen that ended in me dropping out of college. But I could then, and before that day, I hadn\u2019t realized that my classmates couldn\u2019t see that basic, innate relationship, the reason why calculus is beautiful enough to ache. I didn\u2019t have the language for it, had never even heard of the fundamental theorem until my teacher told me that was what I\u2019d done. I\u2019d just been amusing myself with models and transformations, when I should have been paying attention in class.See, that\u2019s the thing. I struggled in math class from Algebra 1 on. I never actually took the AP calculus exam\u2013Mr. Morris thought I\u2019d do fine, but since I was technically auditing his class, I didn\u2019t want to try and sit for it. And this is where the agony comes in.Much like music, the way I experience and represent mathematics cognitively is fundamentally different from the conventional language we are taught for it. With arithmetic, this difference only really caused difficulty when new terms were being introduced. But 2+3 is always 5, and I had enough innate understanding and motivation to preserver through even the most ridiculous name choices. This all fell apart when I got to algebra. It\u2019s not that I lacked understanding\u2013I\u2019d been solving for the missing number since I was nine, and the only hardship I\u2019d had there was, again, in comprehending the linguistic absurdity of mixing letters and numbers and shifting the missing piece to the left side of the equation. As soon as I got over that, I immediately started attempting to teach the game to anyone around me, including my four-year-old sister. Algebra wasn\u2019t the issue. The way we represented it, modeled it, and talked about it? That was a nightmare.Graphs on a cartesian plane have a lot of meaning for me\u2013for another purpose (clue.) They also bear absolutely no relation to the kinesthetic and visual models I see when I craft algebraic equations. Zero. None. And I couldn\u2019t articulate this in high school, anymore than I could make myself care about pitch or slope whether the equation came in point-slope or some other form. I didn\u2019t understand why we were talking about graphs at all. It wasn\u2019t until algebra 2 that someone explained to me that all of our equations were supposed to be models for those lines.I was enraged.I still am, thinking about it. What a stupid waste of my time. Who the fuck cared about lines? I wanted to know how to model the age distribution of my peers around me and how it shifted in relation to me as we moved through the grades, how to fit equilateral triangles with a side length of 2in inside a hexagon with 6in sides as efficiently as possible, how to predict prime numbers. Why on earth would I make an equation for a line I couldn\u2019t even make my hands draw reliably half the time?I wouldn\u2019t! This possibility had never occurred to me! I had better things to do!So I didn\u2019t care about graphs. Later, in college, my math major friend would teach me the theory behind linear algebra in half an hour, and I would concede that graphs were pretty fucking intense, but in high school, all I knew was that I was being asked to humor, to indulge teachers who were never sure if I was a genius or in the wrong class in their fetish with graphs that my eyes, more often than not, couldn\u2019t even process as a whole.It did not go well.There were parts of algebra, of course, that I loved. I enjoyed modeling numeric patterns (\u201cseries,\u201d I was told, and \u201csummations,\u201d I just called it numbers) like 2n + 7, and there were moments when the graphs for these, or for my favorite exponents, lined up with the stacks of numbers I saw in my head, and the graph became, fleetingly, meaningful. (It was argued that graphs themselves were by definition simply visual models of numeric patterns, and therefore should have been my favorite thing. I defy anyone to look at something like THISand honestly tell me that they instinctively see either 2n + 7 or 9, 11, 13, 15, etc. in that.) Systems of equations were a game that made me laugh and resembled the way I\u2019d play with numbers in my notebook margins when we were supposed to be caring about matrices. Matrices were for our calculators; I was a human calculator, insulted by their existence. My first three algebra teachers understood none of this. I did well in algebra one, as long as I wasn\u2019t asked to graph anything; as far as I was concerned, I was doing slightly fancier arithmetic and then humoring Mr. Morris by labeling things as he wished. Algebra 2 was all about graphing though, and it made me want to die\u2013and now, in an exciting plot twist, the equations had gotten long enough, and the graphs complex enough, that my visual process started undermining me, scrambling letters and transposing numbers and fragmenting graphs, and with it, my grade. But I passed, by the skin of my teeth, and had a brief reprieve in geometry, and then got a better teacher for precalculus who, in the last two weeks of class, realized I had a language processing problem. We stayed after school one day and hacked enough accommodations that I could FINALLY start to use the conventional vocabulary and start training my eyes to read equations like stories again, the way 2+3=5 is, and then graph the story out accordingly. Just in time for the bonus unit on calculus.I looked at a derivative for the first time, and my models and raindrops and joy came rushing back, and I was in heaven.Derivatives and integrals made sense because the transformations they undergo are multi-dimensional, just as the ones I assign my models are. But I didn\u2019t ace calculus. I took an introductory course at Stanford the summer before my senior year of high school and passed on sheer intuition despite missing 1/3 of the classes, but the first few tests I took in my AP class came back with failing grades.My teacher and I worked it out. It was, as always, a visual processing issue: permitted to solve an equation on a white board, standing up, with more space than I could possibly use, colored markers, writing as large as I needed, and only one problem presented at a time, I could earn 100%. Give me the same test, after I\u2019d already taken it on the whiteboard, but this time package it as a two-page test on an 8\u00d711 inches sheet of paper, and I\u2019d get a 40%. It seemed easy enough to accommodate: let me take my tests on a whiteboard, with my teacher dictating each problem to me one at a time, and I could be the best in the class. The beauty of reasonable accommodation! But it wasn\u2019t that easy; the teachers were working to contract in protest of their current salary, so my teacher couldn\u2019t stay after school or come in early to test me. If I\u2019d had an IEP I would have been protected, but my parents were told that students with IEPs weren\u2019t permitted to take AP classes. The solution, the administration declared, was that I would audit the class. I could sit in on every class, do every lab and homework, receive no credit, have my motivation and self-esteem destroyed by a year of failing every test but doing any in-class problem on the board perfectly, teach my class the fundamental theorem of calculus but be humiliated every day by my inability to correctly read and copy equations off a sheet of paper, and everybody won.I don\u2019t remember much of the class. I was an anxious, humiliated, depressive mess, unable to concentrate, still haunted by graphs. It was a combined calculus/physics class: I loved the modeling, but my language processing made the word problems we were given for physics exhausting. There are bright memories, of course\u2013drawing out the fundamental theorem, hacking labs, solving problems at the board, practicing integrals with Tommy for fun, tutoring a classmate over Facebook chat for a test that I failed with a record- breaking amount of transcription errors but she got an A+ on. But I hesitate to call myself mathematically inclined now, and that needlessly hellish year is why.Math and music are some of the most sacred and meaningful things in the world to me. I don\u2019t talk about them, because that requires a 12-year trauma history and interfacing with a language that treats these two things exactly opposite of how the should be.(Do you know the secret, yet?)This is what I learned, at the last music lesson I ever took: I see musical compositions as the graphs I spent years being tortured with perversions of, and I move through numbers like a song.The spatial metaphors we traditionally use for music (notes are higher or lower; a second is a whole step, a third is two whole steps, etc.) fall apart for me not only because of their flagrant disregard for basic mathematics, but also because my primary concept of music lies in harmonics: in the spaces between tonic and supertonic, in the beats of the frequency of a given pitch, and all the different ways we can stretch and collapse and layer and color them. This is what I see, this is what I hear (and the two are, in this instance, the same,) every time music plays. Sheet music is as pale an imitation of this as a graph of y=3x is of the multiplication table. And yet, the transformations I drag my models through, the process of solving an equation (and I\u2019ve never been much of one for solving, really; just give me a model and I\u2019m happy, and maybe that was the problem with algebra all along,) is actually perfectly encapsulated by the language and metaphors musicians use to interpret sheet music.And I just wish that once, at some point, just once during those long twelve years, someone said to me \u201cthis language isn\u2019t working for you. Let\u2019s find a new one.\u201d Because then I could have told you, at eight years old, before I could even conjugate reliably or deviate from my scripts, that:this is what C sounds like:this is what G sounds like:this is what a fifth sounds like:and this, Mrs. Lowenthall,  is why 2+3=5:", "outgoing_links": ["http://io9.com/5947852/this-is-a-hexaflexagon-its-about-to-blow-your-mind?fb_action_ids=4695156737637%2C10151465733434097&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=other_multiline&action_object_map=%7B%224695156737637%22%3A114534322033392%2C%2210151465733434097%22%3A114534322033392%7D&action_type_map=%7B%224695156737637%22%3A%22og.likes%22%2C%2210151465733434097%22%3A%22og.likes%22%7D&action_ref_map", "http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2012/10/31/a-fifth-is-two-sine-curves/", "title": "A Fifth Is Two Sine\u00a0Curves"},
{"date": "August 31, 2011", "body": "They say I\u2019m articulate.(I think about all the words that stay locked in my throat, and I give a small and terrified smile and look over their shoulder and into nothing at all.)I\u2019m really quite lucky I have such a command of language.(There are maybe five people in the whole wide world I can talk to face-to-face without wanting to die, without having a panic attack, without needing to hurt myself or sleep for hours afterward. Two of them receive speech therapy. None of them obey the usual laws of dialogue. I know that, really, I\u2019m lucky to have anyone at all.)My verbal agility is a sign of something, they\u2019re sure.(When I\u2019m trapped into a conversation in the kitchen of someone else\u2019s home, I stare at the table and see nothing at all, and my throat closes and my ears ring and the world is small and distant and hot and I am agile because adrenaline alters our capabilities.)I\u2019m really quite social.(If I am asked how are you I will always say fine. If you ask me anything at all I will throw as many words as I can in your general direction. I can have quiet hands but the loudest mouth, I\u2019m very advanced, and for my next trick I\u2019ll even ask what\u2019s up with you.)I can answer every question you might ever have.(Except for what do you need or how do you feel or do you want anything or is this okay.)I can request independently and answer yes-no questions reliably.(I can request independently because I never make requests, which means independence, which means I must not have to but I could if I did, right? But if you ask me if I need help I will say no, and if you ask, as my hands fly around my ears and my shoulders go tight and small, if I\u2019m okay, I will say yes because I can\u2019t say no and if I could it would mean more talking and less space and I will say anything at all to get you to go away until my brain is my own again.)I am verbose and prosaic in my speech.(I am as helpless to stay silent when you speak to me as I am to move when I need to do laundry. I freeze, staring at my dirty clothes, and every cognitive break I own clamps down because I can\u2019t, because there are too many steps, because this has been the Summer Of Laundry Wars and I have lost.

You can\u2019t get mad at us for telling the truth.\u201d I want to teach you about being harassed by airport security because I crawl through the checkpoints, my hands shaking and my mind spinning, concentrating on one step at a time.

{"date": "April 24, 2011", "body": "\nFor a very long time I used to think I was different.\nI wasn\u2019t disabled. God, no, I was super good at math and hey, I read the unabridged version of Les Miserables when I was 12! I skipped eighth grade! I would be perfectly fine if people would stop just poking me all the time.\nI was just different, they said, and they said it was cool and maybe a little edgy and it made me special and it meant that I was just as good as everyone else. I was different, see, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t think that I had toes if I couldn\u2019t see them, that\u2019s why I spent the whole hour-and-a-half of geometry seeing how high I could count by 15\u2019s, that\u2019s why I knew when everyone\u2019s birthday was.\nNo big deal.\nI was just different, see, and so I felt things differently from my peers, and different things happened to me, and things had different meanings. I was different, and my world was different. That was okay.\nExcept for the part where it wasn\u2019t at all.\nSee, here\u2019s the thing. There is an acceptable margin of difference allowed a person, and an acceptable range of ways to be different within that margin, and anyone who pushes beyond that gets pushed into the Uncanny Valley. People in the Uncanny Valley are neither wholly human nor entirely nonhuman, which means we get the human treatment sometimes, and other times we get beat up until the uncanny parts of us are sufficiently chipped off.\nAs an Uncanny Valley girl, I can trick people sometimes\u2014kind of a lot, sometimes. So people got really, really mad when they went to sit next to me and I punched them for being too close, because what the hell, that is not what a human does. I was a bad person, tricking them like that.\nSo I got punished.\nWhen the beating was over, when they let go of my wrist or told me I could maybe come to the next party, I was always, always offered an out. There is a list, somewhere, of the acceptable ways to be different, and they would suggest that maybe I could fit myself safely into one of those boxes, chip off the bad edges off myself on my own, and be a proper human. Give them a break, you know. Help myself out.\nI would like the record to show that I tried.\nI could be gifted, right? I took graduate courses in psychology at Stanford during my sixteenth summer, that should seal the deal\u2014but none of the other students had their A\u2019s dropped to B\u2019s solely because they hid under their bed, wracked with panic attacks, instead of going to class.\nI could be a theater nerd, surely. I loved to mimic people, I loved plays and theaters, I could sing, I stage-managed like no one else\u2014but you had to know how to control your body on stage, and maybe more importantly, you had to participate in the massage trains in the green room, so being in theater was immediately out of the question for me.\nI could be a manic-pixie-dream-girl, right? That was like the epitome of different, and I was so very, very different. I only wore skirts, and I said strange things and repeated things over and over and scratched patterns out on my skin. Surely I just needed love, friendship, someone to save me who also needed me to save them.\nI discovered, though, that manic-pixie-dream-girls don\u2019t bang their heads, and when someone touches them they know how to let themselves be touched. They see the world differently, but it\u2019s an endearing and quirky and acceptable and unremittingly real view, not one that is confused and forgetful and blurred and above all fleeting. They use words differently, but they use the same words as everyone else and they seem to mean the same things.\nPeople like manic-pixie-dream-girls. Some people even like nerds, and gifted students, and kids who spend their Saturdays painting sets.\nPeople didn\u2019t like me.\nThey were so nice to me, carefully working at smoothing out my edges until I fit into one or another of the acceptable differences they offered me, and I was so ungrateful and selfish and obsessive, not cooperating with any of it. Where did I get off, saying I wanted to kill myself, failing tests, waving my arms around, saying things that just no one says, looking over their shoulders instead of into their eyes? Fine. If I didn\u2019t want their help, I wouldn\u2019t get it. See how I liked it then.\nSee, sometimes being different isn\u2019t the best thing about you. Sometimes it isn\u2019t allowed. Sometimes, if you grab onto that label too much, it gets ripped away from you. Sometimes, if you say you are different too often, you get to hear, over and over and over and over again, how everyone is exactly like you.\nSo you get mad, and you take them at their word, and you start asking awkward questions. Were they nicknamed Droolia? Did they get sexually abused when they wiped the drool away on their collar one too many times? Did they get denied medical treatment for their broken wrist because they didn\u2019t cry enough to be in real pain? Can they look at a person\u2019s entire face at once and see it all? Do they come home from school and lie under a blanket for two hours until their head stops echoing from the hallways? Do they know how to mix 50\u00a0mg of liquid Zoloft into 8 oz of orange-pineapple juice so the taste is perfectly hidden? How many friends do they have, and do they see any of them outside of Honors English? Can they scream, or do their vocal cords paralyze at the first flash of any significant emotion? Have they ever completed an entire test in physics perfectly, except for the part where every number\u2014every single one\u2014written down on their work papers was different from those given on the exam?\nOh. It turns out that was just me.\nI guess I really am different, then.\nNo shit. Get out of here. \nThe moment when the Uncanny Valley mask slips and people realize you really are just hideously outside the acceptable range of different is not a fun one. It stays very Not Fun. It extends past a moment and into a lifetime. The question is asked: if you\u2019re not even allowed to fake being an acceptable human, what are you?\nYou\u2019re disabled.\nI\u2019m disabled. I\u2019m not different at all, really, I\u2019m much, much more like you than anything else\u2014but that\u2019s not seen, that\u2019s not allowed, and so I am disabled. My Autism is not a cute, acceptable, or advantageous difference. It\u2019s a disability. I was not born configured for this world, and it fell to me to make up that difference, and there were so many places where I could not close the gap.\nI am disabled, and I will never, never be content to call myself \u201cdifferent\u201d again. When you are different it\u2019s okay for you to not quite meet up with the rest of the world here and there, because most of the time, when it matters, everything syncs up. When you are disabled you don\u2019t have that luxury. When you are disabled you have to prove, over and over again, that you are a real person\u2014and then someone forgets, or you meet someone new, and you have to start again.\nThat\u2019s not a difference. That\u2019s a disability.\nMy name is Julia and I\u2019m Autistic. I\u2019m not different; I\u2019m disabled. I can say it now.\nBut then, I didn\u2019t have much of a choice.\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/disabled-not-different/", "title": "Disabled, Not Different"},
{"date": "January 31, 2015", "body": "\nThere are two stories I could tell you.One: I\u2019m clinging to my roommate\u2019s arm, trying to (re)learn how to walk in heels.Two: a friend sent me a pair of shoes.*****One: I wore heels, once. I was in a choir, a choir that was a Really Big Deal, and the high school girls had to wear character shoes. I got the lowest possible heel, and I was okay, mostly.I liked how they sounded on the floor, so sometimes I wore them in college, or to DD council meetings, or when I went to Washington. I think they had maybe a half-inch heel.I lost my character shoes in the move. Two years went by. I tore all the muscles in my left ankle, every last one, and I couldn\u2019t go to physical therapy.I put on a new pair of heels, and I knew, instantly that I didn\u2019t remember how to do this.*****Two: my life looks very different from high school. I am connected now, in some pretty formal ways, to hundreds of disabled people all across the world. A couple of weeks ago, one of those people, a Facebook friend who has done a lot to show me what living with pride and joy in a disabled body looks like, posted that she had somehow wound up with a pair of mary janes that were far too big for her. Did any crip femmes she knew want them?They were a size 11. I usually only have 1 pair of shoes at a time, and let me tell you, finding cute shoes in your size when you are over six feet tall is not easy. I said so. She sent me a picture, I noted they had heels, we worked out the logistics.A few days ago, they arrived. I was having a bad hands day, so my roommate helped me open the box.I did remember how to put them on by myself.*****I am autistic. Just like the screenings warn, I walked on my toes when I was little, and until I hurt my ankle this summer, I still did. I can dance, kind of, not really. In my own way. I have a lot of trouble with conventional femininity: I wear long skirts and long hair after a religious upbringing, but I don\u2019t have the motor skills or the patience or the social-cognitive something for most of the work required to do femme traditionally. I can\u2019t put on my own makeup or paint my nails; I can\u2019t fasten any clothes that a typical six year-old can\u2019t. I used to be able to pin up my braids, but I lost that skill sometime last year after going too long without OT. The day you see me with my hair perfectly coiffed and my eyes carefully made up, in a coat that buttons and boots with no zippers, is the day you know I\u2019ve either been married or placed on a Medicaid waiver.Like a lot of disabled women hoping no one notices we\u2019ve snuck into the professional world, I cling to the few scraps of traditional femininity I can hold on to with my teeth. My friend, another autistic woman in the workplace, calls it \u201cfemme-NOS.\u201dBeing able to wear heels again would be a big deal.*****\u201cWe\u2019re gonna walk around the room,\u201d my roommate says, and I nod and hang on for dear life.\u201cWhy did you want these?\u201d he asks.\u201cThe gala,\u201d I say, grimly. One of these days I am going to be dressed to kill.\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. At the last gala, he helped ferry me from guest to guest, guiding me through the crowd and staving off meltdowns and making the loudest night of the year mildly enjoyable.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to practice a lot.\u201d*****One of my other friends runs a blog called CP Shoes, about disability and shoes and some other things. I know as soon as I volunteer to take the shoes that I am going to want to write a thing for her. I\u2019m writing, again, because some things worked out and I have a little more energy, a tiny bit of space for words left in my brain on the weekends.Some of my friends and I are starting to talk, in various places and various ways, about #DressingWhileDisabled. There are a lot of stories about disability out there, and not a lot of them look like our lives. We have to tell them ourselves. We have to tell them together.I sit down, and there are two stories I can write.One: I\u2019m autistic, and there are things I have to learn and struggle with and overcome, like wearing heels.Two: a friend sent me a pair of shoes, and on a night dedicated to celebrating disability and community and the way my brain and my body glitch at each other, I\u2019m going to wear them.I want to write a story about shoes and disability, about the connections disability community makes between people who are very short and people who are awkward crashing giants, about the ways my life has gotten so much bigger, about objects and ideas that get passed from person to person, about the ways that disabled women or crip femmes or we take care of each other when no one else will.We\u2019re taking it one step, one story, at a time.

{"date": "April 29, 2011", "body": "So you need to know about Kimba.I met Kimba three years ago. I walked into the lifeskills classroom at the middle school, and he was moaning and flapping in the corner. I kind of wanted to do the same thing but I didn\u2019t, which meant that the teachers mistook me for a neurotypical like them, which meant that the first thing I got to learn about Kimba was that \u201che just tried to throw a chair at me.\u201dI learned a lot of other things about Kimba in the next few days. I couldn\u2019t sit within four feet of him, because he would attack me\u2014he didn\u2019t like anyone except his aide, and he went after her pretty regularly too. He had successfully convinced the teachers for an entire semester that he couldn\u2019t read at all, only to be foiled when they gave him a puzzle of animal names and he completed it perfectly. The only words he said were \u201cNO!\u201d, \u201cBUH-BYE!\u201d, and \u201cONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR-FIVE!\u201d, screamed like something was breaking. About a month after I first met him, I learned two more things: he was a foster child, and the previous night he had attempted to beat his foster mother to death and had almost succeeded.Here\u2019s what I learned about Kimba over the next three years: he is incredibly intellectually gifted. He taught himself to read. He has a system in which he classifies every person he encounters as a different animal based on personality, appearance, relationship and attitude towards him, and the pleasantness of their encounter. He may be autistic, he may have various brain injuries, he might be selectively mute, he definitely had lead poisoning. He uses language obliquely, employing rich and innovative metaphors. He analyzes the symbolism in Disney movies, but his favorite television series is Kimba The White Lion. He taught himself how to use Google. He speed-reads. He spent the first nine years of his life in one of the most horrifically abusive environments my state has on record.Kimba and I, now, spend most of our time in lifeskills together. We are virtually inseparable. I was the one who proved that he could read far above the level he was assigned. I am the only person he willingly lets touch his speech-generating device when he\u2019s having trouble finding the words. He\u2019s held my hand when I randomly dissociated, and he\u2019s grabbed my phone and texted KIMBA when he thought I was spending too long talking to the White House. When he wants to bang his head, now, he grabs my hands and I squeeze at his ears until he can breathe again. He puts his hands on my head and does the same for me.For three years, Kimba and I have stood (often literally) hand-in-hand, united, in our very different pain and very different ways, against a world designed to shut us out. I curled around him when he was having flashbacks and he copied my bitch-face and employed it against incompetent substitutes. I foiled his plans and told his general-ed teachers that he could, in fact, read very well, and he tried to teach me how to wink. When I left lifeskills for a while to attempt college I said good-bye and he held on and wouldn\u2019t let go. I came back, defeated. We saw each other again and smiled with mouths that had forgotten how.I wonder if he got so mad at me for going to Washington because he had overheard what was going to happen next.While I was sitting in a humid room and watching as people stared at me and explained that the world would be better for everyone if we inconvenient autistics just didn\u2019t exist, plans were being made to put Kimba away. While I was getting job offers for my distilled fury and ability to wax eloquent about how my life sucks, it was being decided that the considerable, unbelievable, overwhelming progress Kimba has made in every respect over the last three years isn\u2019t good enough. While I was staring in disbelief as Geraldine Dawson pontificated about the suffering of \u201cautism families\u201d, people were sitting at tables, sipping stale coffees, and deciding that, since Kimba hasn\u2019t recovered quickly enough from his trauma, he needs to be institutionalized.It was announced today, and finances should be finalized by next week. On Wednesday, June 22nd, Kimba will complete the seventh grade at the middle school. He will eat an end-of-the-year cupcake that we will make, as he will not be invited to participate with his general-ed class. We will carefully gather up the last of his projects and load them into the same battered backpack he\u2019s had for three years, a backpack that will be thrown away with his projects that night because he won\u2019t need it\u2014any of it\u2014any more. We will pack up his device, the notes we\u2019ll have scribbled to his new staff saying he can read very well, actually, and here is a Kimba-to-English dictionary, you\u2019ll need it if he ever decides to talk to you and the notes we\u2019ll have labored over for him: love you, miss you, you\u2019ve grown up so much, it\u2019s going to be okay. We\u2019ll smile, we\u2019ll lie, we\u2019ll tell him that he will love his new school and that we\u2019ll be allowed to visit.On Wednesday, June 22nd, we\u2019ll say good-bye and try to memorize what his smile looked like. On Thursday, June 23rd, he\u2019ll disappear into a residential program.They said they know he loves animals. He can work on their farm.I now count three kids I know and have worked with who, since December, have been institutionalized. This is three out of ten. Five out of fifteen, if I push the timeline back a year. We incarcerate people because they kill other people, because they rape or because they steal or because they make our world unsafe\u2014and now, apparently, because they are just a little too inconvenient. Funny. You don\u2019t even get a trial when your crime is drooling or not talking, when your sin is PTSD or autism, when the thing you did wrong was being born and then not quite meeting expectations.You just get put away.I wanted to tell you about Kimba. I wanted to ask you what I am supposed to do tomorrow morning. I wanted to say that it doesn\u2019t matter that things this wrong aren\u2019t ever supposed to actually happen; they do anyways. I wanted to see if maybe, now, you understood\u2014I don\u2019t write to touch, to inspire, to move people, I write because this happens every day, I write because how are we supposed to keep on, I write because a thirteen year old boy is being taken away.I wanted to tell you about Kimba, because you have to understand that he underlines everything I say and write. I wanted you to meet him before he\u2019s thrown away like human garbage. I wanted someone to give a damn. I wanted to tell you about Kimba because, because, because\u2026\u2026.because I can\u2019t save this one, because I can\u2019t save him, because we have sixty-two days, because oh god, oh god, I can\u2019t save this one, because I forgot that even this tiny little somewhere-only-we-know only exists because nowhere is safe and nothing is allowed us, because oh, oh, oh. Because they are taking Kimba away.Because thirteen is too young to die.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/this-is-why/", "title": "This Is Why"},

Add your own kind words, experiences, and links to or quotes from disability pride resources.

You don\u2019t know me, and I don\u2019t know your name. I read an article about an assault you endured at your school though, and I want you to know that you are not alone.\nI\u2019m Autistic too. There are millions of us just like you who have been bullied and abused too. It\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s horrible, it\u2019s unfair and unacceptable and none of us, especially you, deserved it. And you are not alone.\nI was sexually abused by my classmates every day in Earth Science in ninth grade while my teacher stood two feet away. No one believed me. No one stopped it. Everyone laughed. But here\u2019s what some very wise people said to me, later: just because no one believes you doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen. Just because they laughed doesn\u2019t mean it was funny. Just because they said you deserved it doesn\u2019t mean you did.\nPlease, please believe me.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been told it wasn\u2019t a big deal. It was. It\u2019s a huge deal. Don\u2019t doubt that for a second. It was wrong. They are in the wrong. None of this, absolutely none of this, is your fault. They are the ones who need to work on their social skills. They are the ones who lack some basic empathy.\nI can\u2019t fix what happened to you, or to me, or to any of the people I know. It\u2019s painful and humiliating and makes a person feel wrong and bad and powerless. Please trust me when I say that you are none of those things. You are not bad or broken. You are autistic, and you are also fine.\nYou deserve to be treated like a human being. You deserve kindness and respect and dignity. Someday, you will have those things.\nI am fighting for that. My friends at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/) are fighting for that.

{"date": "July 14, 2011", "body": "As Kimba starts talking and typing more, and as I start to develop working relationships with other students, a lot of my assignments in lifeskills have become centered around writing. Writing, being a writer (and versus being a speaker), and teaching (is this possible?) writing have thus featured heavily in my thoughts lately.Most of my concern lies with regard to voice.I am a writing snob: not because I am the most eloquent, grammatically-adept, perfectly spelled starving artist to ever grace the world with her words (ask me about my journeys with commas sometime, or my passionate love affair with fragments and run-ons), but because I am a writer. I am not someone who writes; I am someone for whom there is no other option. This is the difference between \u201cI am someone who (hatefully, regretfully, anxiously) talks\u201d and \u201cI am a writer.\u201d My writing, a complete opposite to my speaking, is joy and confession and a need for both of these things, and I hope this is transparent.I have talents that I\u2019m not supposed to have: I can tell who crushes on who by how they stand, I can read strides, I can hear the tonal differences between an alto and a soprano singing the same line so clearly that to me they sing entirely different notes, and I can read through the lines and tell when a person doesn\u2019t need to be writing at all. That, that is what makes me a snob, because I cannot abide a person putting pen to paper or fingers on keys when they don\u2019t need to, when word choice is not as relevant and demanding and essential to them as breathing and syntax is about being correct and not about being evocative.I am a writing snob, and some of the kids in lifeskills are my very favorite writers.I could write pages of context about the impact of Kimba\u2019s sparse, elegant, punch-to-the-gut syntax when he told me about being made to eat out of the trash, about spaghetti\u2026no. Cheeseburger\u2026no. Dogfood yes. Bad boy. Go outside. Stay in the yard.(Because bad boys don\u2019t get to eat food, but they do get to eat garbage, or wood covered in old lead paint, and they get put and kept outside, and this was the first time he ever sat me down and tried to tell me something, and he can use much more verbose syntactic structures but he was more concerned with making damn sure I understood exactly what had been done to him.)I want Tanya to make a book from the story of her life she carefully encoded in her response to a picture I showed her of a balloon alone in the sky:The boy bought a balloon, and it was red. He was walking and holding his balloon, and then he let go because he was stretching up to the sky, and the balloon flew away. And he wanted that balloon, but it flew away and it stayed in the sky for a month and then it got struck by lightening and exploded. Kapow! Pieces of it everywhere. The boy bought another balloon, and he lost that one, too.(And the most important part of the story, she said, is that it is funny. It makes people laugh (because he loses one balloon, and then another). Not the boy though.What about the balloons? I asked.Probably not the balloons either, she confided.)I imagine handing these manuscripts off to a crotchety old Honors English teacher I had, who writes a biweekly column in our local paper that makes me want to throw rotten eggs because he doesn\u2019t need or even really want to write, it drips through his every sentence, he just wants to stand on a box and pontificate and evaluate, though never himself. I imagine handing him these snapshots of my students\u2019 souls and watching his red pens slash through them. The honesty, the effect, the things they say outright as well as in silence (he had what he wanted, it disappeared, he got a replacement, that disappeared too, it\u2019s a funny story except for how it\u2019s not at all), the things these intellectually disabled children can do without even trying that he simply cannot\u2026they wouldn\u2019t matter at all.He would be threatened by their voice.These students have voice. Interestingly, one is a selective mute and another rarely speaks above a whisper, but when they have a story, when they need to make you understand, they have more of a voice than almost any other writer I\u2019ve read. I\u2019ll take Tanya\u2019s understated she taught me how to play UNO as a reason for letting her bully pretend to be her friend over the cheerful notices the teachers and secretaries send out about field-trips and costume fees or the \u201cRural New Hampshire And The Single Girl\u201d column in the paper. Tanya is honest. Tanya isn\u2019t afraid to mean it.A voice is something honest, a certain unique blend of said-and-unsaid, a particular flavor of syntax and vocabulary and control that stays with you long after you\u2019ve put down the book and think you\u2019ve understood everything you just read. It\u2019s arresting and affecting, and my students have it in spades. I would submit that they\u2019re really never had a choice in the matter and, given that few of them have had any practice in writing before this past month, they haven\u2019t yet had a chance for it to be beaten out of them.(There is one student. Her mother refuses to believe she is intellectually disabled, or treat her medical problems, and insists that she must do the physically impossible and pass as normal. She is allowed to attend Special Olympics events, which her mother coaches for, as an assistant\u2014she signs the other kids in and out and keeps track of scores, but she isn\u2019t allowed to compete, or smile. She writes like a caricature, like a frightened and desperate mimicry of what she is told she\u2019s supposed to sound like. She\u2019s not allowed a voice. She can\u2019t mean anything, and behind every sentence is a nervous laugh or a hiccuped sob.)These students aren\u2019t writing novels, and they don\u2019t let their voices out outside of specific circumstances: quiet, time with their thoughts, accessible method of expression, a clear question, and so on\u2014the sort of things every writer needs. But because they are intellectually and/or developmentally disabled, because they need help spelling or scrawling, because their syntax is alternately sparse and cluttered, because they aren\u2019t even really supposed to have thoughts let alone voice, because different means harder means defective means not worth it\u2026because of all of that, it doesn\u2019t matter what they write or how well they write it.(I find most publications too poorly written to bother with. I have a nightly debate concerning whether or not I should just erase everything I\u2019ve written ever because it is so shitty. I want to emphasize, again, just how elitist I am about writing, how much of a snob I am, how low my expectations were when I sat down to write with them, and how much crow I\u2019ve eaten this month.)These kids are writers, and it doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s not allowed, because their writing samples will be collected and graded and judged more harshly, against higher standards, than any of my essays in AP English ever were (go ahead, read the NH Alt. Assessment Standards and see for yourself. Come into our room and watch how these kids have to prove that they\u2019re sentient on an hourly basis, and then please tell me why I still feel surprised when I see their essays thrown in the trash). People with no voice of their own and no belief that a lifeskills kid could ever have anything to say are the gatekeepers of who gets listened to, who gets read, and they superimpose zombie faces and stutters over Tanya\u2019s stories and say we really need to focus on her handwriting.So you see, I\u2019m supposed to teach writing, which is less a matter of direct instruction about commas and more a matter of facilitating practice in having a voice. Drawing is just looking, and singing is just hearing, and writing is just listening to your own voice. These kids need to be told, explicitly, repeatedly, by at least one fucking person, that they have voices, and they are valuable voices, and they deserve to be heard, and the first person they should want to listen to them is themselves.It takes practice.What I want to know is: how am I supposed to do this, and how can I justify doing this at all, when, as Kimba will be only too happy to remind you, the ones with voices just get their tongues cut out?", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/metaphors-are-important-14/", "title": "Metaphors Are Important:\u00a01/4"},

You, you with the prettiest eyelashes in the world and bright liquid eyes that made me forget to breath when I forced a glimpse at your profile for politeness\u2019s sake\u2014you have done nothing wrong. Your only crime was being assigned a girl with an inexplicably broken computer who could break you simply by averting her gaze.I know I hurt you without even meaning to because you are kind and beautiful with a smile in your voice and you kept trying to catch my eye and coax a connection out. You never grabbed my face, you never ordered me to look at you, you never forced me to drown in your eyes, you just kept smiling and coaxing and worrying until you were a confused an rejected puppy. You never made that my fault, either: you wracked and searched yourself for what you were doing wrong, for how you were hurting me.I wanted to come back to the Apple Store afterwards, clutching the warm cookies I had purchased myself as part of the intricate bargain I\u2019d worked out to permit myself to brave the mall alone. I wanted to come back, and smuggle you a cookie, careful of crumbs and keyboards, and explain.Beautiful boy, 12 people pressed into a 12\u2019 x 12\u2019 space hurts me. The lights and movement in the mall hurt me, the perfume and music pouring from Hollister hurt me, the building renovations and constantly shifting stores hurt me. I came to you reeling and battered and you, kind, beautiful boy, had me leaving the store with poetry in my head.(I wondered, kind and calm and perfect boy, if maybe you have an autistic sister or girlfriend like me, because I\u2019ve never had such perfect, easy, accessible service.)You seem like the sort of boy who might understand, in your fingertips and the neglected spaces behind your ears, what I mean when I whisper about disability as violence. You might understand embodying a brain and a way of speaking and moving and an existence of violence and victimization and forced memory and reminding others. You might understand shattering between bones of steal and searching for glue. You might understand as being seen as fundamentally violent yourself.You might understand this, I think, because the compulsion to break and undo and ruin exquisite things runs as deeps in humans as our need to protect and hoard them, and I suspect the second leads to the first. This is cruelly and hideously unfair to everyone, but I suspect it is worst for the beautiful, breakable boys like you.I wish you well. I write to you because I can hardly write this to Kody or the others, and of course I\u2019ll never send this to you. I guard my own violent and violated beauty too closely.I think my computer might behave now. Thank you. When I left I almost reached out and touched your arm. I almost tangled our scraped nerves together. I almost said \u201cyou have beautiful, beautiful eyes, and I do too, look.\u201d I swallowed it down with a dozen quiet, desperate disclosures of I\u2019m autistic instead and promised myself I\u2019d write.The new OS installed beautifully.Thank you.~Julia", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/to-the-beautiful-boy-working-the-genius-bar-at-the-apple-store/", "title": "To The Beautiful Boy Working The Genius Bar At The Apple\u00a0Store-"},
{"date": "August 23, 2011", "body": "I want to clear a couple of things up.1.I don\u2019t have autism. I am autistic. This is important to me. It also doesn\u2019t mean that I \u201csee myself as a disability first and a person second,\u201d whatever that is supposed to mean. In my eyes, I\u2019m Julia. Just Julia. I cannot separate out which parts of me brain are wired because baby I was born this way and which parts of my brain should be marked off as AUTISM. Nor do I particularly care, to be honest. I am Julia, and a significant fraction of Julia is autism (and thus, via the transitive property, I am autism but that\u2019s not the point). Am I a writer because I\u2019m Julia, or because I\u2019m autistic? My writing is good in its own right, I am told, and it\u2019s also fundamentally shaped by my neurology\u2013just like yours. I like Glee and Phineas and Ferb and also Sudoku. Am I allowed to have a personality and preferences, or just perseverations? Is my deeply and inconveniently round-about, pedantic, literal, and analytic way of thinking and using language a sign of a what a profoundly gifted child you were, Julia (and you know, no one ever tells the kids in the gifted programs that they see themselves as gifted first and human second, or that they should call themselves \u201cpersons who experience a label of giftedness\u201d) or is it a symptom of some monster hiding in my neurons?I would argue that it\u2019s both, and that it doesn\u2019t matter. Being autistic fundamentally shapes how I perceive and interact with the world, with a million cascading and subtle consequences. I would not be the same Julia I am now without whatever parts of my brain can be marked as AUTISTIC (and that\u2019s bad science in the first place, the brain is a whole lot more complicated and subtle than that, we know that there isn\u2019t one gene or one wiring variation that leads to autism). I also wouldn\u2019t be the same Julia I am now if I hadn\u2019t skipped eighth grade, or hadn\u2019t spent a summer at Stanford, or hadn\u2019t been in choir ororor\u2026I\u2019m Julia, and I\u2019m autistic, and I will apologize for, justify, qualify, neither.2.The dichotomy between being a person and having a disability is a false, and useless, one. It\u2019s based in the notion that people with disabilities they can\u2019t hide or that we can\u2019t pretend to ignore aren\u2019t people. In a certain, socio-linguistic, sense, that\u2019s true. Disability is used to mean something inherently bad and wrong and scary and consuming and destructive and sick, and why would you ever want to include that in any way in your identity or personhood? I myself have said that in a perfect world, there would be no such thing as disability. But please, pay attention: it\u2019s very, very important to look at how the same word can be used a few different ways here. In the above scenarios, where disability means bad, I\u2019m quite literally talking about what disability means, what the word is used to signify, what attributes are assigned it, how our current modern Western society places it in context and value. But that\u2019s not what disability inherently, objectively, physically and literally is. When a car is disabled, it doesn\u2019t work the way it was designed to work anymore. Human beings, though not designed and constructed in factories like cars, are similar. There is a certain range of activities and capabilities to which most of us are accustomed. When someone isn\u2019t able to match up, they too become disabled. Difficulty walking, talking, hearing, seeing, eating? Disability. This is what disability is.Notice, though, that when a car stops being drivable it doesn\u2019t also stop being a car. Similarly, a human who can\u2019t do some expected human things doesn\u2019t stop being a human. In some contexts, a car that can\u2019t drive is a bad car, worthless, lesser, low- or non-functioning. In others, though\u2013art, architecture, scrap metal (remember, humans aren\u2019t cars and these examples don\u2019t have direct equivalents for us, please don\u2019t try and find the scrap-metal humans), a car with an exploded wheel is valued positively. Similarly, in a world without stairs, using a wheelchair can be an advantage. In a world where everyone uses sign language, only speaking with your mouth is a disadvantage. Meaning and value and worth get assigned to people based on how useful their range of capabilities and potentials are for various activities. A person who can\u2019t participate in the activity they are expected to is disabled. This is what disability means.A disability is a stigmatized difference, one we haven\u2019t found a slot for yet. I would love for that stigma, that disabling context, to go away. The raw physical difference itself though? It\u2019s a part of me, and I\u2019m not going to hide it, ignore it, or lie about it.3.Quite frankly, it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not I see myself \u201cas a person first, and a disability second.\u201d It\u2019s not going to keep me safe. I know exactly what the other people in the store think when they see me rock, flap, cover my ears. On the internet, maybe, I have the luxury of expounding on the finer points of person-first versus identity-first language. In real life, in a world where our parents kill us, our classmates abuse us, and our employers are virtually non-existent? I really don\u2019t have that luxury.4.As long as there are people demanding that I call myself a person with autism, as though I am just cohabiting with two different brains, one of which I should really want to discard at the soonest possible opportunity, I will call myself autistic out of sheer defiance. The autistic parts of myself are always what are going to be punished and cut away at, they are what are going to get me hurt and killed, and I will put them in the front where everyone else already sees them and fly them as a goddamn flag.5. I am not flattered when you say that I don\u2019t really see you as autistic or it\u2019s just a label. Because what you mean is that \u201cI don\u2019t really see you as Bad right now,\u201d and while I am incredibly grateful for that safety, I am also furious that autistic means Bad at all in the first place and that I feel I have anything to be grateful for in that entire situation.It is, indeed, just a label. One without nearly the neutrality of, say, Campbell\u2019s Chicken Soup. All your wishing in the world won\u2019t change that, and taking away the words I have for my experience just hurts me so you can feel a little more enlightened.For the record, I don\u2019t really see you as much of an asshole, usually.6.\u201cBut my child!\u201d you say. \u201cMy child can\u2019t feed themselves! My child needs diapers! My child cannot be left unsupervised! My child is medically affected!\u201dWell, yes. Your child is disabled. So am I. I thought we were past that?(Is Stephen Hawking low-functioning?My child is no Stephen Hawking. Indeed. Neither am I. No offense, but neither are you.)So often the dividing line between really disabled (my child) and high-functioningaka not really disabled(you, a self-advocate disagreeing with me) is writing a blog post or making change for a purchase or reading. I remember being told that if someone can add and read, they can live independently. Well I hate to break it to you, but I am very good at both of those things and I can\u2019t live independently, not even close. I just don\u2019t think that this inability makes me worth less or nothing.I\u2019m not disparaging the reality of complex developmental and physical disabilities. My own world must function in a parallel and yet fundamentally different and separate realm from even that of my typically developing sister. I have enough imagination, enough personal experience with my own disability, enough time spent living and working with other disabled people, and enough of an ability to hear what people who live with complex developmental and physical disabilities have to say, to know that in some sense it\u2019s a question of scale and that the experience can be dehumanizing for everyone involved. I\u2019ll spare you the gory details of my life, in part because they are private and in part because I refuse to be a self-narrating zoo exhibit. Been there, done that, Temple Grandin and Donna Williams are better at it. I\u2019ll just say this: it never ceases to amaze me how an entry posted every two or three weeks in the ether about deserving human rights somehow reveals\u2013or, rather, erases\u2013the every intricacy and ramification of a person\u2019s disability in their life. 7.If my child could write a blog post like this, I would consider him cured. Fascinating. Have you taught him how? Have you given him the time, tools, technology, and accommodations he would need to do so? Have you exposed him to the ideas this blog post runs on, or has he been sheltered and infantilized? Has he been given an accessible, for him as well as his audience, means of communication? Remember, behavior is communication, that\u2019s Best Practice. Have multiple literacies been facilitated? Remember, everyone reads, everyone writes, everyone has something to say is the current forward-thinking in special education, especially for children with complex access needs. But you\u2019re an advocate for your child, of course you must know that. Silly me, I apologize.Have his attempts at self-determination and self-advocacy be respected and responded to, regardless of form, or has he been taught that passivity is better?If he were to want to blog about his favorite cartoon, would that be okay? Or does it need to be serious, age-appropriate, legitimate-in-your-eyes business, every time, all the time\u2013because there are no frivolous blogs anywhere on the internet, are there.If he were to want to document and share his thoughts via, say, music or a painting or an arrangement of objects, would that be okay? Or must it be words?Are there limits on chances for this? Is any human being ever stagnant?Oh, and by the way, your child is still a child, right? How many children blog, do you know?Sorry, I thought this was worth taking seriously.8.I am not going to make nice. It\u2019s a common directive. We all want the same things. How can we ever expect anyone to listen to us when we can\u2019t disagree respectfully amongst ourselves?I am not going to pretend that a power imbalance doesn\u2019t exist. I am not going to pretend that when non-disabled people attempt to end a discussion with self-advocates they did not enjoy, it is with chastisements and pleas to just get along which hit about a million times harder when aimed at someone who\u2019s been taught to have quiet hands and who\u2019s first sentence was Iwantball PLEASE and who, when they were bullied, was sent to social skills training while their abusers were left roaming in powerful packs of friends.(In no other minority community is this level of power-play tolerated. You are not our voices, we are not the same, we do not want the same things, and if you aren\u2019t disabled? Then by definition you are not a member of the disability community.)You have the power. If you do indeed, as you claim, want to be allies, then I suggest you start acting like it.(And, because I must be nice and patient and helpful and I must educate the people telling me to shut up: for god\u2019s sake, if being an ally, let alone a super-special parent ally, is so very hard, check out PFLAG.)9.This is not a \u201cdisagreement.\u201d You know what people disagree about? Pizza toppings, ice cream flavors, what Shakespeare meant in the third stanza. Things with small consequences.You know what happens when we \u201cdisagree\u201d about disability?People die. People get aborted, people get institutionalized, people get sterilized, drugged, and neglected, people go without necessary support and services, people are dehumanized, people are abused, people are silenced, ignored, and erased, people suffer emotional and mental trauma and distress with life-long consequences.Just as \u201cdisability\u201d has become an ugly word for a physical fact, so \u201cdisagreement\u201d is being used, here, as a polite word for an ugly thing.I call bullshit.10.I started blogging, years ago, as a therapy tool, as a way to modify journalling so it would be accessible to me. It turned, slowly, oddly, and very autistically, into a method of communication. Now it\u2019s one of the ways I advocate for myself and my people. Mostly I think of it as a survival strategy.On days like today?It\u2019s just a lifeline.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/08/23/dear-autism-parents/", "title": "Dear \u201cAutism Parents\u201d,"},
{"date": "July 7, 2011", "body": "Sometimes I think the greatest crime in television is caring.Giving a damn is already practically illegal anyways, so it makes sense. A lot of the time, in fact, giving a damn is actually more of a punishable offense than anything actually offensive. I get yelled at for organizing books too efficiently, for Chrissakes. It doesn\u2019t even stand imagining, what happens when we say stop it, don\u2019t call them that, you\u2019re talking about another person, do you mean to, do you understand, you can\u2019t do that. When I ask someone to please don\u2019t say \u201cretarded,\u201d it hits me, you\u2019re working in a fucking special ed classroom for crying out loud, your student is three feet away, what are you thinking, it is agreed that the problem is that I can\u2019t take a joke.I cried for ten minutes when they said \u201cthe ayes have it\u201d last night and New York got marriage equality, and Dad told me to quiet down, he was trying to sleep. I didn\u2019t know what was worse\u2014not being able to tell anyone about the results, not being able to tell anyone about the newest cut that barely even stings anymore, or being so fucking grateful that at least I wasn\u2019t called dyke, because we know how that one goes.(My brother gave me a sarcastic thumbs-up, and my sister told me that she\u2019d known it would pass, and she\u2019d give the rest of the country ten years. I wanted to congratulate her on being so blithe, I wanted to ask if she knows how long a wait ten years is, I wanted to remind her that at least mom would go to her wedding, I wanted to ask her if she\u2019s ever watched people vote on her right to make a family and if she\u2019s ever seen them vote it down. But that\u2019s not funny or neat or easy and thus allowed, that\u2019s messy and hurt and I would mean it, and so I kept quiet.)I was at the White House conference on bullying in March, which framed violence, in all forms\u2014physical, sexual, emotional, verbal\u2014against students as a civil rights issue. In a group discussion, some immigrant students from the Chicago public school system told us, in excruciating detail, about the physical, racially-based violence they experienced every day. They said that, whenever they tried to report this violence to a teacher or administrator, the same response would come back:\u201cWhy are you telling me this? You\u2019re making me upset. You\u2019re hurting my feelings.\u201d(The students are being beaten, are failing classes because of chanted racial slurs whenever they sit down, are afraid to come to school. The teachers feel bad because the students are implying that perhaps, if they are not safe at school, the teachers are not doing their jobs properly. The teachers\u2019 feelings are hurt. So the students, the victims, get punished again.)It\u2019s not a racial thing. It\u2019s not an issue of Teh Gay, or of cripples and madmen and fools. Strip away the aesthetic revulsion, the fear and the ignorance, the complicated socio-economic histories and the familial scars, and people still like to treat other as disposable objects, good for entertainment and not much else. We\u2019re each other\u2019s toys, and if we don\u2019t amuse sufficiently then we probably need to be whacked a few times, the way you hit a CD-player when it skips. Maybe we need new batteries. Probably it\u2019s easier to just throw us away.(Some people say we evolved the way we did because we\u2019re so good at killing, and we certainly killed off our preceding species quickly enough. It\u2019s a quick hop-skip-jump from amusement to mascot to mystery to menace, and broken human playthings seem to implicitly threaten that we\u2019ll steal, or at least break, all the other toys too. Loss and sacrifice and discomfort and fear we might be next can all trigger our kill-switches, apparently.)Perhaps I\u2019ve lived an exceptionally awful life, but I find that hard to believe when I watch flocks of smiling, popular people being silently unhappy together. There are reasons people lie about and keep secret how they feel and what they think, and I\u2019ve seen one too many terrified college girls fighting and drinking and cutting all their hair off and then going to class the next morning with bright, store-bought smiles to believe that it\u2019s just me.True, I get furious, sometimes, when I tell someone about being mistreated because of my autism and they respond with a tale of their own frustration at the hands of some cruel peer or unnecessarily draconian teacher or boss. One of these things is not like the other, and the whole thing never reads as anything other than the familiar \u201cthat never happened, that story isn\u2019s allowed, let me show you the script, let me show you the acceptable ways to be and get hurt, too bad they\u2019ll never apply to you.\u201dSometimes, though, these things are almost exactly the same in all the ways that viscerally matter. I\u2019m abused because I\u2019m a not-person. To hurt someone without using your fists you just make them feel like a not-person, or, at the very least, a not-okay-person, and you can do that to anyone. Everyone suffers because, as humans, we\u2019re just naturally very good at hurting each other.Which is not to say that we aren\u2019t also very good at making each other feel incredible, or at least happy, or even just warm and safe for an hour, and that can be enough. We have families and stories, and these are not only terrifying weapons, but also powerful things that can create a lot of good\u2014and when they don\u2019t, we can make new ones. There\u2019s joy and beauty in the world, and sometimes another human seems to hold it all in the spaces between their joints.Maybe that\u2019s why we hurt each other so very well.It\u2019s all very stark and dramatic, and that\u2019s a useful way to make a point, but life doesn\u2019t come with points. Life comes kind of blurry and murky and bled-together and wonderful, and maybe looking back you can scoop some of it into a coherent narrative, but the words are never quite sufficient. After all, they said I could get married means something bright and happy, but there\u2019s also something angry and resentful and undefined, because they never asked if their marriage offended me. And then we have to think about all the things marriage means and represents, and what it means for the couples who, watching the votes be counted, whisper that they\u2019ll still love each other just as much if it doesn\u2019t pass. Life is just too big for the words we have and the stories we learn, except for when it\u2019s the other way around.Most of us don\u2019t go around slaying dragons and going on quests of many miles. Happily-ever-afters are unsettlingly complicated, and the problem with slaying one Evil Overlord is that another always pops up. Curiously, Evil Overlords like to disguise themselves as people we rely on and must be polite to, and quests of many miles tend to consist of driving oblivious children to and from soccer practice, piano lessons, and gymnastics every day for ten years and never driving over and off the bridge.The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation is a truism, but no one ever asks why, and if maybe it\u2019s because we think we missed the train to something spectacular years ago and there\u2019s no honor in what we have left, and so we don\u2019t claim the words and stories we were taught to dream as our own. We grow up, and we stop reading children\u2019s literature and picture books, and we\u2019re told that archetypes and mythos are something besides history and biography, and we lose our sense of importance and solidity and any sense of ownership of our own story or right to any words which might mean anything.Stealing a person\u2019s words, their ability to look clearly at something and see it and know that they do, is the smallest and easiest way to kill someone.What I mean is, I say child abuse, and people think of my student, caged and beaten and raped and made to eat out of the garbage for nine years. Well, yes and no\u2014yes, because if anyone deserves those words, it\u2019s him, and no, because things are rarely so harsh and vivid and obvious. There\u2019s a reason children like him are so rare and his situation comes up in textbooks as a Worse Case Scenario, one of the Worst in the History Of Our State. Life is a game of ripples and things adding up and subtle variations.My student will never be the same because he never got to be not-afraid for his first nine years, until eventually he just couldn\u2019t feel fear anymore. I will never be the same because they made me take my clothes off in the car once because I\u2019d drooled all over them, and because I only had to be hit a couple of times before a raised voice was enough to have me looping those experiences and hitting my self, all on my own. His father hit him in places no one could see. I wished someone would just hit me one more time, now that I knew what I could do, so someone might believe me and maybe it would stop. One of those experiences is stark and dramatic and mercifully rare; one is quiet and common and so easy to justify, overlook, pass over. People see my student\u2019s misshapen collarbones and fall silent in horror; no one notices that after a lifetime of being slapped and grabbed for flapping I can\u2019t raise my arms from my side, because the whole point was to make me unnoticeable.Our situations are different, and so it gets decided that one of them doesn\u2019t count. Similarly, people who have never had the horror of growing up in a community where you get taken away if you\u2019re not good enough declare that since my student\u2019s institutionalization was stopped at the eleventh hour, it doesn\u2019t count. (Just like, if you run away fast enough from the homophobes on the street corner, somehow magically nothing could have happened. Just like if you never say no, you must mean yes. Just like, if they don\u2019t put a gag in your mouth or knock you out, you should be able to fight them off.) I\u2019m glad the world is so very tidy and convenient and adjustable that knowing you were supposed to spend the rest of your life somewhere unspeakably horrible because you just aren\u2019t good enough has no effect on a thirteen-year-old boy. I mean, clearly someone needs to tell him this, as he for some reason feels otherwise. Someone should also probably tell his classmates, who now know\u2014and who always knew, but now it\u2019s reconfirmed and a little more fresh in their minds\u2014exactly how unsafe they are.It doesn\u2019t count because he doesn\u2019t (we, they, you, don\u2019t) count.There aren\u2019t any stories about that.I have this niggling suspicion, though, that there are an awful lot of people in the world who have been told that they don\u2019t count, don\u2019t get to be in the stories, things were never quite bad enough, or maybe they were too bad to be real. I have this feeling that there are an awful lot of us, and that if we just stopped keeping ourselves a secret, we might blow that lie out of the water.This is where Glee comes in.Glee tells you, right in the pilot episode, that it\u2019s about not-people discovering that they\u2019re people. Oh sure, there are layers and complications and distractions and other features and a million different ways to say the same thing, but it really does come down to that. It always surprises me, because since when is that a story I see on my TV?We consume media in a context of constant, casual violence against some and dismissal of everyone else. We expect to be entertained in the middle of an environment in which no one, no matter how skinny or blonde or popular or perfect, can expect to be safe and happy for long. If our television program is going to do anything besides lie to us about following our hearts and happy endings, we\u2019d rather it at least didn\u2019t mean it.So Glee gets sneaky about it. They give us Bryan Ryan, a Special Guest Character who gets an entire episode devoted to what it is to be a closeted gay American without every actually showing any icky attraction to men. They delve down into layers of nuance and complicated human relationships and the terrible compromises we make and they talk outright about being closeted and cutting yourself off without ever pulling a visceral homophobic reaction from the audience because Neil Patrick Harris (and can we talk about that casting choice?) kissed a guy.That same episode we have Artie, our wheelchair-using character, learning how to tell people that he doesn\u2019t care about his legs, he doesn\u2019t need to be fixed, he\u2019s got other things he\u2019s worried about. Difference is, he\u2019s not some sort of coded metaphor. You see his chair before you see him. And so all the other characters (and the audience) see is a poor, suffering boy (in a wheelchair, just a cripple bound to his chair) miserable because he can never achieve his dream of being a dancer. Artie spends the entire episode negotiating what all of that means, and how to make himself heard and believed through all the other noise, while, yes, getting a little sad that he can\u2019t just get out of chair and make the entire problem go away. But the episode is called Dream On, and being able to walk doesn\u2019t change the people around you.The point these two intertwined storylines make is that it doesn\u2019t matter how badly you want people to hear your own voice, they much prefer the dream they have of you in their heads. It\u2019s an entire episode, on the heels (and a continuation) of the similarly-themed Laryngitis, devoted to showcasing that on every level, from casting to costumes to musical numbers to the actual lines delivered, Glee plays around with metaphors and story-telling and scale and variations on an idea and performance versus experience to look at how humans negotiate the space around each other.(There\u2019s very little joy in the Glee Club, sometimes, if that gives you an idea of what they mean.)We start out with the writers taking a complicated, unjust experience, stripping away the salient, fundamentally other part of it, and delving waaaaay down into it and all its complexity and nuance. It becomes a story about the fucked-up ways people treat each other, and the fucked-up consequences that has. The audience, to some degree, gets it, and likes it, because it\u2019s not ANGRY, it\u2019s not about TEH GAY, it\u2019s not scary and divisive and other. We don\u2019t have to change the way we treat whole classes of people because of this now, do we?(I think the point being made is that yes, we do, but it\u2019s entertainment so if you don\u2019t want to hear that, you won\u2019t.)Probably the most frustrating part of Glee is that the show focuses on universal problems of human relation, but it\u2019s aired in a world where only a few characters out of the oversized cast are universally regarded as human. The only two characters played and seen straight-away as human, right from the start, are Finn and Will. Besides being straight white middle class males, they have two other very important, tightly-linked things in common:\nThey\u2019re allowed to rage.\nThey don\u2019t hurt people on purpose.\nKurt (gay) snarls in his songs, Quinn (teenage pregnancy) yells that she\u2019s furious, Puck (juvenile delinquent and Lima Loser) explodes and punches people and gets sent to juvvie, and those are all Bad Things. Finn kicks over a chair, Will terrifies his wife, and those things are fine. Those things are natural, healthy, human reactions to the (not-) people around them being awful. Kurt and Quinn and Puck learn to be angry quietly, to smile through their teeth, to take names and social security numbers and sometimes just to wait. Finn and Will are allowed to feel, and show, their hurt.Their rage is safe and predictable and about socially sanctioned things and won\u2019t ever shake anything up. Kurt, Quinn, Puck? They might hurt someone\u2019s feelings.They might make someone uncomfortable.They might ask someone to risk something.Kurt and Quinn and Puck can hurt people just by breathing, just by being there, and it will always, always, be deliberate. Finn and Will only ever hurt people by accident, and that\u2019s the catch. Finn and Will are people. Good people. Good people don\u2019t, can\u2019t hurt anyone, and since Will and Finn are Good, and since they didn\u2019t mean it to hurt, didn\u2019t even know it could, it doesn\u2019t.(They\u2019re not like my student\u2019s father, so obviously intent on destroying people, and so their actions have no consequences. They\u2019re good, and if we feel hurt by them, then that\u2019s our fault, and if we argue, then we\u2019re bad, bad people, trying to sully their goodness. That\u2019s just not who they are.)Isn\u2019t that a cool trick?(That is the real reason my phobia of lifting my arms, and my student\u2019s near-institutionalization, and so many other things, Don\u2019t Count\u2014what was done was never meant to hurt, and the people who did it don\u2019t hurt, that\u2019s just not who they are, the whole thing is really just better off forgotten, it doesn\u2019t ever need to feature, it doesn\u2019t (we don\u2019t) count.)But what Glee does such an uncannily good job at showcasing is just how, exactly, anyone can make anyone else Not Count, and what that does to all involved. Simultaneously, it fleshes out people we see first through Will and Finn\u2019s eyes\u2014because we can\u2019t see not-people through their own eyes\u2014and turns them from cheap and easy stereotypes into painfully real, immediate, people. The process is messy and long\u2014two seasons in and it\u2019s still not quite complete\u2014and it\u2019s complicated by the fact that it happens with an audience going through the same process. People laughed at Bryan Ryan\u2019s quips and cried at Artie\u2019s tears and didn\u2019t quite put the pieces together. The cast donned shirts stamped with their shame and sang about baby I was born to survive, and it wasn\u2019t quite obvious enough to change everything.(It\u2019s entertainment, it\u2019s not supposed to mean anything, and it has to be packaged such that people can ignore the real parts if they don\u2019t want to see them. It\u2019s not allowed to count.)But a few of us get our words and our stories back, and if they were any more obvious about it, it wouldn\u2019t work at all.It\u2019s (we\u2019re) all the same, you see.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/the-greatest-crime-in-television/", "title": "The Greatest Crime In\u00a0Television"},
{"date": "April 5, 2011", "body": "This is a story about disability. This is a story about the politics of drool. This is a lot of things, and maybe you should just read it.\u00a01.So I want you to imagine being born a drooler.We\u2019re not talking just the adorable amounts of saliva an infant will naturally produce as their teeth come in. You grow up with that, sure, but then it never goes away. Some quirk of muscular development and oral-motor control leaves you with a constant stain of spittle around your lips and on your chin.You grow up.You have a small toddler friend or two, before anyone knows better. But you grow apart, and then one day in kindergarten you turn away from your playdough to answer someone\u2019s \u201chello\u201d and a string of drool lands on the tabletop.Your cheerful \u201chi\u201d is answered with a laugh, a stare, a jabbing, gesturing finger.You remember your mother, always scraping at your chin with washclothes and whispering implored reminders to \u201cswallow\u201d and keep your mouth shut. You realize that no other kindergartener has sleeve cuffs which are crusty from reaching up to wipe their mouths every five minutes. The florescent lights above burn through your back, your playdough feels gritty in your fingers, and you\u2019re sure that you\u2019re about to melt under the table in a puddle of drool because you legs get this horrible shaking feeling as though they\u2019re made of water. It spreads, and it\u2019s like a wind or a shudder goes through your stomach and leaves your head empty and clear.2.You don\u2019t realize it at the time, but you are one of the lucky ones, in a way. You do learn to go through life with your lips clamped shut around each other. You learn to swallow so that your mouth is always perfectly dry. Your fingers constantly flutter to your chin just to make sure. You spend hours each day just concentrating on the muscles of your jaw and mouth, more intimately acquainted with them than any other part of you. In some ways, you stop being conscious of yourself as anything except a mouth. The rest of your body seems far-away and empty, everything caught up in your war against your own saliva.It doesn\u2019t sound it, but you are so incredibly lucky. If you just fake it well enough people don\u2019t think of you as a drooler, just another distant and distracted and distrustful kid. It will be years before you are first called retard, and for a very, very long time you are sure you can get away with it, be just like everyone else with one tiny little secret.You never go to sleepovers or let yourself fall asleep on the bus, because you can\u2019t control it when you sleep and you know that drooling is just a disgusting crime, grosser than eating your boogers and punishable in all sorts of intricately painful ways. But it really does seem as though, so long as you take some reasonable precautions and devote three seconds out of every minute to monitoring your mouth, you\u2019ll be just fine.And then you\u2019re in middle school and everyone is laughing at some joke and it happens again, in a rare moment of laxness, and then everyone is laughing at you or else pretending not to see\u2014and you never thought that could actually be worse, but it is\u2014and you realize that no, fuck it all, you\u2019re never going to get away with or from this.You don\u2019t want to be a drooler. No one wants to, and no one wants them. If there is one thing every middle schooler needs, it is to be wanted, even as just a friend, by someone. To belong, to fit in, to have a place where you are welcome. Droolers get none of that. But you\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019ll just try harder and take what abuse you get (because you deserve it, you can\u2019t even control your own secretions) and everything is going to be fine.3.But your brain starts to shift a little.You hear your voice on a recording for your answering machine for the first time and you spend the next five minutes wondering who punched you in the stomach. That voice. Is it really yours? It doesn\u2019t sound anything at all like the one you hear in your head, and when you ask your mom mutters something about sound waves and bone conduction but all you can hear is that stupid, round, fishy, wet voice that you\u2019ve apparently been using all your life. You had hoped you were a lot of things, fierce and funny and smart and competent and cool, but that, that is the voice of a drooler. People don\u2019t even need to see your baby pictures, they don\u2019t even need to see you compulsively swallowing to the point that your mom takes you to a doctor and asks about tics, because they can tell the instant you start talking.You start to wonder if this is some great cosmic secret that everyone else got to know before you, and the thought makes you feel lost and sick and pathetic and you just know that you\u2019d better be getting comfortable with that feeling because it\u2019s going to get awfully familiar.And you fight, you feel like a baby kitten but even they have claws so you scratch and fight and do everything you can to keep that feeling of utter uselessness from settling permanently in you. You sign up for all honors classes for next year and you try to dress like the most popular girls and you try out for soccer even though you are the best in the whole school at tripping over your own feet and you are so damn happy when Eric asks you to the eight-grade graduation dance that you let him kiss you afterward even though he tastes like pepperoni and smells like too much cologne.And the kiss is horribly wet and sloppy and you are now known as the worst kisser in your whole year and you just want to die.4.\u00a0High school is unremittingly terrible, even though you aren\u2019t caught drooling once. But you make tiny mistakes in every algebra problem that create bigger mistakes and big, ugly red \u2018F\u2019s even though you are good at math and you love it. But your teachers talk so fast and you can never make rhyme or reason of what they say and so you spend your classes wondering how you can be so smart and yet so dumb and if you ever were smart at all and how are you going to past this test, and when that gets boring you draw passive-aggressive comics about your \u201cfriends\u201d and their stupid boyfriends eating poisoned chocolates and getting stabbed with lightsabers. Everyone else bitches about long hours spent studying and you wonder if you should tell them that you are up until two every night just staring at your textbooks and worksheets and googling frantically and unable to make sense of any of it, somehow managing to string enough figures and terms together to create a passable bullshitting act that keeps you in the honors track with them. But you don\u2019t tell, of course you don\u2019t, because then people would find out and you can\u2019t be found out again, you\u2019re pretty sure they would kick you out of your classes and being able to scam your way into that elite little group of scholars is the only thing that makes you think that maybe you don\u2019t deserve to die.But one ever tries to kiss you again, or even invites you to a single party for four years, and every time you remember this all you can see in a spot of drool swallowing up the latest 68 handed back to you in geometry.It doesn\u2019t make much sense, but you come to see every little imperfection as a crack breaking across the surface of your act, ripping apart your pretensions of normality, of superiority, and it fills you with hate and fear and makes your nose ache with the smell of rubbing alcohol and your palms punch into your thighs until they bruise.It just steadily keeps on mounting up, and every morning you wake up with a sticky chin and damp pillow and it gets harder and harder to climb out of bed. You know you\u2019re failing on every level, but you\u2019re terrified of what will happen if you stop. So you get up, day after day, and emerge every day from high school battered and empty, and that awful feeling of watery legs and a shivering stomach becomes your default setting.You realize that you\u2019ve never really left kindergarten.\u00a05.\u00a0The admissions officer asks you, sounding bored, who you are, what makes you tick. And you just sort of stare blankly back, because you\u2019ve been trying not to think about that since you were five and somehow, explaining that you\u2019ve spent your whole life just pretending, and passing, getting by and trying to blend in and not let anyone see how empty you actually are, just filled with drool\u2026that doesn\u2019t seem like the sort of answer expected.You realize that you can\u2019t answer the question, you don\u2019t know how to even begin to think about the answer, because sometimes you are so focused on swallowing and sealing your lips that you forget the rest of your body and just sort of bounce along the lockers as you navigate from class to class. You want to tell them that your earliest memory is of a washcloth against your face, that your first nickname was \u201cDroolia\u201d, and that this one special ed boy absolutely terrifies you because he has to wear a kerchief around his neck to catch his drool and what if someone connects you two? You want to ask if they\u2019ve ever been sitting in English, doodling in the margins of a vocabulary worksheet, and then suddenly felt like they\u2019ve been running for miles, so out of breath with their heart hammering in their heads, legs watery, shivering and shaking. You want to tell them that your least favorite thing to do ever is to go to the dentist, because your mouth is open and you can\u2019t swallow for half an hour. You want to point out that you never smile for the camera, that you actively run away whenever a camera comes out because the area around your mouth is so slack and rubbery and you just cannot control it.You smile and say something about liking to draw comics and observe people for new material.6.You fall asleep on a pile of your comics at RISD, and when you wake up they are wet and sticky and ruined.They\u2019re due tomorrow. Or today, actually, since it\u2019s three in the morning. You can\u2019t ask for an extension\u2014what are you supposed to say, sorry I never learned to control my saliva, can I have an extra day to redraw them because I drooled all over them?You drop out instead.You drop out of everything.7.\nAnd the boy who pointed at you in kindergarten? Eric, who kissed and told? Your friends, who never bothered to ask why you wouldn\u2019t come over to their sleepovers? Everyone who ever let you know, subtly and quietly, that you were fake and damaged and disgusting, who may have only said that out loud once or even never but who always gave you a million little reminders?The ones who broke you apart because a few of your muscles developed a little more slowly?They are just fine.\u00a0", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/diary-of-a-drooler/", "title": "Diary Of A\u00a0Drooler"},
{"date": "April 5, 2011", "body": "Hi. My name is Julia Bascom and I\u2019ve had it easy.I had it easy. What this means is that in fifth grade I was the smartest kid in the class. I also did a lot of hiding under my desk, and I talked funny and moved stiffly, so the other kids formed a club. It had only one rule, the golden rule: you couldn\u2019t talk to Julia.I changed schools at the end of the year. I kept breathing, but then, I had to: I had it easy.No one beat me up. They didn\u2019t have to\u2014I did a good enough job of that on my own.I have a friend. We\u2019ll call him Martin. Martin is autistic, like I am, although he doesn\u2019t identify that way. In fact, nothing would make him happier than being just like everyone else. See, Martin and I are different. We both know that being different, being autistic, being disabled, is dangerous. We\u2019ve both been bullied. We\u2019ve both had it easy. We\u2019ve both seen what our alternatives are\u2014be just like everyone else, or don\u2019t be anything at all.The difference between Martin and I is that I know without a shadow of a doubt that this is wrong. Martin doesn\u2019t.Martin and I became friends because we were both worried about each other. Martin was worried because apparently no one had ever taught me how to pass for normal. I was worried about Martin and the way he was quietly twisting himself away. I only got more worried when he tried to teach me how to blend in, how to pass, when he yelled at me senior year for looking like that, because don\u2019t you know you\u2019ll get hurt, don\u2019t you know you\u2019ll die, looking like that?I have another friend. We\u2019ll call her Maria. Maria has also had it easy. She\u2019s autistic like me, but she is more visibly disabled than I am. What this means is that when we went to get ice cream two weeks ago no one would sit near us. What this means is that people think that because I help her count out the money to pay for her order I should be ordering for her. What this means is that Maria is not permitted to just neutrally exist in public. Getting ice cream becomes an act of war.I work with middle school students with significant disabilities in a mostly self-contained classroom. Some of them have had it easy\u2014no one will talk to them, the other kids run away when they see us coming, the teachers don\u2019t want them in their classes, but no one gets beat up. Some of them have permanent brain injuries from abuse. Like Charlie. Charlie goes into murderous rages and has almost killed people\u2013he\u2019s the sweetest kid, but someone decided to beat him enough that he doesn\u2019t feel the world is safe for him. He\u2019s right.Kaley hasn\u2019t been to school in two months. The social workers are sent away from the house and the state is content to leave it at that. I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s still alive, and no one seems interested in finding out. Roger, who can\u2019t feel or control his tongue, was kicked out of his foster home and into an institutional placement three days before Christmas because he eats too messily. His ex-foster mother now visits him regularly and expects him to call her \u201cmom\u201d and say that he loves her.She says she loves him too.The hell of it is, the world agrees with her.Here\u2019s the thing about being disabled: it sucks. It\u2019s horrible in a million different ways, and not a single one of those ways is because I can\u2019t do this or because I have this impairment. That would be too easy. Instead, every single reason translates roughly to because people are awful. Sometimes, for a minute, for a day, for a week, I think I can forget that. I delude myself into thinking that the reason I can buy ice cream without five different hostile stares, can be allowed to work in a school, can be invited to the occasional party, is because people really are okay, and not just because I have learned how to fake being normal, being human well enough to avoid some sort of weird ability-based xenophobia.I\u2019m wrong, of course.I just spent seven hours at a conference about bullying. Here\u2019s the genius behind really good, really effective bullying: it turns the victim into their own worst bully. I told you I never got beat up for being autistic. I want you to take a good look at me. See my glasses? Those are because I damaged my eyes banging my head in tenth grade. See the spots on my arms? Those are from where I tried to gouge out my skin all through high school. See the scars on my face? Those are a little more recent\u2014same idea though: self destruct. There are a million more I can\u2019t show you\u2014even the insides of my cheeks are scarred. I can\u2019t tell you how many pairs of sheets I\u2019ve had to throw away because I woke up covered in blood\u2014I\u2019d tried to pick myself apart while I was sleeping.I didn\u2019t do this because I was depressed, or scared, or because I hated myself. I didn\u2019t want to hurt. But I  knew I had to. When I hurt, I was in my place. And smacking my head against a wall for an hour a day was ultimately less painful than trying to convince myself, let alone everyone else, that I was maybe, possibly, worth something just the way I was.The thing about bullies is that, although they never go away\u2014I went to a different school with different kids after fifth grade, but there were always plenty of bullies to keep me remembering\u2014they cannot be with you every second of every hour of every day. They can do hundreds of subtle and nasty things to you, and they will, but eventually they will need to pee or go home or at least sleep. So what they do is program you so that you can continue to bully yourself in their absence. I still hear the chanted retards in my head whenever I play with a strand of beads. I still believe, in my stomach and pulse, the way you know to run from a lion or don\u2019t jump in the campfire, that I shouldn\u2019t be here.I don\u2019t need someone yelling at me to sit down, shut up, stop flapping\u2014I do these things automatically now. No one needs to tell me that I\u2019m worthless\u2014I get that. Message received, message believed, message drilled into my bones. No one has to threaten and force me into some version of myself that is less visibly disabled, less obviously autistic, less real and I guess less threatening\u2014I\u2019ve carved off all those edges of myself into a smooth facsimile of what I need to be.(That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019ve ever \u201chad it easy\u201d. Because I could do that. Because I have, or had, the rare ability to pull myself apart and twist myself into some new shape when ordered. I\u2019m lucky, in other words, that I don\u2019t have any glue holding me together. Lucky to be broken, because then there is nothing left for someone else to break.)What I\u2019ve just described is \u201chaving it easy\u201d, and it\u2019s actually not easy at all. It\u2019s complete and utter psychological and emotional warfare, and there is no winning for us\u2014they, the bullies, set the rules and the terms and they always win. Millions of us live like this every day\u2014we have it easy, we can\u2019t complain, this isn\u2019t something that can be solved with curb cuts or an act of legislation, and so we die the death of a thousand cuts.I told you about Martin, earlier. Martin always beat me on quizzes in class, but there is one thing I know that he doesn\u2019t. I know that this is bullshit.Here\u2019s the secret. There is, in fact, one way to beat the bullies. See, what they want is to work themselves out of a job, to have you doing their dirty work for them. They want you to beat yourself up. So the way you win is by stepping out of the game entirely. The way you win is by knowing, being absolutely and irrevocably and 100% positive, that they are wrong.It\u2019s the tiniest thing.It\u2019s almost impossibly hard. How do you discover the world\u2019s best-kept secret: that despite what you\u2019ve been hearing since you were two and your parents started dragging you to doctor after doctor and the other kids stopped playing with you that you are actually perfectly fine, just fine?When you are disabled, you are sick in every sense of the word. Disgusting, scary, dangerous, broken, wrong. Lesser. I knew this, had it memorized and lived my life accordingly. But one day I met someone else who was sick. \u201cYou\u2019re sick!\u201d I protested when they insisted on acting like a human being.\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d they agreed. \u201cSo are you.\u201dAnd then one morning I woke up. I was still sick. And I was also fine.I was fine.There is no equivalent to a GSA for disabled kids. We have to pass it on like a secret. You\u2019re okay. We\u2019re okay. Everyone else is wrong. We have a right to be here too. We\u2019re not just sick. We\u2019re not in doctors\u2019 offices all the time. We\u2019re okay. We need that support, need some sort of physical community. Passing it on like a rumor isn\u2019t enough. The moment we realize that the hateful people who fill and control our lives are wrong is the moment when everything can finally start to change. That moment shouldn\u2019t even have to happen\u2014it should be something that we just always know.Things won\u2019t get better until then.Good-bye. My name is Julia Bascom, and I am, always have been, and always will be, fine.Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/speech-without-a-title/", "title": "Speech (without a\u00a0title)"},
{"date": "September 4, 2011", "body": "I received the feedback forms from the presentation I gave in August. The responses were uniformly positive\u2014I\u2019m just not sure I can trust them. See, I was described by various respondents as \u201cinspiring,\u201d a \u201ckid,\u201d and \u201ca very good role-model.\u201d (But relatively \u201cempowered\u201d and \u201cself-sufficient,\u201d as opposed, one can assume, to the Real Autistic People.)Can we talk?First of all, let\u2019s get this out of the way: I am not a kid. I am, indeed, rather young, and as embarrassed about that as I am, there is nothing wrong, really, with calling me a kid. I call myself a girl. But calling my co-presenter, who just earned her doctorate, a kid? Makes me suspicious. It makes me remember how in popular conception there are no autistic adults, only children, and the children never grow up (or even reach puberty.) It reminds of how I listened to a man giving a presentation about a \u201ccommunity\u201d he was designing for \u201cchildren with autism\u201d\u2014except every one of these \u201cchildren\u201d was over the age of 21. When asked, he explained that \u201cI call them children because they will always be children to me.\u201dAnd when that is the dominant context for these discussions? Then no. You do not get to call me a kid.Similarly, \u201cinspiring.\u201d I\u2019m amused that the same qualities which make me a failure and a disappointment in one context make me inspiring in another. But it\u2019s not funny at all. I write and present furiously about injustice, about violence, about the things they do to us. No one who actually hears what I say walks out of the room inspired. They walk out furious. This? Is not inspiring. It\u2019s terrifying. I don\u2019t write to move or to touch, I write to survive, and it\u2019s only inspiring if you paint over all the pain fueling it and everything it\u2019s about so that you can enjoy the utterly adorable sight of someone trying to advocate for themselves.(At the conference, Zoe asked DJ how he dealt with hate-speech. He told her to be brave, because that\u2019s all you can do in the moment. A woman sitting next to us was so touched that she teared-up and put a hand over her heart. Not appalled that we live in a world where people argue about whether or not it\u2019s morally justifiable to kill us. No. Inspired by our adorable attempts at bravery.)I\u2019m not performing for you.This is not about your reactions.This is not supposed to be easy.It\u2019s not easy for us at all.I\u2019m not a good role model. I\u2019m far too angry and unpredictable for that, and if I were to mentor anyone the first thing I would tell them would be\u00a0 \u201cfigure out how you want to be.\u201d There\u2019s not a correct way to do this, there\u2019s not one right way to be an adult autistic, there are no acceptable autistics, and it terrifies me and sickens me and makes me worry about what I did wrong to make someone think I could be any of those things.Finally. I am utterly fascinated by the use of the descriptors empowered and self-sufficent. Those are great words, and I plan on adopting them. But saying I am those things, and other autistics aren\u2019t or can\u2019t be, tells me, if I had any doubts still, that you sat down for an hour and fifteen minutes and didn\u2019t hear a word I had to say.", "outgoing_links": ["../2011/04/29/this-is-why/"], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/patronization/", "title": "Patronization"},

{"date": "April 5, 2011", "body": "Writing is a struggle against silence. ~Carlos FuentesPassing as a non-autistic, passing as neurotypical, means that you never get to actually be human. Be a person. You just learn how to get really good at faking it. It\u2019s not good, it\u2019s not healthy, and yet how can you say no to a trick that gets you the human treatment, college, a job, a future, some sham at self-determination?But that\u2019s all it is: a sham.These things have costs and consequences. You can bottle things up for so long; you can pretend to be someone and something you aren\u2019t and never will be; you can do things which are exhausting, even actively harmful in pursuit of \u201cpassing\u201d\u2026But in the end you are still an autistic. An autistic who doesn\u2019t know how to be an autistic, much less a person, never mind an autistic person. And that\u2019s an important thing to know how to do.How to be.Who to be.Anatomy Of A MeltdownMy brain likes to alternate between being made of swiss cheese (full of holes to fall in and through and down) and wax (for optimal melting). I have meltdowns a lot, in part because I use the term \u201cmelting\u201d very broadly. Meltdowns, moments in which one\u2019s brain melts, are a physical thing, though they look different moment-to-moment and person-to-person. But they all start out the same, with that pressure behind the skull and the feeling of your thoughts evaporating, your language freezing, your body retracting inward. It\u2019s called shutdown, meltdown, violent meltdown, tantrum, outburst, dissociation, a million different things, but they all refer to the moment wherein your body or your brain, independent of your vote, decides that it simply cannot and will not continue to function in this charade that wasn\u2019t really working anyways and\u2026Well.Maybe you don\u2019t bang your head, scream, throw things, leave. Sometimes I don\u2019t. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I incur brain damage. Sometimes I just sit frozen for an hour.Passing tends to come to a halt when this happens.Meltdowns are of course a bit more complicated than all of this. What they are, to me, is a descent. A black hole opens up and draws you in, in, in. It\u2019s empty and silent and ringing with screams and your intestines get itchy and try to crawl up out your throat, or maybe that is just the pressure everywhere building, building until it explodes out or locks you down.The worst part about any of it, for me, is the silence.The complete and utter silence. Silence so deep it fills up your ears. Silence like a scream.And what\u2019s worse is that, when I\u2019m melting, as I enter or exit, I am silent too.It\u2019s why I type so frenetically. Why I get so upset when the words don\u2019t mesh just right, or when they build up and won\u2019t come out. That silence is to be avoided at all costs. When I\u2019m silent, when I have no voice, I might as well not exist. I don\u2019t, really. I\u2019m not properly a person. I must speak, type, make my voice project over their heads and into someone\u2019s ears.Anatomy Of A Passing PersonPassing is\u2026.Passing is\u2026Well, passing is difficult, first of all. It\u2019s constant anxiety, calculation, cognition, because remember, those of us who pass are trying to be a person we aren\u2019t, a member of a species that, should it know our true identity, expels us. The trick to passing, to passing well, is to make it look natural.Passing means repressing, memorizing rules, sublimating, jumping through hoops, and turning tricks so we can get the human treatment. It means making it so that when you reveal your diagnosis to someone they \u201cnever would have guessed it\u201d.Passing is supposed to be a good thing. It\u2019s convenient for the enabled and beneficial for the passing. The passing gets college, health care, respect, an audience to speak to, friends, work, a house, etc.What I want to know is why do I have to pass in order to implicitly deserve any of these things?What I want to know is since when did being treated like a human being have requirements?When I am actively, deliberately passing as nonautistic, I am supporting power structures I benefit from. I am saying through my actions that it is okay to divide the human race along these lines, to treat people who fall outside of these lines like this, to save all the privilege and benefits and nice things for the safe normal people, etc. And you know, there are a million reasons to deliberately do this, some of them okay and a lot not, but in the end I am still supporting and ironically benefiting from a power structure designed to oppress and disable me.But there is nuance to this. Silence is safety, of course, and being safe is important. And we aren\u2019t all cut out to be radical, kyriarchy-smashing activists.And what of those of us who pass without really trying all that hard?There is a certain amount of ridiculousness to that idea, of course. Of course we have to try hard, speaking (speaking!) and socializing and reacting and parroting like the neurotypicals around us takes effort even (especially?) when we don\u2019t realize it. Being a fake person, a half person, a glass girl or a ghost takes work. We tend to burn out eventually, no matter how brilliant a job of faking it we were doing. Or maybe we develop depression, anxiety, dissociation secondary to our autism as a result of this facade? Perhaps we take an increasingly upped litany of pills to cope. At the very least, we spend so much time learning how to be an acceptable human being that we forget, or never learn, how to be an autistic one.Or to question why the one isn\u2019t the same as the other.Anatomy Of A MonsterAnd what none of us passers want to talk about is what our passing does to those who can\u2019t. Passing is necessitated because without it, we would be stuck being a Scary Disabled Person and everybody knows how well their lives are allowed to go. There is a pervasive, fundamental belief that disabled people are monsters, or else possessed by monsters. That disability is monstrous, and disabled people, by implication are either victims or monsters ourselves. And therefore any and all talk of accessibility, universal design, human rights, equality, self-determination, alternative modes of communication, interdependence, what it means to be human and in a communication, what needs are and what it is to have them, etc etc etc goes out the window. Our bodies and lives and minds can be medicalized and politicized, but our voices are silenced and we get redefined as not quite, or not even close to, human.Maybe it\u2019s that view, of autism as monster and we as victims, which makes people recoil so much from the word, from the idea, from the concept of someone who will need 24/7 assistance and someone who won\u2019t but has the same label. People don\u2019t know how to treat victims, except by recoiling, as if bad luck is catching. People don\u2019t know how to treat disabled people except as someone blend of horrific and pitiful, and by doing so we are dehumanized and re-conceived as something manageable and avoidable and yes, monstrous. Unhuman.To be disabled is to be dehumanized. To pass is to be re-humanized as an acceptable, safe version of yourself that does not actually exist.\ufeffWell. Hi. My name is Julia, and I am autistic, and I am neither horrific nor pitiable nor monstrous, and if I am so what? And I pass. Mostly. For now.That\u2019s right. There\u2019s a monster in your midst.Anatomy Of An AutisticSo it looks as if I have two options. Pass and learn, perfect, the art of being a person I\u2019m not. Or don\u2019t, and let everyone else define me as some entwined version of monster and victim, pity and revulsion and terror.But there\u2019s actually a third option.I can humanize myself. I can define myself. I can speak for myself, as myself.I can find out who that self is.I can lean what it is to be an autistic adult.To be honest? I don\u2019t have the faintest idea how to do that, and I don\u2019t think you do either. It\u2019s not as simple as flapping in public or typing on my laptop when speech is too much. All I know how to do is pass, and to interrupt that passing with moments of confusion, furious honesty, rawness and vulnerability. The emphasis in education and intervention is to make the child look nonautistic, not to prepare them for a future as an autistic adult. And there a million more posts in here, and I will go back to writing them eventually, but the point is that a whole generation of us have graduated, we can pass now, and we don\u2019t know who we are or what to do.The anatomy of an autistic is a lot of sketched out, smudged charcoal lines and open uncontained spaces. It\u2019s a free space to develop. It\u2019s something that will fill in as disability is humanized, normalized, as autism is accepted, as I am allowed to be who and what I am and to drop the poor facade that got me so far without risking losing it all.The anatomy of an autistic is perhaps a scary thing. So few people have filled it in before, and even those fleshed-out illustrations have been crossed out by the dehumanizing, pitying, horrifying interpretations superimposed by others. But there\u2019s a whole generation of us coming.And I? I at least am going to work it out.Hi, my name is Julia, and I\u2019m autistic. It\u2019s probably the best thing about me. Check your assumptions at the door.We write to fill a silence here.\u00a0", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/anatomy-of-an-autistic/", "title": "Anatomy Of An\u00a0Autistic"},
{"date": "April 10, 2011", "body": "Last year my parents and I were talking about prenatal testing. It  comes up\u2014I work in a special ed room, I had just learned about the  abortion rates for Down Syndrome, we live on a street with four autistic  kids, and I was discovering the Disability Internet. So I asked if they  would have aborted me had they known how I would turn out.My parents told me last year that, had they known I would have been born autistic, they would have gotten an abortion.My parents would have aborted me.I kind of want to just stop typing there.This is real. It happens. It happens all the time.(I know five other sets of parents with adult autistic children who  have said the same thing. I have yet to find a pair in real life that  wouldn\u2019t. This is real. It happens.)It\u2019s all fun and games when I snark about ableism and eugenics and  people respond with condescension and strawmen and the same  non-arguments I\u2019ve heard hundreds of times before. It wants me want to  write additional fun facts about how the usual silencing tactics in this  conversation are ineffective against me\u2014you can attribute to me things I  never said, but I won\u2019t defend them because I am autistic and your  errors, while interesting, are mostly just amusing and kind of annoying.  I\u2019m used to people not listening. It was the first fact I ever wrote  about.You know what\u2019s not fun and games?My parents would have aborted me.Even knowing me, (then) eighteen years later. They would have aborted me.It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t love you. We just didn\u2019t know if you would have wound up like that kid up the road.I don\u2019t write as some Super Shiny Aspie (TM). I write as someone who spends her days with that kid up the road.  I write as someone who has spent the past year of her life as someone  who was told that her existence is a lamentable mistake caused by a  technological lag. I write as someone who belongs to a group that isn\u2019t good enough to be allowed to exist.I\u2019m not putting this under a cut. I want you to have to scroll  through this. I want to scream about the gaping, oozing wound carried by  every autistic\u2014the you shouldn\u2019t be here written in the margins of our files\u2014and I want someone to listen.The reality of an autistic person is this: your parents didn\u2019t want you. They wanted a child they felt they deserved.  They go to support groups and have a mourning period after a diagnosis  which takes place in a cold white room with whispered voices. They are  probably told to put you in an institution\u2014as you play at their feet\u2014or  else you are subjected to hours of behavioral modification which does nothing for your ability to function as an autistic person and maybe a little  something for your ability to embarrass your parents a little less.People give up on you.You go to school and the other kids call you retard, never  bothering to learn your real name. You don\u2019t sit with anyone at lunch.  You play by yourself and you like that better than the abuse. The point  comes where you realize that you can\u2019t lift your arms anymore. They\u2019ve  been slapped so often for flapping that you have a terror of moving  them.You learn that different means harder means defective means not worth it.Perhaps, like everyone else, you are born knowing that. One day you  realize it\u2019s meant for you. This is probably the same day you receive  some official confirmation that people would really rather you weren\u2019t  there.Everyone is generally very nice about it. What are you supposed to do about the nice people who don\u2019t want you there?You start, maybe, to learn some words to describe what it is to be you. You aren\u2019t sure that they\u2019re entirely the right words\u2014you\u2019re learning them from other autistics, and they get yelled at  a lot of speaking up and trying to help you\u2014and everyone else insists  that they are very much the wrong words. You keep trying, though,  because it\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s ever let you think that maybe no one is ever good enough to exist and yet we keep on existing, and that means something to you.Eventually you start saying these things on your own. (Maybe. If  you\u2019re lucky. If you\u2019re listened to by anyone, which is a crapshoot  anyways.) After a while you stop being confused by the things people  yell back at you, because you realize they have nothing to do with what  you are saying, and everything to do with you saying something.The reality of an autistic person is this: you shouldn\u2019t exist, and your defiance means you must be punished.So no. I\u2019m not anti-science. I don\u2019t think being disabled is super  fun. I don\u2019t think anyone deserves to suffer, ever. (And, because I  mention abortion, I\u2019m also pro-choice!) I\u2019m mostly someone who is tired  of being run off the rails whenever she suggests that maybe she\u2019s a person, too or that\u2019s not very nice with very rational, condescending platitudes about intent and think of the family members and your life is wrong, that never happened and this must be so difficult for you, let me explain and above all: you\u2019ve got it backwards, the world is actually flat.I am someone who should have been, would have been aborted.I am finally, finally speaking up for myself. You don\u2019t have to  listen. But you don\u2019t get to tell me to shut up because my voice doesn\u2019t  belong. You are certainly allowed to take what I say however you want,  especially as a personal affront directly targeted at you (I once used a  similar configuration of words to something she is snarking about! I am  the only person who has ever said this to her ever. She is attacking me, or at the very least responding directly to my mutterings. This is  probably as close to a conversation as she can manage!) I understand  that it must be very hard for you, hearing all of these inconvenient  people speaking up and speaking out and making you uncomfortable. I will, however, ignore you attempts to make me shut up, stop, go die and speak a little louder instead.I should have been aborted, and that is real, that is common,  and I will share that story over and over again until I (finally) die  because nonautistic people seem to think this conversation reduces down  to something other than please go away you are scary.My reality is that I\u2019m not supposed to exist.But I do.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/this-is-our-reality/", "title": "This Is Our\u00a0Reality"},
{"date": "April 5, 2011", "body": "It\u2019s a grabbers vs. flappers warzone.On the one side are the flappers. We wave and twist our hands in front of our faces or slap them against our chests. Our heads punctuate our moods and the music against the wall. Our knees don\u2019t bend as we walk on our toes, our fingers pick at cuticles or scratch patterns against our forearms and cheeks, and we\u2019d rather watch spinning pinwheels than drown in another person\u2019s eyes.(Our joy is own own, and we communicate it differently, perhaps holding privately onto it, or pouring it out into another person. But soon we learn from the grabbers that our joy should be our shame, our movements not our own, and so we withdraw.)What else is there to do when you are surrounded by grabbing hands but shrink in on yourself?The grabbers don\u2019t believe that we can be happy or find meaning unless we are exactly like them\u2014and that\u2019s really the goal, being just like everyone else, and so there is not even a second of hesitation in their eyes when they slap our hands down onto the table with a shriek of \u201cquiet hands\u201d.The hands are everywhere.They\u2019re at our chins. \u201cLook at me,\u201d with a face pressed in so close to yours that you count the pores until they force your gazes to meet. They grab our hands, \u201cdon\u2019t do that, people will think you\u2019re retarded.\u201d They smack away picking fingers, because our foreheads must be pristine and easy-to-look-at for them. You turn away, pull away, try to put some distance in so you can breath, and they grab your hands, your hips, your shoulders and twist you back. You bounce your leg\u2014surely you are allowed this?\u2014and they press a hand to your knee, stilling you. Everyone taps their pencil, but when you start their hand closes over yours and won\u2019t let go.\u201cPlease let me go!\u201dBut protesting just means you need to be grabbed more often, with harder and more insistent hands, until you realize that the way you move is fundamentally wrong, as wrong and deficient and disturbing and dangerous as you are, and if you want to be counted as a \u201cyou\u201d at all you must let them grab you until you can stop your self. The most basic human thing is just existing in space, and you quickly realize that you do even this wrong. Is it that you take up too much space, or just that you do it too differently, moving in an entirely alien way and triggering some sort of dormant xenophobia?In the end it just comes down to you are wrong, and for that you must be punished. It simplifies to your body is not your own, but it is mine. And you learn that a relationship, if you can call it that, always has two roles, a flapper and a grabber, and you will always be grabbed, and never be permitted to grab back.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/grabbers/", "title": "Grabbers"},
{"date": "September 27, 2011", "body": "I\u2019ve told this story before.I didn\u2019t have any theory of mind until I was 13.5. I have a very poor autobiographical memory, but I remember the acquisition vividly. I was in gym, attempting to serve a volleyball, and I turned to Sarah, monologuing in my head about something (a strategy I had developed last year to help me with thinking) and she was thinking. I had a mental stream of consciousness in my head. So did she. I looked around the gym. So did everyone.I was thinking about them. They could think about me.I would never feel safe again.A lot of things changed with that realization. I\u2019d never gained any information from eye contact, but now it terrified me. I\u2019d been abused by my peers, but now I realized that there was a persistent mental component as well. That they wanted to hurt me. They thought about me being confused and scared, and they liked it. I\u2019d been doing very well without any sort of therapy or medications for almost a year\u2014I was back at the doctor\u2019s within a month, got another new therapist, and soon started medication. My panic attacks began to last upwards of 36 hours. I started banging my head. I damaged my eyes. I started gouging out my skin. I got a staph infection, and I almost died, twice. I am covered in scars and discolorations.I am told that I was not, before this discovery, an anxious child. I generally felt safe.(Inside, if not out.)I owe a lot to my discovery of theory of mind. I just can\u2019t think of one positive.I can\u2019t pass the Sally-Ann tests, even now. The language confuses me. But I do know, now, that other people have minds, and they can think with them. About whatever they want. About me.Which means I will never, ever be safe. I never was.After all, it\u2019s not just that other people have minds. It\u2019s that they can think things I don\u2019t. They can be thinking about me without my knowledge. But it gets worse.They can be wrong.Maybe because I\u2019m autistic, and people think (there we go again, theory of mind) that this means I am a robot. I would love to be a robot, personally. I am always very concerned with accuracy. The thing that upsets me most about \u201cautism science,\u201d isn\u2019t actually the dehumanization and the consequences\u2014it\u2019s the bad science. The most terrifying and distressing thing in the world to me is something being incorrect.Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m autistic, and thus a robot. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m autistic, and therefore a simpler, lesser, smaller brain and in desperate need of order. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m autistic, and therefore abused, and I know the consequences of acting on mistaken beliefs about someone, know them in my bones.It\u2019s terrifying.My ability to acknowledge other minds means that I can converse more effectively than I could before. It also means I am never, ever safe. It means that I can see people being wrong, and I can see other people accepting and believing and spreading the misinformation, and I have to keep quiet. But to me, danger and anxiety and this is wrong are all the same.So I am never safe.I have theory of mind, now. I\u2019d like to call it something more accurate.Maybe theory of war.", "outgoing_links": ["http://crackedmirrorinshalott.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/inside-and-outside-safety/"], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/09/27/theory-of-war/", "title": "Theory Of War"},
{"date": "April 5, 2011", "body": "I am autistic. I can talk; I talked to myself for a long time before I would talk to anyone else. My sensory system is a painful mess, my grasp on language isn\u2019t always the best, and it takes me quite some time to process social situations. I cannot yet live on my own or manage college or relationships successfully. I can explain, bemoan, and wish away a lot of things about me and my autism: my troubles finding the right words to say what I really mean, my social processing lag and limits, my rubbery facial expressions, my anxiety, my sensory system\u2019s dysfunctions, my brain\u2019s tendency to get stuck in physical self-destruct mode and land me in the ER. I can complain about the suckiness of being socialized and educated as an autistic and as an outsider, about lack of supports and understanding and always needing to educate.One of the things about autism is that a lot of things can make you terribly unhappy while barely affecting others. A lot of things are harder.But some things? Some things are so much easier. Sometimes being autistic means that you get to be incredibly happy. And then you get to flap. You get to perseverate. You get to have just about the coolest obsessions. (Mine are: sudoku and Glee. I am not ashamed.)Now, maybe you do not understand. Because \u201cobsession\u201d and even \u201cperseveration\u201d have specific dictionary and colloquial meanings which everyone uses and understands and which do not even come CLOSE to describing my relationship with whatever I\u2019m obsessing on now. It\u2019s not just that I am sitting in my room and my heart is racing and all I can think about is Glee and all I want to do is read about it and talk about it and never go to sleep because that would take time away from this and that has been my life for the past few days. It\u2019s not just that I am doing sudokus in my head or that I find ways to talk about either numbers or Glee in any conversation, including ones about needing to give a student a sensory break so he\u2019ll stop screaming and throwing things.(It\u2019s not just the association and pressure of shame, because when ever an autistic person gets autistically excited about something, there will be people there to shame and bully them, and some of us will internalize that shame and lock away our obsessions and believe the bullies and let them take away this unique, untranslatable joy and turn it into something dirty and battered.)It\u2019s not any of that. Those are all things neurotypicals can understand and process. This goes beyond that. It\u2019s not anything recognized on the continuum of \u201cnormal\u201d.It\u2019s that the experience is so rich. It\u2019s textured, vibrant, and layered. It exudes joy. It is a hug machine for my brain. It makes my heart pump faster and my mouth twitch back into a smile every few minutes. I feel like I\u2019m sparkling. Every inch of me is totally engaged in and powered up by the obsession. Things are clear.It is beautiful. It is perfect.I flap a lot when I think about Glee or when I finish a sudoku puzzle. I make funny little sounds. I spin. I rock. I laugh. I am happy. Being autistic, to me, means a lot of different things, but one of the best things is that I can be so happy, so enraptured about things no one else understands and so wrapped up in my own joy that, not only does it not matter that no one else shares it, but it can become contagious.This is the part about autism I can never explain. This is the part I never want to lose. Without this part autism is not worth having.Neurotypical people pity autistics. I pity neurotypicals. I pity anyone who cannot feel the way that flapping your hands just so amplifies everything you feel and thrusts it up into the air. I pity anyone who doesn\u2019t understand how beautiful the multiples of seven are, anyone who doesn\u2019t get chills when a shadow falls just so across a solitaire game spread out on the table. I pity anyone who is so restrained by what is considered acceptable happiness that they will never understand when I say that sometimes being autistic in this world means walking through a crowd of silently miserable people and holding your happiness like a secret or a baby, letting it warm you as your mind runs on the familiar tracks of an obsession and lights your way through the day.It takes a million different forms. A boy pacing by himself, flapping and humming and laughing. An \u201cinterest\u201d or obsessions that is \u201cage appropriate\u201d\u2014or maybe one that is not. A shake of the fingers in front of the eyes, a monologue, an echolaliated phrase. All of these things autistic people are supposed to be ashamed of and stop doing? They are how we communicate our joy.If I could change three things about how the world sees autism, they would be these. That the world would see that we feel joy\u2014sometimes a joy so intense and private and all-encompassing that it eclipses anything the world might feel. That the world would stop punishing us for our joy, stop grabbing flapping hands and eliminating interests that are not \u201cage-appropriate\u201d, stop shaming and gas-lighting us into believing that we are never, and can never be, happy. And that our joy would be valued in and of itself, seen as a necessary and beautiful part of our disability, pursued, and shared.This is about the obsessive joy of autism. So I guess, if I\u2019m trying to explain what an obsession (and, by necessity, obsessive joy) means to me as an autistic person, I can bring it back to the tired old image of a little professor cornering an unsuspecting passerby and lecturing them for half an hour. All too often this encounter is viewed through the terrified eyes of the unwillingly captive audience. I\u2019d like to invite you to see through the eyes of the lecturer, who is not so much determined to force their knowledge into you as they are opened to a flood of joy which they cannot contain.And why would you want to contain something like that?\u00a0", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/the-obsessive-joy-of-autism/", "title": "The Obsessive Joy Of\u00a0Autism"},
{"date": "October 7, 2011", "body": "The correct reaction to hearing about systematic injustices or oppression experienced by an autistic person is not to turn to the autistic person explaining this and exclaim: \u201cbut I would never!\u201d\nThat this response is in any way considered a legitimate one will never cease to baffle me.\nI\u2019m thrilled that you aren\u2019t revolted by the idea of an autistic person having sex. I am really, genuinely, honestly excited. You know why?\nBecause you are rare. You\u2019re like a unicorn. If everyone felt like you, my friend would be permitted to be alone in another room with her boyfriend of seven years.\nBut\u2026oh. She\u2019s not.\nShe\u2019s turning twenty one, and she\u2019s never been told what \u201csex\u201d is.\nShe\u2019s also not an isolated example. She belongs to a specific group of people\u2013autistic, intellectually disabled, in a supervised living situation\u2013who are routinely and almost by default denied agency over her sexuality. Other groups experience the same abuse in different ways.\nYou think that\u2019s wrong? Congratulations. Then I\u2019m probably not writing about you.\nI am honestly overjoyed when a parent or an educator tells me that they don\u2019t practice quiet hands. I am also frustrated past the point of tears, because you are not enough. You are one person refraining from abuse in a culture where these practices are expected. Your actions have an impact, yes\u2013they also do not negate the reality I and the autistic community have grown up in. A spot of light in the darkness is invaluable, but it\u2019s just that\u2013a small spot of light. I\u2019m not writing about the spots\u2013I am writing about the overwhelming, consuming darkness.\nI really don\u2019t understand how we\u2019ve gotten to a point where some sort of acknowledgement is expected for the teachers, professionals, and parents, the service providers and the allies, who manage to show some basic human decency. Such a state of affairs is an insult to everyone involved.\nIf I describe a broader, troubling trend in society that has a profoundly negative impact on me and my community, a reply of \u201cbut surely I am not a part of this trend!\u201d is nonsensical. It says absolutely nothing about anything I described. You aren\u2019t a part of the problem? Then what I\u2019ve said doesn\u2019t apply to you. Why are you bringing yourself up? It\u2019s as if you commented that the sky is particularly blue today, and I mentioned that in Australia it\u2019s midnight. They\u2019re both technically true statements, but mine really isn\u2019t conducive to a discussion of the weather here and now.\nIn fact, if I make a habit of such statements, I\u2019ll probably be seen as needing some speech therapy or behavioral intervention.\nYou will probably be seen as a very, very patient ally.\nIt\u2019s an absurd situation. It\u2019s like a straight parent wanting praise for not kicking out their LGBT+ child, a man expecting me to finish an essay about rape with a p.s. most men aren\u2019t rapists, it\u2019s like me as a white person expecting a Japanese friend to finish a recounting of racial violence with a quick oh but I know you\u2019re not like that, Julia.\nGuess what! I don\u2019t get points for meeting the bare minimum requirement of ethical human behavior! No one does! It\u2019s the minimum. It\u2019s what the default is supposed to be. We should be able to take it for granted.\nYet in discussions about ableism and autism, I am repeatedly confronted by this problem. When I refuse to qualify my statements with but of course some parents would never kill their child, or not that life is always perfectly easy for neurotypicals either, I am told I am being too blunt, angry, or antagonistic. Probably, it is theorized, this is because I am autistic. I must have difficulty understanding that my experiences aren\u2019t universal, or that other people have feelings and a right to different opinions.\nNo, actually. Speaking\u2013well, typing\u2013truth plainly and as concisely and directly as I can is not the same as harshness. It probably feels unpleasant when read by a person in a position of immense privilege. I am frankly more concerned with the systematic injustices I see all around me.\nI mention privilege. Privilege is a word that has a lot of meaning. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m privileged for being able to articulate what has been done to me.\nI really cannot think of anyone luckier.\nPrivilege is actually very different from luck. Privilege is a lot like water, to paraphrase Amanda Baggs. It\u2019s been described as \u201cnot having to know\u201d or \u201cbeing able to forget\u201d\u2013not having to know that nothing will change for you unless they leave a bruise where someone can see, being able to forget that someone was institutionalized. A useful description here, however, is simply \u201cused to taking up space.\u201d People in positions of privilege\u2013and enabled people are by definition in a place of immense privilege over disabled people\u2013are used to taking up a lot of space. This does not mean that they are bad. It does mean, though, that when a minority attempts to claim a little bit of space for themselves, the privileged people will feel attacked. They might feel that the minority is, by trying to exercise their own voices and claim their own space, calling the privileged group intrinsically bad.\nBut here\u2019s the catch\u2013if the minority group devotes their limited attention and energy on reassuring the privileged group and helping them manage and process the transition\u2026then the privileged group is still taking up all of the space!\nThere is not actually a way for the minority group\u2013and to be specific again, I am talking about disabled people, about autistic adults\u2013to win here. Either we let ourselves be co-opted into soothing decent people that they are in fact decent people, or we are a hostile force to be at best ignored and at worst fought. Either way, the privileged group\u2013non-autistic people\u2013is still the center of the conversation and still makes the rules.\nIt is completely unacceptable.\nSo, for future reference? If someone positions themselves as an \u201cally\u201d and expects some sort of acknowledgement or praise or thanks for it: I disengage. I could not be less interested in having conversations which adhere to this power dynamic. I\u2019m busy: I have a liberation to craft.\nI would love it if you could join me.", "outgoing_links": ["https://ballastexistenz.wordpress.com/2008/10/11/people-can-be-a-bit-like-water/"], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/10/07/congratulations-on-your-human-decency/", "title": "\u201cCongratulations on your human\u00a0decency\u201d"},
{"date": "October 5, 2011", "body": "TW: Ableism, abuseExplaining my reaction to this:means I need to explain my history with this:1.When I was a little girl, they held my hands down in tacky glue while I cried.2. I\u2019m a lot bigger than them now. Walking down a hall to a meeting, my hand flies out to feel the texture on the wall as I pass by.\u201cQuiet hands,\u201d I whisper.My hand falls to my side.3. When I was six years old, people who were much bigger than me with loud echoing voices held my hands down in textures that hurt worse than my broken wrist while I cried and begged and pleaded and screamed.4.In a classroom of language-impaired kids, the most common phrase is a metaphor.\u201cQuiet hands!\u201dA student pushes at a piece of paper, flaps their hands, stacks their fingers against their palm, pokes at a pencil, rubs their palms through their hair. It\u2019s silent, until:\u201cQuiet hands!\u201dI\u2019ve yet to meet a student who didn\u2019t instinctively know to pull back and put their hands in their lap at this order. Thanks to applied behavioral analysis, each student learned this phrase in preschool at the latest, hands slapped down and held to a table or at their sides for a count of three until they learned to restrain themselves at the words.The literal meaning of the words is irrelevant when you\u2019re being abused.5.When I was a little girl, I was autistic. And when you\u2019re autistic, it\u2019s not abuse. It\u2019s therapy.6. Hands are by definition quiet, they can\u2019t talk, and neither can half of these students\u2026(Behavior is communication.)(Not being able to talk is not the same as not having anything to say.)Things, slowly, start to make a lot more sense.7. Roger needs a modified chair to help him sit. It came to the classroom fully equipped with straps to tie his hands down.We threw the straps away. His old school district used them.He was seven.8. Terra can read my flapping better than my face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one for everything,\u201d she says, and I wish everyone could look at my hands and see I need you to slow down or this is the best thing ever or can I please touch or I am so hungry I think my brain is trying to eat itself.But if they see my hands, I\u2019m not safe.\u201cThey watch your hands,\u201d my sister says, \u201cand you might as well be flipping them off when all you\u2019re saying is this menu feels nice.\u201d9. When we were in high school, my occasional, accidental flap gave my other autistic friend panic attacks.10.I\u2019ve been told I have a manual fixation. My hands are one of the few places on my body that I usually recognize as my own, can feel, and can occasionally control. I am fascinated by them. I could study them for hours. They\u2019re beautiful in a way that makes me understand what beautiful means.My hands know things the rest of me doesn\u2019t. They type words, sentences, stories, worlds that I didn\u2019t know I thought. They remember passwords and sequences I don\u2019t even remember needing. They tell me what I think, what I know, what I remember. They don\u2019t even always need a keyboard for that.My hands are an automatic feedback loop, touching and feeling simultaneously. I think I understand the whole world when I rub my fingertips together.When I\u2019m brought to a new place, my fingers tap out the walls and tables and chairs and counters. They skim over the paper and make me laugh, they press against each other and remind me that I am real, they drum and produce sound to remind me of cause-and-effect. My fingers map out a world and then they make it real.My hands are more me than I am.11.But I\u2019m to have quiet hands.12.I know. I know.Someone who doesn\u2019t talk doesn\u2019t need to be listened to.I know.Behavior isn\u2019t communication. It\u2019s something to be controlled.I know.Flapping your hands doesn\u2019t do anything for you, so it does nothing for me.I know.I can control it.I know.If I could just suppress it, you wouldn\u2019t have to do this.I know.They actually teach, in applied behavioral analysis, in special education teacher training, that the most important, the most basic, the most foundational thing is behavioral control. A kid\u2019s education can\u2019t begin until they\u2019re \u201ctable ready.\u201dI know.I need to silence my most reliable way of gathering, processing, and expressing information, I need to put more effort into controlling and deadening and reducing and removing myself second-by-second than you could ever even conceive, I need to have quiet hands, because until I move 97% of the way in your direction you can\u2019t even see that\u2019s there\u2019s a 3% for you to move towards me.I know.I need to have quiet hands.I know. I know.13.There\u2019s a boy in the supermarket, rocking back on his heels and flapping excitedly at a display. His mom hisses \u201cquiet hands!\u201d and looks around, embarrassed.I catch his eye, and I can\u2019t do it for myself, but my hands flutter at my sides when he\u2019s looking.(Flapping is the new terrorist-fist-bump.)14. Let me be extremely fucking clear: if you grab my hands, if you grab the hands of a developmentally disabled person, if you teach quiet hands, if you work on eliminating \u201cautistic symptoms\u201d and \u201cself-stimulatory behaviors,\u201d if you take away our voice, if you\u2026if you\u2026if you\u202615.Then I\u2026I\u2026.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://juststimming.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/quiet-hands/", "title": "Quiet Hands"}
