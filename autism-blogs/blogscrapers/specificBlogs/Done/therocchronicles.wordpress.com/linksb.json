{"date": "January 8, 2015", "body": "A few weeks before Christmas we decided to road trip to South Carolina to spend the holidays with GC\u2019s family.\u00a0 We hadn\u2019t spent Christmas with his parents since 2006. We were in good spirits on our drive down, even the dog. GC\u2019s parents were on a cruise so we spent the first couple days in their house without them.\u00a0 The Roc and his Nonna made some Christmas cookies together when they got back. The Roc was very excited to be with his SC cousins for Christmas.\u00a0 He was most excited to sleep at his cousins house on Christmas eve and wake up with them on Christmas morning\u2026which is what GC and I were most worried about.\u00a0 Our Christmases have always been quiet and calm.\u00a0 This year would be so different and we could envision many things that could make the Roc melt.\u00a0 We did a lot of prepping before we left home and crossed our fingers that things would go smoothly.\u00a0 I was still worried a little until my sister-in-law Andrea texted me, \u201cWe love Roc so much and will be there to help if he has a rough time.\u00a0 It will be different for him to be here and we totally understand that.\u201d There is nothing like family who love your kid just as he is, understand that things may be hard for him, and are willing to step in and help.\u00a0 We are so lucky. The Roc spent Christmas eve morning playing on the iPad and continually asking when we would drive down to his auntie Andrea\u2019s house. When we got there the fun began.\u00a0 The kids were so joyful.\u00a0 The Roc and his cousins immediately got together.\u00a0 They spent the night laughing and dancing. The Roc and his cousin Bella even made up a dance and performed it for us.\u00a0 They are so cute together.\u00a0 Bella is a gift.\u00a0 She is sweet, playful, and so wonderful with the Roc.\u00a0 She reassures him when he is anxious and she is willing to play all night.\u00a0 She is a very special girl. The kids weren\u2019t the only ones having a good time.\u00a0 There was a lot of laughter in the kitchen. Guinness found a friend in my youngest nephew Anderson!\u00a0 He tried to hide his face but I captured this shot this funny little guy. My mother-in-law shed a few tears when my brother-in-law from Colorado surprised us all and showed up!\u00a0 We were so happy to see him! At the end of the night the kids all opened new pjs from their Nonna and Nonno. Before the kids went to bed my nephew Aiden read, \u201cThe Night Before Christmas\u201d to all the younger kids.\u00a0 Almost all of my pictures of Aiden on Christmas Eve are of his blurry face as he slid in front of the camera or waved his hand in the corner of my frame.\u00a0 Except this one.\u00a0 He\u2019s a good kid. A moment the Roc still talks about. The next morning the Roc expressed some anxiety before leaving the bedroom to open presents, but after a little pep talk he told me, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready now.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do this.\u201d The kids had a blast opening up their gifts. We spent the rest of the day eating and relaxing before we headed back to GC\u2019s parents house. The holiday was a success all around.\u00a0 The Roc had so much fun spending time with his cousins and he was very well behaved.\u00a0 As we drove out of Andrea\u2019s neighborhood GC and I looked at each other and he said to me, \u201cI think that was my favorite Christmas yet.\u201d Last year, for reasons we never figured out, the Roc had such a hard time on Christmas day.\u00a0 So we are extra thankful for such a family filled fun holiday. We made wonderful memories. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/2014-12-20-16-57-09.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2779.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2787.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2791.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2807.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2812.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2898.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2867.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2853.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2928.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2838.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2819.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2915.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2937.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2945.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2921.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2931.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2957.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2958.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2987.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2973.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_2992.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2015/01/08/sc-christmas-cousins/", "title": "SC Christmas +\u00a0Cousins"},
{"date": "October 13, 2008", "body": "The Roc didn\u2019t have school on Friday so GC took off work and we headed to NYC for the day.\u00a0 We lucked out and had beautiful weather.\u00a0 We drove up to Princeton and caught the 9:48 am express train and arrived in about an hour. The Roc really likes to ride on the train.\u00a0 He was having an \u201call about daddy day\u201d and wanted to sit on GC\u2019s lap the entire way (which was fine with me!).\u00a0\u00a0 When we got to the city we started walking and ended up walking right past one of our new favorite restaurants. So we stopped and had lunch. After lunch we headed over to Central Park and the Roc spied a playground he remembered from the summer (you\u2019ll recognize this place Hilary!).\u00a0 We stopped and let him run free.\u00a0 He climbed all over and had a blast.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the first times he really explored without stopping to make sure he knew where we were. Lucky for us the water was turned off.\u00a0 The fountains were still on though! I got to sit and enjoy the weather and the fall colors.\u00a0 After the playground we tried to go to the Central Park Zoo but were not aware that they only took CASH and we were 5 bucks short!\u00a0 We were pretty disappointed but promised the Roc that next time we\u2019ll definitely go to the zoo.\u00a0 Bummer!\u00a0 We spent the rest of the afternoon walking around Central Park enjoying the fall colors and the beautiful weather.

What do you think the Roc is going to be for Halloween? You\u2019re right! Batman!

He couldn\u2019t stop running into my bathroom to check himself out in the mirror. He even posed for a picture and smiled when I asked him to! Then he wanted to go upstairs and play while wearing it. I don\u2019t think the Roc understands the super hero concept because he kept muttering to himself \u201cI\u2019m a bat.\u00a0 I\u2019m a bat.\u00a0 I\u2019m a bat.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop giggling about this.

{"date": "September 29, 2009", "body": "Kindergarten has been in session for a month and on Thursday night I went to the Roc\u2019s Kindergarten open house.\u00a0 I was a little apprehensive, like I always am to go to the school, but excited to see if I would get a chance to talk to the special ed teacher and see how he was really doing.\u00a0 Lately it seems that he has been oscillating between having good days and bad because I would get a note in his communication book when he went to time-out for hitting as well as notes that said \u201cGREAT day today!\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019ve been worried because he has been reluctant to get on the bus in the mornings, which has led me to wonder what kind of shape he is in when he gets to school.\u00a0 I also know that the day is long (6 hours) so he cannot possibly be in a bad mood the whole day even if he arrives in one.\u00a0 So I was really looking forward to finding out more about his day. Listening to the two teachers talk about the curriculum and how they teach it reminded me of why I was so happy this summer when I found out he was placed with them.\u00a0 They were poised and confident, but more than that they were fun, upbeat, and passionate about teaching these children.\u00a0 The most impressive part for me was when the special ed teacher explained the inclusion room and how it benefits everyone in the classroom and what she hopes they all take away from this experience \u2013 the children, teachers, and parents alike.\u00a0 I sat back and looked around at all the parents with typical children hoping that they really understood the impact and how  lucky  their kids are, because I really do believe they are lucky.\u00a0 Not only because they have this amazing duo of teachers but also because they have these special children in their lives to teach them about respect, acceptance, and sensitivity.\u00a0 I know that the Roc is lucky that inclusion exists because he definitely models off these children and has learned many skills by watching and imitating them, and he wants to be with them. The teachers stated during their presentation that they did not want to answer questions about individual children that night, but the special ed teacher pulled me aside as soon as they were done presenting to show me some of the tools they are using with the Roc.\u00a0 She pulled out a little sheet that had a red frowny face and a green smiley face and told me that she uses that to reinforce his behavior and as a reminder.\u00a0 All she has to do is show him this slip ask him if he wants her to circle the red frowny face and he says \u201cno!\u201d\u00a0 and snaps back in line.\u00a0 She even gave it to the reading specialist to hold over his head while she is working with him individually.\u00a0 Another tool she has ready are some \u201cI need a break\u201d pictures that he can use if he gets overwhelmed.\u00a0 He hasn\u2019t had to use them yet. By this time most of the parents had left the room and the general ed teacher and the para came over to join our conversation about the Roc. We talked about his behavior and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the hitting isn\u2019t  hitting , he\u2019s tapping them and saying he is going to hit.\u00a0 More often than not he is verbally warning them.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m angry.\u00a0 I want to smash the table\u201d but doesn\u2019t actually DO anything.\u00a0 He isn\u2019t having outbursts of yelling and screaming, in fact, he isn\u2019t overly loud at all.\u00a0 When another child bonked him on the head accidentally while they were playing he didn\u2019t yell like they thought he would.\u00a0 Instead he went to the teacher and said \u201cThat wasn\u2019t nice.\u00a0 I\u2019m angry and I want to smash him\u201d\u00a0 which sounds bad but the fact that he went to the teacher and verbalized how he felt and didn\u2019t scream or try to retaliate speaks volumes.\u00a0 He is transitioning from the bus into school well \u2013 he comes right in and does the six step morning routine with minimal help!\u00a0 He had a lot of issues with this in preschool.\u00a0 Something else he had a big problem with in preschool was walking in line, he has a lot of anxiety about people being behind him and they had lots of trouble keeping him in line last year.\u00a0 He is walking in line just fine in kindergarten!\u00a0 Also, he is sitting in the crowded cafeteria and eating with his classmates!\u00a0 I worried about him actually eating because of how overstimulating the cafeteria would be.\u00a0 The para even said that she stopped hanging around the table as much because he is doing so well.\u00a0 He still needs a little help but is surprising her in that situation. And there\u2019s the BIG one:\u00a0 He.Is.Talking.To.His.Classmates\u2026I was over the moon excited to hear about this.\u00a0 I witnessed this with his  friends and cousins  last week and am so thrilled to find out it\u2019s happening in the classroom too!\u00a0 In fact, I think all those typical kids in the classroom has been the catalyst for this growth in conversational skills.\u00a0 The teachers told me that he loves to play with blocks with the boys in the class and that is one of his preferred activities.\u00a0 He is also finally using the playground and likes for the girls to chase him!\u00a0 The special ed teacher even took a little video of him on the playground and showed it to me because she captured him being chased by a little girl and loving it, and then he let her go up the stairs first and said \u201cthese are my friends\u201d when she went by.\u00a0 So cute! I was so thankful that they took the time to talk to me about the Roc.\u00a0 The were so genuine when they told me they are really enjoying having him in the class, he makes them laugh everyday, they love hearing the new stuff that comes out of his mouth, and of course he has one of the best smiles around! I left the building feeling so relieved.\u00a0 Back in February/March I was so worried about whether I should send him on to kindergarten or have him repeat preschool again.\u00a0 I had insomnia for weeks while I visited the two different types of kindergarten inclusion in our district and then thought and thought about it.\u00a0 I talked to all of his doctors about preschool vs. kindergarten and no one could tell me what would be best \u2013 no one knew.\u00a0 I had to decide.\u00a0 Then we had the Delaware Autism Program evaluation in April/May and I was slightly relieved when they said he was too high functioning for their program.\u00a0 They made that decision for me, but I was also worried that they made a mistake and that he might really need to be in that program, (and also really ticked that now he does not have the educational label of autism).\u00a0 My mind was forever pinging back and forth between all the different possibilities and it was driving me nuts.\u00a0 I have been really worried these last few weeks that the Roc was in the wrong place, that kindergarten was too much for him, too many kids, too much change, too long, etc.\u00a0 Worried that I made the wrong decision. I am not anymore.\u00a0 He is doing well.\u00a0 He is learning.\u00a0 He is growing.\u00a0 He is gaining independence.\u00a0 His social skills are blossoming.\u00a0 He is happy (most of the day!). I made the right decision.\u00a0 All those months I felt so sick with worry, all the gray hairs I sprouted, and I made the right decision. For once I don\u2019t feel guilty. What an amazing feeling.

{"date": "September 28, 2009", "body": "For the longest time when children would talk to the Roc he would just grin and repeat what they had said.\u00a0 He was obviously happy they were talking with him and he wanted to interact, but he either couldn\u2019t process what they were saying/asking, or he couldn\u2019t come up with a reply/answer fast enough so he stalled for time by repeating them.\u00a0 It never worked and usually these children would find someone else to play with before the Roc came up with some original speech.\u00a0 It was heartbreaking to watch, but at the same time I have been so happy that he was finally craving that interaction because for a long time before that started he shunned being around children all together.\u00a0 His gain of social skills has been slow, but steady, and now something new and exciting is happening with the Roc! Last weekend he really wanted to jump in his bouncy house, but told me \u201cIt\u2019s more fun with kids\u201d so we invited the neighbor boys over to jump with him.\u00a0 Usually when Luke (4.5) and Daniel (2.5) come over to jump all three of them get really silly, wild, and rough.\u00a0 This time it was different.\u00a0 I reminded the Roc to use his words instead of screaming if things got too rough.\u00a0 As soon as the rough play started I heard the Roc say \u201cHey!\u00a0 I\u2019m going to count to 5!\u00a0 1\u20262\u2026.3\u20265!\u00a0 You just lost your privileges!\u00a0 No rough housing in the bouncy house!\u00a0 You go to time out.\u00a0 You just have to bounce on the grass now!\u201d I was floored and called into the house for GC to get me a pen and my notebook \u2013 I just  had  to write all that down!\u00a0 So many sentences, all original, standing up for himself, and the bossiness!\u00a0 Inwardly I was cheering for him!\u00a0 Go Roc! Luke seemed surprised by all that the Roc said, his face lit up, and the two of them giggled and giggled about going to time-out and jumping on the grass, and then they started  TALKING!!!  Back and forth exchanges.\u00a0 Asking and answering questions.\u00a0 All original stuff from the Roc.\u00a0 Conversation.\u00a0 The Roc was conversing with a friend!\u00a0 I was completely stunned and couldn\u2019t stop grinning. Then the Roc said \u201cLet\u2019s do our running stuff!\u201d and they started a game of running from the side of the house and throwing themselves up the slide into the bouncy house. Then they sat and talked\u2026(!!!) I heard the Roc say things like \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d when Luke would look away and \u201cWait!\u00a0 I have to tell you something!\u201d when Luke would get up and move away from him.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t always hear what they were saying and I know that the Roc didn\u2019t always understand Luke because he once asked him \u201cDo you like the treats at school?\u201d after Luke had just made a statement about something completely unrelated to school.\u00a0 I was and still am totally floored that they were conversing!\u00a0 It was very recently that the Roc began having more appropriate back and forth exchanges with GC and I, and I figured it would still be awhile before this started happening with children.\u00a0 I guess I was wrong. I got to witness these new conversational skills a few days later when my BIL and SIL stopped at our house to spend the night on Thursday before driving back down to South Carolina.\u00a0 The Roc was sooooo excited for his cousins to come and I was a happy for him and a little worried.\u00a0 He just adores his cousin Annabella and they used to play this little running game when we would visit them.\u00a0 She has since outgrown that game but the Roc remembers doing this with her and so he always wants her to run with him, but she isn\u2019t as interested anymore.\u00a0 The last time we were down South he got really upset when she wouldn\u2019t run with him and it was hard for me to explain to him that she didn\u2019t want to do that anymore and no one could make her run, no matter how much he wanted her too! I didn\u2019t need to worry.\u00a0 When I got home from his Kindergarten open house (I\u2019ll post about that soon) that night everyone was already there and the Roc was just full of excitement to have his cousins in the house.\u00a0 Everyone was just finishing up dinner when I came home and sat down to eat.\u00a0 The Roc asked if he could go play and I suggested he go ask Bella if she wanted to see his room.\u00a0 He ran off towards the living room and I heard his little voice \u201cDo you want to come upstairs and see my room?\u201d and her sweet little answer \u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0 I looked at my sister in-law and we smiled as the kids went up the stairs chattering to each other.\u00a0 We could hear them talking and bumping around above us and it was then, while I was eating, when I realized that this was the very first time that the Roc was upstairs playing with another child and I didn\u2019t have to be there.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t need to intervene.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t need to watch.\u00a0 Break up fights because he grabbed something away from someone.\u00a0 Stop him from screeching because he wanted to play chase and the other child did not.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t need to be there\u2026 That was totally brand new for me.\u00a0 I really, really, really liked that feeling. We let the Roc stay up late that night so he could play with his cousins and he also got to see them for about an hour before he left for school the next morning.\u00a0 I tried to get a few pictures of them playing but all I got was the back of their heads, and this picture of the Roc with the little girl he adores, Annabella with her little brother (the Roc hugged her before he left for school and I  wish  I could have gotten a picture of it\u2013it was so sweet!) (I also got those too funny pics of the Roc wearing Annabella\u2019s Hannah Montana wig I posted this weekend!\u00a0 Just like with the Batman costume\u2013he really enjoyed checking himself out in the mirror wearing that wig!) I\u2019m really loving these changes and leaps in progress the Roc has been making lately.\u00a0 He still wants to play with me a lot but he is always asking if there are kids to play with.\u00a0 He just told me this morning \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be just the Roc and Mommy\u201d when we were talking about what we would play with when he gets home from school.\u00a0 I can\u2019t help but remember that at this time two years ago he was mostly using echoalia to communicate, was having lots of screaming fits, did not possess many play skills, and really wanted nothing to do with other children.\u00a0 I was heartbroken to get the diagnosis.\u00a0 Suddenly I couldn\u2019t picture his future and heard many bleak statistics which for a time plunged me into deep despair. Watching and listening to the Roc interact with the neighbor boys and his cousins has filled me with hope.\u00a0 He has accomplished so much in two years.\u00a0 I wonder what he will be like two years from now. I\u2019ll keep holding onto my hope.

{"date": "October 2, 2009", "body": "I\u2019ve been meaning to post about last Saturday because it was a truly wonderful day.\u00a0 The best day in many, many, many days.\u00a0 I am still basking in the glow of Saturday (even through the horrid meltdown last night and the crankiness of this morning).\u00a0 Here\u2019s why: In the morning we went to the 2nd annual Special Olympics horse show so the Roc could \u201ccompete.\u201d\u00a0 I had thought about making a social story for this event and even asked his instructor for pictures of the facility and of last year\u2019s event.\u00a0 I never got around to making the social story so we looked at the event pictures on Friday night.\u00a0 We talked a lot about the fact that he would be riding a new horse at a new place, but his instructor would still be the same and he would do the same activities he does during lessons.\u00a0 We got there just as the opening ceremonies started so GC dropped us off and went to park the car.\u00a0 The Roc was immediately anxious about the crowd and so he ended up where he always does during times like those \u2013 on my back.\u00a0 (I wonder what I will do when he gets too big for piggy back rides?!)\u00a0 We watched the torch being lit and then went to find his riding instructor to get our instructions for the morning. Once the Roc got his number and the time he would ride we took a little walk to an area less crowded and let the Roc do some hill climbing to burn off some of his anxiety. Soon enough it was time to head over to the ring and wait for his turn to ride.\u00a0 Again the Roc rode on my back through the crowd and I worried a little about how he was going to do because he seemed so wound up. I didn\u2019t need to worry though.\u00a0 As soon as he got his helmet on he went off with Becca willingly, and then he GRINNED the WHOLE time he rode! Except for those moments each time he passed us and he yelled \u201cHi Mommy!\u00a0 Hi Daddy!\u201d And when he concentrated to stand as they went over the poles. When he was done he stood on the podium to receive his medal from the police officer. (He looked right into the police officer\u2019s eyes after he got his medal and grinned that famous grin and we are cursing our too slow camera for we didn\u2019t catch it!\u00a0 It\u2019s time for a new camera.) After he got his medal we left the event and headed across the border into PA to go apple picking.\u00a0 The Roc was very excited to go on a hayride so we did that first.\u00a0 He surprised us by  not  stimming with the hay, which is what he usually does whenever we go on a hayride.\u00a0 I think it may have something to do with the medal he insisted on wearing the rest of the day! Once the hayride was over we jumped on the shuttle out to the apple orchards and the Roc helped pick the apples. He was so pleased with himself and wanted to keep picking even when our bag was full.\u00a0 He shocked us by eating an apple with the skin on \u2013 something that never happens at home!\u00a0 He waited patiently for the shuttle back to the parking lot even though he had to \u201cgo\u201d and told me \u201cI want to pee on the grass right here.\u201d\u00a0 He does look a little uncomfortable\u2026 We ended the day by stopping at a Thai food restaurant for a late lunch and he did awesome in the restaurant.\u00a0\u00a0 He was excited to point out all the different kinds of lights, the artwork on the walls, and did a running commentary on what the waitresses were doing. On the ride home GC and I looked at each other and he said to me \u201cThis has been the  best  day.\u00a0 The best day in a long, long time.\u201d\u00a0 The day was amazing because the Roc was happy throughout, he didn\u2019t scream about anything, throw any tantrums, or whine about anything.\u00a0 He was happy.\u00a0 It was an especially good day for him. More than all of the things the Roc did right on Saturday, I think that GC meant it was the best day since we received the diagnosis two years ago.\u00a0 We have each struggled in our own way to come to terms with autism and at the same time have watched the Roc change before our eyes.\u00a0 Two years ago we dealt with limited communication, many tantrums and much screaming on a daily basis, and we just couldn\u2019t picture a day like Saturday.\u00a0 A day where we would do so many activities in one day.\u00a0 A day out as a family, making memories and having fun.\u00a0 A day where the Roc would be talking to us, describing what he was seeing.\u00a0 A day where he would transition so easily.\u00a0 A day where he would keep himself together all day.\u00a0 A day like Saturday. Something I know for sure is that Saturday didn\u2019t happen magically.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all changed.\u00a0 The Roc is able to handle more change and is able to verbalize much more than he could two years ago.\u00a0 That is most definitely evident.\u00a0 But GC and I have changed too.\u00a0 We know what the Roc likes and doesn\u2019t like.\u00a0 We know his limits and respect them.\u00a0 We\u2019ve learned to heed the warning signs or deal with the consequences.\u00a0 Maybe most importantly we prepare as best we can and we keep trying.\u00a0 All of us. Saturday was the best day. I have no doubt we will have more of them. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/the-best-day/", "title": "The best day"},
{"date": "September 11, 2009", "body": "I imagine that I am perched on a wooden fence in the middle of a beautiful mountain meadow filled with colorful wildflowers.\u00a0 The sun is shining, water gurgles over rocks nearby, puffy white clouds sift across a bright blue sky, and the sun warms my face.\u00a0 But even though the scenery is lovely I do not fully enjoy it because my heart is heavy with indecision. I don\u2019t know which side to step off the fence.\u00a0 Each side is a different life.\u00a0 My mind swirls with the weight of this decision and I don\u2019t know which direction to go\u2026and so I sit.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been sitting on this proverbial fence for months now\u2026. On one side is the life I lead now.\u00a0 I am the mama to one child.\u00a0 He is a gorgeous, spirited, amazing, and challenging child.\u00a0 His existence has shaped the person I am now, pushes me to grow, and challenges me every day.\u00a0 Together with GC we are a family of three.\u00a0 Just the three of us. On the other side of the fence is a life with GC, the Roc, and another baby.\u00a0 Another baby.\u00a0 Another child.\u00a0 Another little human that would cause our little family of three to shift and expand into a family of four.\u00a0 How different that would be.\u00a0 A completely different life.\u00a0 Four of us. GC and I always knew we wanted children and we didn\u2019t really see the need to wait a specific time frame before starting our family, nor had we completely decided on exactly how many children we would have.\u00a0 I knew I at least wanted two, and he convinced me of the possibility of three.\u00a0 When we tried for our first baby I got pregnant right away.\u00a0 The Roc was born.\u00a0 When the Roc was two years old I was ready to start thinking about adding to our little family.\u00a0 We starting trying.\u00a0 Months and months went by and I was disappointed again and again to find myself empty. Then came Autism.\u00a0 Our lives changed.\u00a0 My focus shifted solely onto the child we do have and I shelved that idea of an addition to our little family.\u00a0 I cried, I screamed out my grief, I poured over the internet, read books, took notes, made and waited various amounts of time for appointments with a neurologist, a developmental pediatrician, a psychologist, the evaluation team at the school, a DAN! doctor.\u00a0 I wondered what happened to my beautiful baby and all my dreams, I thought I might go crazy, and I called my Mom every time I felt that I was coming unglued, surely shaving years off her life (thank you Mom).\u00a0 I\u2019ve lost mommy friends who didn\u2019t understand, and gained a few that live a similar existence.\u00a0 The Roc started special ed preschool, a special diet, therapeutic horseback riding, swimming lessons, and a social skills group.\u00a0 I\u2019ve attended IEP meetings, FBA meetings, watched the school psychologist chart my son\u2019s IQ on a bell curve, and felt that my heart would explode with all the decisions to be made.\u00a0 I\u2019ve lived through meltdowns and horrid tantrums at home and in public, and learned to keep my eyes and focus on my son and to hell with the general public.\u00a0 I\u2019ve advocated and tried to raise awareness.\u00a0 I\u2019ve laid awake at night heart pounding and mind racing and I\u2019ve had days that I wonder what I was getting so worked up about in the first place.\u00a0 And on and on and on.\u00a0 All of that is ongoing still. When the Roc was three years old and we received the Autism diagnosis kindergarten seemed so far away.\u00a0 Two years looked like a lifetime.\u00a0 I had so much to do to get him ready.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t think too far ahead.\u00a0 I could only put one foot in front of the other while I gained the knowledge I have now and learned how to help the Roc. Now the Roc is in kindergarten.\u00a0 He is gone from 9 am to 3:30 pm.\u00a0 Six and a half hours.\u00a0 When I mention this to some of my mommy friends they say \u201cWow!\u00a0 What I wouldn\u2019t give to have just one day to myself!\u201d\u00a0 They have started to ask me \u201cWhat are you going to do now? Are you going to get a job?\u00a0 What do you DO with yourself all DAY?!\u201d Of course I have a list of projects I want to complete around the house, and I\u2019m trying to use some of this time for creativity, but this wasn\u2019t what I imagined when we started our family.\u00a0 I assumed that when the Roc went to kindergarten I would have a toddler at home to deal with.\u00a0 I always wanted more than one child. And there it is.\u00a0 The reason I\u2019ve been sitting on that fence. Should we give the Roc a sibling? Sounds like an easy question to answer given that I\u2019ve stated we always wanted more than one child.\u00a0 But it is the  what ifs  that keep me perched on this fence of indecision.\u00a0 What if autism happened again?\u00a0 What would that do to our family?\u00a0 What would that do to the Roc?\u00a0 What would that do to my marriage?\u00a0 What would that do to  me ?\u00a0 How would we  pay  for it?\u00a0 Can I even do this again?\u00a0 What if it\u2019s worse for the next child?\u00a0 How would the Roc handle all that?\u00a0 How would we DO it all?\u00a0 Since there is no clear answer as to why it happened to the Roc, there is no clear answer to if it will happen again.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t know what to do with that knowledge, or lack thereof. There is another side to the what ifs though.\u00a0 The Roc and I were at the pool Labor Day weekend before it closed for the season and the Roc was quietly pouring water in the baby pool while I sat on a lounge chair scribbling in a notebook (jotting my scattered thoughts on this topic in fact) when another family entered the pool area.\u00a0 Two young boys and little toddling baby girl, she was probably about 15 months old, got into the pool while their parents settled themselves in the sun.\u00a0 The boys ignored the Roc who was still quietly and repetitively pouring water while the little girl beelined for him.\u00a0 I cringed wondering if he was going to scream at her as she reached out her hand to touch the water he was pouring when he smiled at her.\u00a0 He proceeded to pour water for her to put her hands in and when he squirted water out of his mouth she laughed and he did it again and again to keep her laughing at him.\u00a0 He got out of the pool and she followed him to the fence and watched him pour water.\u00a0 She followed him around and he totally enjoyed it.\u00a0 I watched all this with a soft smile on my lips and felt a tug on my heart.\u00a0  What if? What if that little girl was the Roc\u2019s sister?\u00a0 What would it be like for him to have someone to interact with, even though they would be so far apart in age?\u00a0 What would it be like to expand our family?\u00a0 For the Roc to have someone else in this world to love and who would love him?\u00a0 Would he like to have a little brother or sister?\u00a0 He says \u201cyes\u201d if you ask him.\u00a0 What would it be like for me to have another baby that I dreamed about?\u00a0 To have two children instead of one? What if the next child was typical and I got to see the other side of the coin?\u00a0 What  if ? I know that I am lucky.\u00a0 The Roc is verbal and learning new things.\u00a0 He is on his own slow and steady uphill climb.\u00a0 He is beautiful, smiley, amazing, and changing right before my very eyes.\u00a0 I am fiercely proud of all that he has accomplished so far and I refuse to put a cap on how far he can go. Shouldn\u2019t that be enough for me?\u00a0 I wrestle with this as I watch my friends, sister, and sister-in-law through eyes green with envy.\u00a0 I always wanted more than one child.\u00a0 It\u2019s the what ifs that keep me up at night sitting on this fence. I just don\u2019t know which way to go. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2009/09/11/on-the-fence/", "title": "On the fence"},
{"date": "August 12, 2010", "body": "The Roc turned six years old last week while we were in South Carolina.\u00a0 We celebrated with Nonna, Nonno, Auntie Andrea, and his cousins.\u00a0 He wanted a batman party, a castle cake, and a street sweeper. A street sweeper? Yes, my boy loves the  street sweeper  that comes through our neighborhood.\u00a0 I searched the internet and found a Tonka street sweeper that looked like it might fit the Roc\u2019s desire, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure until one night I was comparing the Tonka to a Kmart version when the Roc walked up behind me (such stealthy quiet feet!) and asked \u201cWhat is that Mommy?\u00a0 What kind of truck is that?\u201d\u00a0 When I told him it was a toy street sweeper he said he wanted it. Done. How often does the Roc ask for a toy?\u00a0 Almost never.\u00a0 During the last week of summer school I found one at Toys R Us and excitedly wrapped it that night.\u00a0 I wondered how the Roc would react when he opened it. He was pretty excited and seemed a little shocked!\u00a0 He got to playing with it right away. Awhile later GC looked at me and said \u201cHe\u2019s really playing right now.\u00a0 Do you see that?\u00a0 He\u2019s  playing .\u00a0 Appropriately.\u00a0 With a  toy .\u201d Yup, we\u2019re starting to see a bit more of that lately.\u00a0 Play.

{"date": "May 19, 2010", "body": "The Roc has been sick, his throwing up while riding the bus to school on Monday morning was just a precursor to the breathing issues and high fever that were coming.\u00a0 It\u2019s Wednesday and he\u2019s home from school again today and I\u2019m tired.\u00a0 Now I am physically tired as well as mentally exhausted.\u00a0 I \u201cslept\u201d in the Roc\u2019s bed again last night, administering nebulizer treatments every couple hours, taking his temperature, lightly rubbing the broiling skin on his arms and belly, laying awake watching the fast rate of his shallow breath, and all the while debating whether to make a trip up to the ER.\u00a0 I was completely wide awake from 1 am \u2013 3 am, and then at 3:30 am I brushed my teeth, got dressed and threw my contacts into the overnight bag I had packed for the hospital, only to have the Roc plead with me to go to sleep.\u00a0 I waffled and decided to do another treatment and keep my vigil.\u00a0 I was up all night. But not only was I up because I was worried about the Roc\u2019s breathing, I was up because my \u201canxiety induced insomnia\u201d is kicking in.\u00a0 Yesterday I got an email from the school\u2019s special ed coordinator confirming the date and time for the Roc\u2019s school placement meeting.\u00a0 It is next Thursday.\u00a0 They all know already that I want the Roc to repeat kindergarten.\u00a0 His birthday is in August, so he essentially entered kindergarten this year a few weeks after turning 5.\u00a0 All year long as his classmates have been turning 6, my boy is still 5.\u00a0 So he\u2019s young, and he\u2019s a male \u2013 notoriously immature in comparison to girls of the same age, and every year when he is tested by his developmental pediatrician he is 12 \u2013 18 months behind his peers.\u00a0 So this year I sent a chronologically 5 year old to kindergarten, but the reality is that I sent a barely 4 year old to school if you look at his development.\u00a0 And then add Autism and all it\u2019s complications \u2013 receptive and expressive language issues, social skills, play skills, sensory issues, etc. to the mix and I see gobs of reasons holding him back at this early stage in his schooling will do the most good for him.\u00a0 Luckily when I spoke to the special ed coordinator on the phone a few weeks ago she made it seem as if having the Roc retained in kindergarten wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but I see another potential problem that has me making mental lists in my head in the night and running for my computer to document it all as soon as the sun comes up in the morning. I emailed the special ed coordinator asking who would be invited to the placement meeting and I was  surprised when she responded that the special ed coordinator of the  Roc\u2019s feeder pattern school will be coming.\u00a0 That is the school he was supposed to go this year, the school that when I viewed the 2 inclusion rooms that share a special ed teacher and para last year I didn\u2019t think would fit the Roc.\u00a0 Not enough help.\u00a0 Instead we choose the classroom set up he is currently in \u2013 25 students total, 5 with some sort of need, a full time teacher, a full time special ed teacher, and a full time para all in that same room.\u00a0 A ratio of 5 needy students to 2 adults.\u00a0 Very good odds in my opinion.\u00a0 The Roc has done well in this classroom this year and in retaining him I want the same kind of set up again next year.\u00a0 I think his success is in direct relation to the amount of available help in the room.\u00a0 There are 2 kindergarten rooms in the district with this low needy student/adult ratio and I want the Roc to be placed in the second classroom next year.\u00a0 I already know that because the special ed coordinator from the feeder pattern school is invited to the meeting the district is planning on recommending the \u201cless help\u201d inclusion room, which they call \u201cfull inclusion.\u201d\u00a0 I am guessing that they are going to justify it by saying that the Roc is too dependent on adults and needs to learn more independence and it will be his second time around being presented with kindergarten material. So I am stressed and not sleeping.\u00a0 Stressed to realize that I will probably have to plead the Roc\u2019s case for the more supported inclusion room.\u00a0 Stressed by the stress.\u00a0 Incredulous that I feel this way again, thinking that there are always going to be times during the year that I will lay awake at night pondering these decisions and worrying that I\u2019m making the wrong choice, damaging him somehow. Then of course I am second guessing myself, wondering if the Roc would actually excel in the \u201cfull inclusion\u201d room.\u00a0 If he would become more independent the second time around if there wasn\u2019t the immediate availability of someone to help him.\u00a0 If he would try harder to work things out for himself.\u00a0 If he would learn to ask for help.\u00a0 If it would be better to be around some kids that he would see again in first grade and beyond.\u00a0 If there would actually be enough help because he has seen the kindergarten material before and it wouldn\u2019t actually get hard for him until half way through the year when they start to focus on writing and beginning reading skills. I am torn. I am stressed. These decisions are hard. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/my-insomnia-begins/", "title": "My Insomnia Begins"},

He kept asking me what the music was and I told him to ask the waitress, and he did, but she didn\u2019t know saying she could speak the language but when they started singing she couldn\u2019t keep up!\u00a0 After lunch we headed over to the gardens.\u00a0 And it was bliss.\u00a0 Perfect weather, only the retired and a few with very small children, wonderful for the Roc.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s about the flowers, but it\u2019s all about the fountains for him. We found a dragon in a tree house, and stopped to drink out of every water fountain we saw, which makes the Roc oh so happy. After a second visit to a waterfall, and some more time gazing at the Italian water garden, we headed into the conservatory where I bored the Roc by taking pictures of orchids before letting him loose in the childrens garden. It was the perfect way to wrap up our long three days and his smile says it all. Now I need to go clean my house, my in-laws are coming this weekend!\u00a0 If the weather is nice the Roc and I are planning on taking Nonna to see Longwood Gardens, we know she\u2019ll love it as much as we do. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0802.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0803.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_08071.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0809.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0842.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0870.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0848_2.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0860.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0866.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0814.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0871.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0904.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0903.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0908.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0885.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0898.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0880.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0883.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0919.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0807.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/busy-bee/", "title": "Busy Bee"},
{"date": "May 31, 2010", "body": "May has been crazy busy, lots of things have happened, and I intend to write about them soon.\u00a0 I just haven\u2019t had the time or mental energy.\u00a0 But yesterday was so fun, I just have to share a little about our day.\u00a0 We were invited to our friends Tom and Carrie\u2019s house for an afternoon barbecue/pool party and the Roc was looking forward to it, we all were.\u00a0 We had stopped by their house the day before to chat and let the dogs play for a few minutes so the Roc knew exactly where we were going and he had seen their pool, so he was excited.\u00a0 We warned him that there would probably be other people coming and possibly a few kids coming to swim too.\u00a0 We never really know how things are going to go when we take him somewhere unfamiliar where he could encounter strangers, but we were relaxed knowing that we would be with friends and we weren\u2019t far from home, so if things didn\u2019t go well, we\u2019d just come back and hit the nearby pool which opened on Saturday.\u00a0 When we arrived the Roc couldn\u2019t wait to get into their pool, we decided to see if Guinness could swim, and Carrie gave Gonzo a turn in the pool, which made Tom smile. GC and I took turns with the Roc in the pool. Even water play is rougher with Daddy. GC took Guinness swimming too. But what Guinness really enjoyed yesterday was playing with Gonzo. Ladderball was played throughout the afternoon/evening and GC promptly declared that we need to buy the game for our house, and to bring to SC this summer to play with his father and brothers. The Roc even got a chance to try ladderball. But the Roc\u2019s favorite thing is the pool, and he would swim for awhile, get out and eat, and then go and swim some more.\u00a0 He even got Tom to go swim with him as he didn\u2019t want to \u201cswim alone,\u201d and neither GC nor I would get in the pool at that moment.\u00a0 I was surprised that he went without us, but he knows Tom and the pull of water is just too great!\u00a0 I sat at the table talking with GC, Megan, and Carrie before I realized what a big moment it was that he went willingly with someone other than his parents, so I had to take some pictures to document.\u00a0 They were racing, and he was in heaven. We stayed until after the sun went down and the Roc convinced his dad to go \u201cnight swimming,\u201d only coming back when the bugs started to bite.\u00a0 We decided it was time to leave and were surprised to see just how late it was, after 9:30 pm.\u00a0 The Roc did awesome all day.\u00a0 At one point I had been talking to Carrie and Tom\u2019s friend Megan about the Roc\u2019s autism and she commented on how well he seemed to be doing, herself having a friend with a 4 year old with autism, and again I realized how far the Roc has come.\u00a0 Even a year ago the day wouldn\u2019t have gone like it did.\u00a0 My heart swelled as I watched him swimming in the pool with Tom.\u00a0 He was having so much fun.\u00a0 It was a great day, the perfect way to end this crazy month of May. *** I woke up this morning and got online to check my email and saw this note GC sent Tom & Carrie when we got home: Hey Guys, Just wanted to extend a big thank you for inviting us to your place for the BBQ. \u00a0It\u2019s really nice to have friends like you guys that are so accommodating to the Roc. \u00a0He really felt comfortable at your place today and had a great time :)\u00a0 Thanks again guys. \u00a0Oh and I\u2019m sure the Roc is gonna want to come back soon!\u00a0 GC and Tom\u2019s reply: The Roc is always welcome to beat my ass in swimming races\u2026. \u00a0:-)\u00a0 We had such a great time and it\u2019s because of you guys. We love you guys. and I smiled in appreciation of good friends.\u00a0 How lucky we are to have good friends here who celebrate the Roc with us. Thanks Tom & Carrie! We\u2019re looking forward to your wedding in October!

{"date": "May 17, 2010", "body": "May has been a hectic month so far, and I just haven\u2019t had the chance to write it all down.\u00a0 Oh well.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a bit of a recap: My in-laws made the long drive up from South Carolina two weekends ago to visit, and help with a big project \u2013 fencing in our teeny, tiny yard.\u00a0 It took my father-in-law and GC three full days to completely install it, but it\u2019s in!\u00a0 They really did a great job and now we can play with the pupper outside and he won\u2019t be able to run away, and I can keep those pesky teenagers from cutting through my yard.\u00a0 Double score. While the guys were busy in the backyard cursing the wind I took my mother-in-law and the Roc up to the Thai food restaurant for lunch, and then to Longwood Gardens.\u00a0 She loved it, and so did the Roc. Except when the Roc got tired of my camera constantly being pointed in his direction. He isn\u2019t able to stay mad for too long. During the week that my in-laws were here they got to spend a lot of time with the Roc.\u00a0 Nonno played basketball, the Roc called Nonna up when he was taking a bath and conned her to sit in the bathroom with him, they both went to see the Roc\u2019s swimming lesson, and they were even here for a momentous event \u2013 the loss of the first tooth! The Roc was funny when it came out.\u00a0 I thought he would be upset, maybe even throw a mini tantrum at the big change in how his mouth felt, but he took it all in stride.\u00a0 His tooth had been loose for a while and he had been complaining for a couple days, saying that it hurt.\u00a0 While eating a muffin after dinner one night he said \u201cOUCH!\u201d and we could all see that the tooth was hanging by a thread.\u00a0 The Roc reached in and pulled it out!\u00a0 We all cheered and I grabbed my camera.\u00a0 We put the tooth in a bag, put it under his pillow, and then he forgot all about it.\u00a0 The next morning I went up to his room and reminded him to look under his pillow! He was pretty excited to find the money and he told his teacher that the fairy left him a dollar, when in fact it was a $5.\u00a0 We are definitely leaving $1 for all subsequent teeth! We didn\u2019t have the greatest weather last week but we were lucky that it was decent on the night of the Roc\u2019s baseball game, I had really wanted my in-laws to see the Roc play and I knew he would enjoy having them cheer him on.\u00a0 I was right, he smiled so big when he went up to bat and kept looking over at them sitting on the bleachers. And I got the official baseball pics \u2013 they turned out awesome! Nonna and Nonno left on Saturday morning and we spent the rest of the day in the yard.\u00a0 I planted seeds in our new little herb garden and I planted my tomatoes. I went to bed early on Saturday night, but I tossed and turned, too keyed up to sleep.\u00a0 I woke up right before my alarm went off at 4:45 am and got ready to meet my friend Tracy, who lives two doors down.\u00a0 It was race day.\u00a0 My first half marathon.\u00a0 On the drive up I wished that I had trained a little harder, done some intervals and added weight lifting to my routine of just running.\u00a0 It was too late now and I just vowed to finish the race running.\u00a0 And I did! We had perfect weather for the race, cool and cloudy for the start.\u00a0 My training partner Kelly and I ran the whole race together, talking a bit and keeping each other motivated.\u00a0 As we rounded the final corner and saw the finish shoot we clasped hands and sprinted across the finish line.\u00a0 I\u2019ll remember that forever, my first half marathon, completed with a good friend. I woke up this morning with sore quads and was looking forward to a day of rest.\u00a0 Not only physically, but mentally.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been feeling mentally/emotionally exhausted lately.\u00a0 The Roc has been going through a phase lately, oh please \u2013 let it be a phase, and I\u2019m so worn out.\u00a0 I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned my \u201cday of rest\u201d to the girls while we were out celebrating our race (where I found a new favorite drink: THE DOUBLE BLACK DIAMOND.\u00a0 Fresh pineapple and SKYY Infusions All Natural Pineapple  Vodka. Garnished with a sweet pineapple slice.\u00a0 YUM!) last night because as soon as the Roc got to school, the school called me \u2013 he threw up on the bus and then again while walking into school.\u00a0 I abandoned my resting plans and went to pick up him.\u00a0 He was in good spirits and spent the rest of the day following me around, except for the 1+ hour he sat on the couch watching a movie, with a barf bowl nearby. He never did use it.\u00a0 But he did lose another tooth! So now I must go put $1 under his pillow. And then try to rest my brain.\u00a0 The Roc will be home again tomorrow, he has to be barf free for 24 hours and technically he barfed at school today\u2026sigh.

{"date": "October 15, 2010", "body": "The Roc had a field trip today to an apple orchard, complete with a hayride.\u00a0 I did not sign up to chaperon this field trip as the Roc tends to act much different when I am present at school functions.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t worry about him though, he has been very good about regulating his behavior at school, and his teacher does an excellent job handling him, but I did wonder about him during the day.\u00a0 I wondered how he was doing, if he was having a good time, if I should have prepped him with a social story, and if he behaved himself during the hayride \u2013 the part he was most looking forward to, and I felt a little pang of regret that I didn\u2019t sign up to tag along.\u00a0 But again I reminded myself that my presence is not always needed, and in fact, seems to unsettle him when I show up at school, and I wanted him to fully enjoy this field trip. Of course when he got home I asked him about his day.\u00a0 If he went on a field trip \u2013 yes.\u00a0 If he went on a hayride \u2013 yes.\u00a0 If he had fun \u2013 yes.\u00a0 If he picked an apple \u2013 yes.\u00a0 If he saw any animals \u2013 yes.\u00a0 Then he volunteered that the hayride was his favorite part and asked if we could go play upstairs.\u00a0 I knew that our \u201cconversation\u201d about the field trip was over.\u00a0 I thought that would be all I would ever know about the special day, but then I got an email from his teacher, Look at how cute this picture is!!!\u00a0 He was soooo happy and excited all day!\u00a0 He said on the walk to the hayride\u00a0 \u201cI can hardly wait!\u201d\u00a0 He did so well, didn\u2019t seem nervous or anxious one bit!!! complete with a picture of the Roc enjoying the hayride.

{"date": "October 19, 2010", "body": "It\u2019s no secret, the Roc loves water, and he especially loves waterfalls.\u00a0 Many months ago GC showed the Roc some waterfall videos on You Tube.\u00a0 One of those videos became a favorite and was requested over and over and over again.\u00a0 It was a 10 minute video of Ricketts Glen State Park in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 It mesmerized the Roc, completely. So we decided to go visit. The Roc was soooo excited when we got out of the car on Saturday morning.\u00a0 He was literally bouncing up and down, manically grinning, and repetitively repeating \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u00a0 Let\u2019s go mommy!\u00a0 Hurry up!\u201d\u00a0 As soon as we got on the trail he lead us off the path right to the water, and we were still over a mile away from the first waterfall!\u00a0 He was all smiles, so happy to be outside. We didn\u2019t rush and let the Roc stop at each and every waterfall for as long as he wanted. We hiked up one side of the Falls Trail and back down the same side, deciding not to risk the whole loop in one day, and when we got back down to the bottom the Roc insisted on throwing rocks into the stream.\u00a0 There\u2019s just something about little boys and rocks. That night we stayed at a Residence Inn and while GC made dinner in the teeny, tiny kitchen, the Roc made a waterfall on the couch. The Roc has stayed in cabins in northern Minnesota, but this was his very first hotel experience.\u00a0 We decided not to tell him there was pool there (or we\u2019d hear about it all day) until we were ready to go swimming.\u00a0 So while I was washing the dishes, GC had the Roc go look out the window where you could see a little bit of the indoor pool below us.\u00a0 His expression was priceless as he realized what he was looking at.\u00a0 He had a great time swimming in the (cold) pool, and he even sat in the hot tub with me for a little bit. We decided to hike up the other side of the Falls Trail on Sunday.\u00a0 It proved to be just as beautiful, but much steeper, see the trail there right next to the waterfall? It was just a little bit nerve wrecking to hike this with the Roc!\u00a0 We stayed glued to his side during each ascent. We hiked to the 96 foot waterfall, but the Roc wouldn\u2019t get any closer for a photo so I took his place. After hiking up, up, up we found a great place to stop for lunch. The scenery was beautiful, and when we got to the top of the Falls Trail we decided to hike across the Highland Trail and go back down the side we climbed the day before.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t imagine hiking down the waterfalls we\u2019d just climbed up with the Roc. The Roc thoroughly enjoyed himself at Ricketts Glen.\u00a0 We hiked around 5 miles on Saturday and just over 7 on Sunday, and the Roc really hung in there, only really showing how worn out he was about a mile out from the car on Sunday afternoon.\u00a0 It was a great weekend, one we will not forget.

{"date": "October 25, 2010", "body": "Saturday was a super busy day for the Roc, and it turned out to be a super day period.\u00a0 He played soccer in the morning with the  TOPS soccer  team here in our town and had a great time.\u00a0 He has been excited for soccer every Saturday ever since the season started on September 11, but in the past couple weeks he has seemed a bit more comfortable.\u00a0 The 1 hour time slot they have is broken into little field drills where they kick the ball around cones, through hoops, to each other, and into the goal, followed by a game (which is more like an organized version of chaos, but funny to watch.)\u00a0 The Roc has always liked the drills, the game part has been another story.\u00a0 Too many people on the field, (each child has a buddy \u2013 which amounts to lots of people of many sizes running around, all after one little ball, on a kiddie soccer field) too much movement, too much noise, too much pressure for the Roc.\u00a0 Usually I can see him start to get squirrely and then start playing with GC\u2019s hands when it was time to start the \u201cgame,\u201d a sure sign of sensory overload.\u00a0 So during the game portion the Roc would hang back and watch, but over the last couple weeks GC has encouraged him to run with the pack, even if he wouldn\u2019t get close to the ball.\u00a0 Then on Saturday during the game he kicked the ball hard and straight, the grin on his face splitting the sun, and my heart swelled for him.\u00a0 He was so proud of himself.\u00a0 When they were done the soccer pictures were handed out. Just like Challenger baseball, I love watching all the kids on the TOPS soccer team play and have fun, because that\u2019s what it should be about.\u00a0 Every child is cheered on, every child is encouraged to try and is given the time and space to do so.\u00a0 I love the atmosphere, where a child throwing a tantrum, laying on the grass kicking and screaming, isn\u2019t cause for embarrassment or criticism, just smiles of understanding, as we\u2019ve all been there.\u00a0 No judgment.\u00a0 How often do you have the chance to surround yourself with people who are not judging you or your child for your parenting skills or their behavior.\u00a0 It\u2019s a safe place, and sometimes that feels so rare. After soccer GC and the Roc had plans for their first father \u2013 son fishing outing to Lums Pond State Park, an anticipated event for all three of us.\u00a0 GC and the Roc headed over to Wal-Mart for some fishing supplies, I made the Roc\u2019s lunch, and then left for a long run (in the wind.)\u00a0 When I came back they were gone and I was able to relax in the house on a sunny Saturday afternoon, it was a much needed break for me, and some good quality time for GC and the Roc.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t catch any fish, but they had fun.\u00a0 GC said the Roc did great, loved walking around to different fishing locations, and he wasn\u2019t upset that they didn\u2019t catch any fish. When the Roc busted through the front door upon his return home he was breathless with excitement.\u00a0 I thought he was going to tell me about fishing, instead he announced \u201cWe\u2019re going to play basketball!!\u00a0 Will you come Mommy?!!!\u201d\u00a0 For many months now the Roc has been playing basketball with the Fischer-Price plastic hoop in our family room and he\u2019s gotten pretty good!\u00a0 GC decided it was time to take him over to the actual basketball court and let him try on the  real  basketball hoop.\u00a0 I was a little worried, thinking the Roc would get really frustrated and we would have a huge screaming meltdown\u2026but nothing ever goes like you think it will, including when you assume the worst. The Roc loved it, and he was good too! (That one totally went in.\u00a0 Actually he made more shots than GC!) There were a few moments of frustration, but GC talked him through it. I actually tried a few times, and missed most of\u00a0 my shots. So I spent most of my time watching and taking pictures.\u00a0 Guinness watched with me. GC\u00a0 missed most of his shots too, saying that it figures that the one (and possibly only) sport that he knows nothing about the Roc LOVES.\u00a0 He did make this shot though. Impressive, eh? After basketball we took the boy and the dog to the dog park.\u00a0 It was packed and Guinness ran around like a maniac and even made friends with a Great Dane.\u00a0 The Roc usually lasts about 5 minutes before he starts asking to walk over the bridge (which is actually a fishing dock) so GC took him and the fishing stuff over to the dock while I stayed back with Guinness.\u00a0 He ran and ran and ran.\u00a0 When I walked over to the dock GC told me they had caught one fish, and not long after they caught another! By the end of the evening the Roc was wiped out, but he had a great day! It was a super Saturday!

Also on our fridge is a list of the rules, a list of good behaviors, and his daily behavior chart that we just started today, complete with three stars and 1 X \u2013 a pretty good morning at the Roc\u2019s house.\u00a0 The bus will be spluttering down the road in a few minutes to deliver him back home, and I\u2019m hopeful that there will be more stars than X\u2019s at the end of the day.

{"date": "October 20, 2010", "body": "For all the positive posts I\u2019ve written lately I have just as many, more in fact, of the negative variety (though unwritten\u2026until now.)\u00a0 Lately I feel I am in over my head with this child.\u00a0 The waves are crashing over me, water has rushed up my nose, and I\u2019m struggling to get some air.\u00a0 The behavior, oh the behavior.\u00a0 We are struggling with the Roc.\u00a0 We have been struggling with the Roc for some time. When I went on a trip in September with my good friend Christa we talked about discipline.\u00a0 Her son P is the same age as the Roc, he also has autism, and she can give him \u201cthe look.\u201d\u00a0 You know \u201cthe look\u201d some parents can give their children when they are doing something wrong, and they stop immediately.\u00a0 \u201cThe look\u201d does not work with the Roc.\u00a0 Christa told me how they went through a period of time which she referred to as \u201cbringing down the hammer.\u201d\u00a0 Every time P broke the rules he went to his room, no threats and no bribes.\u00a0 She said that it wasn\u2019t pretty and he would tantrum for long periods of time while in his room.\u00a0 They had to remove almost everything from his room to keep him and his things safe.\u00a0 When they were out in public and he started up they would leave, when they got home they would tell him that he would be losing a certain privilege which would cause him to tantrum and be sent to his room, but at least they were in the safety of their home.\u00a0 Over time (she guessed about 4 months) he started to change and was having to go to his room less and less.\u00a0 And now they have a child who, for the most part, listens to his parents. I do not. Lately the Roc has been so demanding, everything has been such a big deal, or I should say that the littlest of things are the biggest deal.\u00a0 He is bossy and tries to control everyone and every situation in the house.\u00a0 Strange stuff is popping up lately like his sudden issue with all things circular.\u00a0 Container lids have to be hidden, he doesn\u2019t like to see the lids of our pots, he now refuses to eat off the blue plates because they have an indented circle inside, he doesn\u2019t like my camera because the lens is circular.\u00a0 It\u2019s maddening.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\u00a0 I feel as though I have no control over this child, and the reality is that  I don\u2019t. I have no control over my child.  What is this going to look like in 2 years?\u00a0 4 years?\u00a0 The teenage years?\u00a0 GAH.\u00a0 Something has to change.\u00a0 I need to get the upper hand here. We\u2019ve been trying the no threats/no bribes, go to your room whenever you break a rule tactic, and it had an effect at first.\u00a0 He was shocked that we didn\u2019t give any warnings, he flailed and thrashed and screamed away in his almost empty room, but then things changed.\u00a0 He usually gets upset the first time he has to go to his room and then the rest of the day it becomes a game.\u00a0 He runs away from us laughing when we say go to your room, he quiets down immediately as soon as we put him there, he doesn\u2019t really seem to mind anymore, and it feels like he is playing us again.\u00a0 Or maybe he is just outlasting us. He does tend to outlast us.\u00a0 We had an awesome time hiking in Pennsylvania last weekend.\u00a0 For the most part the Roc did well.\u00a0 He had his moments though, and they were not fun, for any of us.\u00a0 On the ride home he broke apart because GC didn\u2019t answer a question the right way.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t say certain words in a certain order.\u00a0 The Roc SCREAMED for at least 20 minutes.\u00a0 20 minutes of screaming about what Daddy should have said while driving down the Blue Route, through construction, with lots of traffic.\u00a0 My ears hurt just writing about the length of screaming and remembering how ear piercing it was.\u00a0 We tried to ignore him, we lasted for a long while, but we were tired and hungry and so sick of dealing with these wild swings in behavior that we snapped.\u00a0 He out screamed us, and we both screamed back.\u00a0 Our ropes snapped. Yesterday morning I had a similar experience and didn\u2019t handle myself as best I could.\u00a0 The Roc and I were playing upstairs together and when it was time to go get ready for the bus all hell broke loose.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t go down the stairs at the appropriate pace while holding his hand, and he went berserk, screaming for me to try again.\u00a0 He wasted all his morning exercise time screaming at me to go back up the stairs.\u00a0 I turned on the silent treatment, ignored him and wouldn\u2019t engage in a fight, trying to see if that would make him calm down.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t.\u00a0 He escalated to roughing up the chairs, throwing things off the table, throwing things towards me, swatting at me, spitting, and then spitting at me.\u00a0 As I felt the spittle hit my face I lost it.\u00a0 I clapped my hand over his mouth and with the devil in my voice I told him that he would \u201cNEVER DO THAT AGAIN!\u201d\u00a0 He kept screaming and thrashing around the entry way.\u00a0 We went outside to wait for the bus, he started running away laughing so I turned to go back in the house causing him to screech for me to stay outside.\u00a0 We waited in the doorway and as soon as the bus came I pulled him out and down to the curb, where he lost it.\u00a0 Screaming and crying saying he didn\u2019t want the bus to be there, he wasn\u2019t going to get on, he wasn\u2019t going to make a good choice (I\u2019ve been talking a lot about choices lately.)\u00a0 I tilted his face upwards, leaned down, and said that he would never, ever, ever behave that way again.\u00a0 That he would never hit me, he would never, ever spit at me, or behave so disrespectfully towards me again.\u00a0 He was so visibly upset.\u00a0 I was shaking with exhaustion and anger and it wasn\u2019t even 9 am.\u00a0 We walked toward the bus and he started to ramp up again.\u00a0 I stopped him at the bottom of the stairs and asked him if he wanted to tell the bus driver about his morning, about how he behaved.\u00a0 He looked afraid and the bus driver looked at me like I was crazy and a horrible mother.\u00a0 As my blood boiled in my veins I felt like the worst mother. Which I feel on so many occasions throughout each and every day.\u00a0 What am I doing wrong?\u00a0 How do I discipline this child?\u00a0 I talked to the Roc\u2019s doctor on Monday morning (while the Roc bounced around the room, swinging his arms, throwing his jacket, pulling on me, snorting in my face \u2013 seriously, he was snorting in my face.\u00a0 Try having a coherent conversation while all of that is going on.) and she did suggest trying to find a behavioral therapist and also referred me to a neurologist that she really likes, she said he has wonderful bedside manner \u2013 how often do you get that in a doctor? I also talked to a mother of a 10 year old with autism at soccer two weekends ago.\u00a0 She and her husband said that it took a lot of time and patience on their part, that they really just repeated everything over and over and over again, literally drilling the rules into their son.\u00a0 She said they talked a lot of things through with him, validating his feelings and giving him alternatives to his outbursts, and over time they could see him shifting, choosing the alternative to blowing up.\u00a0 She also mentioned that they charted his behavior throughout the day so he could see how he was doing, and that if he did well he was able to earn TV time, which was his greatest reward.\u00a0 She suggested I figure out what the Roc\u2019s greatest reward would be and have him work towards that.\u00a0 And right there we are stumped.\u00a0 Because we don\u2019t know how to motivate him.\u00a0 We tried taking toys away, having him work toward a bath, or a special dessert, or an outing, but nothing seemed to really have an impact. So please, tell me, how in the world do you discipline your child with autism?\u00a0 What do you do when they talk back, get aggressive, flip out over nonsense, scream at you, kick at the dog, spit in your house and then spit at you, are bossy and controlling?\u00a0 How do you motivate them to follow the rules of the house?\u00a0 To respect you?\u00a0 What do you do?\u00a0 Please tell me what do you do? And please, for the love of god, do not tell me try a sticker chart (as I\u2019ve heard on numerous occasions from parents of typical kids, the Roc could care less about earning a STICKER) or suggest that I have him stand in the corner with his nose pressed against the wall (as my neighbor did after a particularly trying day.\u00a0 She could hear the Roc tantruming through our shared wall\u2026sigh.)

{"date": "December 1, 2010", "body": "We\u2019ve been working hard on behavior around here and it\u2019s not easy.\u00a0 Anger and frustration are two emotions the Roc can fly to in half a heartbeat.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve lost a little bit of hearing over the last couple years due to the volume in our house, I often have a quick vision of my grandfather as I wince, and it makes me smile through the ear piercing pain.\u00a0 Once upon a time, when I was a little girl we were visiting my grandparents in Ohio and I remember catching my grandfather suddenly reaching for his hearing aide and turning it down.\u00a0 My rambunctious boy cousins were running and yelling, being boys.\u00a0 As soon as his fingers drifted down we locked eyes and he quickly smiled, his twinkly blue eyes full of mischief (those sparkly blue eyes have been passed on to the Roc.) I covered my mouth and stifled a giggle feeling like grandpa and I were sharing a little secret.\u00a0 Now, years later, and well before I actually need one, I regularly wish for my own hearing aide or some sort of volume control in my home.\u00a0 Ah, the screeching. Lately, the thing my water obsessed boy loves to do is to make \u201cwaterfalls\u201d with blankets, he arranges the blanket to spill over the end of my bed or the couch, and it has to be placed just so\u2026or all hell breaks loose.\u00a0 We have been working on teaching him how to appropriately gain our attention.\u00a0 So often when he screams/shrieks/shrills out his frustrations I either come running or yell that I\u2019ll be right there.\u00a0 Lately we\u2019ve been ignoring him until he uses an inside voice and asks for help, using the magic word, please.\u00a0 While he was attempting to make his \u201cwaterfall\u201d this morning it wasn\u2019t coming out how he wanted it to, and he got upset.\u00a0 After a bit of screaming before asking me nicely to help him he suddenly demanded that I fold the blanket a certain way using what we refer to as the \u201cnasty voice.\u201d\u00a0 I walked away knowing that we were going to have another explosion before he was able to get to the point where he could use his \u201cnice voice\u201d to ask me for help again.\u00a0 He followed me to the kitchen shrieking all the way there and when he failed to get my attention he threw my shoe at me, and it hit me in the back.\u00a0 I was just as shocked by this behavior as I was by the way he hit me yesterday.\u00a0 His behavior has been escalating now that he is not getting our attention immediately like he used to.\u00a0 GC and decided to draw the line at the physical.\u00a0 We used to send him to his room, but that having no effect we are now having him sit on the stairs. I told the Roc to take his place on the stairs and he immediately started sprinting for the top, the opposite of where I told him to sit.\u00a0 I reached out and grabbed his ankle, only wanting to slow him down, but causing him to fall onto his face and scaring him badly.\u00a0 The instant \u201cchild cry\u201d he went into is something I rarely witness.\u00a0 Usually the Roc is frustrated and angry or calm and happy.\u00a0 He almost never cries, really cries.\u00a0 You know, those big crocodile tears and heaving sobs children (and some women..ah hem\u2026me) can produce when truly, truly heart sick sad (usually over something small, but mighty in their minds.)\u00a0 Without thinking I galloped up the stairs and pulled him onto my lap, facing me, and he threw his arms around my neck and jammed his face into my shoulder, and  cried .\u00a0 I held him tight and rocked him back and forth.\u00a0 So rare, those moments are so rare, did I mention that? After some time went by I asked him if he knew why he was sent to sit on the stairs.\u00a0 \u201cBecause I throw\u2019d a shoe at Mommy,\u201d he sniffled while looking sideways, the close proximity to my face too much to bear.\u00a0 When I told him that throwing objects at people was something bad, very bad, and that he could have really hurt me, his face crumpled and he started with \u201cBut!\u201d\u00a0 I cut him off and said, \u201cIt does not matter what your reason is\u2026throwing things at people is never okay.\u201d\u00a0 We went back and forth a few times, me cutting him off at \u201cBut!!\u201d\u00a0 He cried again and told me that he wasn\u2019t going to tell Daddy\u2026and then he leaned back away from my face and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mommy\u2026My angers are really angry,\u201d while touching his chest with both hands.\u00a0 \u201cAre they in here?\u201d I asked pointing to his sternum.\u00a0 \u201cYes\u2026and, and, and there are a lot of them,\u201d he said. Who knew anger could be plural? For once I felt like we were getting somewhere.\u00a0 He has these wild emotions and hasn\u2019t been able to wrangle them in, gain some control over them for so long now.\u00a0 But being able to name that overwhelming feeling he had today is the first step to being able to control himself.\u00a0 It\u2019s baby steps baby, and often as many steps backwards as forwards, but he\u2019s moving, we\u2019re moving along, everyday.

{"date": "October 28, 2010", "body": "I was driving the Roc to horseback riding lessons on Tuesday night, we had the sun roof and windows open, letting the unseasonably warm fall air glide in and around us.\u00a0 The stable is less than 5 miles from our house and we take a \u201cback road\u201d route over a narrow little bridge continuing through fields and farmland to get there.\u00a0 When the Roc was younger, all of our car rides were silent on his end.\u00a0 I talked and talked, pointing things out to him in the hopes that he was listening and that he would one day reciprocate.\u00a0 Over time he has and our car rides are no longer silent. \u201cMommy, is that a forest?\u201d \u201cYes Roc, that\u2019s a forest, isn\u2019t it pretty?\u00a0 All the leaves are changing colors,\u201d I say trying to expand his thinking and shift our conversation away from what I know is inevitably coming, talk about deer.\u00a0 Over a year ago we were driving through a hilly forest up north and a deer ran out in front of our car as we rounded a curve, GC slammed on the brakes and we narrowly missed taking the deer out.\u00a0 Ever since then the Roc has a running script of questions regarding deer.\u00a0 Where they live \u2013 in the forest, when they come out \u2013 at night, where they are going \u2013 to look for food, etc.\u00a0 I answer them dutifully each time they are asked, but I do admit to growing tired of the same question and answer game.\u00a0 Even though I tried to get him to notice and comment on the fall leaves he asks, \u201cAre there deer in that forest Mommy?\u201d \u201cYup, there are,\u201d I answer. \u201cAre there deer on the ground?\u201d \u201cYes, there are deer in the forest Roc,\u201d\u00a0 I say, thinking that maybe my \u201cYup\u201d wasn\u2019t the answer he was looking for. \u201cAnd in the trees too?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo Roc, the deer are on the ground, they don\u2019t go in trees,\u201d\u00a0 I say to him, glancing in the review mirror.\u00a0 Where would he get the idea that deer can climb trees?\u00a0 In all the books we\u2019ve read depicting animals, the deer are never  in  the trees.\u00a0 I wonder what he is thinking.\u00a0 I stifle a giggle while imagining a deer struggling to climb a tree. \u201cYES THEY ARE!\u00a0 They go in the trees!!!\u201d\u00a0 he insists forcefully, and I can sense this rising into an argument I don\u2019t want to have. \u201cNo buddy, how would they climb a tree?\u00a0 They don\u2019t have hands or claws to grab the tree trunk.\u00a0 The deer stay on the ground,\u201d\u00a0 I explain to him. \u201cIn the TRREEEEEEES Mommy,\u201d\u00a0 he shoots back. \u201cNo honey,\u201d\u00a0 I respond. \u201cYES MOMMY!\u201d he yells passionately from the back seat.\u00a0 He is getting squirming in his seat, his face is red with frustration.\u00a0 I wonder why he\u2019s fighting me on this issue and I try to divert his attention, \u201cLook Roc, we\u2019re going over the lake now!\u201d\u00a0 As always, he asks me what lake it is and we are off onto another topic.\u00a0 Later on down the road we go through another forested area and I know what is coming, \u201cMommy, I hope we don\u2019t almost hit a deer,\u201d he says from the back. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen Roc, remember the deer come out at nighttime, when the sun is going down.\u00a0 That\u2019s when they move around the most.\u00a0 Right now the deer are in the trees.\u201d\u00a0  In the trees , oh my gosh!\u00a0 I literally smack myself on the forehead and let out a chuckle.\u00a0 How long have I been saying \u201cthe deer are in the trees\u201d to him?\u00a0 Duh, Kim!\u00a0 Did you forget just how literal this child is? I go on to explain that the what I meant was the deer are on the ground walking around and between the trees, that they don\u2019t go up in the trees.\u00a0 I talk faster than I mean to and I think I might be making him more confused.\u00a0 I sneak a look in the rear view mirror.\u00a0 He is completely blank faced, which I know doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s tuned me out and is not listening, it means he\u2019s processing.\u00a0 I stop talking and let him process.\u00a0 I wonder when we will revisit this particular fact about deer and if it will be added to our running script of deer questions and answers on the way to horseback riding next week. I stifle another giggle as I imagine him all this time imagining that deer can climb into trees, and then I remind myself yet again that I need to watch what I say, in more ways than one!

{"date": "December 9, 2010", "body": "My in-laws were in town last weekend.\u00a0 It was a quick trip for them, up north to visit an old friend who is very ill.\u00a0 Both a hard and happy visit.\u00a0 We were glad to have them for a short period, and the Roc was especially overjoyed.\u00a0 He loves to have visitors almost as much as he loves to travel.\u00a0 We informed him on Thursday of their impending arrival the next day and I reminded him on Friday morning before he went to school.\u00a0 That afternoon I could see him scanning the road for their truck as the school bus rounded the corner near our house, and the first thing he asked me when his feet hit the pavement was where Nonna and Noono were.\u00a0 He literally waited (not patiently) at the window for almost 45 minutes and was a loony toon when they finally arrived, bouncing around, making silly (loud) repetitive noises.\u00a0 So Excited. He had so much fun while they were here.\u00a0 He played upstairs with Nonna and she was impressed at how his play has changed.\u00a0 The last time she saw him in October his play was very repetitive in form and function, two months later she marveled at his ability to switch gears and the new things he was thinking up.\u00a0 She also was very impressed by how much he loves to draw! While they were here we decided to do \u201cearly Christmas\u201d and open our gifts to each other.\u00a0 I was happy to do this because I love to see people\u2019s faces when they open gifts and we usually never get to do this with my in-laws.\u00a0 We surprised the Roc with \u201cearly Christmas\u201d and he was E.X.C.I.T.E.D!! He loves to open gifts, and to see what other people get too! I couldn\u2019t wait for my father-in-law to open his gift.\u00a0 I found it in a little shop in Chesapeake City and as soon as I saw it I thought of him and laughed. It is an apron that says \u201cCook is Crabby\u2026but Cute.\u201d I warned GC that he should stop making faces at me or I would put it on the internet\u2026he didn\u2019t listen!\u00a0 (But at least he smiled!) Then we enjoyed a few yummy Italian pastries! It was a nice unexpected visit. *** I knew the Roc would be disappointed when he got home from school on Monday afternoon, his Nonna and Nonno had left that morning to drive back down to South Carolina, so I asked GC if he wanted to check out the Christmas display at Longwood.\u00a0 I had heard it was something to see and the Roc loves to go places in the dark and see lights.\u00a0 When he found out where we were going he flipped and would hardly eat his dinner.\u00a0 We met GC after work and headed up. Everyone was right.\u00a0 It is something to see! Guess who totally loved it?\u00a0 This kid: His most favorite part?\u00a0 The fountain show we passed right at the end! Of course!

{"date": "December 13, 2010", "body": "Two amazing things happened today, not of equal value, though almost equally exciting for me. I\u2019ll spill the lesser first:\u00a0 I was able to squeeze myself back into my favorite pair of jeans this weekend!\u00a0 Jeans I haven\u2019t worn for 2 years because\u2026I couldn\u2019t get them past my thighs.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t actually wear jeans last winter because I had two pairs I couldn\u2019t wear and refused to buy any more, but I also didn\u2019t do much about fitting back into them either.\u00a0 This fall when jeans weather rolled around and I still couldn\u2019t get my jeans on I broke down and bought a pair of Levis the next size up, and they drove me crazy.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t fit right, sliding down in the back, pulling my undies with them every time I bent down.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t look right either, too much baggage in the front making me look bigger than I really am.\u00a0 I missed my jeans and my body from 2 years ago.\u00a0 So I quietly vowed to myself to try harder.\u00a0 I started running a few times a week and kept going instead of stopping after a couple weeks like I tend to do.\u00a0 I started working out with Jillian Michaels on my days off from running and I have to say that she will kick your ass, she did mine!\u00a0 (Seriously, the 3-$10 DVDs from Wal-mart were money well spent!)\u00a0 I  try  not to eat as much, but I love food and am addicted to chocolate.\u00a0 I still eat, but I\u2019ve lowered my portion sizes, (except for last night when GC made pizza\u2026) we don\u2019t really have junk in the house, and I haven\u2019t been baking \u2013 something I used to do every week.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty pumped about this recent development. The second thing that happened is less vain and probably more exciting to read about. I forgot something big today, but that\u2019s not the amazing part, I forget stuff all the time (just ask GC.)\u00a0 \u201cYikes!\u00a0 Oh Crap!\u00a0 Sh@t!!\u201d\u00a0 is what I thought when my brain woke up this morning.\u00a0 I was groggily standing in my little closet, struggling with my ancient sports bra, pumping myself up about finishing the movie Bride Wars while I ran a 5 miler on my treadmill as soon as the Roc got on the bus\u2026when I remembered that the Roc had a dentist appointment scheduled for 10 am\u2026 Did you catch the fact that I totally forgot about it?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t prep the Roc this weekend.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t talk about his last visit or this upcoming one.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t go over where the dentist is located, what the waiting room looks like, that he would go back without me like he did last time, or discuss the chair.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t go over the steps of the visit or how the hygienist would talk to him and that he should obey her, let her look at his teeth, touch his teeth, and clean his teeth.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t remind him last night about the change in schedule.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t talk about it at all. Oops. I hung my head as my thoughts spun in different directions at how this morning might go.\u00a0 I gathered my clothes (the jeans!) for the day and hopped in the shower, figuring that today would be an errand day and I would not work out as I originally planned.\u00a0 Upon exiting the shower I could hear the Roc getting frustrated with some toy in the loft area upstairs and my stomach knotted thinking about the worst case scenario of our morning with the dentist.\u00a0 I decided to try to spin this change in routine as brightly as possible and hope for the best.\u00a0 \u201cGood morning Roc!\u00a0 Guess what?\u00a0 You can take a bath this morning because Mommy is going to drive you to school late!\u00a0 Guess where you get to go today?!!!\u00a0 The DENTIST!\u00a0 Won\u2019t that be fun!!\u201d\u00a0  (please buy it kid, please!)  The Roc looked at me\u2026and smiled.\u00a0 I moved him along, let him take a bath and didn\u2019t say another word about the dentist until he was eating his breakfast 30 minutes later.\u00a0 I reminded him that his hygienist is really cool, super nice and that she loved to talk with him.\u00a0 I also reminded him of the cool chair that lays back and the fact that there will be a TV on the ceiling and headphones he can wear so he can watch cartoons!\u00a0 \u201cYay!!!\u201d he squealed.\u00a0 I kept the talk shiny and bright and when snow started blowing around outside I knew I would have no trouble getting him to leave the house, \u201cHey Roc, it\u2019s snowing!\u00a0 Do you want to drive through the snow?\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to the dentist!\u201d\u00a0 With that said he was very willing to don his hat, gloves and jacket to get in the car.\u00a0 Whew!\u00a0 I breathed a sigh of relief and geared up for the next steps of our dentist trip.\u00a0 I felt like we were on our way to having a successful morning. It continued when we got to the dentist.\u00a0 I could tell the Roc was a bit anxious when we got in the waiting room as he made his latest repetitive noise (sounds like a hissing cat) a few times.\u00a0 Luckily he was called back immediately so we just had to get his winter gear off and then he went back.\u00a0 I sat in the waiting room half listening to the TV and half listening for any sort of Roc noise from the back.\u00a0 I only heard the TV.\u00a0 In no time the hygienist came to get me, and as we walked back she said \u201cHe did great!\u00a0 We weren\u2019t able to x-ray the back teeth as he didn\u2019t seem to understand exactly what I was asking of him, and I didn\u2019t want to make any part of this experience traumatic for him, so we\u2019ll just try again in 6 months.\u201d\u00a0 Thank goodness for her.\u00a0 When I got to her bay the Roc was laying back in the chair, headphones on, giggling at the TV above him.\u00a0 He stayed that way while we talked (no cavities!) and I got to see him in action when the dentist came in to take a peek at his teeth.\u00a0 He made eye contact, answered the couple questions asked, and then he did as he was told and opened wide so the dentist could check out all of his teeth!\u00a0 He was so good! I was amazed that with no prep, only a few snippets of conversation this morning about the dentist, that he did so well! Then, as I parked the car in front of his school the Roc started to ramp it up in the backseat.\u00a0 I told him to be calm and to use his words when he said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little bit anxious Mommy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what my class is doing right now.\u201d\u00a0 O.M.G.\u00a0 He was able to pull himself down as he was gearing up, identify and then explain what he was feeling and what was upsetting him.\u00a0 I gave him a little play by play of how we were going to get from the car to the office to his classroom and what to expect.\u00a0 Then he said, \u201cAnd my teacher will help me if I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u00a0 !!!\u00a0 Something I say to him all the time!\u00a0 Ask for help and you will get help!\u00a0 He was a bit tentative to enter his classroom but as soon as the special ed teacher told him to unpack his bag and join his friends on the carpet he left my side and started his day.\u00a0 After a quick conversation with the special ed teacher, in which she reiterated how great he is doing, how he is sounding out words himself during writing, I left the room smiling. It was a pretty amazing Monday morning in our corner of the world! (Oh, and the jeans?\u00a0 I forgot to mention that I only wore them for 4 hours today, that I had to peel them off as soon as I got home from dropping the Roc off at school.\u00a0 Large, angry red indentations marked my hips, and my thighs breathed a sigh of relief as they were released from their sausage-like encasing.\u00a0 But hey!\u00a0 I got them ON!\u00a0 They were buttoned!\u00a0 That\u2019s the important part of that story! ) ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/jeans-dentist/", "title": "Jeans + Dentist"},

GC and I cooked and baked, cleaned up the kitchen, played basketball with the Roc, welcomed his high school friend Greg and his sister into our home, ate and laughed, cleaned the kitchen again, ate some more, went to bed full and with a sink full of dirty dishes.\u00a0 Throughout the rest of the weekend I thought about the post I was going to write, the pictures I was going to take, and all the changes that have happened over the last few years, when it hit me.\u00a0 Change. I am so grateful for the changes and the richness and depth they have brought to my life. Because autism changed me, it changed GC, it changed us.\u00a0 The Roc is the Roc, has been, always will be.\u00a0 Autism is a part of who he is.\u00a0 But I had never considered it, didn\u2019t know what it was until I was blindsided. I\u2019ve changed, for the better.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had to adjust my vision, but not as much as I first thought.\u00a0 I felt splintered apart by the diagnosis, and slowly, slowly I\u2019m finding out that I have not actually shattered, I\u2019m much stronger than I thought.\u00a0 I\u2019m tough, I\u2019ve had to be.\u00a0 I fought through the early trauma, the beginnings of finding my feet, gaining the tools and my voice.\u00a0 I found a good friend, made a couple more as time went by, let go of those who did not care enough to care, knowing that was okay to.\u00a0 I fought through horrid tantrums, sighs and disapproving looks from strangers, the anxiety, the fear, the depression.\u00a0 Learned to say \u201cNo\u201d and when to say \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0 Learned to advocate, to question, nudge and push.\u00a0 Learned to truly cherish what is important in life and let go of the rest.\u00a0 I am a different kind of mother than I envisioned as I held newborn Roc 6+ years ago. For all of that I am grateful. GC and I have changed together.\u00a0 We are unified in our desire to help the Roc thrive and achieve, as many parents are, but our focus has solely shifted from what many other parents view as achievement.\u00a0 We work hard and we celebrate the little things.\u00a0 We are the only ones who truly see how far the Roc has come and we are the ones to help him go further.\u00a0 Our job is harder than most and we\u2019re doing it together.\u00a0 There is no way we could have ever become this close without the struggle we have pushed through.\u00a0 After a disastrous exit from a gathering of friends in New Jersey on Saturday we held hands while the Roc tantrumed it out in the backseat for the first 25+ minutes of our hour long drive back home.\u00a0 United in the fight to teach appropriate behavior/modify the ugly I squeezed his hand.\u00a0 We have changed.\u00a0 From the man who said he would never move to Minnesota, he\u2019s stoked about it now (and hopes to acquire the accent.)\u00a0 He has changed.\u00a0 I am a lucky girl. For him I am grateful.\u00a0 For us I am grateful. The Roc.\u00a0 Oh, the Roc!\u00a0 The changes in the Roc continue to amaze me.\u00a0 My boy who would shriek and scream before original speech can now tell me what he wants and needs, and more!\u00a0 He asks questions!\u00a0 We have little conversations!\u00a0 He PLAYS!\u00a0 I\u2019ve waited so long for him to play for even just a little while, and just recently he started.\u00a0 He will build things out of blocks upstairs, play with his construction vehicles, make a mess!\u00a0 Finally he likes to draw!\u00a0 He gave up his bath again last night so he could continue drawing.\u00a0 A huge change for my routine entrenched, water obsessed boy.\u00a0 He is a marvel, he works hard every day and he is changing all the time.\u00a0 He amazes me. I am so eternally grateful for him. We have big changes planned for our future.\u00a0 A move to be near my family.\u00a0 Changes that will be hard, hard to leave the only home the Roc has ever had, the safety of what is known and the few truly good friends we\u2019ve made here.\u00a0 Changes that will be so good, to be near family who unconditionally love us, all three of us, and want to be a part of our lives.\u00a0 Friends I\u2019ve had for 15+ years who are ready with open arms.\u00a0 We will roll with the changes, plan and prep, and do what needs to be done. And I am so grateful. Change is good. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/the-grateful-post/", "title": "The Grateful Post"},

{"date": "November 8, 2010", "body": "Alternatively titled, The Crazy Maker, or Roid Rage\u2026 So I totally jinxed myself, or the Roc to be more exact, when I wrote about avoiding the hospital in my last post\u2026sigh.\u00a0 The Roc started to sniffle and cough on Thursday and I dutifully started up the \u201cfog machine\u201d that night and again in the morning before school.\u00a0 Even though he got a breathing treatment at school on Friday and more when he got home it wasn\u2019t enough, and by the time I was placing dinner on table that night I knew that we were headed to either Urgent Care or the Emergency Room.\u00a0 GC and I agreed that at the late hour the staff at Urgent Care was most likely going to send us up the road to the children\u2019s hospital, so we might as well save the time and at least one co-pay (too bad it was the cheaper one) and go straight to the ER. We knew what to expect and after an initial exam in triage and a big dose of steroids the Roc was taken back and given more breathing treatments.\u00a0 We spent about 5 hours at the hospital, watched 2 kid movies, (how cool that they had some on demand movies in the room) and listened the the Roc chatter on and on.\u00a0 The steroids really jack him up and he talked and sang and talked and sang at the top of his lungs throughout our ER visit.\u00a0 GC pointed out how the Rocs hands were shaking as he held a cup of juice and said, \u201d oh boy, here we go,\u201d with a look of fear in his eye.\u00a0 We knew what was coming, and it wasn\u2019t going to be pretty.\u00a0 We were in for a looooonnnng weekend\u2026 and some truly monstrous behavior.\u00a0 The screams of anger and frustration filled our house in short intervals on repeat throughout the day on Saturday.\u00a0 \u201cNo!!!!\u2019\u00a0 \u201cI want it the way I want  IT! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t  dO IT! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt won\u2019t  WORK!! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cThis isn\u2019t  RIGHT!! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m trying to make a  BRIDGE! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cThis train won\u2019t  GO!! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t like that  SHOW! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t  WANT  to do a breathing treatment!!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI won\u2019t  WEAR  those  PANTS! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t have to go to the  BATHROOM!! \u201d\u00a0 \u201cARGH!!!!!!!!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cCome  HERE  Mommy!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cCome  HERE  Daddy!!!\u201d\u00a0 \u201c NOW , I want it  NOW!! \u201d\u00a0 \u201c NO , I\u2019m  NOT  going to take my  MEDICINE!! \u201d\u00a0 GC and I looked at each and kept the mantra of \u201cit\u2019s the medicine, it\u2019s not him\u201d going for the better part of the day, until I lost my cool during bedtime. I went to bed with a stomach filled with dread on Saturday night.\u00a0 Sunday was  the party .\u00a0 The party the Roc had been looking forward to and talking about everyday since the invitation arrived 20+ days earlier.\u00a0 The party at an indoor bouncy place, just the wrong thing for a boy with breathing issues \u2013 jumping, climbing, jumping, running, jumping, sliding, jumping, jumping, jumping.\u00a0 How were we going to break it to him that because of his difficulty breathing he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t risk him relapsing and going  back  to the hospital while he was on the road to recovery.\u00a0 He was going to be crushed and extremely disappointed.\u00a0 My insides ached thinking about how hard it was going to be to smash his day, knowing that there was nothing we could offer him in return that would measure up to this party.\u00a0 I laid in bed wondering if he would like to go get a new truck at toys r us, or a book from the bookstore, or to make another castle cake like we did for his birthday\u2026but I knew, just knew that the whole day was going to be shot for having to miss this party.\u00a0 We were already dealing with some horrendous steroid induced behavior, and I sank into sleep worrying about the nightmare behavior that was sure to greet me upon waking. Sunday was much like Saturday, lots of screaming, split second mood swings, immediate frustration, tons of angry outbursts, hitting, spitting, and a few tears shed by both the Roc and me.\u00a0 But interestingly enough, while the Roc was super disappointed about not going to the party, he didn\u2019t have the total freak-out meltdown that I worried was coming.\u00a0 I explained why he wasn\u2019t going to be able to go, but told him that we would try to do some fun low key things together that day.\u00a0 He got upset, cried a bit, (his version which is more like screaming with tear filled eyes, instead of just screaming with an angry tomato red face) then moved on.\u00a0 I thought we would hear about the party all day long, but he didn\u2019t bring it up again.\u00a0 The day was more down than up, and GC and I had a conversation about how scary the Roc\u2019s steroid induced rage is and how if he were like that all.the.time he would for sure be medicated and we just might be scared of him\u2026especially as he aged, not a fun conversation.\u00a0 But then at the end of the very long weekend I saw a glimmer of my Roc. He was fresh out of the bath and pajama clad when he asked to sit on my lap, I granted access and he grabbed a few stuffed animals and pulled his earlier discarded towel onto his legs.\u00a0 Then he wrapped my arms around him and leaned back against me.\u00a0 I rested my head against his, squeezed him and started to sway back and forth, back and forth, keeping a constant squeezing pressure with my arms.\u00a0 My back was hurting but I kept going, feeling him relax into me, breathing in his soft skin.\u00a0 I almost never get to hold him, to sooth him this way, to  mother  him the way I wish I could.\u00a0 I kissed his face, his hair, his ears, his neck and told him for the millionth time that he is my favorite little boy in the whole world.\u00a0 He turned slightly and made eye contact when I told him I loved him and then he whispered, \u201cI love you Mommy.\u201d And the horrid no-good weekend was over. (except for the midnight tantrum in which my presence in the Roc\u2019s bed was the only way to calm him.\u00a0 I am soooo tired.)

{"date": "November 18, 2010", "body": "It was a rough morning around here, a 4 X and only 1 star morning\u2026but I\u2019m not going to write about that, because as much as we swing from good to bad and back again, sometimes within the same 30 seconds, there has been a lot of good in the last week.\u00a0 Instead of writing a bunch of individual posts, I\u2019m lumping it all together into one (giant?) post.\u00a0 So here goes\u2026 *** First, last week I received the following email from the Roc\u2019s teacher, \u201cHi there!!!!\u00a0 Roc earned his 15th straw today!!!\u00a0 He has been saving them and every time I ask him, he says he is saving to have lunch with his teachers.\u00a0 So\u2014 tomorrow his is going to have lunch with us as a reward for great behavior!\u00a0 I just wanted to let you know!\u00a0 He had a good day!\u00a0 I am doing assessments on him for report cards and he is flying high!\u00a0 Things that even last year he\u00a0 was not able to do or needed a lot of help with he is doing all by himself!!! YAY!\u201d I had to write back to be reminded of how the straw system works, it\u2019s a positive behavior system they started this year.\u00a0 When they catch the kids doing something good they get a straw in their name pocket.\u00a0 When they earn 5 straws they can cash them in for a prize, 10 for computer time, 15 to have lunch in the room with the teachers, and 20 they can help teach morning meeting.\u00a0 When the Roc got to 5 and then 10 straws they reminded him he could cash them in, but each time he said he was saving them to have lunch with his teachers.\u00a0 How cute! When the big day arrived he was excited, but wouldn\u2019t talk to me about it.\u00a0 After school the teachers sent me a photo of him sitting between the regular ed and special ed teachers with a big silly grin on his face.\u00a0 They said he was great during lunch, all smiles, and that the teacher next door and the school nurse came and had lunch with him too!\u00a0 The special ed teacher brought in a big jar of pickles to share and he devoured them! I posted a status on my facebook page about him having lunch with his teachers as a reward for his good behavior and that there are just some things you never expect when handed the autism diagnosis.\u00a0 I wanted to say more though, because when your child gets that diagnosis suddenly nothing is taken for granted, everything is sharper, more intense, both the joy and the pain, but especially the joy.\u00a0 I\u2019ve kept my dreams for him, buoyed and carried by hope, but they are not as focused as they once were, I left more room open for leeway, in whatever form it might be.\u00a0 I always wanted him to be mainstreamed, and after some behavior problems (hitting, biting, acting out \u2013 things that would horrify the women I know with typical children) in preschool I was worried about kindergarten.\u00a0 Worried about his ability to regulate himself, express himself, and learn in an often chaotic environment.\u00a0 So for any other kid, any other parent, getting the note that their child earned good behavior straws, and enough to have lunch with his teachers, would be a source of happiness and pride, of that I am sure.\u00a0 But for my child, for this mama, it is so much deeper\u2026and if you walk in my shoes, you know just what I mean. *** On Sunday GC went to play (his last) round of golf for the season and the Roc and I had to whittle the day away together.\u00a0 Of course my boy wanted to be outside and so we went to the dog park for a few hours and then later we to a private school nearby where there are two basketball hoops, shorter than regulation, but taller than our 6 foot hoop at home.\u00a0 GC had taken him there the day before and said he had a blast.\u00a0 The kid has just loves basketball. He had me shooting along with him and doing the skills they work on in APE.\u00a0 After he played for almost an hour he asked to go on the little playground right next to the school.\u00a0 No one was around the school, we had the whole place to ourselves, so I said sure and parked myself on a nearby bench.\u00a0 I stretched out on my back and watched the clouds, I even closed my eyes, until I heard the Roc say, \u201cUh oh Mommy!\u00a0 I need help!!!\u201d I have never seen him attempt a ladder like this and was shocked to find him atop it!\u00a0 He is usually very insecure about leaving the ground in this fashion and would prefer to walk up steps than climb anything.\u00a0 I figured it was a one time thing, but no, as soon as he slid down the slide he went right back and climbed it again (with a little help from me at the top.)\u00a0 The physical skills he\u2019s gained in the last year continue to surprise and amaze me.\u00a0 I love these kinds of surprises!\u00a0 We had a good day together. *** On Tuesday I had the first conference of the year for the Roc and again I had to pat myself on the back for pushing to have him repeat kindergarten.\u00a0 He\u2019s doing so much of the kindergarten work independently this year!\u00a0 The teachers raved about how well he is doing, how much more they hear him talk and answer questions, how relaxed and more confident he seems this year.\u00a0 He is retaining the sight words they are working on, when last year he could sometimes pick them out of a group both visually and verbally, though not consistently, and not at home.\u00a0 He is following directions and attempting the \u201cwork at the table\u201d activities by himself and often doing them correctly.\u00a0 Last year he had to be prodded along, each step of the way, many of his sheets coming home highlighted for him to trace.\u00a0 He is doing writing in small group instead of being pulled aside individually like last year, and he is starting to sound out words.\u00a0 He is drawing pictures to represent things, adding more detail, and actually coloring inside the lines, all things he couldn\u2019t do last year.\u00a0 They have found good slots of time for his pull out services and everyone, everyone said how much they enjoy him and that he is very pleasant.\u00a0 The bathroom isn\u2019t scary this year like it was last year, and he even gets in trouble for goofing off in the boys room.\u00a0 I asked if they had any fire drills yet, and they had had 2 already this year, and he never balked, and he never mentioned it at home!\u00a0 Of course there are things to work on, and we had our annual IEP meeting directly following the conference, and came up with some new goals for this school year.\u00a0 We got to meet the guidance counselor who is facilitating the social skills group, and of course, she loves working with the Roc too.\u00a0 At the end of the meeting the special ed coordinator said that it has been great that we\u2019ve met so many times this year (this was our 4th IEP meeting in 2010) and that we have a great team working for the Roc.\u00a0 Now that the educational label has been corrected, we\u2019ve discussed his needs due to autism, come up with some new goals to address some of his language and social issues, and many of his services up\u2019d I am confident that we are doing everything we can during the school day for him.\u00a0 As GC and I were leaving the door to the Roc\u2019s classroom was open and we were able to peak in and see him sitting at a little table, working on something, reaching for a crayon, fully engaged in the activity at hand.\u00a0 The regular ed teacher was nearby, but not directly helping him, at that moment he was functioning just like any other kindergarten.\u00a0 Exactly what I wanted for him. *** On Tuesday night I went to the first night of a series of Parent Education and Training sessions.\u00a0 GC and I were one of twelve families of children with autism in our school district who were invited to attend these once a month sessions.\u00a0 Unfortunately, we do not have child care so I attend alone and GC stays home with the Roc.\u00a0 This first session was about writing behavioral objectives and data collection.\u00a0 We learned how to select a target skills we want to increase and our first assignment is to write the behavioral objective for two target skills and then take data on those skills until we met with our personal liaison, who comes to our house once a month between the sessions to answer questions, take data on what we\u2019ve learned and how we are applying it, and to help us if we are struggling with the assignment.\u00a0 I left feeling excited knowing that I am going to be learning some very useful tools in how to handle the Roc and how to teach him some very necessary skills. *** I\u2019ve been saying it a lot lately to GC, to myself, to anyone who will listen to me \u2013 I love our blogging community.\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 Never have I felt so connected to people who \u201cget it.\u201d\u00a0 Just this week  Shivon  started up a movement to help Nik\u2019s parents get an iPad to help him communicate, something they would have had to save and save a long time to acquire.\u00a0 $850 was raised in less than 2 days.\u00a0 I love our blogging community.\u00a0 Today I got to speak with  Jess , someone whose writing I admire and  always identify with.\u00a0 A  beautiful woman, both inside and out, a wonderful mother, an amazing writer (I said that already?\u00a0 Oh well, it\u2019s true) and an awesome  support.\u00a0 When I wrote about the  struggles  we were having with the Roc I got many wonderful comments of support, encouragement, and advice from my fellow mommy bloggers.\u00a0 I was so thankful for all the suggestions I received and started an email dialogue with Jess which turned into us having a conversation on the phone this morning.\u00a0 How lovely to hear her voice, she\u2019s just as nice as you would think, and she explained some of what she learned about the principles of ABA and how they applied them at home with their daughter.\u00a0 I have some new ideas to try out with the Roc now.\u00a0 I love our blogging community. *** Finally, the Roc has been all about tractors lately, specifically combine tractors, which is what he is asking Santa for this year.\u00a0 He regularly asks GC or I to play \u201cplow the field\u201d upstairs, which involves driving his trucks (tractors) around and around upstairs, often through all the tiny bits of ripped up wrapping paper he has strewn across the floor (which we totally allow\u2013hello, play dirt or snow! use your imagination!)\u00a0 Tonight after dinner when he asked to draw a picture I figured it would be another house/driveway/tree/garden combo that has been the drawing of choice since school started, so it surprised me when he asked me how to draw a tractor.\u00a0 Unfortunately for him GC is having a guys night out (in actually \u2013 they are playing board games!\u00a0 I love my geeky husband!) and he is the artist, not me.\u00a0 I flipped over an envelope and drew two circles for the wheels and an L for a seat, gave him a big sheet of paper and he went with it.\u00a0 Was I ever surprised when he called me over to look at his first drawing. He kept going after that, forgoing his bath in favor of tractor drawings. He was so proud of those combine tractors and now I have no doubt that he is going to flip his lid when he opens this on Christmas morning: I can\u2019t wait!!! *** The End\u2026 Of this  GIANT  post\u2026 about all the good stuff!

Those skills that are not wanted, not useful to the Roc during the day, are accepted, wanted even, in the dim haze of an owl nightlight with sleep a fingers grasp away.\u00a0 When a nightmare rushes the Roc to the surface and he awakes scared, sweaty, with tears on his cheeks nothing short of my body next to his, my hand providing a soothing deep pressure up and down his spine, and kisses to the forehead will do.\u00a0 When sickness strangles the air he breathes I can climb into bed with him, stretch my legs alongside his, wrap my arm around him and read enough stories to ease the annoyance of the \u201cbreathing machine.\u201d\u00a0 As we wait for the magic of motrin to bring a fever down I can lay face to face, mere inches from the Roc and watch his eyes roll back into sleep as I sweep my fingers through his hair and across his forehead just as I remember my mother doing for me when I was small and ill. This week has seen my feet skittering down the dark hall, only the glimmer of streetlights to light my way, as I rush upward towards the sounds streaming from the Roc\u2019s room when everyone should be sleeping.\u00a0 On Sunday night I spied empty sheets as I swung his bedroom door open, and as I rounded the bed I found a disoriented and distinctly upset little boy on the floor.\u00a0 After convincing him to get back in bed I rubbed his back while he drifted away, then I honored his weepy request that I stay the night right there next to him.\u00a0 We both slept the rest of the night peacefully.\u00a0 Monday night found me rushing toward screams and a dreadfully disturbed Roc, who must have had a nightmare due to his incoherent mumblings about \u201cnot wanting to paint.\u201d\u00a0 He did give a very clear but pathetically sad \u201cYes\u201d when I asked him if he wanted me to rub his back.\u00a0 He quickly fell asleep again and I lay watching his eyes move behind his eyelids, wondering who and what in the world he had been dreaming about.\u00a0\u00a0 Last night it was a fever.\u00a0 As I lay in bed with the Roc waiting to feel his skin cool under my fingertips I sighed.\u00a0 I hate that he gets scared, or disoriented, or sick, or startlingly uncomfortable in any way\u2026but I do love that I can mother him at night.\u00a0 I love that I can free my arms to squeeze and hug, loosen my fingers to smooth sweaty hair, let my voice flow with love and concern, shush and sooth the monsters (or painters) away, bring comfort and ease when he needs it the most. It is what I always ache to do during the day, but during the day it is not what he needs, and so I am strangely grateful for slippery sheets, bad dreams, and  slight  fevers.

Ever since the formulation of The Plan GC and I have been hard at work executing Phase I.\u00a0 The flooring has been fixed, moldings have been put up, sealed and repainted.\u00a0 All the trim and doors are newly painted, and the hand prints and kid smudges on the walls have disappeared beneath a fresh coat of paint.\u00a0 The closets have been de-cluttered, light fixtures changed, shelves and pictures hung.\u00a0 I\u2019ve sorted and purged and made piles of things I just can\u2019t let go of yet.\u00a0 We painstakingly ripped the crabgrass from the yard, aerated, reseeded and watered a new lawn into existence.\u00a0 It has taken us a few weeks to get the house ready, ready for the \u201cfor sale\u201d sign that was planted under our big, fat tree out front last Saturday morning. We\u2019re moving.\u00a0 When we sell our house, whenever that is, we\u2019re moving\u2026 to MINNESOTA!!!!!!!! To where I was born, to where my parents still live in the house I grew up in, to where my sister is busy raising her three children.\u00a0 To where I went to college, learned to steer a canoe, grew up camping and playing outside, to where I still have friends I\u2019ve known since high school.\u00a0 To where the Roc will have people who love him surround and support him, and us.\u00a0 Because we need it.\u00a0 He needs it.\u00a0 My marriage needs it.\u00a0 My sanity needs it.\u00a0 I need it.\u00a0 GC needs it.\u00a0 We need family.\u00a0 We need help. Help with the everyday, \u201cI have an IEP meeting, and no one to get the Roc off the bus!\u201d\u00a0 Help when GC and I want to go out for dinner, to a movie, to a party, or away for a weekend perhaps!\u00a0 GC and I haven\u2019t spent any time alone since the Roc was born.\u00a0 Help when I don\u2019t feel that I can go on, when the Roc and I need to be separated from each other, lest someone lose a limb.\u00a0 Help\u2026and while we truly need some help, it isn\u2019t the only reason we want to move.\u00a0 Family.\u00a0 Family meals, family time, visits, birthdays, holidays, all the good stuff you get when you live close to family.\u00a0 I\u2019ve missed that over the last 10+ years. As we discussed The Plan back in July, in the back of my mind I wondered when GC would change his mind.\u00a0 He is the one who mentioned the idea while grasping my hand across the table, but he is also the same person that told me once upon a time that he would \u201cnever\u201d move to Minnesota, and so long ago I gave up my dream of living closer to my family.\u00a0 But he hasn\u2019t changed his mind, and he keeps surprising me with his random positive comments about Minnesota.\u00a0 He found that there are hockey teams for kids with special needs, much like the baseball team the Roc was on in the spring and the soccer team he has been playing with for the last couple weeks, and he\u2019s excited about the prospect of signing the Roc up.\u00a0 He found gaming stores, golf courses near where we are thinking of living, (near my sister!) and he has mentioned buying a boat or most definitely a canoe.\u00a0 (I vote canoe!)\u00a0 He thinks he may take up hunting (oh god,) wants a dirt bike and/or a snowmobile (yikes,) and because of all the things we are apparently going to be hauling while living in Minnesota (??) he says he will  need  a truck.\u00a0 That a truck will be better than an SUV (which is what I want) when we take up camping (oh really?)\u00a0 He says he will drive to Colorado to snowboard with his brother rather than snowboard on the ice hills in Minnesota, and has stated quite vehemently that he will \u201cnever\u201d cross country ski (remember how he said he would never move to MN?\u00a0 Once upon a time he said he would never eat meat again too\u2026)\u00a0 I\u2019ll admit to being worried about the winter weather, but he says it won\u2019t be too bad for him because he has so many hobbies that are best enjoyed indoors (D&D geek!) So I am surprised.\u00a0 Surprised by his eagerness to uproot from the East Coast, his home, and start new in the middle of the country, or according to him \u201cbasically Canada.\u201d\u00a0 Surprised by his enthusiasm and casual comments about how he is looking forward to moving to Minnesota (\u201cthe frozen tundra.\u201d)\u00a0 I am cautiously excited, not really believing we are really going to make it there, waiting for something to happen or someone to change their mind, but still delighted.\u00a0 I am excited to live near my parents, my sister, and her family.\u00a0 I am excited to spend time with my niece and nephews, for them to know the Roc and the Roc to know them.\u00a0 Hoping that it will not be too late for them to form a bond.\u00a0 I am eager to strengthen the bond with my sister, to be able to spend time together and support each other.\u00a0 I look forward to being able to make spontaneous plans with my Mom instead of buying a plane ticket.\u00a0 So much, we will gain so much just by moving.\u00a0 Holidays and birthdays and family dinners, being present in the everyday lives of my family and them in ours.\u00a0 And friends.\u00a0 I have a few great friends I\u2019ve had for years who I look forward to seeing on a more regular basis.\u00a0 Friends who know me from way back, and there is something to be said for friends like that. I know it will not be perfect.\u00a0 Moving will not magically fix the wrongs, will not irradiate the behavior problems we\u2019ve been slogging through the past few months, it will not suddenly color my vision rosy.\u00a0 Autism will come with us.\u00a0 The problems we have here, we will have there, and new ones will most likely arise because of the move.\u00a0 It will be stressful.\u00a0 Stressful to move half way across the country with all of our stuff, 4 cats, a dog, and a 6 year old with autism.\u00a0 It will be stressful for GC to find a job, stressful for me to set up a good team for the Roc in whichever school he attends, stressful to figure out where to live, buy a house, and everything that comes along with a move like this.\u00a0 It will be stressful for the Roc, in ways that I can already anticipate, and in ways that I will most likely overlook, we may all be blindsided with the fall out.\u00a0 It might be stressful to settle back in to Minnesota \u2013 I\u2019ve been away for 10 years, and my family has lived their lives without me.\u00a0 We will all have to figure out how we best fit together again.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have a perfect plan in place, we don\u2019t know when we will get there, or how, or the logistics of how it will all work out.\u00a0 We do know we will figure that out as we need to.

I made my Mom sit in the bee chair and took a picture just like I do to the Roc every time we visit. We spent a good amount of time walking through the conservatory, something I can never do with the Roc, he starts to get squirmy whenever we go in there.\u00a0 He loves the children\u2019s garden, but after that he wants to get back outside.\u00a0 I was glad for the chance to observe and smell the flowers.

On Wednesday we went to Historic New Castle to walk around and have lunch.\u00a0 We saw an old church and graveyard and decided to visit right before we left.\u00a0 It was amazing to read the inscriptions on these very old tombstones, some from the late 1790s.

Focus. The past couple years I have been wholly focused on Autism.\u00a0 Reading, researching, googling, worrying, completing evaluations, studying reports, going to doctor appointments, attending school meetings, and worrying some more.\u00a0 Last year was eaten up by the educational label change and my worries and fears about the Roc repeating kindergarten and his school placement for this year.\u00a0 Not to mention the more challenging aspects of the Roc\u2019s autism diagnosis, the behaviors and explosive emotions we are working hard to help him manage. There are so many ways to go with this word when thinking about how it can impact me this year. It has become obvious to me that I need to shift my focus.\u00a0 That I need to make time and room in my brain for more than just autism and my gorgeous child.\u00a0 Of course I need to keep my focus on him, but I need to enjoy the good and live in the moment more.\u00a0 Enjoy where he is right now and not where I want him to go or what I hope we accomplish in the next 12 months. I need to focus on my relationships, with GC and with friends.\u00a0 I shut myself away for awhile after the diagnosis and over time I\u2019ve come back out.\u00a0 I need to get out more, connect more, feed those friendships that have sustained me through these stressful times.\u00a0 I am lucky to have GC, for so many reasons, and I need to focus more on us.\u00a0 We need each other and our relationship deserves more time than it\u2019s been given. I need to focus on  me .\u00a0 I need to feed me and let go of the guilt, for I carry so much guilt around every day.\u00a0 I am no longer going to feel guilty about needing time apart, space for myself, for needing my friends, for wanting to expand, for needing my family, for needing time to be more than mommy/therapist.\u00a0 I need to focus on being healthy and take care of me. More than anything this year I want to life this life.\u00a0 I want to live in the moment and enjoy the here and now.\u00a0 The small stuff.\u00a0 The good stuff. Because this life is good. It\u2019s a new year, what will you focus on? \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4393.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4393.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4436.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4458.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4478.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/img_4486.jpg", "http://aliedwards.com/2010/12/one-little-word-2011.html"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2011/01/06/christmas-recap-south-carolina-a-new-year/", "title": "Christmas Recap + South Carolina + A New\u00a0Year"},
{"date": "October 15, 2010", "body": "Summer is over and thank goodness fall has finally arrived.\u00a0 There were more than a few times that I wondered whether I was going to survive the summer with a few shreds of my sanity left to staple together.\u00a0 Cooler breezes have started to float through the windows after the sun goes down, I feel fall\u2019s decent, and even though I don\u2019t fit into the expensive jeans I bought two years ago, I\u2019m ready for pants weather.\u00a0 But before my mind wipes my memory of the summer of 2010 I want to record something I recently found.\u00a0 A bunch of scribbled notes and a conversation I hastily recorded over two sheets of paper late one afternoon at the edge of the pool in late August. The Roc and I spent many hours at the nearby community pool this summer.\u00a0 In the years past I have loved the pool, loved that we could walk there, that the Roc would be entertained playing in the water, that we didn\u2019t have to find a way to whittle away the day indoors, that there was a baby pool and I didn\u2019t have to worry he would drown.\u00a0 He loved that baby pool right away the first summer we joined when he was still just two years old.\u00a0 Loved to line up his buckets at the edge, and fill them, over and over and over again.\u00a0 His attraction to the baby pool nothing out of the ordinary for a little kid.\u00a0 Over the past couple years his love for the baby pool hasn\u2019t diminished, and for a long time I was okay with that.\u00a0 Until this summer. This year is the first summer that I was really ready to be done, ready for school  to start, ready for fall to come, for the heat to dissipate, to move on  from our days spent at the pool.\u00a0 Or I could really say I was ready to be done watching the Roc pour water in the baby pool while all those who poured along with him in years past have now moved on to the big pool.\u00a0 No longer babies.\u00a0 They swim, make up games, yell \u201cwatch me!\u201d to their mothers who lounge on chairs or sit with their feet dangling in, they dive for rings, jump in together, tease the lifeguards, mess around at the pool with their friends.\u00a0 While the Roc stays at the baby pool pouring water, and it\u2019s not that the he cannot swim, in fact he loves to swim, has no fear of jumping in, going under water, plunging into the deep end.\u00a0 He does all of those things, and I\u2019m always happy to join him in the big pool, but he continually wants to come back to the baby pool and pour water.\u00a0 Repetitively.\u00a0 This year it became hard to watch. I had been hoping that this year would be the year that the Roc would spend more time in the big pool and less time pouring water.\u00a0 I was hoping he would reach out more to the other kids, try to engage, because he is so comfortable in the water, it seemed to me the perfect place to branch out.\u00a0 All summer long the Roc and I spent our time divided between the baby pool and the big pool.\u00a0 I, of course, talked to the regulars I\u2019ve seen for years now, but the Roc, for the most part, didn\u2019t talk to anyone but me.\u00a0 I resigned myself to the fact that I expected too much and tried hard to let it go, to not compare, to feel happy for his contentment, because we all say \u201cwe just want our children to be happy\u201d and he is happy at the baby pool.\u00a0 I tried hard to settle my soul while I watched the other former baby pool attendants splash together in the big pool and I swallowed the snarky words that threatened to slip between my clenched teeth when people would joke \u201cyou haven\u2019t graduated from the baby pool yet?\u201d to me when I would walk past them to the baby pool entrance.\u00a0 I reminded myself that other people\u2019s benchmarks were not my own.\u00a0 That progress and victory look different for the Roc, and to me, are sweeter.\u00a0 If, and when he wanted to engage, he would.\u00a0 I let myself think ahead to next year. Then, at the very end of the summer while the Roc was busy pouring water a little girl I\u2019ll call \u201cG\u201d persisted in getting the Roc\u2019s attention.\u00a0 No easy feat, but G is the persistent sort.\u00a0 I noted her presence all summer as she followed the lifeguards, played with all ages of kids, took an interest in everyone, talked to anyone, child and adult alike, at any time.\u00a0 Whenever she encountered the Roc she always shouted out a hello and unlike other children who give up trying to engage him after a few attempts, she kept at him, repeating \u201cHi!\u201d or \u201cLook at this!\u201d until he looked at her.\u00a0 She was not turned away by his tendency to not respond, she just tried harder to get him to pay attention to her.\u00a0 Eventually he did. Late one afternoon while the Roc was doing his usual in the baby pool G entered.\u00a0 She was excited to see him.\u00a0 Inwardly I groaned thinking I was going to be stuck talking for the Roc as is sometimes the case when she got going and he tunes her out.\u00a0 Plus, I was reading a good book and I didn\u2019t feel like making small talk with a four year old.\u00a0 I glanced around to see if her mother was going to come and watch her and felt relief as I saw her approaching.\u00a0 Then I was startled and sat still as I listened to the Roc and G start to interact.\u00a0 I dropped my book like a hot potato when I heard the Roc start talking and grabbed my notebook and a pen and started scribbling down their exchanges.\u00a0 Here is what I wrote down about their exchange: Roc:\u00a0 \u201cI like the waves in here!\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cMe too!\u201d Roc laughs:\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s swim.\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cRoc, can you walk on your hands like this?\u00a0 Roc?\u00a0 Roc?\u00a0 I\u2019m talking to you!\u00a0 Look at me Roc!\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cWell, I\u2019m being a shark.\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to be a shark too!\u00a0 I\u2019m mommy shark.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m daddy shark.\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t open your mouth.\u00a0 Icky water.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cWell I bite.\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cSharks bite.\u00a0 Sharks eat humans.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s what kind of fishes we are.\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cShark fishes!\u00a0 Right!\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to get something for our sharks to drink out of.\u201d\u00a0 He gets two buckets and puts them side by side. G:\u00a0 \u201cOkay.\u201d Roc, pointing to the buckets:\u00a0 \u201cWhen we are thirsty our sharks can drink out of them.\u201d\u00a0 He fills up the buckets. G and the Roc swim around together. G:\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s be sharks that eat humans.\u00a0 Roc, let\u2019s be sharks that eat humans!\u201d G\u2019s mother admonishes her. G:\u00a0 \u201cSharks eat people mama!\u00a0 Mrs. Shark is hungry.\u201d Around this time I note that the time is 5:56 pm. Roc:\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s get a drink.\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cOkay!\u201d They pretend to drink out of the buckets.

G:\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s go eat again!\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cThen we\u2019ll be done with that.\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cI ate all mine.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cI ate all mine too.\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cDo you know what?\u00a0 Fish!\u00a0 Let\u2019s be fish!\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cThen be crabs!\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cYeah!\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cThen be all alligators!\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201cYeah!\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cThen eat!\u201d G:\u00a0 \u201clet\u2019s be mermaids!\u00a0 You be a merman, I\u2019ll be a mermaid.\u201d They continue on this vain while swimming around and around in the baby pool, at 6:15 G notices some bigger girls in the big pool and rushes out to be with them.\u00a0 Instantly the Roc wants to follow her and cannot get out of the baby pool fast enough.\u00a0 He enters the shallow end of the big pool but doesn\u2019t approach G and the other children.\u00a0 He reverts to swimming alone. I don\u2019t mind. Because did you catch that? Holy smokes!\u00a0 Back and forth conversation.\u00a0 For almost 20 minutes!\u00a0 I had never witnessed that before.\u00a0 He was engaged in play with another child!\u00a0 He conversed with another child!\u00a0 All of it appropriate!\u00a0 I knew I was grinning like a maniac. I turned to G\u2019s mother as she was leaving the baby pool to follow her daughter and said, \u201cThat was so amazing for me to witness.\u00a0 I know you see that all day long with G, but that was the very first time I saw the Roc have such a long back and forth exchange with another child.\u00a0 And he played with her!\u00a0 Appropriately!\u201d\u00a0 Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think G\u2019s mom really  got  it.\u00a0 She gave me a little funny look and didn\u2019t say anything while she closed the gate.\u00a0 I know that at one time I mentioned to her that the Roc has autism, but she may have forgotten, or she didn\u2019t really know what that meant. It didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 It still doesn\u2019t matter as I read through this nearly two months later. Conversation. Appropriate play. With another child. So much potential. I have to continually remind myself, this child is on his own trajectory, his own time line, and that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 Everything in due time.

{"date": "January 24, 2011", "body": "My husband sent me a message today \u201cHow come you aren\u2019t blogging?\u00a0 I miss having posts to read ;)\u201d\u00a0 I just haven\u2019t felt like blogging lately\u2026.of course, not for the lack of stories, those are aplenty. The Roc is still the Roc, will always be the Roc.\u00a0 He is both a charmer and a challenge.\u00a0 A ball of energy hard to contain, hard to control, impossible to wrangle at times.\u00a0 Loud, very loud, both in anger and joy.\u00a0 Then happy, calm, even snuggly sometimes, a rarity.\u00a0 He has been wanting to  play , always to  play , but only with an adult, and usually that\u2019s me.\u00a0 And while I try my hardest to remember our humble beginnings of play, sometimes I just.don\u2019t.want.to.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to muster the energy to crawl around on the floor moving through the same motions.\u00a0 Because once you start, you cannot stop.\u00a0 Stopping and switching activities are grounds for massive upheavals of emotion.\u00a0 Sometimes even the way I play is called into question as it was this morning, causing an explosion of epic proportions, as they are in our home, where autism lives.\u00a0 The playing is slowly starting to expand though, and I am grateful.\u00a0 New stories are forming, and they are not being made up by me.\u00a0 Today our three little people went to \u201cRoc National Park\u201d where they climbed a rock wall, took a picture from the top, slid down a slide, and then hiked off into the forest in search of a waterfall.\u00a0 Once found, Annie climbed the waterfall, went down the waterfall, and then needed to be rushed to the hospital, by the little people bus, because the ambulance couldn\u2019t be found.\u00a0 She came right back after her surgery. I did not build the rock wall made out of stuffed animals along the bed, make the waterfall that was a blanket draped over the large plastic bins of clothing the Roc will never wear again, nor did I come up with the story, name the national park, or pick out the little people we would play with.\u00a0 Even though our morning play session ended with a tantrum to shake the walls, there was all that expansion. Growth. Change. As I calmly left him to wail his frustrations at my inability to make the people \u201cclimb the rocks the RIGHT WAY\u201d and washed the morning dishes, I kept my mind focused on the progress.\u00a0 From \u201cno functional play skills\u201d and \u201cno imaginative play\u201d to making up the story, using his imagination, constructing the scene, interacting with me, playing with me,  wanting  to play with me.\u00a0 Hell yeah! I will always be grateful for the expansions. (There GC, does that count?\u00a0 I would write more, but the dog is now waging war on the pile of clothing left on the floor\u2026on your side of the bed\u2026don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not the Giants shirt\u2026I promise. ) ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/a-few-words/", "title": "A Few Words"},

{"date": "February 4, 2011", "body": "There are certain moments that will be forever engraved in my mind.\u00a0 Snippets of conversations with old friends, moments with GC when we first got together, light bulb flashes of realization about the Roc.\u00a0 Moments of laughter, joy, heartache and pain, as well as moments of wonder.\u00a0 I will always remember the pit lodged in my stomach when I dropped the Roc off at preschool for the first time.\u00a0 I was blinded by tears as I made my way to the car.\u00a0 Tears to be separated from my 3 year old, tears that his going to school was happening earlier and in a way that I didn\u2019t expect, and while I was the one pushing for him to be there as soon as I realized that he had autism, I was grief stricken by what it meant when I left him there that first day.\u00a0 It was hard, so hard, it would be for awhile, and some days it still is\u2026but the moments of wonder started soon after that tear filled day. I will always remember pushing him in the cart at the neighborhood grocery store a week after preschool started.\u00a0 I chatted to him as we made our way around the store, labeling things, and asking questions I didn\u2019t receive answers too, tickling his ankles that dangled down in front of me.\u00a0 I asked him if they sang songs at school, and I started to sing the A,B,C song\u2026and he finished it.\u00a0 I stopped the cart mid-aisle and started the song again, only to have him sing it again.\u00a0 I whooped it up right there next to the canned veggies and grinned the whole way home.\u00a0 As soon as I got there I called my parents in Arizona.\u00a0 I had the Roc sing for my dad when he answered.\u00a0 I had him sing for my mom a minute later.\u00a0 I laughed and smiled at my boy who, even though he didn\u2019t answer my question directly, he was listening, he was processing, he was singing! Not long after I was astonished when the Roc did his own version of crying.\u00a0 Up until he started school he never really \u201ccried.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 He has always had all the emotions, but his brain just couldn\u2019t seem to figure out what to do with them, and his sensory systems wouldn\u2019t let him process.\u00a0 He would go completely stiff, scream in frustration and anger, gouge at his eyes when the tears came, and then try to smack them away while looking at his reflection.\u00a0 It was always hard to watch, and many times I pinned his arms down to his sides while saying \u201cno hit.\u201d\u00a0 My heart broke on a daily basis watching him struggle.\u00a0 But one day not long after he started preschool he became upset about something, and instead of screaming and hitting himself, he emitted a fake \u201cWahhh Wahh\u201d while contorting his face.\u00a0 He still didn\u2019t want me to comfort him in the way that I ached to\u2026but in that moment, watching him push out those fake cries, I realized that he was imitating something he must have seen at school\u2026and again I rejoiced!\u00a0 He was paying attention, he was processing what he was seeing, he was generalizing, he was trying it out at home!\u00a0 Holy crap!\u00a0 I told his preschool teacher the next day, \u201cThe weirdest thing has happened, the Roc  learned  to cry.\u201d\u00a0 She laughed and said that they had a few criers in the room, so he had many chances to observe kids crying.\u00a0 It was one of the many things the Roc would pick up being surrounded by his classmates. Now, three years later, something new has been happening with the Roc.\u00a0 He is expressing emotions like he never has before.\u00a0 He is crying, really crying, out of sadness and not anger or frustration, and he\u2019s not faking it.\u00a0 Something is connecting for him and he is able to express this feeling.\u00a0 He got upset last week after he threw his favorite stuffed cat across his bedroom in a fit of anger.\u00a0 I found him crying on his bed and when I asked him what was wrong he told me he felt sad that he threw his kitty.\u00a0 I was stunned.\u00a0 He was sad, and he was expressing it!\u00a0 He came down to my room the other night when GC was trying to put him to bed.\u00a0 I heard him yelling \u201cI\u2019m going to go give Mommy a hug\u201d as he thundered down the stairs.\u00a0 When he came into the room I turned around in my chair and saw his face contorting and his eyes fill up with tears.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sad Mommy!\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cAww buddy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked him.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be so far away from you when I go to bed\u201d\u00a0 he told me, sniffling and wiping his eyes.\u00a0 I tried to explain to him that it was time to go to bed and his bedroom was upstairs, just on the next level.\u00a0 When he continued to cry I pulled him onto my lap and he wrapped his arms around my neck.\u00a0 I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, breathing him in.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know when I will stop being amazed at not only being allowed to comfort my child, but that he is now sometimes seeking it out.\u00a0 Even though I knew I was delaying bedtime and making GC wait, I hugged and hugged the Roc, rubbing his back and kissing his cheeks.\u00a0 Slowly he calmed, and after we spent a few minutes tickling I was able to get him to go up to bed. I sat back in my chair and thought about how he is changing, how he still has all these explosive emotions, but he is starting to label them, to explain himself, to seek me out for help and comfort\u2026and I smiled.\u00a0 I will always remember being completely grief stricken on a beautiful fall afternoon three years ago.\u00a0 I literally could no longer stand in my kitchen, and as I slid to the floor in a heap of tears, the Roc danced around me squealing and laughing.\u00a0 I cried all the more for the realization that he did not understand my emotions, he did not connect my sadness to my face, my tears, my sobs.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know if he ever would.\u00a0 I worried endlessly. Three years.\u00a0 He gets it. My chest tightened and I thought my heart just might explode. He gets it.

(Arizona 2010) I am excited, and of course a little nervous.  The Roc has traveled by air since he was an infant, averaging about 2 flights every year.  He remembers what check in looks like, that we have to wait in line at security and take off our shoes, that we have to wait to get on the airplane, and then fly.  He remembers the order and we have a little picture schedule that we use to help with each step.  Even though he remembers all of it, that doesn\u2019t make it easy.  He is still anxious about the crowds, the noise, the people, the movement, the general chaotic feel of the airport.  He has a hard time waiting in the long security line, as well as waiting to get on the plane, and don\u2019t forget about the scary airport bathrooms.  He has already told me that he doesn\u2019t want it \u201cto take a long time to get there\u2026\u201d  Of which I can do nothing about.  I\u2019ve packed snacks, markers and paper, a few little toys, and our portable DVD player.  I even got a few new movies for him\u2026about waterfalls, which I am saving as a surprise!  I hope he likes them and will sit in relative silence and watch during our 2 separate plane rides tomorrow, first to Texas, and then on to Arizona.  I bought a t-shirt that says \u201cI love someone with Autism\u201d on it in case anyone needs an explanation of the strange faces, noises, and hand obsession that all emerge when the Roc is under sensory duress and anxiety, though I don\u2019t know if anyone will actually notice (the t-shirt, lots of people will notice the strange faces, noises and hand obsession.)

On Monday The Roc didn\u2019t have school and GC was off work.\u00a0 So we rented a minivan and headed up to Ikea where we got a new table, a new bookshelf, a huge heavy mirror, and some \u201cart\u201d for the walls.\u00a0 It took us all day and the Roc was surprisingly good (except for the squirrelly behavior in the Ikea parking garage as we struggled to fit all of our new stuff in the minivan) that we pushed him a bit further and went to Lowes where we found a rug for the family room (which Guinness loves.) \nWe got about 4 inches of snow on Monday night so of course the Roc had a snow day and I didn\u2019t get any house stuff done, but I did find this adorable picture when the Roc and I went to Willey Farms after his riding lesson. On Wednesday I changed the Roc\u2019s bathroom from this: to this: On Thursday I repainted our upstairs landing/loft the same color our foyer was slated to be painted. On Friday the real fun began, our scaffolding arrived, and after GC and I bought paint and picked out new lights for our foyer and dining area, we got to work.\u00a0 It was nerve wracking to put the scaffolding together and even more so when GC got on it.\u00a0 He taped and painted, and changed the totally awful gold light fixture in the foyer. In the end the foyer looks much better. On Saturday we moved into the great room, put together the scaffolding and GC got to work replacing the light and taping along the ceiling.\u00a0 We painted all day and started again on Sunday morning when we woke up. We painted until late Sunday afternoon and then put the room back together in time to record the Devils game.\u00a0 It looks great and now no one can call our house cold and sterile!

{"date": "August 31, 2010", "body": "I\u2019ve been  keeping my mouth  shut for awhile, but now I can open it and write about a meeting I worked EIGHT months for.\u00a0 To change the Roc\u2019s educational label from emotionally disturbed to autism. Back in January I decided that I couldn\u2019t live with that completely unjust label attached to my boy and I deeply regretted that I allowed it to happen.\u00a0 Since he wasn\u2019t a behavior problem in class, which was the reason I was given qualified him for the ED label in the first place, I called the schools spec ed coordinator to find out how to start the process to change the label.\u00a0 We had a brief discussion on the phone, she agreed to look into the matter and talk to the school psych who pushed the ED label, and then she sent me a copy of the Delaware regulations.\u00a0 After 3 weeks of hearing nothing, and under the advice of a friend, I sent a certified letter to the district supervisor of special education and cc\u2019d the school psych requesting an independent educational evaluation.\u00a0 I immediately got a phone call.\u00a0 And so began the back and forth emails with the district supervisor of special education.\u00a0 After a volley of 32 emails, taking up most of the month of March, she approved the neuropsych, and the speech and occupational therapists I had requested.\u00a0 I scheduled the evaluations for May, the first available appointments.\u00a0 The neuropsych evaluation consisted of a parent interview (the ADI-R), a school observation, and then 3 consecutive days of testing, the ADOS being one of many tests administered.\u00a0 Both the speech and occupational therapy evaluations were equally comprehensive. We got the results of all three evaluations in June. Guess what? The ADI-R and the ADOS concluded that the Roc has AUTISM.\u00a0 Imagine  that!  Guess the neurologist, the developmental pediatrician, the psychologist at the children\u2019s hospital, and the mama who knows her kid were  RIGHT!  The neuropsych had great recommendations and lots of information on where the Roc struggles the most, and really emphasized that his struggles are due to autism and language impairments and that he is NOT emotionally disturbed. The OT and speech evaluations were full of awesome in-depth information on the Roc.\u00a0 I sat for hours upon hours reading all the reports and taking notes.\u00a0 I learned so much about the body reading the occupational therapy evaluation and was stunned to see in black and white, how dysregulated my boy is.\u00a0 His auditory sensitives are huge.\u00a0 He has gross motor issues that impact is ability to even attempt the fine motor tasks that are demanded of him every day.\u00a0 The occupational therapist was mad when she heard that the Roc had been labeled emotionally disturbed.\u00a0 She said he was clearly a boy who needed to be taught by people who understood that the behaviors he exhibits are due to sensory issues and how best to diffuse them and prevent them. We scheduled an IEP meeting for July to go over the IEEs and I also mentioned that I wanted to discuss placement again.\u00a0 We were all agreed on the Roc repeating kindergarten, but I was still doubting moving him to classroom with less support, and reading the neuropsych report furthered my feelings that he needed to be in a well supported classroom.\u00a0 Then they canceled the meeting saying that since we had done the ADI-R and the ADOS the district autism assessment team needed to review the reports and view the Roc during summer school.\u00a0 We rescheduled the meeting for the end of August. Last week was the meeting, and I was well prepared.\u00a0 I had a friend on one side, GC on the other, the neuropsych on conference call, and a voice recorder on the table.\u00a0 I had prepared a long document supporting the autism label and I didn\u2019t even need to reference it.\u00a0 They agreed.\u00a0 His label was changed to autism.\u00a0 Whew.\u00a0 8 months.\u00a0 Many phones calls.\u00a0 Gobs of emails.\u00a0 Lots of time.\u00a0 School missed for the evaluations.\u00a0 Notes taken and discussed.\u00a0 For an educational label.\u00a0 A label to fit the diagnosis he has. A wrong was righted. But so much more than the appropriate label came out of these evaluations.\u00a0 After everyone on the team agreed to the new educational label of autism, (and I laughed when we went around the table and I had the chance to say \u201cI\u2019ve never said it wasn\u2019t autism, I presented my child to the school when he was 3 years old, telling you that he has autism,\u201d)\u00a0 we talked more about placement for this school year.\u00a0 And after arguing with a school psych (who had never met my son, only read this one report about him before coming to the meeting) about retaining the Roc in kindergarten (a team decision made in May,) and having the neuropsych state again that moving him to a less supported kindergarten placement wouldn\u2019t be to his benefit, we were presented with the option of having him repeat kindergarten in the very same classroom he was in last year.\u00a0 20 students total, 5 identified with a need (the Roc making that number 6), a teacher, special ed teacher, and a para (who used to be a speech therapist) all full time in the room.\u00a0 We agreed.\u00a0 With the hope that a familiar environment with adequate support and some revised accommodations will allow the Roc to flourish this year. Then the school occupational therapist presented her findings from the independent OT report.\u00a0 She had prepared a document titled \u201csensory strategies for the Roc\u201d and I  knew I was going to like what she was about to say when I read that title.\u00a0 She took almost all of the recommendations that the independent evaluator suggested and incorporated them into the Roc\u2019s IEP.\u00a0 We got more OT for him each week and the therapist is going to do a consult each month with the teachers to talk about what is working, what some of his problems are, and how they can help him.\u00a0 So we went from hearing \u201cwe don\u2019t do that\u201d to sensory stuff when we entered the public school system, to getting sensory accommodations written into his IEP a few years later.\u00a0 I hope everyone now understands that sensory issues are a big part of the Roc\u2019s day, and even though he is holding himself together really well in the classroom environment, he is working SO hard to do so. Unfortunately, the speech therapist who was present at the meeting hadn\u2019t been given a copy of the independent speech evaluation.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t about to sign anything in relation to his speech services until this was read by an SLP.\u00a0 So we agreed to meet after school starts and have scheduled another IEP meeting to be conducted with the therapist who will be working with him this year.\u00a0 I am hopeful that she will be as thorough as the OT, and take the recommendations of the independent evaluator.\u00a0 We will find out in 2 weeks. It was a long meeting, and we still have more to cover when we meet again.\u00a0 The supervisor of special education mentioned a social skills program that was started last year when she was touting how \u201cprogressive our district is in regards to autism\u201d while the neuropsych was on conference call at the beginning of the meeting.\u00a0 Later, when we brought this program up again we were told that the Roc would need a referral, that the program hadn\u2019t started yet, they didn\u2019t know where it was going to be this year, and that we would discuss that at the next meeting in 2 weeks.\u00a0 Yup, we will!\u00a0 Especially when in one breath we were told it was for children with autism, and in another we were told that we would have to see if the Roc qualifies! Hmmm\u2026I wonder if he does??? You can bet I won\u2019t be letting this go either.

Lucky him. He got to help GC install a new sink, garbage disposal, and faucet in our kitchen.\u00a0 I repeat: lucky him (and SUPER DUPER LUCKY ME.)\u00a0 Here\u2019s a little something you might not know about my husband: he has temper tantrums.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t pretty.\u00a0 They resemble the Roc\u2019s temper tantrums, only with really colorful cuss words thrown in instead of the phrases the Roc uses when he\u2019s mad like, \u201cIt\u2019s a PLAYGROUND!!!\u201d\u00a0 or\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a MARE!!\u201d\u00a0 (I have no clue what that last one is, as I don\u2019t think he knows that a mare is a horse.)\u00a0 I lovingly  jab  refer to his temper tantrums as \u201chissy fits\u201d or \u201cspaz attacks,\u201d neither descriptors make GC happy.\u00a0 But both are accurate labels to describe the huffing, puffing, groaning, grunting, cursing, foaming at the mouth in frustration episodes he has when trying to do something \u201chandy\u201d around the house.\u00a0 I will admit to being greatly annoyed by what I view to be childish behavior, and I don\u2019t understand how GC hasn\u2019t connected the fact that the Roc  totally  takes after  him  with the whole lack of patience/low tolerance for frustration thing, but I\u2019m learning not to worry that GC won\u2019t figure something out.\u00a0 Even when he gave up on Saturday night, saying the disposal was going to have to go back to the store because he couldn\u2019t get it attached, that we were going to have to call a plumber because something was leaking.\u00a0 That even though it seemed simple, he \u201cJUST COULDN\u2019T DO IT!\u201d\u00a0 Oh was he TICKED.\u00a0 He plopped himself down on the couch in a foul mood.\u00a0 I patted him on the shoulder while he sulked, rolled my eyes at Marcello (behind GC\u2019s back, sorry babe) and said good night.\u00a0 I knew he wouldn\u2019t let go of the problem until he figured it out.\u00a0 Sunday morning GC told me he knew what he was doing wrong, he had found a video on the internet while he was seething with his iPad on the couch the night before, and sure enough, he fixed something simple and everything worked out.\u00a0 Some photos to document the process would have been a nice touch, it wouldn\u2019t have been appreciated at the time, and I would have more pictures of GC glaring at the camera, but it would have been funny.\u00a0 I wish I had at least snapped a photo of Marcello shining the flashlight for GC and giving me this  look  that summarized how I feel when GC starts spazzing out. Oh brother. Get. A. Grip. Dude. Seriously? (and if it seems as if I\u2019m \u201cthrowing GC under the bus\u201d here \u2013 I\u2019m not.\u00a0 He will readily admit to having a \u201ctemper.\u201d\u00a0 Just ask him.) \n And then there\u2019s the 4th of July.\u00a0 I got my camera out that evening,\u00a0 (so here come the pictures.)\u00a0 The Roc spent the afternoon at the pool and willingly came home when I mentioned that our friends Marc & Erin and their two little ones were coming over for a BBQ and to watch the fireworks from our backyard.\u00a0 The Roc couldn\u2019t get through dinner fast enough, he just wanted to jump with Maddie in the bouncy house. Yes, he\u2019s wearing a crown while jumping\u2026don\u2019t you? The real fun began when the sun started to go down.\u00a0 Our neighbors lit some (apparently illegal) fireworks and the bicycle cops stopped by their party to have a friendly chat with them.\u00a0 (Another awesome photo opportunity missed.)\u00a0 It was right about this time that Marc brought out the sparklers (and we all looked at each other asking \u201cthese are legal \u2013 right? while sneaking peeks at the cops.)\u00a0 GC offered a sparkler to the Roc, and we both were surprised when he actually held it!\u00a0 And waved it around!\u00a0 And then put it up to the bouncy house!!!\u00a0 \u201cNO!!!!!\u201d everyone yelled! He didn\u2019t quite know what to do with himself when it went out. So we gave him another. And the dog and I stayed far back.\u00a0 Uncle Marcello even got in on the sparkler action. As it got darker and darker I put my camera away, gave the Roc his noise canceling headphones and we all settled in our chairs to wait for the town firework display.\u00a0 The bicycle cops had been gone long enough that we thought it safe to try out one of those canister firework thingys.\u00a0 The kids loved it.\u00a0 The last two years the Roc was way to anxious to watch the fireworks outside, so we always sat on the floor by the big windows and watched from inside the safety of the house.\u00a0 This year we had talked the Roc into staying outside.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t too worried about where we would watch them, if the Roc wanted to go inside during the show, we would. But he didn\u2019t!\u00a0 He sat on my lap and watched the whole display! Another image I should have (had someone) photograph.\u00a0 There\u2019s always next year.

I tried to phone my neighbor this morning to ask if we could borrow a movie.\u00a0 He followed me around screeching and seething.\u00a0 My attention cannot be diverted from him.\u00a0 He cannot entertain himself.\u00a0 I vaulted the gate and locked myself in the bathroom.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t hear her.\u00a0 She couldn\u2019t hear me.\u00a0 The Roc screamed and thrashed against the door until I paused my conversation and sent him to his room.\u00a0 He did not go willingly.\u00a0 He had a massive tantrum upstairs. I got angry.\u00a0 Really angry.\u00a0 Sometimes I feel stuck in anger.\u00a0 I cannot see through it\u2019s thickness.\u00a0 I cannot figure out how to solve these seemingly unsolvable problems.\u00a0  Really?  You\u2019re going to tantrum again?\u00a0  Really?  And I know that his behavior is a form of communication.\u00a0 I know this.\u00a0 But seriously?\u00a0 I am spent.

My neighbor to lend me the movie I requested.\u00a0 The dog pushed his way outside and I couldn\u2019t hide my hideous face.\u00a0 She asked if I was okay.\u00a0 I shook my hands in front of my body.\u00a0 My arms wobbled.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t speak.\u00a0 She stepped inside.\u00a0 I backed away.\u00a0 Turned away and with my hands over my face told her I couldn\u2019t do this anymore.\u00a0 She closed the door and sat at the table.\u00a0 Her eyes filled up with tears as my body heaved. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u00a0 I can\u2019t do this.\u00a0 I am not good at this.\u00a0 I am not a good mom.\u00a0 I can\u2019t do this again.\u00a0 I\u2019ve ached for another child\u2026but I can\u2019t do this again.\u00a0 I think the universe knows this and that\u2019s why I only have one.\u00a0 I am not supposed to be a mom.\u201d I laid my head down and sobbed.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t let her hug me.\u00a0 I told her how I screamed at the Roc.\u00a0 How I swatted his leg.\u00a0 How he flinched.\u00a0 (It hurts to even write this and remember the look on his face.)\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to tell her.\u00a0 I told her anyway.\u00a0 The truth stings. She told me that every mother has bad days.\u00a0 Every mother does things like that.\u00a0 My eyes searched her face.\u00a0 She told me how she threw something at one of her children on one of her roughest days.\u00a0 I was surprised.\u00a0 I was grateful that she told me.\u00a0 Her truth.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t always feel like a good mom.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t always feel cut out for the job.\u00a0 Her three (typical) kids drive her up the wall too.\u00a0 Parenting kids is hard.\u00a0 I have a little bit of a different situation.\u00a0 Yup, I do. When she left I went up to talk to the Roc.\u00a0 He had seen the street sweeper out the window and was wholly focused on whether or not it was coming back.\u00a0 His tantrum and my breakdown apparently forgotten.\u00a0 I apologized and hugged him to me.\u00a0 He sat on my lap and rested his head on my shoulder.\u00a0 Then he started to play with my hands.\u00a0 We went downstairs to get some fruit and put in the movie. I called GC and he couldn\u2019t leave work.\u00a0 I called my mom and there was no answer.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t leave a message.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t trust my voice.\u00a0 I thought about my sister, I know she\u2019s busy.\u00a0 And it\u2019s hard to dump this stuff on people over the phone.\u00a0 I can only imagine how helpless they feel when I cry 1,500 miles away.\u00a0 So I opened up a New Post and started to write. It feels good to get this out of my head and onto the screen.\u00a0 I\u2019m slowly putting the pieces back together.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t broken apart like this in a long time.\u00a0 I know that I\u2019m over whelmed and spent.\u00a0 I need a break.\u00a0 I need to recharge. And today that just isn\u2019t possible.\u00a0 I have to get it together and hold it together for the rest of the day. The movie is still playing.\u00a0 So for now I\u2019m going to go bake some zucchini bread and dream about the road trip my best girl and I are in the planning stages of right now.\u00a0 It\u2019s a necessary trip for her, research for a book she\u2019s writing, and a luxury for me, to be her sidekick and helper.\u00a0 It will be my first  real  break from the Roc since he was born, almost 6 years ago. 5 whole days.\u00a0 I just have to get through July and August.

{"date": "March 10, 2010", "body": "I didn\u2019t really pay attention to the fact that the Roc didn\u2019t hug until after he was diagnosed with Autism.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t an affectionate child like some children are, snuggling into their mothers arms, but he did like to be carried (the phrase I most remember from age 2 is \u201ccarry you!\u201d), he liked to be rocked in the glider, loved being tickled, and he would always crawl into my lap for a story.\u00a0 The lack of hugs shook me, and I know it shook GC too, when we realized what their absence meant, or what we thought it meant.\u00a0 Detachment.\u00a0 Absence of love and connectedness.\u00a0 Distance. I came to understand that those fears were laid by false claims about Autism.\u00a0 Hugs do not equal love, they are just an expression of love, one of many.\u00a0 The Roc has shown his love, attachment, and connectedness in other ways.\u00a0 His smile, his laugh, his sureness, his growth, and lately with  words . But just like any parent, I longed to hug and be hugged.\u00a0 I wanted to give hugs and I craved the action, the physical gestures of love many children give their mothers so freely.\u00a0 So we taught the Roc how to hug. At first he would stand straight with arms held stiffly by his sides, and tolerate the invasion of his space as we hugged him.\u00a0 Soon he began what we referred to as \u201cthe lean\u201d when he was prompted for a hug.\u00a0 Later we would place his arms around our necks and there they would stay, secure in their straightness.\u00a0 Then he began to bend his arms to form a very loose oval, but they were loose, a dead weight.\u00a0 But it was better than no hug at all and it was all progress, this evolution of the hug. We have practiced these hugs every night and it\u2019s also standard that when coming out of \u201ctime out\u201d the Roc apologizes and gives a hug.\u00a0 So much that when I say \u201cwhat do you say\u201d he says \u201csorry mommy, I will give you a hug now.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s been an ingrained response. We have adored these hugs because even though they are prompted, there is no longer an ounce of resistance to the request.\u00a0 (As long as it\u2019s mom and dad who are doing the requesting.)\u00a0 I\u2019ve prompted them all, and they only last a mire second before abruptly ending, but I\u2019ve soaked up every split second.\u00a0 This evolution I thought was complete, and I have been happy with the prompted, but freely given loose armed hugs.\u00a0 I did not want for anything more\u2026 And then the other night as the Roc and I were heading upstairs to start his nightly bath routine something extraordinary happened.\u00a0 We were holding hands as we ascended the stairs.\u00a0 I was thinking to myself that I loved the way his hand felt in mine, mine still the bigger, wondering how long that would last.\u00a0 Wondering when his hand would dwarf mine, and how much longer I would so easily be able to take his hand.\u00a0 Would there come a time when he would not want to hold my hand?\u00a0 That it would be embarrassing?\u00a0 Then we reached the summit and stopped in front of the bathroom door, at which time I fully expected him to say, as he does every night, \u201cwait for me.\u201d\u00a0 As in wait for me to take off ALL of my clothes, wait for me to go potty, wait for me to watch all the water go down the pipe and then refill the toilet, wait until all of this is done before moving to the next step \u2013 which is me turning on the faucet in the tub.\u00a0 But instead of reaching to pull the shirt from his body he turned to me and said:\u00a0 \u201cI will give you a hug now.\u201d And he did. A hug. A real hug. Arms wrapped around my waist, ear pressed into my belly button, squeezing and taking my breath away.\u00a0 He hugged me for at least 10 seconds. 10 seconds. Count to 10. That\u2019s amazing. I stood in shock with one hand on his back and the other on his head just processing the moment and when I realized it for what it was, the first spontaneous, unprompted, freely given hug, my eyes filled up with tears.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t prompt him, it wasn\u2019t part of a routine at that specific time, he wasn\u2019t coming down from his room after a \u201ctime out,\u201d he simply hugged me, just to hug me\u2026 Monumental moment for him and for me. 5.5 years and my baby gave me a hug.

{"date": "March 11, 2010", "body": "I guess I was riding on a euphoric  hugging  high when I decided to take the Roc and Guinness to the local dog park.\u00a0 I envisioned the Roc and Guinness frolicking among the dogs, the Roc smiling and laughing, giggling as the dogs met and played, reaching out to pet a new dog, at ease in the huge outdoor enclosure, exclaiming to me \u201clook at all the dogs Mommy!\u201d What can I say?\u00a0 Sometimes I let Autism and all it\u2019s complications slip my mind. I know, I know.\u00a0 What was I thinking? I should have talked to the Roc about where the park was located, what it looked like, what the fencing looked like, that we would be going to the dog park  before  going to the playground and to see the pond fountains, and that there are 2 gates to enter the dog park.\u00a0 I should have told him that all the dogs are off leash inside the enclosure, that there are  people  at the dog park and many dogs, that the people go with their dogs, and that the people may want to talk to him or his mother, about our dog.\u00a0 I should have explained to the Roc that some dogs will run to him, that some dogs will jump on him, and that some dogs may bark at him.\u00a0 I should have told him that Guinness wouldn\u2019t run with him like he does inside our house, that he would be too busy sniffing dog tushie and would most likely chase other dogs, and  not  him.\u00a0 I should have warned him that if he threw a ball  all  the dogs may run after it, not just Guinness, and that Guinness may not be the dog to get the ball and bring it back.\u00a0 I should have set the rule for no screaming, for any reason, unless it involved blood.\u00a0 I should have described the consequences for throwing a tantrum at the dog park. I should have. But I didn\u2019t. Like I said, I kinda forgot about Autism for a minute\u2026 and then we paid the price.\u00a0 Autism doesn\u2019t like to be forgotten. The Roc seemed excited to go to the dog park, but I should have prepped him.\u00a0 Right away he had a list of complaints: the dogs were too big, there were too many people for him, and they tried to talk to me and him, and then someone laughed when a little fluffy dog barked at him and he got scared.\u00a0 The Roc doesn\u2019t like to be barked or laughed at.\u00a0 Guinness wouldn\u2019t run after him, and he wouldn\u2019t go get the ball the Roc threw for him, other dogs were willing, but that wasn\u2019t good enough.\u00a0 Things were going down hill fast, and I just couldn\u2019t turn it around. We were there less than 10 minutes before he completely melted down.\u00a0 Guttural screeching, a tomato red face and stiff arms.\u00a0 Everyone averted their eyes, but not before I caught the pure disgust on one woman\u2019s face.\u00a0 I immediately announced that our time was up, hooked on the leash, and drug the Roc and Guinness back to the park entrance.\u00a0 He screamed and flailed, and the poor dog was so confused.\u00a0 I had a hard time wrangling him and it was taking me awhile to get him to go where I wanted him to.\u00a0 A woman waiting for us to move cooed to her little dog:\u00a0 \u201cshush, it\u2019s okay baby,\u201d while I struggled to get the Roc through the gate without letting anyone else\u2019s dog out.\u00a0 I felt the eyes of disdain on my son.\u00a0 I felt the judgment passed on me.\u00a0 I wished things were different.\u00a0 I had had a vision of a fun afternoon at the dog park and then the playground. But it was not fun. The Roc hasn\u2019t had a public meltdown in awhile.\u00a0 I forgot how ugly it can be.\u00a0 As I struggled to get the Roc into the car, the cooing lady walked past, and I hoped she noticed the \u201cAutism Awareness\u201d magnets on my car.\u00a0 I try not to care what other people think, but it\u2019s hard not to when it\u2019s directed at my son and my parenting abilities. The Roc screamed and threw himself around in his car seat when I informed him that we were skipping the playground and the fishing dock that goes out over the pond.\u00a0 He wailed like I was killing him.\u00a0 And he continued a good 2 miles down the road until I turned around and screamed for him to \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d Oy.\u00a0 I always want to immediately suck my scream back as soon as it exits my mouth.\u00a0 But he stopped his terrible screech, I think it\u2019s the shock, it can be like a switch sometimes. I told him that we had to ride home in silence and I would not talk to him until we got home.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t silent, but as soon as we pulled in the driveway he said, \u201cMommy, are you ready to talk now?\u201d and added, \u201cYou need to talk nicer to me now,\u201d for good measure.\u00a0 And so after we got inside we talked.\u00a0 We had the discussion we should have had  before  we attempted the dog park. I think we\u2019ll wait awhile before making our second attempt, and I\u2019ll make sure to do my prepping homework next time. I won\u2019t forget about Autism, but I won\u2019t give up on my vision either.

This will be the Roc\u2019s third trip to Arizona and he is already listing the activities he would like to do while there.\u00a0 Picnics in the park, Sabino Caynon, lunch in that restaurant with the fountain \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t want to eat inside this year, trips to the neighborhood playground, the desert museum, Saguaro National Park.\u00a0 All of that sounds good to me, I really just want to visit with my parents, relax, and feel the sun\u2019s warmth on my face. Not only have we been talking about the different activities we will do while we are in Arizona, we\u2019ve been discussing a big change in the way we travel.\u00a0 No more stroller.\u00a0 The Roc will have to walk in the airport, and not just one airport, we have to switch planes in Denver.\u00a0 We\u2019ve discussed waiting in line at check-in (already check-in online, that should save some time), waiting in line at security, waiting in line to get on the plane, walking through the different areas of the airport, what kinds of things we will see, sounds we will hear, that there will be many people all around, all moving!\u00a0 The chaos!\u00a0 The Roc has a handy picture schedule to help him along, he\u2019s already got the pictures in order and has been looking at them and talking through the sequence.\u00a0 I hope it\u2019s enough.\u00a0 I hope everything goes okay. The other hurdle will be the bathroom.\u00a0 Those scary flushing toilets.\u00a0 The Roc has already said he doesn\u2019t want to go to the bathroom because it\u2019s too loud and so he devised a plan.\u00a0 We will each use the restroom before walking the gauntlet otherwise known as Security, where Daddy can help him before we have to say good bye, because, you know \u2013 urinals are not as scary as toilets.\u00a0 From there on out I\u2019d better not drink anything because I\u2019m only allowed to use the restroom on the plane so he can stay in his seat.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if this is really the best plan.\u00a0 He hasn\u2019t allowed himself any bathroom breaks saying he will hold it until we get to Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s. Hmmm\u2026we\u2019ll see how that goes! ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2010/02/04/dodging-a-big-snow-bullet/", "title": "Dodging a Snow\u00a0Bullet"},
{"date": "March 28, 2010", "body": "Saturday was a day that I desperately needed.\u00a0 After a school field trip in which I could not help but compare, that left me wondering about the Roc\u2019s future and how to prepare him for the cruelness of others, to the defiance and discipline issues we\u2019ve been facing of late, and a joke I heard that stung my heart instead of making me laugh.\u00a0 I really needed Saturday.\u00a0 I needed to see the good.\u00a0 The good in friends, in strangers, in the Roc, in GC, in our life.\u00a0 I needed to smile. And on Saturday I did. On Saturday morning I ran with my good friend Kelly, who moved into my little neighborhood a year and a half ago, and who happens to have a 10 year old on the spectrum.\u00a0 I saw the magnets on the back of her car and introduced myself the first chance I got, which happened to be in the days where her house was still filled with boxes, I wasted no time.\u00a0 Upon introduction I told her that my son had been diagnosed with autism and she stepped out her front door and hugged me.\u00a0 I never looked back.\u00a0 She gets it.\u00a0 I knew we would be friends.\u00a0 And so a year and a half later we are training for a half marathon and have a pact to run our long weekend runs together.\u00a0 We run slow and we talk and laugh and tell the stories no one else would understand.\u00a0 On Saturday she sucked in her breath just the way I knew she would when I recounted a joke that everyone laughed at, except me.\u00a0 And we discussed how autism has fundamentally changed us, to the core.\u00a0 How we will never again laugh at vulnerability.\u00a0 I am not the same person I was 2+ years ago.\u00a0 I am better. So I smiled as I ran and discussed life with my good friend Kelly.\u00a0 And we high fived at the end of our 9 miles, the farthest either of us has ever ran. A couple hours later the Roc had his first baseball practice for the challenger team.\u00a0 The challenger team is part of our area\u2019s little league and is totally free of charge for children with disabilities ages 5 \u2013 18 years of age.\u00a0 I had heard of challenger teams but did not know there was one right in my town, and that they play at the park we can walk to.\u00a0 A letter had come home in the Roc\u2019s backpack a few weeks ago and I called the coordinator to get a feel for what it entailed.\u00a0 After hearing her say it was all about getting the kids out there and having fun I signed the Roc up.\u00a0 Last year it may have all been too much for him, but he was excited this year, and I was excited at the opportunity for him to expand.\u00a0 And so yesterday, at the appointed time, we trooped over to the field to meet up with many people we did not know, and of course, as it is in our world, to see a few familiar faces and thus grin in recognition.\u00a0 GC is to be the Roc\u2019s \u201cbuddy\u201d and help him during practices and games and I am so excited for them.\u00a0 For them to have something in which I am on the sidelines, an observer.\u00a0 For them to forge a deeper bond through baseball.\u00a0 And so I smiled as I watched them play catch. I smiled as GC helped the Roc when it was his turn up to bat. I smiled as they ran the bases and the coaches cheered him on. I smiled and my eyes filled up with tears as I looked around at all these children, who if not for challenger teams, would not have the opportunity to play baseball.\u00a0 To throw a ball, to swing a bat, to cheer for their teammates (and those on the other team as well, because really, it\u2019s about playing, not winning), and to hear the words \u201cGreat job!\u201d or \u201cNice swing!\u201d and \u201cGo Roc, Go!\u201d\u00a0 It was more fun that I had imagined it to be, and the Roc enjoyed himself doing something brand-new.\u00a0 An accomplishment in of itself.\u00a0 Practice was an hour long, and when it was over the Roc said he had a good time and would go again.\u00a0 I smiled all the way home. After a quick wardrobe change we went over to the B\u2019s house for dinner.\u00a0 It was so fun to sit at the B\u2019s dinner table, with our boys, and share a delicious meal.\u00a0 And of course the Roc getting up from the table to go hide behind a pillow in the living room didn\u2019t phase the B\u2019s at all \u2013 they live with the quirks of autism too.\u00a0 After dinner Christa and I popped the little boys in her car and our husbands rode together in a our car, and we all went up to the Please Touch Museum for autism awareness night.\u00a0 The Roc had never been and I was a little worried about how he would react to all the stimulation there, and then when I saw the crowd of people going in I worried about how he would handle all the movement and noise the hoard of adults and children were sure to create.\u00a0 Not to mention that the only people there were families with children with autism.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have to worry, he followed P\u2019s lead and had a great time exploring all the things to do and see.\u00a0 I smiled when his eyes lit up as soon as he saw the \u201cdigger\u201d in the Road Construction exhibit, as construction vehicles have been a hot topic of car conversation lately. I smiled while helping him navigate the crowded grocery store and while checking out his chosen food items (fruit and cake) and when he climbed into the back of a dump truck to play with the \u201cbricks\u201d at a construction site. I laughed out loud when he played the part of a doctor in the clinic, white lab coat donned, and told me as I laid on an exam table that I needed to \u201clisten more\u201d when I asked him what ailed me.\u00a0 I smiled at his excitement for the carousal and even though the batteries were conking out in my camera, I was able to snap a picture of GC and the Roc before the ride started. We saved the best for last and I smiled to see the Roc\u2019s reaction to the \u201cRiver Adventures\u201d exhibit.\u00a0 WATER.\u00a0 He was in heaven. I did have to bribe the Roc to leave, as it was already 8:30 pm, but I smiled as he said he wanted to come back again.\u00a0 And that he wanted to come back with the B\u2019s.\u00a0 We drove home exhausted from a very full day.\u00a0 A day in which I celebrated the knowledge of good friends and deepening friendships, rejoiced to see the Roc try a sport, cheer and be cheered for, and share something with only his father.\u00a0 An evening spent with a wonderful family, watching our 2 little boys enjoy each other and have fun in a place just for kids on a night that was just for them. I smiled thinking over how lucky we are to have our friends who have made this state finally start to feel like home, to have our boy, to have each other, and to experience all we get to experience. After a long week I really needed a day like Saturday. My cheeks hurt from all the smiling.

{"date": "February 15, 2010", "body": "I started looking forward to our trip to Arizona as soon as\u00a0I clicked the purchase button on the Expedia confirmation page many months ago.\u00a0 And\u00a0now it\u2019s over.\u00a0 We are back home, with\u00a0much more snow on the ground than when we left.\u00a0 I\u2019ve now set my sights on spring and am anticipating the fence that will enclose our minuscule yard\u00a0(hint hint GC)\u00a0and the flowers and vegetables I will plant along it\u2019s border. And now on to the details of our trip: Traveling with the Roc went well.\u00a0 I was worried\u00a0about this being his first trip through the airport sans stroller, but he was a rock star, and rarely looked over his shoulder at the swarm of people behind him.\u00a0 He did have a hard time waiting in line to get through security at the Philly airport, and for the umpteenth time I wished they would hire more helpful and polite souls, is it too much to ask?\u00a0 Maybe someday?\u00a0 Probably not.\u00a0 In the 9 years I\u2019ve lived out here, the Philly airport is never a friendly place to be. The bathroom was another area of concern\u00a0well before the day of travel\u00a0for the Roc, but he faced his fear and used the bathroom on the plane, and then we were lucky to find a fairly empty bathroom at the Denver airport, and he willingly went inside wearing his headphones.\u00a0 I think the water he guzzled during our 4+ hour flight and the pressure on his tiny bladder had something to do with it.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t bolt from the bathroom as soon as the stall door was opened and even used the hand dryer.\u00a0 Simply amazing stuff for him.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t help grinning at a woman who did a double take as we came out of the bathroom.\u00a0 Yup, my kid rocks the headphone look. We arrived to nice weather but relaxed in the house that afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0 The Roc was consumed with his need for nourishment and ate a snack as soon as we got there, and wanted dinner almost immediately after.\u00a0 He went to bed early that night. On Saturday we went to Saguaro National Park (East) and took a hike.\u00a0 I just love the desert landscape and the Roc\u2019s need this year to be photographed by the different cati. After our hike we headed downtown to an awesome restaurant, where we got to eat outside in the courtyard.\u00a0 Not bad for February (and I was nice this year, I didn\u2019t call my sister in Minnesota while sipping my margarita in the sun, but I thought about it.) After dinner we took a walk to see the fountains (it was the Roc\u2019s reward for good behavior at the restaurant.) I couldn\u2019t help but trying to snap a picture of the mountains through the window as we drove back to the house.\u00a0 They are so beautiful when the sun starts to descend throwing shadows all around. We woke up to cloudy skies and rain in the forecast on Sunday.\u00a0 (The news people go NUTS about rain and the possibility of snow in the lower elevations there.\u00a0 And the weather guy used words like snizzle and graupel to describe snow.\u00a0 Watching the weather was always good for a giggle.)\u00a0 So we made the rounds at the health food stores in the area, baked brownies, and my Mom made a fort for the Roc to play in.\u00a0 She even got in there herself! Better weather was forecasted for Monday so we went to the desert museum, and on the way we stopped for a picnic, which the Roc fully enjoyed. I enjoyed the view (and the fact that I wasn\u2019t back home where snow was starting to fall for the second time in less than a week!) The Roc enjoyed walking through the desert museum and he started something that continued throughout the trip:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll climb on this rock, and you take my picture Mommy.\u201d Not only were there lots of rocks to climb at the desert museum, there were some pretty cool animals to see. We finally saw some javelinas up close! On Tuesday we went to Sabino Canyon.\u00a0 This year we had to ride the tram into the canyon because it\u2019s almost 4 miles to the end and then another 4 miles back to the car, and no more stroller for the Roc. He said he didn\u2019t want to ride the tram, but he did fine once it started moving.\u00a0 A benefit to riding the tram was being able to learn more about the canyon and have little things pointed out to us like Snoopy sleeping on his back.\u00a0 See him? As soon as the Roc got off the tram he found a rock to climb, and instructed me to photograph him. Then he wanted to get moving so he could see Sabino creek.\u00a0 We took the first trail down and he clambered over the rocks to get close. My parents stayed a little lower. After watching the water for awhile we convinced the Roc to continue down the road and we walked on, before stopping for lunch and then again later for a snack, all the while reminding the Roc that he didn\u2019t have to walk the whole way back to the parking lot, we could get back on the tram.\u00a0 He repeatedly said he didn\u2019t want to ride the tram and so he ended up walking the whole thing.\u00a0 3.8 miles. Pretty good (and not too much whining.) It rained on Wednesday so we spent another day indoors.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to entertain the Roc indoors while in Arizona.\u00a0\u00a0My water obsessed son\u00a0took three (yes, 3!) baths that day.\u00a0 Nuff said. It cleared up on Thursday so we offered the Roc a choice of activities, the zoo or hiking.\u00a0 My outdoor boy chose hiking, and I wasn\u2019t surprised.\u00a0 We headed back to Saguaro National Park (East) to hike a trail that is deemed \u201cstrenuous\u201d\u00a0because of it\u2019s uphill nature.\u00a0 Second to the Roc\u2019s love of water is his love of climbing rocks.\u00a0 We hiked part of this trail last year and he did well going up, going down was hard on him and we had to lift him down steep sections, and I vividly remember piggy backing him for a portion at the end.\u00a0\u00a0 A year later (and a few inches grown) proved to be even better.\u00a0 He followed close on the heels of his grandfather the whole afternoon. We hiked up to the same spot we stopped at last year, and then instead of going back down like we did in 09, we hiked up even further, before heading back down to the car. Friday was our last full day in the desert and we took advantage of the nice weather and headed out for another hike.\u00a0 My Mom had a terrible headache (the result of her flights to Atlanta and then Jamaica being canceled two days in a row I\u2019m sure) so it was just my father, the Roc and I.\u00a0 My Dad picked a trail the Roc and I had never been on before, and his pick didn\u2019t dissapoint.\u00a0 It was steep, and the Roc loved it. Around the time we thought we should turn back we found a pond, so we stopped to rest and let the Roc refuel before heading back. On the way back I was really digging the way the light lit up these teddy bear chollas.\u00a0 Don\u2019t they look soft? Look close, you can see the path on the side of the hill. The Roc did awesome on the way back down, so he got to have a lollipop in the car and then pizza for dinner! I had to pack up that night and was sad to do so.\u00a0 We always have such a great time in Arizona.\u00a0 I was not looking forward to going home to lots of snow, cold, and most likely gray weather.\u00a0 Our return flights went relatively well.\u00a0 The first, and shorter flight to Denver went fine.\u00a0 I got the Roc to watch a movie and he didn\u2019t give me too much grief.\u00a0 Once we got to Denver we rode the moving walkways and sat by a window watching the planes before boarding.\u00a0 The final flight was a long one.\u00a0 The Roc didn\u2019t want to watch a movie, or watch the (FREE!) TV, didn\u2019t want to color with markers, eat what I brought for him, play with his tag reader, or be read to. And he definitely didn\u2019t want me to read my book. It.was.a.long.flight. And now we are home. And it\u2019s cold.\u00a0 And there\u2019s lots of snow on the ground. We\u2019ll make the best of it. And dream of spring, then summer, and then Arizona in 2011.

{"date": "March 30, 2010", "body": "I joined a book club about a year ago.\u00a0 I was nervous to go to my first meeting because this particular book club has been getting together for about 3 years, so their friendships are pretty solid.\u00a0 Also, I\u2019m not good at pushing my way into group conversations, I hate feeling like an outsider, and I feel like a different person than the one they first met 3+ years ago.\u00a0 I knew some of the women from the short amount of time I spent in the \u201cMom\u2019s Club\u201d here in our town.\u00a0 I never really got a chance to make friends during my time in the Mom\u2019s club because the Roc wouldn\u2019t let me get close to anyone, literally.\u00a0 The events we attended were spent on the fringe of the crowd.\u00a0 He was easily upset and didn\u2019t have an interest in doing whatever the other children were doing.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know at the time that he had autism.\u00a0 I faded away from the events because it was just too hard, and when I figured out that the Roc had autism, I quit going all together.\u00a0 It was way too hard.\u00a0 I felt so incredibly lonely during the the time after the Roc\u2019s diagnosis.\u00a0 I poured all my energy into him, it was all I could do to keep moving forward.\u00a0 Once the Roc entered special ed preschool I started to meet other special needs moms, a whole other breed of parent, just like me.\u00a0 I continued to sporadically attend the Mom\u2019s Club scrapbooking night but kept my mouth shut most of the time.\u00a0 I felt like I couldn\u2019t relate to any of the moms anymore.\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t want to cut myself off completely, just because these ladies had neurotypical children didn\u2019t mean that I couldn\u2019t be friends with them, and even though I felt on the outside, I could try to change that.\u00a0 And so a year ago I asked one of them if there was still room in the book club.\u00a0 I needed to get out more and knew that having two nights a month that were scheduled would help push me back into the world.\u00a0 I felt like I\u2019d been in hiding since the diagnosis. So I started going to the book club, and it felt strange.\u00a0 Suddenly I didn\u2019t know what to say to these women.\u00a0 How could I describe what my life was like without bringing everyone down?\u00a0 Or the flip side of how could I convey the importance of the Roc finally calling me Mommy at 4 years old?\u00a0 The joy was so deep for me, but I worried it would be meaningless to them.\u00a0 They had no frame of reference.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know what to share.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t relate to their struggles with their children and they certainly didn\u2019t relate to mine.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know if I made them uncomfortable when I mentioned my son.\u00a0 I was and sometimes still am struggling mightily with the realities of my life.\u00a0 With autism.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know what to share, and so I didn\u2019t share anything at all.\u00a0 Most of the time I kept my mouth shut. Until now. Last week during our monthly get together we were talking about kiddie shows that make us cringe when someone joked that they told their son that Barney \u201cwas for slow kids\u201d to keep him from watching it.\u00a0 Everyone at the table giggled.\u00a0 Except me.\u00a0 The conversation went on without me and I stayed frozen in that moment.\u00a0 And it stayed with me all night.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t say anything though I thought of so many things I could have/should have said in that moment or afterward.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if she actually did say this to her son or if she was just trying to be funny, the wine was flowing that night (I don\u2019t drink wine so I was stone cold sober) and maybe that had something to do with her joke.\u00a0 I do not think she really thought about what she said and all of it\u2019s implications.\u00a0 She is a genuinely nice person, I think they all are, but it made me think. Then the  smockity frock  uproar happened.\u00a0 And we in the autism community realized that we have much work to do to create understanding and compassion for our children. And I decided it was time for me to open my mouth and speak to this small group of women.\u00a0 To start sharing what life is like at our house.\u00a0 The pain, the anguish, and the unbelievable joy that comes with raising the Roc.\u00a0 For them to know me, really know me, and to understand.\u00a0 I could keep to myself or I could branch out.\u00a0 I knew the only way that I could stay in the group was if I branched out and let them into my life.\u00a0 I thought about how to accomplish this because I certainly don\u2019t want to speak AT them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to give a speech.\u00a0 But I want to be able to discuss this life, my life.\u00a0 Then my Mom told me about a book she just read about a boy with autism and his dog that was very good.\u00a0 She said she cried in a few parts, especially when the author described her grief after the diagnosis, and she could see me, her daughter in the author\u2019s words, and that gave me an idea.\u00a0 I ordered the book, waited anxiously to read it, and wasted no time when the book arrived and I had it in my hot little hands.\u00a0 It was around midnight when I finished the book and with tears slipping down my cheeks I logged onto my email.\u00a0 I knew what I was going to do and I drafted an email to my book club.\u00a0 The next morning I sent it: Good Morning ladies, I am hosting book club in May and I read a  book that I really want for my pick, but it is not  available in the library.\u00a0 I do not want people to have to buy this book  and am suggesting that I transfer it between the 5 of you.\u00a0 I am  totally willing to drive the book between people as you finish it.\u00a0 We  have almost two months and the book is a little over 200 pages\u2013so not  big-I actually started it around 6 pm and finished it the same  night. The book is \u201cA Friend Like Henry\u201d by Nuala Gardner. The  blurb on the front cover reads:\u00a0 \u201cThe remarkable true story of an  autistic boy and the dog that unlocked his world.\u201d I think all of  you know that my 5 year old son, the Roc, has autism.\u00a0 While I do not want  people to groan inwardly when they see me and think \u201cHere comes Kim, her  kid has autism and it\u2019s all she talks about,\u201d I do want people to  understand.\u00a0 To have an understanding of what autism is and what it is  like for our family.\u00a0 I want to share the joy of my son with you and  know that you understand the significance of all the small things we  celebrate at our house (for instance, the Roc can finally put on his own  shoes and velcro them\u2026that\u2019s HUGE in our house.\u00a0 The process to teach  him, for him to overcome his frustration, break it down into steps, and  complete them on his own.\u00a0 HUGE.)\u00a0 I do not want people to be uncomfortable around  me and I don\u2019t want to hold back in sharing this integral part of my  life with you all. Please let me know what you think.\u00a0 I hope I  am not being pushy, I just really want to share more of who I am and  what my life is really like with you all. I waited anxiously for the first reply and got just what I was hoping for: Kim, I am totally open to reading and understanding more about autism. It is  so prevalent now that it very easily could be any one of us in your  shoes. Every one of us as moms and women should be able to share with  each other and support each other and I am more than willing to do that,  no matter what it is about. Kim, don\u2019t ever feel like you have to hold  stuff in because we will think you are \u201cthe autism mom\u201d or whatever  because I don\u2019t feel like any of us would ever in a million years be  like that. and: I second that. and then this: Hey Kim. I can\u2019t wait to read this.\u00a0 The beauty about this book club is that  you can have a reason, or no reason for the selection.\u00a0It just makes it  all the better to know that your selection is personal and close to  your heart. I look forward to being able to learn more about autism, about you  and the everyday trials and challenges through your selection. And\u00a0all of us\u00a0share the common joy of children, no matter how  different each one of our children\u2019s\u00a0personalities and needs may be. I\u2019m looking forward to talking about my life, about the Roc, about how far he has come and how hard he works everyday.\u00a0 The grief, the anguish, the unbelievable joy.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking forward to hearing what they think of the book, what they learned about autism, and I hope they have questions for me.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m looking forward to answering them. \n I\u2019m looking forward to spreading awareness. \n \n I\u2019m looking forward to sharing. \n \n I\u2019m looking forward to branching out and letting them in. \n \n To be continued\u2026 \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/autism-unexpected/2010/mar/28/when-autistic-behavior-misunderstood/"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2010/03/30/an-email-i-sent-yesterday/", "title": "An Email I Sent\u00a0Yesterday"},

I\u2019ve felt that way for a long time.\u00a0 In fact, I may have felt that way since not long after I got here.\u00a0 Here being the East Coast.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t regret moving here.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not what I want it to be.\u00a0 It\u2019s just not where I thought I would end up. See, I always fancied myself to be a West Coast kind of girl.\u00a0 I spent the first twenty two years of my life in Minnesota.\u00a0 When applying for college I entertained the notion of Colorado as well as California.\u00a0 But I stayed in state for the proximity of parents, friends, and in state tuition (paid for by my parents if I stayed in-state or if I went to a nearby reciprocity state.)\u00a0 After college I moved to Nebraska for a job.\u00a0 Nebraska lasted a mere 12 months, the length of my lease.\u00a0 When GC and I met, I moved to New Jersey because, well, that  had  to be better than Nebraska, right?\u00a0 In some ways it was. But ever since we\u2019ve been together we\u2019ve talked about moving.\u00a0 Sometimes we kick ourselves for not moving when we were DINKS, it would have been much easier then.\u00a0 We were living in New Jersey and knew we wanted to get out.\u00a0 More me than him, it\u2019s his home state.\u00a0 Lots of friends and memories tie him to New Jersey.\u00a0 Maybe I wasn\u2019t in the right area of the state, or a didn\u2019t meet the right people, but I never felt at home there.\u00a0 I always looked ahead to the day we would move out.\u00a0 We saw our chance when GC got a good job offer in a neighboring state. Not long after moving and buying this house we put it on the market.\u00a0 We were going to move to North Carolina.\u00a0 The good job was bought out by another company and he could work at the headquarters in NC, even though his new team was in Dallas (no way I was moving to Dallas!)\u00a0 It was right at the down turn in the housing market.\u00a0 Our house didn\u2019t sell and GC got offered another job here with much better pay.\u00a0 He took it, and we stayed. A year or so later Autism appeared on our radar.\u00a0 Immediately I wanted to move back to Minnesota.\u00a0 Suddenly I felt as though I couldn\u2019t handle this life and I desperately needed to be near my family.\u00a0 But, again, it wasn\u2019t the right time to sell for many reasons, and as time went by I felt as though I was getting my feet under me again.\u00a0 I slowly started to feel stronger.\u00a0 I realized I was handling it.\u00a0 We were handling it.\u00a0 Life could still be good.\u00a0 But this wanderlust bug still gets to me. We went to Colorado this summer for vacation.\u00a0 GC lived there before we met.\u00a0 He told me I would love it.\u00a0 And I did.\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 Giddily we talked about moving again.\u00a0 I joined a Denver special needs yahoo group, but I have not read positives about the schools and kids like mine.\u00a0 Poor funding, IEPs not being followed, restraint being used, bullying not being taken seriously, services not available, long, long wait lists.\u00a0 I looked at the special education scorecards for that state as well as a few others.\u00a0 Colorado isn\u2019t matching up as well as other states we could move to.\u00a0 We put Colorado on the back burner.\u00a0 Even though it has many things to offer, it may not be the best fit for us.\u00a0 So we decided to wait. But at times we still feel overwhelmed and talk about moving to be near either sets of grandparents.\u00a0 Having help would be so nice.\u00a0 A night out.\u00a0 Some time together to be us again.\u00a0 Someone we trust and who loves the Roc to take him for the weekend.\u00a0 But the my in-laws live in Myrtle Beach, and South Carolina isn\u2019t the best state for special education.\u00a0 And while Minnesota has my parents, my sister, and a couple girls that know and love me and mine, it. is. frigid.\u00a0 It\u2019s the COLD, the length of the winter, my SAD and Raynauds, the fact that the Roc is an outdoor kid and has been complaining about the snow and his hatred for his winter jacket, his hat, his glove, etc., that keep us from committing to moving to that albeit beautiful, but frozen tundra of a state.\u00a0 (You totally can\u2019t deny it Minnesotans, not when you post about the -5 degree wake up temps in your facebook status! Brrr!)\u00a0 Even if we wanted to move, the housing market is still in a slump around here. For now we are stuck. So instead we travel and I can\u2019t seem to get enough.\u00a0 I look forward to getting away from this state as soon as I get back.\u00a0 So here I am yet again perusing the travel sites for a place to go.\u00a0 Then GC mentioned his friend TJ who lives in San Diego, who graciously offered to be our tour guide if we want to come visit, and I went into a tizzy dreaming about the California sun, the West Coast, a beautiful place to be during the winter.\u00a0 Do they even have winter there?\u00a0 No?\u00a0 That sounds like heaven. Do you know what you just opened yourself up to TJ? Apparently TJ (a former New Jersey boy) describes his California existence as \u201cbeing on vacation every day.\u201d\u00a0 Well, we may come join your \u201cvacation\u201d in April if you were really serious about having us! Now I just have to convince GC to take a few days of his precious vacation and spend a few bucks to get us there. I think it\u2019s a reasonable request. Don\u2019t you?

Because like my boy, her boy has Autism too. And up until that Valentine\u2019s day class party her son didn\u2019t really understand holiday celebrations, didn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d as she put it on facebook.\u00a0 Class parties are something that other moms may complain about, \u201coh crap, I have to make cupcakes/cookies/brownies for the class party/birthday celebration.\u201d\u00a0 While that may not be you, dear reader, I\u2019ve read some similar statements as status updates from moms of typical kids, always causing me to think \u201cif you only knew\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Us mommies of kids with needs know how it feels to wish for the typical experience.\u00a0 To be a \u201cfinger quote\u201d normal mom.\u00a0 To make cupcakes, to have a child excited for a class party, and for that to be the norm, ho hum, an everyday activity. I went out to lunch with this dear friend the other day.\u00a0 We can fill up hours talking, switching subjects, going off on tangents before coming back to the finish off a thought.\u00a0 She makes me laugh, and to my delight, she gets my sense of humor, even finds me humorous!\u00a0 We discussed this glorious cupcake moment, her status update, and the way it felt to, in her words, \u201csavor the moment.\u201d To savor the typical. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of savoring this week as the Roc has talked my ear off, not all of it making sense as he valiantly tries to explain something to me.\u00a0 His language is coming along and he tries so hard.\u00a0 He even asks me, \u201cdoes that make sense Mommy?\u201d and I almost always tell him \u201cyes.\u201d\u00a0 He likes to retell something I\u2019ve explained to him, and I hear myself when he speaks; so I have an idea of what he is grasping, and just how much is sliding over his head.\u00a0 The \u201cwh\u201d questions have begun to pour forth. \u201cWhere is the water going?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhy do dogs bark?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat is that little boy\u2019s name?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWho are you talking to on the phone?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhen\u201d questions have yet to appear, but I see them on the horizon.\u00a0 I never tire of these questions, I\u2019ve waited so long to answer them.\u00a0 His eye contact has increased, and he holds my gaze much longer than he did a year ago, and boy do I love looking into those big blue eyes.\u00a0 Last night he trilled \u201cwatch me mommy!\u201d as he bounced a big ball on the floor and then caught it, ever so proud.\u00a0 GC nudged me and I stopped in my tracks, our eyes locked, savoring the sound of \u201cwatch me!\u201d\u00a0 He begs for me to sleep in his room at night, and tries to stall bedtime like any other kid, telling me \u201cit\u2019s too scary in here,\u201d and tugging at my heart with, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be lonely in here without you.\u201d\u00a0 Oh yes, I\u2019m savoring the manipulation.\u00a0 What might exasperate other mothers makes me smile every night.\u00a0 The sound of his little voice as he sings songs from school while in the bath at night, every night I hear this, and every night I smile.\u00a0 His voice, gosh I love to hear his voice. Then I got the following email from the special ed teacher yesterday while waiting for the bus to deliver the Roc from school: \u201cHi there!\u00a0 Had a crazy afternoon so I didn\u2019t get a chance to write in his book.\u00a0 He had an AWESOME day!\u00a0 He literally came in smiling!!!!!\u00a0 It was soooo cute.. I asked him for a hug and he said \u201cNo!\u201d so I told him I was sad.\u00a0 Two other girls came up and said \u201cI will give you a hug\u201d and before I could look at him, he was standing right next to me waiting to give me one!\u00a0 It was soo cute, like he felt bad that I didn\u2019t get a hug from him!\u00a0 So cute, he was just on all day, answering questions, participating, etc.\u00a0 I hope he continues to do that at home too :)\u00a0 Have a good night! and I savored the moment, reading about a good day, a day where he just may have been indistinguishable from his peers. I thought about my good friend, about all of this savoring, and about how as she started to get comments on her \u201ccupcake baking\u201d status she added this: \u201cAutism certainly causes you to never take anything for granted.\u00a0 Seriously, I poured the whole of my motherhood into those cupcakes today.\u00a0 Baked with love and thankfulness for a child who is progressing far beyond my wildest imagination.\u00a0 Deep life lessons found in cupcakes\u2026 I\u2019m just so happy I could cry.\u201d And my eyes filled with tears.

The walk/trot (he doesn\u2019t like to stand while the horse is trotting and we heard him saying \u201cnot too fast\u201d as they went by us!) Second place again! And finally, walking over poles: First place! It was over pretty quickly, but the Roc enjoyed himself and held onto his ribbons on the way home.\u00a0 After a quick lunch we headed back out the door for an afternoon of fishing.\u00a0 The Roc had never fished before so we attended the DFRC fishing derby hosted by Reel Expectations.\u00a0 The Roc was paired with an expert fishing buddy, who cast and snagged the fish, and then let the Roc reel them in. With a little help from GC, of course. It was  hot , so even though the fishing derby was going until 4 pm, we headed home early and all three of us hit the pool. A busy Saturday.\u00a0 A day in which the Roc tried his best, was rewarded, and then hours later tried something totally new, and was rewarded with his very own fishing pole!\u00a0 A good day.

I hoped. For the past 6 weeks he did all that and more.\u00a0 He looked forward to each game, wore his uniform with pride \u2013 including the hat, wanted his daddy to be his buddy, wanted to get there in time to \u201cwarm up,\u201d stayed in the dugout and outfield when he was supposed to, took his turns up to bat, ran the bases, went through the line and high five\u2019d the other team after each game, and  smiled  the whole time. Last night was the last baseball game of the season and a first for the Roc.\u00a0 Last week coach Steve told the Roc that he wouldn\u2019t be using the tee this week, that he would hit off a pitch.\u00a0 Coach Steve was adamant that the Roc could do it, and we followed his lead.\u00a0 As I was helping the Roc into his baseball uniform he brought up what coach Steve said the week before and told me he didn\u2019t want to get hit by the ball.\u00a0 I assured him that coach Steve would be super careful and that he could do it, all he had to do was try. He fretted about it on the way to the game. When it was his turn up to bat GC helped him with his stance, coach Steve tossed the ball, the Roc took a swing, and on the 3rd try\u2026he HIT it!

{"date": "June 9, 2010", "body": "This morning I awoke at exactly 5:55 am with a little ball of dread lodged in my stomach.\u00a0 While the rest of the house slept, Guinness and I headed out for our morning walk, trying not to trip on the cats who ran under foot hoping I would follow them to the basement and feed them.\u00a0 The ball of dread came along and I thought about how I was to approach the morning.\u00a0 The Roc had a dentist appointment at 9:15 am and I was worrying about how it would go.\u00a0 Will I ever not worry? I had mentioned the dentist appointment the night before and reminded him again when he woke up.\u00a0 He reminded me that it was Wednesday and that he had swimming lessons.\u00a0 To which I replied \u201cThe dentist  AND  swimming lessons!\u00a0 Wow!\u00a0 You are lucky!\u201d and he smiled.\u00a0 Off we went. The Roc waited nicely in the waiting room, if you count bouncing in your chair, speedily swinging your legs, and repeatedly saying \u201cIt\u2019s not the LOBBY, it\u2019s the WAITING ROOM\u201d in a singsong voice, over and over and over.\u00a0 I was happy to see the same hygienist as the  last visit , which went well \u2013 she was actually able to clean his teeth.\u00a0 I was hoping for the same today.\u00a0 She asked me to come back in the hallway and we spoke of his health, the 2 teeth he lost in the last 6 weeks, and then she mentioned she was going to try for some x-rays.\u00a0 I smiled, waved bye-bye to the Roc, whispered \u201cGood Luck!\u201d to her, and then headed back to the lobby, I mean waiting room.\u00a0 I was deeply engrossed in my new library book when the hygienist came back out to get me. As we walked I asked her how he did and she smiled wide and said \u201cGREAT!\u00a0 He did even better than last time, I had read through my notes from our last visit early this morning and was looking forward to seeing him.\u00a0 I cleaned and polished his teeth and was even able to x-ray the front.\u00a0 I\u2019ll wait until next time to do more x-rays, didn\u2019t want to overwhelm him.\u00a0 But he did great and I\u2019m sure you noticed those permanent teeth coming through in the back?\u201d Um\u2026 Nope. \u201cHe\u2019s teething?\u201d\u00a0 I asked.\u00a0 \u201cYup,\u201d she said as she rounded the corner and walked into the space where the Roc lay back on the dental chair gazing out the window.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHas he been a little bit irritable lately?\u201d\u00a0 She asked. \u201cUm\u2026a little?\u00a0 Try a LOT irritable!\u201d\u00a0 I blurted. \u201cWell, he probably hasn\u2019t been too comfortable lately and that may have something to do with his attitude,\u201d\u00a0 she told me and then went on to show me the two bottom molars that are still partially covered by gum and the one on top that has started to break through.\u00a0 The other one on the top hasn\u2019t begun to break through, but it\u2019s going to soon.\u00a0 She showed me the x-rays and how his front teeth are coming out next, one of them loose already.\u00a0 Then she had the Roc pick out a sticker and a new toothbrush and we were on our way. I was so taken aback to learn about the permanent teeth coming in that I didn\u2019t really digest the fact that he. did. great.\u00a0 At the dentist.\u00a0 Again.\u00a0 I love that this office has been so accommodating to us, letting me bring him in to see the office and say hello before his first 2 visits, having a lot of patience with him, and not forcing things like cleanings and x-rays until he was comfortable.\u00a0 This hygienist knew that getting 2 x-rays was all he could handle and she followed his lead.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t ask for anything more. Whether the 4 new molars ripping their way through his gums has anything to do with his attitude in recent weeks?\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing so.\u00a0 But I know enough to know that it doesn\u2019t explain it all away.\u00a0 I think those teeth were the icing on his crabby cake, they may be what pushed him over the edge of his cranky cliff.\u00a0 Only time will tell. *** We survived day 2 of our 3 weeks of togetherness.\u00a0 Yesterday (day 1) we went to Longwood Gardens (man am I glad I bought the season pass!) and had a fine time in weather that was so perfect it reminded me of summer in Minnesota.\u00a0 Sunny, crystal blue skies, slight breeze lifting the green leaves, low humidity.\u00a0 Did I say perfect yet?\u00a0 I ached to be back home yesterday and thought of my Mom upon viewing every garden, she loves flowers and she adored Longwood when she was here visiting last fall.\u00a0 The Roc spent most of the day like this, only coming apart at the seams when we got home that afternoon.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have a corresponding picture for that, but am thinking I should take one, I\u2019ll have ample time to do so in the next couple weeks.\u00a0 I literally watched the clock those 3+ hours, waiting for GC to come home and take over.\u00a0 The Roc spent a lot of time in his room for sassing me.\u00a0 Time outs are not all that affective, but I needed him to be out of my reach\u2026I so wanted to wipe that smirk off his face.\u00a0 He got to me and he knew it.\u00a0 I spent the rest of the night reading while GC did the bedtime battle.\u00a0 Here\u2019s to a husband who knows when his wife has had enough. Our perfect weather ended today, it\u2019s been raining and even though I\u2019m terribly sick of listening to the Roc whine this afternoon, I\u2019m hoping this rain will breath new life into our already torched grass.\u00a0 Besides the dentist visit we\u2019ve run errands, watched movies, played, and the Roc has talked my ear off about leaving for swimming lessons.\u00a0 He keeps moving the picture up on his schedule, as if by moving it up we will really will leave sooner. And now it really is time to leave.\u00a0 Day 2 is almost over. Thank you for all your comments and suggestions on yesterdays post.\u00a0 I love that I can vent and plead, and you all take the time to read and answer.\u00a0 I am so grateful to not feel alone in this.

I try, try, try to stay positive.\u00a0 I focus on the progress, the little bits and the big jumps both make me feel like the Roc is moving uphill, at his own pace.\u00a0 But sometimes it feels like we are slipping or stalling out.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how to discipline this child.\u00a0 There is nothing I can lord over his head, nothing I can take away, no threat and follow through that works.\u00a0 Screaming doesn\u2019t work, (don\u2019t know why I still try that one out at least once a day\u2026)\u00a0 I feel like I\u2019m missing something, some clue on what to do with this child.\u00a0 How to reason or make him understand.\u00a0 I\u2019m frustrated and worn out.\u00a0 Some days I\u2019m ready to throw in the towel and the sun has barely risen.

We have been having major bedtime battles.\u00a0 This boy who would do x, y, z, in that order, used to go off to bed without a peep.\u00a0 After the last story had been read I would slide out of his room with a \u201cGoodnight, I love you, I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d gently close the door, wipe my brow, take a deep breath, and get on with my evening.\u00a0 My time.\u00a0 Now he throws out every excuse he can come up with to stall bedtime.\u00a0 \u201cI have to go potty!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI want to play!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s too dark in here!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMy tummy hurts, I need a snack!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMommy, I want to talk to you!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMommy, I  NEED  to talk to you!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI need water!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNO, not in a cup!\u00a0 In my water bottle!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI am the adult and you are the child!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t make me!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHey, don\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d\u00a0 And on and on.\u00a0 He completely defies us when we tell him he has to go to bed, he comes right out of his room and runs around.\u00a0 We won\u2019t chase him but he runs if we look in his direction.\u00a0 He says he will go to the bathroom and then climbs on his rocking horse.\u00a0 We put him back in his room, he comes right back out.\u00a0 He screeches and screams and writhes on the floor as we try in vain to get him to bed.\u00a0 7:30 bedtime has stretched to after 10 pm most nights.\u00a0 That sass that started at the dinner table?\u00a0 Not so cute anymore. But it\u2019s not just at bedtime or the dinner table where we are battling.\u00a0 Everything is a battle.\u00a0 Anything he dislikes in the slightest is cause for a battle complete with guttural screeching, screaming, tomato red face, and foot stomping.\u00a0 It\u2019s maddening and so wearing. We tried using the happy/frowny face slips his teacher used at the beginning of the year.\u00a0 We threaten with no dessert or no pool, but have to be careful that those things aren\u2019t too far away time wise, or they hold no value.\u00a0 I pulled out his picture schedule to plan our days and he\u2019s been using it religiously.\u00a0 Though now instead of just following the schedule, he will take off the \u201cgo to the bus stop\u201d and \u201cgo to school\u201d pictures and put them away telling me that he doesn\u2019t have to go to school.\u00a0 Very crafty indeed, but it doesn\u2019t work that way kid!\u00a0 We have been ignoring some of the things he does just for a reaction in hopes that he will tone it down if he doesn\u2019t get a reaction, all the while reassuring each other that \u201cthis too shall pass.\u201d Please tell me it will. Please, oh please, oh please\u2026let this be a phase.\u00a0 A developmental milestone he\u2019s hitting 2-3 years late. Please. I am almost out of resources.

{"date": "April 14, 2010", "body": "About a month ago I attempted to take the Roc and Guinness to the local dog park.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t go well, read about it  here .\u00a0 But I don\u2019t give up easily with this kid, because if I did, we\u2019d never be able to go the places that we do.\u00a0 It takes a lot of preparation to go someplace new.\u00a0 Lots of description, lots of talking (from me, not so much him,) and looking at pictures if available.\u00a0 It helps him understand what is expected when told \u201cThere is no screaming at the dog park,\u201d as well as gives him an idea of what may happen so he is not as upset when something \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d (for his world) happens.\u00a0 It keeps his anxiety levels in check.\u00a0 Anxiety being a big precursor to melt downs. I didn\u2019t prep him last time, which was our first attempt at visiting the dog park, and what a disaster.\u00a0 We both paid the price for my lack of foresight and I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t do that again.\u00a0 When we got back home we talked a lot about the dog park and we\u2019ve had small conversations about it in the weeks since.\u00a0 So last Monday, the first day in our week of all day togetherness (which roughly translates to my being an all day entertainer for my son who lacks those skills necessary to entertain himself,) I casually asked him if he wanted to try the dog park again and this time, if things went well, he could play on the playground afterward.\u00a0 I received a very enthusiastic \u201cYes, I would!\u00a0 I will play on the playground and see the fountains.\u201d Alrighty.\u00a0 I reiterated that the playground would come  after  dog park success. On the drive over we spoke about who might be at the dog park, what we would see, different types of dogs, and that there would be people in the dog park.\u00a0 Just a little refresher.\u00a0 Kind of a verbal social story.\u00a0 As I drove into the parking lot I immediately noticed the small herd of big dogs in the \u201clarge dog park,\u201d and no one in the \u201csmall dog park.\u201d\u00a0 No one. Not one little dog. We had the place to ourselves! No worries now.\u00a0 So the Roc got to explore, try out the water fountain and push the button for the doggie water fountain.\u00a0 And they both RAN while I threw a ball. All that prep. But not for nothing because after spending some time on the playground, the Roc wanted to go back in the dog park and run with Guinness some more.\u00a0 And this time, there were a couple ladies with their little dogs in the small dog park.\u00a0 As we approached I gently reminded the Roc that there were people and dogs here now and it would be different.\u00a0 I wondered how it was going to go, and I tried to remember if anyone from our disastrous first day was present.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t recognize anyone, but I tend to block everyone out except the Roc during any public spectacles. We went in and stayed near the entrance for a little while, bouncing and throwing the tennis ball for Guinness.\u00a0 Pretty soon the Roc wanted another drink from the water fountain and we edged our way over there.\u00a0 The water fountain is near a bench where the old ladies congregate to talk, and they love to talk to kids, except the Roc doesn\u2019t like strangers approaching him.\u00a0 I happened to be walking away from the water fountain to deal with a little \u201cgift\u201d Guinness was leaving on the ground when the Roc asked for help pushing the button.\u00a0 I yelled to him that I would be there in a second and one of the ladies popped up and said she would help him.\u00a0 I cringed inside as I watched the Roc bounce a step backwards with a wary look on his face, but the promise of a drink from the fountain was too enticing and he stepped forward to drink with a hesitant  \u201cokay . \u201c  She stood next to him, holding the button down, and he drank.\u00a0 When he was done she asked if it was good and he said yes before sprinting towards me.\u00a0 She laughed. She had no idea the amount of prep work that had gone into this morning  at the dog park.\u00a0 She had no idea how hard that exchange was for him.\u00a0 How far he has come to allow a stranger that close to him.\u00a0 To allow a stranger to help instead of Mommy.\u00a0 For him to say  \u201cokay\u201d  to her!\u00a0 My god!\u00a0 He spoke to a stranger!\u00a0 She had no idea how tight I was holding my breath, willing the Roc to keep it together.\u00a0 She had no idea how hard both of us had worked on making our second trip to the dog park more successful than the last.\u00a0 And as much as I wanted to share, to shout out his accomplishment, like I do every time something like this happens, I just quietly savored the moment.\u00a0 A small moment where a nice lady simply helped my son get a drink and he accepted the help. A small moment, but a HUGE one at the same time. We spent a little more time throwing the ball for Guinness and after a few \u201ctimes up soon\u201d warnings and the promise to bake something when we got home, we left.\u00a0 We left with success.\u00a0 A successful second trip to the dog park. Whew. I won\u2019t give up on this kid.\u00a0 Over and over he shows me why.\u00a0 Gives me reasons to keep reaching, keep working, keep guiding.\u00a0 He is worth it.\u00a0 I know that our next trip to the dog park my not go as smoothly, he may have issues again on another day.\u00a0 But, we both know what he is capable of, and I always hold that in my mind.

{"date": "April 20, 2010", "body": "Saturday was opening day for little league here in our town.\u00a0 A big deal for many, and this year, that included the Roc. The Roc was so excited to put on his uniform that morning and even donned the matching baseball cap and kept it on all day.\u00a0 So delighted in his uniform that he refused to wear a coat, but would allow a long sleeve undershirt \u2013 it was windy!\u00a0 As we walked to the middle school where the parade would start we discussed the order of events for the day:\u00a0 parade, opening ceremonies, team picture, and then the first game.\u00a0 I found it hard to prep for the first three activities as we had never done them before, we hadn\u2019t had an real game yet either, but I figured that would be similar to the 2 practices we had already attended. As we approached the big wall of kids and coaches in the middle school parking lot the Roc just stopped.\u00a0 Stopped still and wouldn\u2019t budge.\u00a0 I had been busy looking for the challenger division coordinator and the wall of people didn\u2019t even phase me until my arm locked up as he halted.\u00a0 I scooped him up and maneuvered through the crowd and he clung to me, not normal for him, so I knew he was really feeling anxious.\u00a0 Luckily the challenger team was scheduled to lead the parade and the kids got to ride in a  wagon so they were located right at the parking lot entrance and we didn\u2019t have to push too far into the mass of humanity.\u00a0 Once settled in the wagon the Roc seemed to zone out.\u00a0 Too much motion and noise.\u00a0 Too many bodies in one area.\u00a0 I wondered aloud to GC if he was going to freak out and I cringed as the coordinator hopped up onto the wagon to move him back to make room for a wheelchair.\u00a0 And then I marveled at how he held himself together while she spoke to him, and directed him out of the way.\u00a0 How he followed her directions and stood by while she held onto to him to keep him from getting squashed.\u00a0 Last year he would have shrunk back from her touch and he would have screeched at the intrusion.\u00a0 He was stiff and I could tell he was uncomfortable, but he didn\u2019t melt. As soon as the sign was given the wagon gate closed and the parade started.\u00a0 GC and I walked a few paces behind the wagon and tried to get the Roc to smile and wave.\u00a0 He would give us a brief smile but never did he wave.\u00a0 He seemed a bit shell shocked.\u00a0 As the parade started and a few bystanders clapped and waved at the kids I turned to GC and said, \u201cI\u2019m such a dork.\u00a0 These things always get to me.\u00a0 Looking at all these kids, seeing strangers smile and clap for them\u2026the Roc included\u2026\u201d\u00a0 to which he replied \u201cYou\u2019re going to cry aren\u2019t you?\u201d Almost, I just got a little teary eyed.\u00a0 Teary eyed for the kids, for their parents, and in appreciation for those who supported them instead of ignoring them.\u00a0 For those who smiled and waved back instead of looking through them, instead of looking down the street for their kid.\u00a0 There were many who looked into the wagon and then looked away.\u00a0 Many who didn\u2019t smile or wave.\u00a0 Many who have no clue\u2026but I refused to feel anything for them.\u00a0 But to those who clapped and cheered for the challenger kids:\u00a0 Thank you. The parade was short, just from the middle school to the nearby park.\u00a0 The challenger wagon was led to third base and the kids sat or roamed the area until the ceremony started.\u00a0 GC stayed with the Roc and I tried to hang back.\u00a0 I want this to be their thing, so I took pictures. After the ceremony we trooped over to where the team pictures would be taken, the Roc wasn\u2019t about to get into the shot and so GC ended up in the team picture!\u00a0 He is front and center with the Roc on his lap and another little boy draped on his arm!\u00a0 I was glad I signed the Roc up for an individual picture because I stood behind the photographer and on the third try, he got a good one!\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to get them now!\u00a0 My neighbor took a photo of all three of us as we waited for the rest of the team to be photographed. Then we went into the dugout to have a snack and the Roc protested my photographing him. After a quick snack they warmed up, the Roc caught the attention of a little cutie, and then they played the game! Three days later and I\u2019m still finding it hard to describe the way I felt as I watched GC and the Roc on Saturday.\u00a0 GC had always wanted a little boy and when the Roc was a  baby he mentioned how he would help him with sports, maybe even coach a  chosen sport one day.\u00a0 I kept this in mind when I signed the Roc up for  the challenger team and committed GC to be his buddy, before I even  told him about it.\u00a0 I knew it would be good for both of them.\u00a0 It was a dream come true, with a twist, for the Roc  to be on a baseball team and for GC to be his buddy.\u00a0 It may not be  exactly like he dreamed as he held his infant son, but I truly believe  it is better.\u00a0 There is no pressure on the challenger team.\u00a0 No score is kept.\u00a0 No competitive parents complaining about coaches or umpires, the position their child is playing, or the amount of time their child gets to play.\u00a0 That attitude has no place or purpose during our games.\u00a0 How refreshing for parents to support all the children, to celebrate what they CAN do, and cheer them on.\u00a0 To get back to the reason the kids want to play in the first place \u2013 FUN.

{"date": "April 22, 2010", "body": "A couple years ago when I had the idea that the Roc might be on the autism spectrum I started looking for information on the internet and was over whelmed.\u00a0 So much information.\u00a0 So many conflicting opinions.\u00a0 Where to start?\u00a0 Who was/is right? I started reading the message boards on the Autism Speaks website and was stunned by how cruel the posters were to each other and especially to those who were new to the diagnosis, just looking for some guidance.\u00a0 I quickly logged off that day.\u00a0 It was my first glimpse of the division within the autism community.\u00a0 The chasm that opens up between those with differing opinions on the cause(s) of autism, whether there is a \u201ccure\u201d or not, differing opinions on therapies, biomedical interventions, to label or not to label, whether we should say \u201cautistic\u201d or \u201cwith autism,\u201d and don\u2019t even mention vaccinations.\u00a0 The division that exists within a community of parents all trying to do the best for their children. I took what I could from the Autism Speaks website and moved on to others and started borrowing and buying books of my own.\u00a0 A year or so later I started to blog about the Roc, mainly for our family and friends, everyone living in a state other than the one in which we currently reside.\u00a0 Through blogging I found other autism mommies and a sense of community and most definitely support.\u00a0 I love to read about their children, cheer them on, and hopefully give some strength through rough times.\u00a0 I enjoy posting about the Roc\u2019s accomplishments and smile when I read comments and know that there are people who \u201cget it.\u201d\u00a0 Often I learn about new on-goings in research, therapies, etc. through some of my favorite blogs.\u00a0 But sometimes I am still blindsided by \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality that exists within this community. I have been reading some new blogs lately and have been reminded of just how deep that gulf between autism parents can be\u2026and I can\u2019t seem to stop thinking about it.\u00a0 The callous way some will sling insults from the safety of their  keyboards.\u00a0 The judgmental words sit solidly in my chest and stay with  me longer than I want them to.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that one of the things we rage  about when we speak about the awareness we want for our children?\u00a0 The judgment we feel is passed on them and thus our parenting abilities?\u00a0 Certainly I cannot be the only one who finds this ironic? I know it will not change in the near future, but I just wish it wasn\u2019t so hard for people to find common ground.\u00a0 The common ground that we share as parents of children with autism.\u00a0 We all have unique children that deserve their place in this world.\u00a0 We are trying to do our best by them.\u00a0 We may go about that in different ways, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make one better than the other.\u00a0 Just different.\u00a0 What works for one child may not work for another.\u00a0 We know our own children, their histories, which are entwined with our own, and we each learn the ways to help them live their best life.

{"date": "April 25, 2010", "body": "This is what I wrote on Friday before abandoning it   favor of taking Guinness on a nice loooonnng walk in the fresh spring air while listening to a podcast on my ipod: This week has gone by both fast and slow, if that\u2019s even possible.\u00a0 It\u2019s Friday already and I don\u2019t know how that happened, but on the other hand there were many, many times this week that I wondered how much longer the day could drag on.\u00a0 Wondered when the day would end so I could go to bed and start over again tomorrow, with a clean slate and maybe feel as though I accomplished something.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t all that productive this week, which may be because my mind is circling around and around the same topics and will not let me rest or concentrate. I always feel this way when meetings regarding the Roc are looming in the near distance.\u00a0 I\u2019m still  keeping my mouth shut , for now, but we\u2019ve got some stuff lined up.\u00a0 After a flurry of email exchanges over the course of a couple weeks the silence in my in-box is a bit unnerving, but I know that is in my head.\u00a0 The silence isn\u2019t ominous.\u00a0 I\u2019m just waiting.\u00a0 Waiting to go through the next couple steps, assess the information, and then meet and make some decisions.\u00a0 The waiting is hard for me.\u00a0 I feel as though my brain won\u2019t come in for a landing. All this brain circling is affecting my mothering abilities.\u00a0 This morning wasn\u2019t the best, I didn\u2019t do my best, and I\u2019m still upset about it.\u00a0 I went to bed last night unsettled even after I wrote about the  division  in our community that has got me thinking.\u00a0 I tossed and turned and woke up feeling sick to my stomach.\u00a0 The Roc woke up on the wrong side of the bed too.\u00a0 He began screeching as soon as his feet hit the floor.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have a good morning, nothing made him happy, and I pressed my nose against the window and willed the bus to arrive early.\u00a0 I sighed in relief when I saw those flashing lights, while the Roc screamed that he had to go potty and he didn\u2019t want to get on the bus.\u00a0 As soon as the bus pulled away I felt guilty and ashamed of how I lost my cool, that he must have felt how desperately I wanted to move on to the next part of my day, the part where he was at school. I couldn\u2019t write any further that afternoon, still distressed over the way I handled the Roc that morning.\u00a0 I sat back, looked at the screen, glanced down at the puppy in his crate, and then out the window where the sun was shining and decided I had been too connected to my computer lately .  Too much in my own head.\u00a0 I left the cursor blinking and spent the rest of the afternoon walking. I ran into one of the ladies in my book club while out walking.\u00a0 She is a no fuss kind of gal.\u00a0 I like that.\u00a0 I\u2019m like that.\u00a0 We talked a bit and she requested that I bring my copy of \u201cA Friend Like Henry\u201d to our April book club meeting next week (I\u2019m hosting our May meeting, and it\u2019s  my pick .)\u00a0 She said she was really looking forward to reading it and I opened the floodgates on why I choose the book, how I hope to shed some light on the Roc and what our lives are like, that I really hope people read it and want to discuss it, and I hope they have questions because I want to share.\u00a0 I told her about how I closed myself off for a long time and I\u2019m ready to rejoin the world at large.\u00a0 It was a nice conversation and I felt that on some level her and I are kindred spirits.\u00a0 We parted ways and I felt a lifting in my soul.\u00a0 I think she will \u201cget it.\u201d When I got home I took a deep breath and called the school\u2019s special education coordinator.\u00a0 She had left me a message the day before regarding an email I sent her requesting a meeting to discuss school placement for next year.\u00a0 I have come to the decision that I would like the Roc to repeat kindergarten and have been wondering how hard I would have to fight to get what I desired, what I feel is most appropriate for him.\u00a0 I figured they would try to push for first grade.\u00a0 I had started a document listing all the reasons why I think he should repeat and had a list of things my mother had said to me during our conversations on this topic, things that would cut to the heart of the matter.\u00a0 Things that I might not think of in the pressure of the moment, but would wish I would have said after the fact.\u00a0 But as soon as the special ed coordinator opened the conversation I realized that maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to fight as hard as I imagined.\u00a0 Maybe I had been worried without reason, reading too many horror stories online. Right away she mentioned that she knew of my desire to have him repeat, she had talked to the special education teacher in the room, as well as observed him herself and \u201ceven though she doesn\u2019t always agree with retention, in this case she can see where it would be beneficial for him.\u201d\u00a0 Whew.\u00a0 I blew out all the air I didn\u2019t even know I had been holding.\u00a0 I assumed I would have to enter the placement meeting armed with all the reasons why, prepared to duke it out over one more year to learn the basics and grow, only to find out that may not be the case at all.\u00a0 They may support my request.\u00a0 Then she mentioned that during the meeting we would have to discuss the full inclusion kindergarten room, and I had to tell her that I was thinking differently again.\u00a0 I like the setting he is in now, 25 students, 5 identified with some kind of need, 3 full time adults in the room (1 regular ed teacher, 1 special ed teacher, 1 para.)\u00a0 I feel he is succeeding because there are people available to help him.\u00a0 I\u2019m not so sure that sticking him in a room with more kids with needs and less people to help them would be the right thing for the Roc.\u00a0 He needs support, he\u2019s doing well because of it, I don\u2019t feel comfortable taking it away.\u00a0 As much as I love his current teachers I think he should work with fresh faces next year, and I know there is another classroom like the one he is in at the third early childhood center in our district.\u00a0 She paused and said that they would take our lead on placement and support.\u00a0 I felt a weight being lifted off my shoulders.\u00a0 Could it really be this easy?\u00a0 I will find out in time. We have another meeting regarding his classification that will need to be scheduled after a few more steps in that arena are completed.\u00a0 But for now it seems as if the placement meeting may not be as stressful as I had imagined.\u00a0 We are tentatively scheduled for the end of May.\u00a0 I will still be ultra prepared, but I have a feeling it may go smoothly, and I hope it is an indication that the classification meeting will be similar. My holding pattern has been broken.\u00a0 It is possible I may be able to let my circling brain rest, for awhile anyway.

{"date": "October 15, 2009", "body": "The Roc LOVES water, especially falling water.\u00a0 He loves to take a bath.\u00a0 He loves to swim.\u00a0 He loves to see rushing rivers and thunderous waterfalls, the bigger the better.\u00a0 And he loves fountains.\u00a0 Because of this love I just knew he would enjoy Longwood Gardens in PA.\u00a0 On Monday the Roc and I, along with our awesome friends Christa and her son P, drove up to see the flowers, fountains, and emerging fall colors. The boys were ready and excited to go. Upon arrival we survived the horror of the \u201cbathroom with the blue doors\u201d and \u201cscary flushing toilets\u201d in the visitors center and made our way out into the gardens.\u00a0 Then the Roc saw his first fountain. He was in heaven.\u00a0 Lots of different fountains to see and someone to run with. The boys really had a blast running around together.\u00a0 In fact, they were hard to keep track of!\u00a0 Multiple times I was glad I put the Roc in that bright red vest! They almost never stopped moving! They did stop for a brief moment to show off their tree hugging skills, and we caught them sitting down at a little table where it appeared they were waiting for someone to come and take their order.\u00a0 Immediately after I snapped this photo they were off chasing a squirrel! I tried to get them to sit together for a photo but this was the best I could do. I was able to snap a cute photo of P by a fall display. The Roc\u2026not so much.\u00a0 The boy never stops moving! After lunch we headed into the conservatory where the boys really enjoyed the children\u2019s garden. Christa tried to get a picture of me and the Roc.\u00a0 He just wasn\u2019t cooperating (It\u2019s rare for us to have a nice picture together.\u00a0 He readily smiles for the camera if it\u2019s a picture with his father \u2013 go figure!) I did get a nice picture of Christa and P though! And at the very end of the day the Roc was sufficiently worn out enough for me to snap a photo of him by another big pumpkin display.\u00a0 He was too tired to run around any more at this point! It was a great day.\u00a0 A day spent with a good friend who, having been living this same kind of life, really  gets  it.\u00a0 Neither of us bats an eye at screaming outbursts, conversations that consist of scripted lines from Little Einsteins episodes, and we both knew just when it was time to leave and get back to the car, our time having run out for good behavior and keeping it together.\u00a0 The boys enjoyed being outside and being together, and I always enjoy Christa\u2019s company.\u00a0 The Roc got his fountain fix and I know now that we will be able to come back, maybe for the Christmas display.

Anyway, last Monday I was pacing around the house and decided that I just  had  to get outside and enjoy the weather, but I didn\u2019t want to do it alone.\u00a0 I had the urge to walk a dog.\u00a0 It was a beautiful fall day and I just wanted to enjoy it with someone (and none of my 4 cats would enjoy a walk on a leash).\u00a0 So I called my friend down the street who has 3 children age 4 and under and also possesses a big brindle pit bull mix who I\u2019ve never, in the 5 years we\u2019ve lived near each other, seen walked.\u00a0 I asked her and she said I could walk Tigger anytime.\u00a0 Now, Tigger is a sweet dog, but he really doesn\u2019t walk well on a leash.\u00a0 He pulled and yanked me around, and when he saw a squirrel?\u00a0 Forget about it.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t the relaxing walk I was hoping for but at least I did something nice for my friend and for Tigger. On Wednesday my other neighbor called me from work asking if I would mind going into her house and taking her little 4-month dachshund puppy outside.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t do his business before she left for work and she was worried that he would soil his crate and/or be uncomfortable all day.\u00a0 I jumped at the chance to walk another dog on another gorgeous fall day.\u00a0 I was pretty sure a little 4-month wiener dog wasn\u2019t going to be pulling me around!\u00a0 He was very excited to see me and donned his collar and leash with ease, until we got outside.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t having too much luck getting him to walk on the leash so I carried him down the street to another neighbors house who has two chihuahuas who love to go for walks.\u00a0 The puppy quickly got the hang of walking after seeing the two chihuahuas on their leashes.\u00a0 He had a great time after that I fully enjoyed myself. GC happened to be working from home that day so I bought the little puppy in the house under the pretense of \u201cseeing what the cats would do\u201d (they puffed themselves up like raccoons).\u00a0 After 30 minutes had passed GC came out on the landing again and saw me sitting in the foyer with the puppy sleeping in my lap.\u00a0 He groaned, shook his head and said: \u201cYou want a dog now, don\u2019t you?!\u201d\u00a0 I sheepishly smiled and shrugged my shoulders.\u00a0 He groaned again and walked back into his office.\u00a0 30 seconds later he came back out and said: \u201cWe used to talk about getting a Boston Terrier when we lived in New Jersey.\u00a0 I wonder how the cats would feel about a dog in the house?\u00a0 I wonder if the Roc would like a dog?\u201d My mouth dropped open!\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think he would even consider getting a dog! That night we had the following conversation with the Roc. Me:\u00a0 \u201cRoc, would you like to get a dog?\u201d (totally thinking he would say no because he has in the past) Roc:\u00a0 \u201cYes, we could have cats and a dog.\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cShould we get a big dog or a little dog?\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cA little one.\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cWhat color dog should we get?\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cA black one.\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cWould it be okay if it was black with a little bit of white like Sasha?\u201d\u00a0 (one of our tuxedo cats) Roc:\u00a0 \u201cYes, black with a little bit of white.\u201d Not really sure if he understood what \u201cgetting a dog\u201d meant we went on to show him some pictures of Boston Terriers and talked about what it would mean to have a dog in the house.\u00a0 He still said he wanted a dog! On Friday GC sent me an email with a link to Boston Terrier breeders with pictures of puppies and I replied:\u00a0 \u201cOMG!\u00a0 You\u2019re killing me!\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve found our Christmas present to each other\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 That night we talked about it more and started looking for nearby breeders.\u00a0 On Saturday went to Borders and got a book on the breed and did some more research that night. On Sunday morning GC called a breeder in Pennsylvania and she told him she had a brand new litter, only 5 days old, and we could come and see them that day if we wanted.\u00a0 We drove up after lunch.\u00a0 After talking to the breeder and her husband and meeting the parents we put a deposit down on one of the male puppies! The Roc did really well while we were there and we were shocked to see the time when we drove away.\u00a0 He had stood with us for just over and hour while we looked at the dogs and talked to the breeder.\u00a0 He did repeatedly put his hand up my shirt, but we were worried he would have a tantrum or at least scream while we were there, so I didn\u2019t worry to much about it.\u00a0 He was a little confused by the fact that we didn\u2019t bring home a dog that day and we tried to explain that our puppy won\u2019t be ready to come home for 7 \u2013 8 more weeks. When we were leaving GC shook his head and said:\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened.\u201d\u00a0 To which I replied:\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you think?\u00a0 We would go look at puppies and I wouldn\u2019t want one?!\u201d\u00a0 I had known that I would have to act fast when he started talking about a dog.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to give him too much time to change his mind! He glanced at me and said:\u00a0 \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d I think it will be! (Oh, and the Roc said we should name the puppy Buggles) ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/about-a-dog/", "title": "About a Dog"},
{"date": "October 16, 2009", "body": "Ohhhh Man!\u00a0 He is driving me nuts!\u00a0 He is driving me crazy!\u00a0 He is driving me bonkers! How can this totally adorable child possibly be driving me over the edge you ask? It is his obsession with my  HANDS .\u00a0 Sounds a little strange doesn\u2019t it? Where did it come from?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 When did it start?\u00a0 I cannot remember distinctly, but I know it\u2019s been going on for months, and months, and months.\u00a0 Many months.\u00a0 I know it was happening at the end of the school year in the spring because we wrote it into his Functional Behavior Assessment. It may have started back in  January  when he began calling his awesome preschool teacher the \u201cbig hand teacher\u201d and was resisting hand over hand help.\u00a0 It has progressed into something much bigger.\u00a0 It has become a persistent, preoccupation with my hands.\u00a0 It seems obsessive to me. He is always conscious of where my hands are, what they are doing, if they are cold, if they are holding something, if they are in my pockets, if I am writing, if I am wearing something like gloves (to clean), or mittens, etc.\u00a0 He wants me to position them certain ways when I\u2019m resting one hand on the counter while I use the other to stir sauce, brush my teeth, or comb my hair.\u00a0 Also, he calls them \u201cwhite hands.\u201d\u00a0 Which sounds like he understands color in terms of race, but he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ve never discussed ethnicity with him.\u00a0 And he says it very drawn out \u201cwwhhhyyyyiiiiiiitttteee\u00a0 haaaaaaands\u201d so I know he is not referring to the fact that I happen to be a Caucasian woman.\u00a0 He also calls me a \u201cwwhhyyyyiiiiiiitttteee Mooooooommiiieeee\u201d so I think it has more to do with the way the words sound as he says them, and possibly to be annoying.\u00a0 He says other things in that drawn out way.\u00a0 Like when he calls me a \u201cdoooooogggggiiiieeee.\u201d\u00a0 Nice. So, not only is he overly conscious of where my hands are and what they are doing, he is always touching them, squeezing them, or putting my hand on his neck and then ramming his pointy little chin down on the back of my bony, skinny hand, which I have to say is slightly painful.\u00a0 Finally, the one thing that annoys me the most, he puts his mouth on the back of my hand, sometimes slobbering on it, sometimes rubbing his lips back and forth over the skin.\u00a0 It happens whenever my hands are in reach of his mouth, which is quite frequently given that he never leaves my side when we are in the house (unless he is watching a show or in the bath tub, sigh\u2026). Earlier in the year I thought this was really becoming an obsession, something he wasn\u2019t totally in control over, and I was slightly worried about it.\u00a0 Now, I really think he is doing it for the attention.\u00a0 For the negative reaction I eventually give him (yanking my hand away, sighing loudly, making my mad Mommy face, etc.) which makes him smile that evil, adorable, devilish smile and laugh at me!\u00a0 I am frustrated.\u00a0 This hand obsession is really bothering me and he knows it.\u00a0 He even said to me yesterday \u201cI\u2019m driving Mommy bonkers!!\u201d when I ripped my hand out of his grasp after he slobbered on it.\u00a0 Then he said \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with Mommy\u2019s hands.\u201d\u00a0 Sigh.\u00a0 He\u2019s totally doing it for the attention.\u00a0 Which I cannot understand because this kid gets all of my attention!\u00a0 If he\u2019s home, he\u2019s with me!\u00a0 There are times when I have to answer the phone, read his communication book, or type a quick email and then it is 10 times worse, he\u2019s grabbing at my hands and trying to get his mouth on them.\u00a0 Sigh. We\u2019ve tried time-out, taking desserts away, taking other preferred activities away, yelling, as well as talking calmly about it NOT putting his mouth on my hand.\u00a0 I tried really hard to ignore it and redirect, and only lasted a few hours.\u00a0 I guess I just wasn\u2019t strong enough and  IT\u2019S ANNOYING!  Yesterday I even threatened to start giving him a piece of broccoli every time he started in on my hands.\u00a0 He said \u201cNO!\u201d but I never did get out the dreaded broccoli.\u00a0 This morning I tried to ignore him while he contorted his body to get his mouth on the back of my hand while I helped him get dressed.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t too successful at getting what he wanted and so he reached over and jammed his finger up my nose\u2026it took every ounce of my strength not to completely  freak-out  on him.\u00a0 I have to be honest and admit that I YELLED at him to \u201cSTOP IT RIGHT NOW!\u201d then I stomped down that stairs and he started to cry.\u00a0 He knows he is bothering me with the hand stuff and he definitely knows that it is NOT okay to ram your finger up someones nose. I am just at a loss as to what to do? Any advice before I put my head through the wall in frustration?

{"date": "November 4, 2009", "body": "Last Thursday I felt quite recovered from my Mommy Meltdown that I wrote about it while the Roc was at school.\u00a0 He had been home from school for a week and I was soooo very ready for him to go back and was relishing the quiet house, only the sloshing washer and cat growls could be heard as I sat at my desk writing about my Monday implosion.\u00a0 It was to be my last bit of peace for at least 24 hours. Earlier that morning the Roc\u2019s breathing was a little tight, which didn\u2019t surprise me because he had been fighting a cough and had needed help over the weekend to get his breathing under control, so I gave him a breathing treatment and sent him on his way eager to be alone.\u00a0 I got a lot done that day, though I don\u2019t remember what, (besides that blog post) and was slightly dismayed when the school nurse called me late in the afternoon.\u00a0 She was only calling to inform me that the Roc had been coughing a lot in class so he was sent to her for another breathing treatment.\u00a0 No big deal I thought.\u00a0 He arrived home not long after and my heart dropped a bit to hear him wheezing.\u00a0 I gave him another breathing treatment and when that did not alleviate his discomfort we headed over to Urgent Care. Because we had been to Urgent Care the week before and the Roc had been put on steroids and breathing treatments the doctor took some x-rays of his chest (so not fun trying to get him to stand still for an x-ray!) which came back with clear lungs.\u00a0 They did another breathing treatment but his oxygen level was still in the low 90s and she said she wasn\u2019t comfortable with just giving him more steroids and sending us on our way.\u00a0 She said we should head up to the Emergency Room at the Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0 A knot formed in my stomach as I loaded the Roc in the car. We met GC at home and drove up to the hospital with the Roc talking and coughing the whole way.\u00a0 He just LOVES to drive places in the dark and see all the lights and he wouldn\u2019t stop talking!\u00a0 The ER was crowded with people wearing masks and parents jiggling their crying children as I rushed up to the desk.\u00a0 The one and only good thing about breathing issues is that no one messes around.\u00a0 We were brought back to triage immediately and from there we had to wait less than 10 minutes (which felt like a lifetime) for them to find a bed for the Roc.\u00a0 He was going downhill fast and was coughing and begging for help while we waited for them to find a place for him.\u00a0 I stood at the desk holding the Roc and practically bored holes in the intake nurses head while he cried and pleaded \u201cI need help\u201d and then he threw up all over me and cried even harder.\u00a0 Ack! After we were ushered into a bay the Roc was put on oxygen and his eyes immediately rolled back in his head and he fell asleep.\u00a0 His oxygen level was 88% when they first hooked him up but quickly went up to 95% on the O2.\u00a0 We stayed there for a few hours while they gave him more oxygen and did back to back breathing treatments with another medicine.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t able to maintain a good oxygen level and his breathing was so labored that he was admitted and moved to the second floor to start continuous albuterol treatment through the night. By now it was around midnight and he was amped up on all those medications.\u00a0 When the receiving team on the second floor got him into his bed he was just a wild thing.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t stop laughing and trying to get out of the bed to run around.\u00a0 I had to climb in bed and hold him while they did their examination and hooked him up to the breathing apparatus.\u00a0 I tried to settle him and eventually succeeded only for the doctor to wake him up!\u00a0 GC left to get us some food and I got the Roc to fall back asleep.\u00a0 We ate and then GC drove home and I spent the rest of the night at the foot of the Roc\u2019s little hospital bed putting his mask back on and re-hooking the monitor to his thumb every 3-14 minutes (you bet I timed it, I couldn\u2019t believe that I would literally close my eyes and then immediately have to open them to fight with him about the mask or monitor!)\u00a0 Eventually around 5 am he slept for longer periods and I got about 45 minutes of sleep. On Friday morning they were able to wean him off the continuous treatment and we worked toward getting him to go 4 hours without a treatment so we could take him home.\u00a0 He was able to participate in the hospital trick-or-treating that morning and they even brought a little batman costume for him to wear, which he didn\u2019t!\u00a0 He was sleep deprived and easily overwhelmed so we only went to a few stations to gather Halloween trinkets before he said he was ready to go back to his room.\u00a0 He took a little nap in the afternoon (so you know he was sleep deprived) and eventually he was released to go home around 5 pm. It was a totally exhausting 24 hours.\u00a0 For me and for the Roc (and GC too, but he wasn\u2019t at the hospital overnight so our experiences there are a little different!)\u00a0 One good thing that came out of it was that we didn\u2019t have any trouble getting the Roc to take his medicine at home.\u00a0 All we had to do was remind him that if he didn\u2019t take it his breathing might get bad again and he would have to go back to the hospital.\u00a0 Enough said.\u00a0 He downed it like a champ each time. *** Saturday was warm and rainy and we took it easy during the day, going out to buy some supplies for the puppy we will be bringing home in December.\u00a0 We drove around a bit trying to kill time before the night\u2019s festivities.\u00a0 The Roc was bouncing off the walls excited to go trick-or-treating with his two friends down the street, it\u2019s almost all he talked about that day.\u00a0 He could hardly get through dinner fast enough.\u00a0 When the first trick-or-treaters arrived while we were eating he was done and wanted to get out there.\u00a0 Our neighbors appeared with their kids just as we got the Roc into costume.\u00a0 Look at that grin! We headed out the door and the Roc was jacked up like we\u2019d already fed him a bunch of candy.\u00a0 He kept running down the sidewalk and repeating phrases his friend said over and over again like \u201cI\u2019m going to ring THAT doorbell!!\u201d\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t paying attention to where he was going and didn\u2019t seem to grasp the whole point of trick-or-treating.\u00a0 I was starting to regret asking our neighbor if we could all go together because I knew that this could happen.\u00a0 The Roc and Luke tend to really get each other going and they get really silly.\u00a0 Luke has the ability to switch gears pretty quickly and calm down where the Roc does not.\u00a0 I had to slow him down and make him walk with me and eventually he got himself under control and did a very nice job trick-or-treating after that.\u00a0 At the end of the evening as we were nearing our house I nudged GC, pointed to the Roc, and said \u201cTwo years ago babe.\u201d\u00a0 He just shook his head and said \u201cI know.\u201d There are many times that I watch the Roc and marvel at how he is doing the very things I worried that he might not be able to do.\u00a0 Walking up the sidewalk toward a stranger, saying \u201ctrick-or-treat,\u201d only taking one piece of candy, and saying \u201cthank-you\u201d before spinning around and coming back to us seemed an impossible feat two years ago.\u00a0 But here he is surprising us and doing it, and most importantly enjoying it.\u00a0 As soon as his friends were done, he was done and wanted to go inside.\u00a0 The sky was starting to spit rain and we wanted to get back in to hand out some candy of our own before all the trick-or-treaters went home.\u00a0 The Roc got to have his Halloween cupcake in exchange for his candy (wonder how long until he figures out that he\u2019s not really getting a fair trade there?!) and he was happy. Then he had one last surprise for us before the night was over.\u00a0 He wanted to hand out candy to trick-or-treaters!!\u00a0 That was a totally new request but we were happy to oblige him. It didn\u2019t last long \u2013 he was done after Harry Potter pictured above. I am just hoping this week is quiet\u2026.it has been so far!

{"date": "October 22, 2009", "body": "Brushing teeth is not one of the Roc\u2019s favorite activities.\u00a0 When he was younger it felt like a wrestling match that always ended with me sweaty and defeated.\u00a0 My neighbor once told me that she would wrap her daughter up in a blanket so she couldn\u2019t move her arms and then was able to really brush her teeth because the girl would lay there and scream with her mouth wide open.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t work for the Roc.\u00a0 I tried it.\u00a0 Once.\u00a0 He knew what I wanted to do and clamped his lips together.\u00a0 Plus, he has never been one to allow you to wrap him in a blanket, he is much to wiggly for that!\u00a0 We moved on to using a head lock maneuver which kinda worked.\u00a0 But I never felt like I was actually getting his teeth very clean, and I dislike psychically struggling with him.\u00a0 It has been a long process but he is getting better about having them brushed.\u00a0 Sort of.\u00a0 I still find myself chanting \u201cSay ahhhhh.\u00a0 Open wide.\u00a0 Say ahhhh.\u00a0 Open wide.\u00a0 Don\u2019t bite the brush.\u00a0 Stand up straight.\u00a0 Stop leaning back.\u00a0 Say ahhhh.\u00a0 Open wide.\u00a0 If you whip your head away one more time\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 and threatening to read less stories if he won\u2019t let me brush his teeth.\u00a0 I want him to have nice teeth and worry the dentist will tell me his teeth are horrid and that I\u2019ve done a very poor job. Yesterday the Roc had a dental appointment.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tried hard to let the him know that going to the dentist really is no big deal.\u00a0 This is difficult for someone who doesn\u2019t like the unknown, changes in his schedule, strangers touching him, and especially strangers putting objects in his mouth.\u00a0 He had his first visit to the dentist last fall and while he did do very well during that visit they were not able to clean his teeth that time or six months later at his second appointment.\u00a0 My main mission last year was getting him in the building, having him go with they hygienist without me, and her being able to at least peek into his mouth, count the teeth, and tell me they were looking healthy.\u00a0 All of that was accomplished last year. Yesterday was the Roc\u2019s third cleaning appointment and I was hoping that they would be able to accomplish more this time around.\u00a0 I told myself if they were not able to clean the teeth I would consider taking him to the pediatric dentist we visited in the spring when the Roc did a nose dive onto the  sidewalk .\u00a0 I really wanted this office in town to work out though as they were not going to restrain him and were so willing to work with him.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do much to prepare him for this visit and was silently cursing myself in the morning while making his breakfast.\u00a0 \u201cI should have driven him by the office last night as a prep.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI should have showed him the pictures of the staff from their website so he would remember them.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI wonder if this is going to be a big FAIL?\u201d\u00a0 During breakfast and while driving to the office I reminded him to listen to the lady, lay back in the seat, open his mouth, and NOT to bite them.\u00a0 I swallowed hard and hoped it was enough. The Roc told me he didn\u2019t want to go in but I ignored him and led him into the building.\u00a0 He wanted to sit on my lap and I let him.\u00a0 His name was called right away and I asked if they would refrain from doing a fluoride treatment on him that day because I want to do some more research on it\u2019s affect on neurology.\u00a0 They hygienist frowned and asked me to come back with the Roc.\u00a0 \u201cUh-oh.\u201d\u00a0 I thought.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to get a speech, this lady is going to think I\u2019m nuts, and I\u2019ve never gone back with the Roc, now he\u2019s going to act up because I\u2019m going to be in the room with him.\u201d I did get a speech and she did try to scare me by saying that all his teeth might fall out, but I insisted that I still wanted some time to do my own research.\u00a0 Which I think makes me a good parent, not a negligent one, but I still got the \u201cyou\u2019re a crazy lady look.\u201d\u00a0 I get that a lot.\u00a0 I\u2019m used to it.\u00a0 While I was getting a lecture on the wonders of fluoride the Roc was wiggling around in his seat and kicking his legs.\u00a0 The hygienist wanted him to wear sunglasses and I didn\u2019t try to help her as I knew that there was no way he would wear them.\u00a0 A little nugget of panic was forming in my stomach wondering if she was going to be harsh with him in my presence.\u00a0 But to my relief the opposite happened.\u00a0 She gave up the sunglasses idea and calmly moved onto showing him all the different things she was going to use and how the seat went down (closing up the \u201chole\u201d that was causing the Roc some major anxiety).\u00a0 To my surprise he listened, laid back on the chair and opened wide when she directed.\u00a0 Many times his eyes shifted over to mine and I thought to myself \u201cthis is when he is going to start his counter attack and act up so he can end this visit and get the heck out of here.\u201d\u00a0 But he didn\u2019t. He did not yell.\u00a0 He did not scream.\u00a0 He did not push her hand away.\u00a0 He did not whip his head around.\u00a0 He did not bite her fingers.\u00a0 He did not protest or cry.\u00a0 He did not clamp his lips together.\u00a0 He did not panic. To my utter shock he allowed her to SCRAP HIS TEETH and then polish them.\u00a0 He was quiet.\u00a0 He listened when she explained what she was going to do next.\u00a0 He answered her questions.\u00a0 He followed her directions.\u00a0 He made good eye contact with her.\u00a0 I think she was surprised at how well he did and I know that I was.\u00a0 It actually felt a little surreal to be sitting back there witnessing the cleaning and his cooperation. And his teeth cleaned up nicely!\u00a0 There were a couple stains on the front teeth that were polished away to reveal perfect little white teeth.\u00a0 One of which happens to be loose\u2026uh oh.\u00a0 I guess I have something else to start prepping for.\u00a0 The baby teeth fallout.\u00a0 Not only is one of the top front teeth loose, two teeth on the bottom are loose too.\u00a0 She said this is about the age that they start to loosen up and the fact that he had a pretty big mouth injury in the spring may cause them to come out a bit earlier. Yikes!\u00a0 I guess I\u2019d better start looking for some books about baby teeth. I am still, even the next day, astounded at how well he did and thus how much he has grown.\u00a0 I keep saying it, but I\u2019ll say it again.\u00a0 He is changing right before my very eyes and it\u2019s thrilling to witness.\u00a0 Cooperating at the dentist may seem like small potatoes to many parents.\u00a0 But for me, for the Roc, it is huge.\u00a0 All these small victories add up to some pretty big changes.\u00a0 It will never go unnoticed or unappreciated by me.

{"date": "October 29, 2009", "body": "It has taken me a few days to be able to write about what happened on Monday.\u00a0 I had a Mommy Meltdown.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t had one in awhile.\u00a0 Four days later (and a child who finally went to school after a week of being home sick) has given me time to get back to normal, whatever that is. The Roc has had a cough for a couple weeks and that morphed into breathing issues last week.\u00a0 I started administering breathing treatments of Albuterol through his nebulizer and ended up laying awake in his bed on Thursday night wondering whether I should pack him up and head out to the ER, or to wait for medical aid to open in a few hours.\u00a0 I opted not to expose him to the piggy sickies at the ER and we were the first patients at medical aid. (He coughed so hard on the way over he barfed all over himself.\u00a0 Thank goodness I put him in a zip up hoodie and track pants as it was easy to clean him off before entering the building, the car seat was another story.\u00a0 Ick.)\u00a0 They gave him Prednisolone, another breathing treatment, and prescribed an antibiotic to try to help with junk that has been plugging him up. Over the weekend he rested and took all these medications along with more breathing treatments to keep his breathing under control.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if it was the Prednisolone, the antibiotic, the Albuterol, or all of these combined on top of being sick and not being able to breath, but his behavior spiraled out of control.\u00a0 Even after his breathing got much better, he just went down hill behavior wise.\u00a0 I chalked it up to all of the above and really tried to be understanding while he threw tantrum after tantrum, screamed at the littlest injustice, (water on his sock, oh no!) and fought me over everything.\u00a0 Everything. On Monday I was looking forward to sending him off to school and was dismayed to see his red, crusty eyes when he woke up.\u00a0 Pink Eye.\u00a0 I had to keep him home again and make another trip to the doctor.\u00a0 I made an appointment with the regular family practice and tried to entertain the wild beast of my son until we could leave.\u00a0 I was really starting to loose my footing in sanity land and chatted online with GC that he had to relieve me when he got home, I was going bonkers.\u00a0 I was packing my bags to Crazy town, and unless he wanted me to move there permanently, he needed to take over when he got home.\u00a0 The Roc was uber defiant in a way he hasn\u2019t been in a long while.\u00a0 He was hyper.\u00a0 He did everything I told him not to.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t leave the door handles alone, and was repeatedly jiggling them and opening and slamming them closed.\u00a0 He was screaming at our poor cats and scaring them into the basement.\u00a0 He was following me around, poking me in the back and slobbering all over my hands.\u00a0 He kept grabbing the phone, pushing lots of buttons and running away from me.\u00a0 And more and more and more.\u00a0 I could go on and on but am feeling a little sick at reliving what I have written so far.\u00a0 The worst part of all of this was that he did all these things with a huge, devilish smirk on his face.\u00a0 He was delighting in torturing me.\u00a0 I eventually broke down crying and he laughed at me.\u00a0 He.Laughed.At.Me. He hadn\u2019t done that in a long time.\u00a0 I\u2019ll never forget that one time after learning that the Roc had autism I completely lost it, slid down the wall, slumped over on my kitchen floor, and sobbed my heart out.\u00a0 All the while the Roc danced around me laughing.\u00a0 My being beside myself and crying did not affect him like it should.\u00a0 He laughed and I cried harder in understanding for the first time the wide gulf that separated him from other children his age.\u00a0 He should have been crying to see me cry so hard.\u00a0 It should have affected him and it didn\u2019t.\u00a0 Over the last two years the Roc learned a lot about emotions and has come to a point where he doesn\u2019t like to see me upset.\u00a0 Not long ago he told me to \u201cput your happy face on mommy\u201d while we were stuck in a traffic jam and I was sighing loudly in the driver\u2019s seat.\u00a0 To have him laugh at my crying cut me just as deeply as it did the first time it happened.\u00a0 It felt like he was regressing before my eyes.\u00a0 I lost it. I went into my bedroom, closed and locked the door, and screamed (causing cats to fly off my bed and cower in fear) my lungs out.\u00a0 I laid on the floor, pounded my fists and kicked my legs like a 2-year old.\u00a0 I cried like I hadn\u2019t cried in a long time.\u00a0 I was worn out from the weekend of worrying about him being able to breath and fear of him dying to literally wanting to run away and never come back.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to leave my room but the Roc was out of control on the other side of the door screaming his brains out and throwing whatever he could grab.\u00a0 I wiped my face, tried to gather some semblance of clarity, and grabbed my purse.\u00a0 We had to leave soon for the doctor\u2019s office.\u00a0 I calmly got the Roc\u2019s shoes and coat on, helped him pick out a few books to read in the waiting room and we headed out the door. This is when my Monday got even worse.\u00a0 The Roc was a L.U.N.A.T.I.C at the doctors office.\u00a0 Lunatic.\u00a0 He tugged on me, on my purse and my hand while tried to sign him in.\u00a0 He screamed at a women sitting where he wanted to sit.\u00a0 He bounced around in his seat and wouldn\u2019t concentrate on the book I tried to read to him.\u00a0 Luckily we were called back very quickly and from there he picked up speed on his downhill slide.\u00a0 He jumped up and down on the scale so she couldn\u2019t get an accurate weight on him and then he took off running down the hall, barely missing an elderly woman with a cane.\u00a0 When we got in the exam room he wouldn\u2019t let the nurse near him and he wouldn\u2019t stop barking at her.\u00a0 My eyes had been pricking with tears in the waiting room and once the barking started I started crying and couldn\u2019t stop.\u00a0 I spluttered \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, he has autism\u201d to the nurse and she said \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d without any emotion and immediately left the room.\u00a0 I was gulping down sobs and trying to pull myself together when the doctor came in.\u00a0 Again I apologized \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I was crying LAST time I brought him to see you and here I am crying again.\u201d\u00a0 (Last time I brought him to this doctor was Dec 08 and he was a loon during that visit as well.\u00a0 And I cried then too.\u00a0 Sigh.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if she actually remembered that visit, but I do!)\u00a0 I bear hugged the wiggling Roc while she examined him and then prescribed some eye drops for the pink eye.\u00a0 I did the ugly cry (You know, when your face contorts, your lips do that weird stretchy thing, you turn all blotchy red, your nose runs, and you can hardly talk? The ugly cry.\u00a0 Definitely not pretty.) while telling her it was like watching him regress right before my very eyes and how terribly horrifying it was.\u00a0 Really.Horrifying.\u00a0 She was very sweet and asked me if I had a good support system, if I had anyone to take over for me and give me a break, and reassured me that what I was dealing with was HARD.\u00a0 She also said that the steroid Prednisolone was a very powerful and much of his behavior was probably stemming from the medications and after they left his system he would right himself.\u00a0 I tearfully thanked her and I dragged the Roc to the car. Once in the car I called GC on my cell phone, laid across the steering wheel and sobbed out the whole experience to him.\u00a0 (How fun for him right?)\u00a0 His first question was \u201cYou\u2019re not  driving  right now are you?\u201d\u00a0 God no.\u00a0 By the time I got off the phone and picked my head up the cars parked on either side of me had driven away.\u00a0 Makes me wonder what they thought seeing a woman sobbing over her steering wheel and a silent kid strapped into the back.\u00a0 It did make me thankful for the amount of hair I have that I was able to hide behind.\u00a0 I did pull myself together after that and the Roc and I muddled through the rest of the day.\u00a0 He tantrumed and screamed and I counted the minutes until GC walked through the door. I took a hot bath when he got home and used the Roc\u2019s bubble bath titled \u201cOvertired and Cranky\u201d as I thought that was fitting.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t flinch once at the Roc\u2019s screams as it was no longer my problem and it was then that I decided I was no longer going to feel guilty about being home all day while the Roc is in school.\u00a0 I have EARNED this time.\u00a0 I have definitely earned some time to breath. What I did feel guilty about was the tantrum I threw in the Roc\u2019s presence and how I had really fallen apart that day.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t a good mom that day and I really felt bad about that.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until 2 days later, while talking to my mother-in-law, when she reminded me of an important fact that made me feel a bit better.\u00a0 I was relaying this terrible day to her and how I felt about completely losing my cool and packing my bags to Crazy Town when she said \u201cKim, you are only human.\u201d Oh yeah. She\u2019s right. No one\u2019s perfect. Breath in.\u00a0 Breath out.\u00a0 Repeat.

{"date": "November 6, 2009", "body": "It\u2019s a given, no parent likes to see their child struggle, really struggle with something.\u00a0 That is one of the hardest things to swallow about autism.\u00a0 So many things are a tremendous struggle for the Roc.\u00a0 Little things, simple things that other parents take for granted.\u00a0 Opening baggies, zipping zippers, screwing and unscrewing caps, getting shoes and socks on, brushing teeth, cutting with a scissors, and writing are just some of the things the Roc struggles with in regards to fine motor skills.\u00a0 In the past many of these things would immediately frustrate him and he would  SCREAM  and throw a raging fit.\u00a0 As he has grown, so has his patience, (a teeny tiny amount, but I have to acknowledge it) and his verbal skills.\u00a0 Now, while many of these things still frustrate him, he tries just a little bit longer (sometimes we even get \u201cNo, I wanna do it!\u201d) or he asks for help (many times in a screech, but I\u2019ll take it!) As his mother it has been so hard to watch him struggle.\u00a0 So hard not to compare him to my friend\u2019s children who do almost everything with ease.\u00a0 So hard not to want to change things somehow for him.\u00a0 Help.\u00a0 Fix it.\u00a0 Do something. Why does everything have to be  so hard  for my baby? But that is what makes the little things that much sweeter. I remember when I first gave the Roc a marker and a sheet of paper.\u00a0 He concentrated hard, fisted that marker, and proceeded to fill the whole page with compact little squiggles.\u00a0 I bought a couple sketch books and he alternated between filling the pages with dots, lines, the letter H, (for some reason only known to him) or those original scribbles.\u00a0 I found it fascinating that he had the focus to continue page after page.\u00a0 For awhile I saved that first paper, proud of the perseverance it took to evenly space out those squiggles.\u00a0 Then the word autism pushed it\u2019s way into our house, parked itself on my chest, and I saw those repetitive squiggles differently.\u00a0 Repetition and perseveration.\u00a0 Hallmark signs.\u00a0 Desperately I tried to get the Roc to draw something different in his sketch book and to reverse his grip on that marker.\u00a0 I pushed too hard and pushed him away from wanting to write or draw with me.\u00a0 I had to take a step back. He started preschool and at home I let him return to filling up his sketch books with squiggles, dots, lines, and the letter H.\u00a0 I wondered when he would draw something, anything other than those repetitive images.\u00a0 My mother (the former teacher) sent me a list of fine motor activities and the school OT sent home some suggestions as well.\u00a0 I worked on them with him when he would allow, trying not to push him too far into frustration. Over time I saw the slips coming home from the preschool OT start to change and rejoiced for the progress. March 4, 2008 March 30, 2009 Eventually he started to reverse his grip at home and stopped fisting the marker.\u00a0 Now in full day kindergarten he is required to do much more writing and has \u201chomework\u201d each week, one day of which is writing the sight words they are learning.\u00a0 He still likes to scribble all over a page if you let him so I usually print the words lightly in pencil and give him a marker to trace over them with. Earlier this week we were working on his \u201chomework\u201d and I asked him if he wanted to draw when he was done.\u00a0 He was really enjoying the little marker his OT sent home (a crayola pip-squeak, perfect for those kids who want to hold the writing utensil at the top \u2013 can\u2019t do that with a tiny marker!) and I asked him if he could draw a house.\u00a0 I fully expected him to scribble all over the page but instead he looked at me, looked down at the page, and then drew this: Holy smokes!!\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know he could do that!\u00a0 He went on to draw two more but the first one is the one I saved and slapped up on the refrigerator. Even if no one else really grasps the amount of time, repetition, and literally hours of work this kid has put in to be able to draw that little house, I know.\u00a0 I get it.\u00a0 And  man  am I proud of that little wonky house and the kid who drew it!

{"date": "November 20, 2009", "body": "I\u2019m getting away this weekend!\u00a0 In about four hours my very good autism mommy friend and I will be skipping town for two whole days!\u00a0 We are getting massages tomorrow and plan on watching chick flicks, painting our nails, eating, sleeping in, window shopping, chatting and chilling out (without our kids!!!).\u00a0 I\u2019m very excited and have been looking forward to getting away for quite awhile.\u00a0 The Roc will be off of school ALLLLLL next week and this will give me a good chance to recharge before I\u2019m \u201cON\u201d every day for seven days straight. There is one, little, tiny detail that I\u2019m sorry to miss this weekend. The Roc got invited to a birthday party!\u00a0 At his conference last week I asked his teacher if the whole class was invited and she said \u201cNo, only five boys from the class were invited.\u201d\u00a0 I sat there stunned.\u00a0 Which sounds bad to many people, to be stunned that my son was invited to a birthday party.\u00a0 But really, he rarely gets invited to parties and I just didn\u2019t expect it.\u00a0 Apparently this little boy really likes the Roc and so he is one of five boys invited.\u00a0 When I found this out I told my husband (who originally said he didn\u2019t want to take him) that he just  had  to take him.\u00a0 To be one of five invited is a big deal! (to me anyway!)\u00a0 If he wasn\u2019t going to take him I would consider canceling my weekend so I could take him.\u00a0 After two seconds GC changed his mind and agreed to take him tomorrow afternoon. I\u2019m a little nervous for both of them.\u00a0 The party is at a roller skating rink\u2026\u00a0 The Roc has never roller skated and from what I can remember of our local roller skating rink when I was a kid \u2013 it could be a sensory nightmare for the Roc.\u00a0 He is very excited to attend this party though (mostly because he will get a GFCF cupcake) and I really want to give him the chance to experience this.\u00a0 I am nervous for GC because he has never taken him to a party before.\u00a0 These type of things usually fall to me.\u00a0 If there is a playdate, party, or event I\u2019m the one who takes him.\u00a0 I hope GC can stay calm and positive and that no meltdowns occur (for either of them, and for both of their sakes!)\u00a0 I have a lot of confidence in GC, he shines when under the gun without me, and the Roc usually behaves differently for his father than for me (many times better, go figure!) I am sincerely hoping it will be a good experience for both of them. And I\u2019m not going to worry\u2026or I\u2019ll try not to worry\u2026 Really, I\u2019m going to try hard! I\u2019m taking two days off!\u00a0 (and this is the 3rd & 4th day that I\u2019ve had \u201coff\u201d since the Roc was born.\u00a0 I do believe I\u2019ve earned it.)

{"date": "November 9, 2009", "body": "I\u2019m an outdoor girl.\u00a0 I grew up hiking, canoeing, and camping in Minnesota.\u00a0 I would rather be outside than in, I hate feeling cooped up, and struggle to get through the winter every year.\u00a0 I always hoped that I would have an outdoor child so I could pass on my love of the outdoors to them and see their delight at the things I experienced as a child.\u00a0 When the Roc was a baby I took him outside whenever I could, even pushing him in the stroller when it was sunny and 38 degrees in January because I just couldn\u2019t be stuck inside any longer.\u00a0 He went on at least two walks a day when he was a baby.\u00a0 I think all of my walking did him good because to my utter joy I have produced an outdoor boy.\u00a0 He loves to be outside just as much as his mama. Like most weekends, we didn\u2019t have any plans and after the Roc had been fed on Saturday morning I wondered out loud if we should drive down to the beach.\u00a0 The Roc was beyond excited and started in on us.\u00a0 \u201cCan we build a sandcastle?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t like the waves!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe will take our clothes off!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s go to the beach!!\u201d\u00a0 Those sentences were repeated over and over and over.\u00a0 We had to remind him that it wasn\u2019t summer and we were going to walk, not roll around in the sand, because it would be cool at the beach.\u00a0 We drove down to Cape Henlopen State Park and the Roc really enjoyed walking on the beach, picking up shells, and he even got to build a sandcastle while we stood by with our hands jammed in our pockets, that wind was cold and the blood had quickly drained out of my fingers.\u00a0 We drove over to the nature center and tried to go for a hike on the nature trail but found it too muddy so we drove down to \u201cthe point\u201d and walked a bit more, bribing the Roc with a lollipop. I took a picture that I would have used for my Christmas card, if only he had been looking at the camera!! (Which prompted me again to start lusting after a new SLR camera.) We drove back down to the beach parking lot and loaded the Roc into his wagon so we could walk along the paved hiking/biking path.\u00a0 As soon as the Roc saw all the pine needles he had to have\u00a0 some and GC filled up the wagon giving him his very own \u201chay ride\u201d which he thoroughly enjoyed. We walked along the trail and stopped to climb up and enjoy the view. On the way back to the car the Roc got to go for a ride down a big hill.\u00a0 I could hear him laughing the whole way down. We were worn out by the end of the day! On Sunday we drove up to Brandywine Creek State Park and went for a walk in the woods. GC picked up a big stick and then Roc had to have one of his own.\u00a0 Like father, like son.\u00a0 Or maybe it\u2019s just a thing with boys and sticks? Not long after the Roc decided that I needed to have a walking stick too. Whatever makes him happy right? He is most happy near water and insisted we stop to sit by the creek. GC was happy he got to wear his Vibram shoes. There was only a minimal amount of whining: \u201cMy legs don\u2019t work\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d and GC gave him a shoulder ride once, but all it did was reinforce my childhood memories.\u00a0 I remember whining a little when I was his age, and apparently it never failed that I would ask \u201cIs this a circle trail?\u201d but the fresh air, the sounds of the forest, and the peace I felt while outdoors as a child still exists for me today.\u00a0 I hope the Roc will look back on his childhood and have happy memories of the outdoors. We spent the weekend outside.\u00a0 What could be better than that?

I have been astounded at the little conversations I\u2019ve been having with the Roc lately.\u00a0 He has exploded with things I didn\u2019t know where there.\u00a0 Making connections, expressing just how much he has been paying attention all this time. The other morning we had this exchange when I was getting his breakfast ready: Me:\u00a0  \u201cOh dang, I stepped in cat barf.\u00a0 Gross.\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMommy, do you have to take a bath now?\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cNo, I just need to change my sock and clean up the barf.\u201d  (I\u2019m thinking:\u00a0 OMG!\u00a0 He just asked me a question about ME!) Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMommy, help me!\u00a0 The egg burrito is falling apart!\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cOkay, I just have to wash my hands first baby.\u00a0 I just cleaned up cat barf.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to touch your food until I wash my hands\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to bite cat barf.\u201d  (Yup, that about sums it up.) *** We had this little conversation while I was making dinner a few days later (and yes, we have lots of burritos in this house): Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMommy, are you going to have a burrito too?\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cNo, I\u2019m actually not feeling very well at the moment.\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cDoes your tummy hurt?\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cYes, I feel nauseous.\u201d  Roc:\u00a0  \u201cAre you anxious?\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cNo, just an upset tummy.\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cYou should eat Mommy.\u201d  (I looked around for GC before I remembered he wasn\u2019t home yet.\u00a0 I wanted to lock eyes with him in disbelief and mouth \u201cdid you hear that?\u201d to him.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing a lot of that lately.) *** \u00a0 The Roc and GC had this little conversation while we were eating dinner on Thursday night: GC:\u00a0  \u201cHey Roc, how was your field trip today?\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cWe didn\u2019t go on a field trip today.\u201d GC:\u00a0  \u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u00a0 Why not?\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cIt was raining Daddy.\u00a0 There was mud everywhere.\u201d  (This was said with a \u201cDuh!\u201d attitude and Roc looked up at GC like he was a moron!\u00a0 I snorted and said \u201cDid you hear the way he said that to you?!\u00a0 It was raining  D-a-d-d-y!\u201d  causing the Roc to repeat that line over and over.) *** Today while I was getting the Roc\u2019s lunch ready he was bouncing around me excitedly: Roc:\u00a0  \u201cI\u2019m going to have turkey-lurkey for lunch!\u00a0 Yay!\u00a0 I like turkey-lurkey\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cOkay, I\u2019m opening up a new package of turkey just for you.\u00a0 It\u2019s your lucky day.\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cAnd I\u2019m not supposed to put it on the table.\u00a0 That table is dirty.\u201d   (He has been removing food from his plate and setting it right next to the plate on the table\u2013we had been confused about that\u2013until today.) Me:\u00a0  \u201cYes, your food should stay on your plate.\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the plate to get wet.\u00a0 I\u2019m weird like that.\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cOkay\u2026 (thinking in my head did he just say \u201cI\u2019m weird like that?\u201d and that explains why he keeps putting the food on the table instead of just eating off his plate!)\u00a0  \u201cHow about if I put a paper towel down on your plate and put the turkey on top of it?\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cYes!\u00a0 Okay!\u201d *** After lunch we did one of the Roc\u2019s favorite things \u2013 baked brownies.\u00a0 I was greasing the brownie pan and he was sitting at the table eating his turkey-lurkey (on a paper towel, on a plate) when he started the following conversation: Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMommy, do we go places?\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cYes, we go lots of places.\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cI like to go somewhere.\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cI know.\u00a0 You really like to travel to far away places to.\u201d Roc:  \u201cMommy, why do we get married?\u201d Me:  \u2026 (shocked into silence, mouth hanging open, GFCF butter poised over the brownie pan, did he just ask me a why question?)\u00a0  \u201cWhat?\u00a0 Why did we get married?\u00a0 Mommy and Daddy?\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMommy and Daddy.\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cWell, we really like each other, we love each other, and wanted to always be together.\u201d  (wondering if that was the best way to explain marriage having never thought about it.) Roc:\u00a0  \u201cWe like each other.\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cYes.\u00a0 Roc, do you think you would like to get married someday?\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cYes.\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cWhen you are older you could get married like Mommy and Daddy got married.\u00a0 Who do you think you want to marry?\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMommy and Daddy.\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cMommy and Daddy are already married to each other.\u00a0 You can only marry one person.\u00a0 You could marry a girl you really like to be around.\u00a0 Are there any girls you really like to be around?\u201d Roc:\u00a0  \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cHow about Miss P (special ed teacher in his kindergarten room) or Mrs. L?\u201d  (he cut me off as soon as he heard Miss P\u2019s name) Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMiss P.\u00a0 I will marry Miss P.\u201d *** I feel like a broken record saying again that he is amazing me, that I didn\u2019t know if he would get here, and yet \u2013 here he is.\u00a0 I am beyond thrilled. He is thinking.\u00a0 He is understanding.\u00a0 He is asking questions.\u00a0 He is finding his own voice and expressing himself.\u00a0 We are conversing. We. Are. Conversing. I will never tire of talking to this child.\u00a0 That much I know. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/from-the-mouth-of-babes/", "title": "From the Mouth of\u00a0Babes"},
{"date": "December 14, 2009", "body": "On Friday night before I turned out the light in the Roc\u2019s bedroom I poked my head back inside and whispered \u201cRemember, we\u2019re going to pick up our puppy tomorrow\u201d to which the Roc replied \u201cI\u2019m so excited!!\u201d and then immediately \u201cHe won\u2019t look like Tigger\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Tigger is my neighbor\u2019s pit bull mix.\u00a0 A very sweet dog, but a big one, one that looks imposing complete with a deep bark.\u00a0 I assured him that our doggy would be really small and wouldn\u2019t bark like Tigger as I softly shut the door.\u00a0 As with everything brand new I wondered if I prepared the Roc well enough and if we made the right decision to change his environment so drastically.\u00a0 A puppy is kinda drastic right?\u00a0 We had talked a lot about the dog and looked at pictures of the breed as well as pictures of our puppy, but I never know (until much later) how much has sunk in and what has been comprehended.\u00a0 I wonder if I second guess myself more because of his Autism, or if other Moms second and third guess every decision they make. I know that puppies and kids go together\u2026but what about puppies and a kid with Autism?\u00a0 What about this kid who is afraid of big dogs and won\u2019t let most dogs approach him? I tried not to worry as I slid under my flannel sheets and three (of our four) cats settled themselves on the bed that night (Oh My GOD\u2013what about the CATS?!!\u00a0 Do puppies and CATS go together?! Ha!) So on Saturday morning we went to pick up Guinness, our Boston Terrier puppy.\u00a0 The Roc continually said he was \u201cso excited!\u201d as we drove up to the breeders house in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 The Roc was excited, but what about GC and I?\u00a0 Kinda nervous to tell you the truth, but definitely excited, just like the Roc.\u00a0 I grew up with dogs but never had to housebreak them or take care of them when they were puppies.\u00a0 They were easy once my dad had trained them!\u00a0 The Roc remembered exactly where we were going after only being there once and while at the breeder he asked for her to bring out the little box of dogs.\u00a0 When we went to pick out our puppy weeks ago the pup was only 5 days old and she brought them out in a little box, and the Roc remembered that!\u00a0 Of course he did.\u00a0 We paid the breeder, got the puppy\u2019s papers and a few instructions, and were handed our puppy.\u00a0 Both GC and I looked at each other like  what do we do now? Guinness slept on the ride home and continued to sleep much of the weekend.\u00a0 He slept on us, and he even slept on the Roc when I tried to get a picture for our Christmas cards! He slept where ever we put him. He\u2019s sleeping on the floor next to me right now! The cat is not too happy about it either. The Roc\u2019s reaction to the puppy\u2019s presence has surprised me.\u00a0 He was so interested in Guinness and wanted him to come out of his crate and be where ever he was.\u00a0  \u201cI want to sleep with Guinness\u201d  and/or  \u201cI want to lay with Guinness\u201d  were the phrases repeated over and over while he would lay down next to the sleeping puppy.\u00a0 He was up off the floor 2 seconds later but it was so cute that he wanted to be near him.\u00a0 He even asked  \u201cCan he come upstairs and play The Grouchy Ladybug Game with me?\u201d  After I explained that the dog cannot play those kind of games he said  \u201cThen I\u2019ll go and get my marble run\u201d  and played with the toy near the puppy. He will spontaneously pet the dog but is afraid that the puppy will bite him so he won\u2019t get his hand near Guinness\u2019s mouth.\u00a0 The puppy loves the Roc already though.\u00a0 His little ears perk up when the Roc comes into the room and his eyes follow the Roc\u2019s every move.\u00a0 I was worried that the Roc would want to take the dog back after we got it home but he did the opposite of what I thought.\u00a0 Of course.\u00a0 He wanted the puppy to come in bed with him while I read the bedtime stories the last two nights, and this morning he asked if Guinness could come to school. So far so good.\u00a0 I think this puppy and this kid will go together nicely.

{"date": "December 21, 2009", "body": "The first weekend Guinness was home he stayed where ever we put him and was so calm.\u00a0 The Roc was interested in him, he wanted to be near him, and even wanted the puppy in bed with him while I read his customary three bedtime stories.\u00a0 I was so excited for what seemed to be a great start on adding another little being to our family\u2026until I opened the crate on Monday morning\u2026and a new dog came out. A dog who wouldn\u2019t stay where I put him, wanted to explore and sniff everything and everyone.\u00a0 A dog who was turning into a bit of a wild thing.\u00a0 Dogs getting in your face and sniffing is what the Roc has a problem with, and so he suddenly had a pretty big problem with Guinness.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to be near him anymore for fear of the dog sniffing him.\u00a0 He screamed when Guinness made a move in his direction and hopped on a chair every time the dog got too close.\u00a0 In typical GC fashion he doomed their relationship and feared we made a big mistake in bringing Guinness home.\u00a0 (GC is a self proclaimed pessimist, just ask him.)\u00a0 But I knew better. I started talking to the Roc about being quiet, calm, and moving slowly around Guinness.\u00a0 I explained that puppies are attracted to lots of noise and fast movement, and if he didn\u2019t want to attract Guinness\u2019s attention he needed to take it down a notch.\u00a0 He tried and even though it was hard for him, and he still had moments where he just couldn\u2019t seem to control his reaction, he has managed to slow down.\u00a0 Over the last week the Roc started to interact more with the playful puppy Guinness has turned out to be.\u00a0 He is always interested in what the puppy is doing, runs to get the dog to chase him (just don\u2019t let that dog bark!), and he still wants the puppy to come in bed with him to read stories.\u00a0 He just doesn\u2019t want the puppy to sniff his face, but he will be still and allow him to sniff his hands, feet, and legs. A pretty big deal for him.\u00a0 Working through his fears.\u00a0 Adapting.\u00a0 Rolling with changes.\u00a0 Dealing with the unexpected.\u00a0 Learning how to behave around a dog.\u00a0 Keeping quiet instead of screaming.\u00a0 Walking when he really wants to run.\u00a0 Controlling his reactions.\u00a0 In fact, all of that is pretty huge for him.\u00a0 He needs reminders and sometimes I hear him reminding himself\u00a0 \u201cwalk, don\u2019t run and he won\u2019t chase you\u201d as he eyes the dog and scoots past him. Even though he was slightly afraid of the dog, if we asked him if we should give Guinness back (we never would) he would say \u201cNO!\u201d\u00a0 Whew!\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to have to say \u201cWell, we\u2019re keeping him anyway\u201d if he would have said yes to giving the dog back!\u00a0 I knew he liked the dog so I was pretty sure of his answer before I asked the question.\u00a0 I knew we just had to work out the kinks between the two.\u00a0 Teaching the Roc how to behave around Guinness, and teach Guinness to give the Roc some space.\u00a0 Both are doable. Guinness is still enamored with the Roc.\u00a0 It\u2019s true, puppies and kids just go together.\u00a0 When the Roc enters the room Guinness\u2019s little puppy ears perk up and his eyes seek the boy out.\u00a0 The screams and fearful energy coming from the Roc last week haven\u2019t deterred the puppy from wanting to be around him.\u00a0 I am truly grateful for that.\u00a0 Guinness is turning out to be a pretty neat little dog. Today the Roc was home from school because of the massive amount of snow we received over the weekend (he\u2019s off tomorrow too\u2026GAH!) and so he had the opportunity to spend lots and lots of time with Guinness.\u00a0 Today was the first day the Roc actually wanted to play with the dog instead of just watching him play.\u00a0 They played \u201cGit Yur Ducky!\u201d\u00a0 (get your ducky) and had a blast.\u00a0 The Roc would throw the duck, yell \u201cGit Yur Ducky,\u201d Guinness would chase the duck, the Roc would chase Guinness, and then they would reverse on the way back to me.\u00a0 It was hysterical to watch.\u00a0 Check it out. He wore that dog out! Now my next challenge is to teach the Roc that just because he wants to play \u201cGit yur ducky!\u201d Guinness may not.\u00a0 The Roc had so much fun playing with him that he wanted to play that same game three more times throughout the day.\u00a0 By dinnertime Guinness was done and the Roc had a little meltdown because he wouldn\u2019t play. More screaming, but for a completely different reason.\u00a0 At least Guinness was unfazed\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0085.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0050.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0090.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0056.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0096.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0003.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/guinness-update/", "title": "Guinness Update"},
{"date": "December 26, 2009", "body": "The Roc asked for three things for Christmas this year.\u00a0 The first year he actually asked for something in particular, a milestone I celebrated by buying every item he asked for.\u00a0 Though I\u2019m sure most parents try their best to honor the Christmas wishes of their children, there is something especially significant about the wishes of a boy who almost never asks for anything (except lollipops).\u00a0 A boy who despises Toys R Us and refuses to go inside.\u00a0 He asked for a Spider-Man couch, a purple hippo, and the Kohls Cares stuffed animals \u2013 the mouse, cat, moose, and pig that go with his favorite \u201cIf you give A\u2026\u201d books.\u00a0 Those four stuffed animals were a late addition to his wish list which happened after we were at Kohls shopping and he saw them at the checkout, grabbed them, and then cried and had a mini meltdown when he couldn\u2019t bring them home.\u00a0 I smiled to myself as GC escorted the Roc from the building because those four stuffed animals were already in our storage closet.\u00a0 Score!\u00a0 So I was pretty excited to see if this was the year the Roc would actually be interested in what was under the wrapping paper versus the wrapping paper itself. Like most parents GC and I were up late on Christmas Eve busy with the last minute wrapping and placing of gifts under the tree.\u00a0 So when GC got up with the puppy in the early morning hours I reminded him to turn on the tree so it would be lit up when the Roc came out of his room in the morning.\u00a0 He\u2019s been coming downstairs in the mornings on his own (that\u2019s new!) and I had asked him when I put him to bed if he would be coming down to my bedroom in the AM, and he whispered \u201cYes\u201d as I shut his door.\u00a0 Sure enough, I heard his door open and then a looooonnnngggg pause where he must have been stupefied by the presents under the tree in the family room below, and then I heard his little feet hit the first floor and go pitter patter down the hall to our room. \u201cMommy!\u00a0 There\u2019s presents under the tree!\u00a0 LOTS of presents!!\u00a0 And there\u2019s a BIG one!\u00a0 A BIG RECTANGLE one behind the tree!!!\u201d Oh boy was he excited. We trooped into the family room and ohhh and ahhhed at the amount of gifts Santa had brought. The Roc waited patiently for the go ahead. And then the opening began! Look!\u00a0 A mouse!\u00a0 I wanted one of these! What about this big one?\u00a0 Back here? Not yet? Okay, I\u2019ll open the smaller ones first. What is it?\u00a0 A Behaviors with Friends video from Nonna and Nonno!\u00a0 Perfect! This one\u2019s from Aunt Sandy and Uncle Allen. Aunt Sandy sure does use some strong tape\u2026! Getting there\u2026 It\u2019s an ostrich!! Let\u2019s keep going!\u00a0 A book! I wonder what\u2019s in this one? The PIG!!!!!!! And the MOOSE! I like him! LOOK!\u00a0 It\u2019s a\u2026 PURPLE HIPPO!!!!! Half way done.\u00a0 A few more to go. What\u2019s is this? Ohhhh\u2026 A bathtub fountain! Almost done.\u00a0 Here comes that BIG one! A bike! One present left! The Spider-Man couch!! The Roc GOT it this year!\u00a0 He was so excited to see what was under the wrapping paper and it wasn\u2019t until hours later (as I was starting this post) that he played in the wrapping paper. One of his favorite gifts is a little bathtub fountain that I found at a neat little toy store/teacher supply store in early fall.\u00a0 As soon as I saw it I just knew that my water obsessed son would love it. Upon swallowing the last bite of his french toast he was begging to take a bath and play with the fountain.\u00a0 I was worried that it wouldn\u2019t work, but it does. and he LOVES it! That smile is the best gift! We relaxed the rest of the day and played with Guinness in the kitchen, and then played some of the new games the Roc got for Christmas. GC had to do some game assembly, while Guinness supervised. The Roc went to bed with all his new animals tucked around him.\u00a0 GC and I were asleep by 10!\u00a0 It was a good day. Happy Holidays!

{"date": "December 22, 2009", "body": "I have always loved to read.\u00a0 I remember going to the library as a child with my mother, heading into the childrens section, and picking out books to bring home.\u00a0 The cool, musty silence of the old brick building, and the feel of the papery hardbacks in my little hands are memories forever ingrained in my mind.\u00a0 I remember checking out all the  Babysitters Club  books and later the  Sweet Valley Twin  series from the little library extension that opened closer to our home.\u00a0 I would check out as many as I could carry.\u00a0 I read anywhere and everywhere.\u00a0 I used to hide out in our camper to read my father\u2019s Stephen King and Dean Koontz books undisturbed, and I read while the camper was forest bound on weekend camping trips.\u00a0 I read at the dinner table, and I read while out at restaurants \u2013 how nice was that for my parents!\u00a0 I READ books while we were out at restaurants, dang they were lucky.\u00a0 During my teenage years I laid out on our deck saturated in suntan oil and read novels for fun.\u00a0 I remember staying up into the wee hours of the morning finishing a novel I just couldn\u2019t put down while in high school.\u00a0 In fact, I still do that.\u00a0 GC often finds me propped up in bed reading way past the hour I said I was going to go to bed.\u00a0 I love to read.\u00a0 I always hoped to pass on the love of a good book to our child. The one thing every new Mom hears about, besides the importance of breast milk, is the importance of reading to young children.\u00a0 Given my love of the written word, I knew my kid would never lack in bedtime, or anytime stories.\u00a0 Books were one of the first things I bought when I found out I was pregnant.\u00a0 I started reading to the Roc at an early age \u2013 in utero.\u00a0 I used to read  Good Night Moon  and  House Mouse Friends  to my growing belly.\u00a0 I even got GC to read to my belly sometimes, though in truth that was a little weird for me.\u00a0 I preferred to sit in the glider I just HAD to have and read board books out loud, by myself. A few weeks after the Roc was born I traded breastfeeding for the breast pump and felt so guilty.\u00a0 No matter how hard I tried, breastfeeding this child just wasn\u2019t working out for us.\u00a0 The guilt I felt was immense.\u00a0 I hated watching the Roc cry while I hooked myself up to that pump, but it is literally impossible to sooth a squawking infant and operate a double breast pump at the same time.\u00a0 Believe me, I tried.\u00a0 So I started strapping him into the bouncy seat, balancing the pump bottles on my knees, hunching over to keep them in place, and reading to him for the 20 minutes it took to empty myself.\u00a0 It was the start of his love affair with books.\u00a0 He grew to LOVE being read to. He still enjoys it and we read every night before bed.\u00a0 Most nights he tries to stretch our three bedtime stories to five or six, and most of the time I let him.\u00a0 What\u2019s the harm?\u00a0 I get to spend a little more time with him doing something we both enjoy, and more reading can never hurt! Lately the Roc has become enamored with two books I recently purchased through the monthly scholastic book club order at his school,  Let\u2019s Be Friends  and  We Are Alike, We Are Different .\u00a0 First he wanted to read them over and over, they were the only books he chose night after night, and now they are constantly with him.\u00a0 He has to know where they are and if he moves locations in the house, they come too.\u00a0 He will even stop what he is doing, ask where they are, and then run off to find them. It used to be that he was never without his little stuffed elephants named  \u201cbaby\u201d and \u201cEE\u201d  and now he is never without these two books. I find them on the counter when I am making his breakfast (and no, that is not wine on the counter in the morning, that is light olive oil in a wine bottle.\u00a0 I speak the truth.\u00a0 I\u2019d rather have a Mikes and I can barely eat in the morning, let alone drink!) They are on the table during meals, and even while he plays with and eats his nightly green beans.\u00a0 He was making the letters H and R, and then a box before I  threatened him with the loss of a cookie  convinced him to eat them. They are with him while we play games, play in his room, and even while we watch a show together on the couch. They are the first thing he finds after school, along with a lollipop, and the last thing he touches before falling asleep. It\u2019s adorable isn\u2019t it? Also, how completely appropriate that my son, who has to work so hard to interact with his peers, and who happens to be a spunky, fun little boy on the spectrum should become so attached to these two titles.\u00a0 He does not know how to read yet, but I watch him flipping through the books and pointing to different letters and words.\u00a0 He is particularly interested in a certain few pages that are about laughing with friends in the book  Let\u2019s Be Friends .\u00a0 Both books use photographs of real, smiling children throughout, and I think that has something to do with their appeal.\u00a0 I find it utterly fascinating that he has become so bound to these two books.\u00a0 I wonder if he understands the significance of the the titles in relation to himself and his own daily struggles with peer interactions and fitting in. The books are getting pretty worn, and now I have to remind the Roc to keep them elevated and away from Guinness, but I\u2019m excited for all that is implied in his connection with these two books. It seems that not only have I created an outdoor kid, I may also have a bookworm on my hands! Yay!

My first memory of Grammy will forever be ingrained upon my mind.\u00a0 I had just moved from Nebraska to New Jersey to shack up with GC after spending 1 week with him and only having known him 1 month.\u00a0 I was pretty certain his whole family thought I was a complete loon.\u00a0 I felt that a lot was riding on the first impression I presented and so I was quite nervous on the drive to Grammy\u2019s house for the first family dinner, that included me.\u00a0 I clenched my hands together and peppered GC for information about his family during the twisty turning drive to her yellow house.\u00a0 I was worried he was going to throw me under the bus for the Midwestern way I pronounced Italian, not to mention my Minnesota accent.\u00a0 (He did.)\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember conversation from the evening, what GC wore, or what we ate (other than I KNOW there was pie on the table after the meal), but I do remember that I wore a little cotton light blue t-shirt dress and hoped against hope I would meet the family\u2019s approval, my stomach sick with nerves. The reason I remember the dress I was wearing is because it is tied up in my first memory of Grammy.\u00a0 She was aghast to see a few cat hairs clinging to my cotton dress and insisted on rolling me with a lint brush.\u00a0 I tried to wave her off but she was persistent and so I stood stock still while she rolled the brush over my body including my rear!\u00a0 I joked with GC on the car ride home that I didn\u2019t know what the rest of his family thought, but I was pretty sure his Grammy liked me, heck, she practically felt me up!\u00a0 It was classic Grammy, taking care, from the first moment we met.

{"date": "January 11, 2010", "body": "My son, who has Autism, was given the educational label of \u201cEmotionally Disturbed\u201d to receive services at school.\u00a0 This happened back in the spring after he was evaluated by the Delaware Autism Program (DAP.)\u00a0 Basically, to make a long story short, he wasn\u2019t \u201cAutistic enough\u201d to go to their program so he cannot have the educational label of Autism.\u00a0 Never mind that he has a diagnosis from a neurologist, a developmental pediatrician, and the psychologist at the Children\u2019s hospital.\u00a0 Oh no, those medical people don\u2019t know squat, do they?\u00a0 And forget about the MOTHER who has read, educated herself, and happens to be living with the boy who has Autism.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t know diddly either. Apparently. Definitely disturbing.\u00a0 So much that I haven\u2019t really been able to let it go. Can you tell? I did add an addendum to his file stating that he has a medical diagnosis of Autism and added copies of his latest reports from said neurologist, developmental pediatrician, and psychologist.\u00a0 I figured his new teacher would read his file before he started school.\u00a0 Back in November I was disturbed to find out that she hadn\u2019t read the whole thing (the addendum was most likely at the end.)\u00a0 She didn\u2019t know he had Autism until I mentioned it (and I mentioned it over the summer, thinking she\u2019d read his file.)\u00a0 She didn\u2019t know that DAP holds the key to the educational label of Autism in our tiny state.\u00a0 I filled her in. Something else that has been niggling at the back of my mind is that the special ed teacher told me she read his Functional Behavior Analysis (which we wrote when the psychologist gave him the emotionally disturbed label) over the summer but has not had to implement ANY of it and hasn\u2019t looked at it since.\u00a0 He isn\u2019t a behavior problem in the class. Emotionally disturbed my ass. Oh yes, I find this disturbing. Recently I reached out to a couple Moms I know with boys on the spectrum to ask what labels their children have, and what I found out disturbed me even further.\u00a0 In one case a boy with Aspergers has the educational label of Autism and the other has the label of Learning disabled.\u00a0 All it took to for the child with Aspergers to get the educational label of Autism was a letter from his regular pediatrician stating that he is on the spectrum and how it could affect his schooling.\u00a0 The other with the educational label of learning disabled was given that label because his biggest struggle was with adaptive behavior.\u00a0 This is a child who taught himself to read at 4 years old!\u00a0 He is not learning disabled!!\u00a0 The school psychologist told me that the Roc didn\u2019t qualify for the learning disabled label because he wasn\u2019t showing any academic issues.\u00a0 Well, he certainly cannot read!\u00a0 And he definitely has issues with adaptive behavior!! So now I\u2019m seriously disturbed by all of this.\u00a0 What an injustice to him to have the label \u201cEmotionally Disturbed\u201d following him around, tacked on behind his name at the top of his file. So today I put on my advocate hat and called the school\u2019s special education director.\u00a0 Of course, I got her voice mail.\u00a0 I took a deep breath, retracted my mama bear claws, spewed out a little introduction, and requested more information on how the district determines the educational labels they give their special needs students, as I have not been able to locate it on the state\u2019s website, as well as a time to meet to go over a more appropriate label for the Roc. We will see how quickly she gets back to me.\u00a0 I always end my messages with a cheery:\u00a0 \u201cI very much look forward to speaking with you regarding this matter, talk to you soon!\u201d Oh yes, I look forward to stating the Roc\u2019s case on this matter.

Meanwhile through another Autism mommy friend I got in touch with a woman who apparently has fought the system.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know her whole story yet, but she was mad when she heard mine.\u00a0 She requested information on the Roc and so I spent some quality time at the UPS store photocopying all of the Roc\u2019s evaluations, both medical and through the school.\u00a0\u00a0 Then I dropped them off at her house this morning.\u00a0 She told me via email today that she finally won her battle for her son to have an appropriate Autism label\u2026and he\u2019s graduating this year!

{"date": "January 28, 2010", "body": "GC and I had ideas about how we would parent our children before we actually became parents.\u00a0 You know, we\u2019d use time outs, the 1-2-3 method, lots of talking, no screaming or yelling, and I was pretty firm on my NO hitting rule.\u00a0 GC maintained that there were certain things that would be cause for a good smack on the tush like lighting fires in the woods, throwing rocks at cars and/or people, and torturing siblings (not that GC did any of those things mind you\u2026ah hem.)\u00a0 He stood by his \u201cboys are different than girls\u201d and really, how would I know?\u00a0 I have a sister and he has two brothers.\u00a0 Mainly we agreed to work together as a united front and our children, or course, were going to be pretty well behaved\u2026 and then came the Roc. He was an angel from about two months to two years of age.\u00a0 And then the screaming started.\u00a0 I understand now that he was intensely frustrated without a way to communicate and most definitely dealing with sensory issues he could not articulate.\u00a0 In any case this is what I dealt with on a daily basis: (proof that he isn\u2019t always smiling!\u00a0 I still see that face at least once a day!) We started putting him in time out every time he screamed and man did he scream a lot.\u00a0 So he spent a lot of time in the corner.\u00a0 Then it was suggested to me that I try dabbing a little bit of Tabasco sauce on my finger and sticking that on his tongue.\u00a0 We called it \u201cscreaming sauce\u201d and it didn\u2019t seem to have any impact on the screaming.\u00a0 Looking back I feel pretty bad about doing that to him, but he likes salsa now, so maybe I helped him get used to spicy foods? In any case time outs have never worked for this child.\u00a0 Not in the way I see them work for other parents. While we were in South Carolina over New Years I witnessed something I have never, ever experienced in my own home.\u00a0 My sister in law, mother in law, and I were sitting in the family room together while my niece and nephew played nearby (the Roc was already in bed, I don\u2019t mess with bed time, even on vacation).\u00a0 It was late and my nephew Aiden was a little tired, his sister on the other hand can go on and on and she was niggling him, getting under his skin, as siblings sometimes do.\u00a0 She stepped on something of his and he retaliated by bumping her in the leg with his head.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t even call it \u201cheadbutting\u201d because it wasn\u2019t a hard hit.\u00a0 My sister in law is an awesome mother, she is on top of her kids, and they are not allowed to tease or be disrespectful.\u00a0 So when this happened right in front of her she gasped, raised her arm, pointed to the front door across the room, and said in a low quiet voice:\u00a0 \u201cGet in time out right now.\u201d\u00a0 No dramatic screaming from her.\u00a0 With a protruding lower lip Aiden quietly (OMG!\u00a0 quietly!) went to the corner, sat on the floor, and didn\u2019t say a peep\u2026 OMG.\u00a0 Seriously!\u00a0 Oh. My.\u00a0 God.\u00a0 Never has the Roc ever behaved that way while getting disciplined.\u00a0 Now I know that I shouldn\u2019t compare, Aiden is a typically developing boy, and he is 10 months older than the Roc, but still I was flabbergasted.\u00a0 That\u2019s how it happens in (some) people\u2019s houses?\u00a0 What am I doing wrong?\u00a0 The Roc couldn\u2019t care less about time out or any kind of punishment we\u2019ve tried for that matter.\u00a0 There is nothing I can take away that matters to him.\u00a0 Being separated from the group isn\u2019t really a punishment to him.\u00a0 And lately I\u2019ve been losing my mind and have resorted to screaming. Yesterday I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror as I screamed at the Roc to get upstairs to his room and I was frightened.\u00a0 It was just like when Sully the monster on Monsters Inc. sees the still images of himself when he scared the cr@p out of little Boo.\u00a0 He was surprised to see his grotesquely distorted face and so sorry to have scared the little one.\u00a0 I was mortified to see the monster I became, and was instantly sorry to have screamed my head off at the Roc.\u00a0 So, so sorry to have made him cry and to hear him say:\u00a0 \u201cMommy, you scared me!\u201d with a single tear tracing a path down his chubby pink cheek. Broke. my. heart. I felt that I would surely be awarded Worst Mother of the Year. I vowed to try harder today.\u00a0 I knew I would have ample opportunity.\u00a0 You see, the Roc is still a screamer and it is hard to hear so much screeching, many times for the simplest, most ridiculous reasons.\u00a0 Every day.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve been having a hard time with it lately.\u00a0 He screams about food falling on the floor, the table, or heaven forbid \u2013 his pants.\u00a0 He screams when the dog gets to rough (which isn\u2019t the dogs fault, the Roc is crazy wild and the dog gets revved up.)\u00a0 He screeches at his inability to get the cap off a jar, to throw a ball exactly where he wants it to go, to zip a zipper, or get his shoe on.\u00a0 And on and on.\u00a0 He is so easily frustrated. And I won\u2019t even get started on the defiance we have been experiencing lately.\u00a0 That\u2019s a whole other post.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just say that if he doesn\u2019t want to do something, he\u2019s not going to do it.\u00a0 He won\u2019t do it because he\u2019s supposed to or because you want him to.\u00a0 And the devilish smile when he\u2019s realized he\u2019s gotten under your skin?\u00a0 Maddening.\u00a0 But I won\u2019t go there. So this morning when the screaming started and I felt the anger well up inside and my annoyance meter hit the red zone I shouted,\u00a0 \u201cScreaming means you get a HUG and a KISS!\u00a0 Yay!!\u201d and then I chased him around the kitchen until I was able to capture him and hug, hug, hug away!\u00a0 He reacted just like I thought he would, he laughed and tried to wiggle out of my loving embrace.\u00a0 I continued with this scream = hugs and kisses mantra until the bus came. It felt good to find a way to redirect his attention and keep my cool.\u00a0 We had a much better morning together.\u00a0 We had fun.\u00a0 There was less screaming, or at least it turned to giggles pretty quickly.\u00a0 I felt like I outsmarted him for once. Until he got home from school and screamed so I would chase him around the kitchen and hug him.\u00a0 The boy loves to be chased!\u00a0 Oh, my poor, poor ears. Now I have to figure something else out.\u00a0 Or I\u2019ll just go back to what I was doing last week: Those noise canceling headphones may look really dorky, but they do the trick! (The Roc HATES when I wear them.\u00a0 He screams, which seems a bit counter productive, but what\u2019s a girl to do?)

{"date": "January 31, 2010", "body": "A little story that has stuck with me since Christmas. On Christmas Eve GC, the Roc, and I traversed the neighborhood on foot to deliver Christmas cards to our friends and neighbors.\u00a0 Our last stop was right next door where my neighbor\u2019s daughter was inside with her new boyfriend (I cannot remember his name, so he is Boyfriend in this memory) wrapping presents for her kids who were napping.\u00a0 Of course Heather invited us inside, we rarely see each other anymore, though I see her kids every weekend next door at their Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s playing in the back yard.\u00a0 We started to catch up on the last few months and the Roc immediately started asking to leave.\u00a0 The more I talked the more he yanked on my arm, my coat, my leg, pounded on the door and whined to  leave .\u00a0 I brought him back home and left him with GC, then I scooted next door and took Heather up on the offer of a stiff drink. I apologized for the Roc\u2019s behavior and answered the obligatory \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d question with my usual \u201cReally good!\u201d\u00a0 Then Heather told me that the new Boyfriend has been a special ed teacher for many years and he works with Autistic kids.\u00a0 Upon hearing of the Roc\u2019s Autism diagnosis he asked the question I\u2019ve been asked countless times before. \u201cSo what is his special skill or interest?\u00a0 Does he have something he loves or excels at?\u201d I hate being asked that question.\u00a0 I never know how to answer it.\u00a0 The Roc is smart and special (and not because of his Autism) but he doesn\u2019t have a splinter skill.\u00a0 Not all children with Autism do.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t teach himself to read at an early age, he cannot do advanced math, and he doesn\u2019t play an instrument by ear.\u00a0 So I answered with my standard answer.\u00a0 He is smart and funny, and he\u2019s making progress everyday.\u00a0 We are very proud of how hard he works.\u00a0 As far as an intense interest goes, he is obsessed with water.\u00a0 Waterfalls, rivers, streams, fountains, any kind of moving water.\u00a0 He loves to play in the bath, he is taking swimming lessons, and he enjoys the beach, especially watching the waves. Boyfriend went on to say that not all children with Autism show their special skills at an early age.\u00a0 The Roc may still be developing a skill.\u00a0 Or his interests will develop into a skill in the future.\u00a0 Then he told me that my description of the Roc reminded him of a boy with Autism he had in his class ten years ago, he too was completely water obsessed.\u00a0 He wanted to do something with this boy\u2019s love of water, and so with the parents permission, he took the boy to his beach house and taught him to surf.\u00a0 Now, ten years later, this 19 year old kid is an amazingly good surfer, so good that Boyfriend thinks he has a shot at going pro.\u00a0 His love of water has also led him to develop an affinity for photography, specifically photographing waves.\u00a0 Whenever Boyfriend and friends travel south to surf this kid comes along and he pays him to photograph their surfing adventures.\u00a0 He ended by telling me that you just never know where things will lead, how these kids will develop their skills, and to keep an open mind about the future. I relayed this story to GC when I got back home and I could see him turning it over in his mind. After the Roc\u2019s Autism diagnosis we found it hard to think about the future.\u00a0 I struggled with it terribly.\u00a0 I felt that his future was stolen, or at least my dreams for his future were ripped out from under me.\u00a0 Doom and gloom psychologists charting his supposed intelligence on a bell curve furthered my feelings that the future looked bleak.\u00a0 But time has a way of changing your perspective.\u00a0 The Roc is definitely on his own time table, but I see his potential is starting to bloom.\u00a0 Now we think a bit more about the future.\u00a0 We often say that the Roc will have some sort of job that allows him access to water.\u00a0 We\u2019ve joked that he will become a landscape architect, specializing in water gardens, or that he will design his own line of fountains.\u00a0 But surfer/wave photographer has never crossed our minds. I\u2019ve added it to the list and now I smile inside imagining the Roc as a surfer dude, traveling the world with a camera slung around his neck. I\u2019ve carried that conversation with me since Christmas Eve.\u00a0 I felt like I had been given a little unexpected gift that afternoon.\u00a0 It was a wonderful conversation.\u00a0 A reminder to keep dreaming of the future for the Roc. He will find his way. We will help him get there. We\u2019ll even buy him a surf board if he requests one.

{"date": "December 2, 2009", "body": "A lot has happened in the last couple weeks and I\u2019ve just been out of touch with blogging about it.\u00a0 I have many draft posts in my dashboard and I just can\u2019t seem to find the creativity to finish them and hit publish.\u00a0 I have a post about the first conference of the year, the annual IEP, My get away weekend (bliss), the roller skating birthday party, and I even started the obligatory \u201cthanks for everything\u201d post on Thanksgiving.\u00a0 Now too much time has gone by and other things are happening and I\u2019ve decided to combine them into a catch-up post.\u00a0 I\u2019ll try to keep it brief\u2026 The Conference: I went to the first conference of this important Kindergarten year a couple weeks ago.\u00a0 I woke up early on that morning with a bit of a pit in my stomach.\u00a0 Most likely I will be forever anxious about this child.\u00a0 Is he learning?\u00a0 I know he can memorize, but are things clicking?\u00a0 Comprehension?\u00a0 Is he coping?\u00a0 Is he making friends?\u00a0 During open house a couple months ago I was relieved to hear that he was adjusting to school and had been doing well.\u00a0 I knew I would get more detail about his day and how he was doing academically at this conference.\u00a0 And just like at the open house, I was relieved to hear that he is adjusting both socially and academically.\u00a0 He is learning to regulate his behavior and use his words when upset or frustrated instead of lashing out.\u00a0 In fact, his aggressive behaviors are almost nonexistent!\u00a0 He is starting to interact more with his peers, though the adults have to help him initiate conversation.\u00a0 He is following directions and is listening.\u00a0 He is answering questions.\u00a0 What amazed me more was that academically right now he is in the middle of the pack.\u00a0 Last year when he had his four old year school psychology evaluation I was devastated when she showed me where she placed him on the bell curve and explained his IQ scores to me.\u00a0 I held out hope that she was wrong, and that as his language increased he would show everyone just how smart he is, and am so glad I did.\u00a0 I know that he is behind many of his peers in many areas, but I was pleased to hear that he is actually above some in certain areas!\u00a0 That was something I didn\u2019t expect and while I try my hardest not to compare it was nice to hear that he was good at something. Weekend Escape: The break was lovely.\u00a0 Christa and I had a wonderfully relaxing weekend during which we got massages, shopped the outlets (and I only looked at stuff for me), ate lots of good food, watched 3 chick flicks (and realized just how predictable they are after watching so many!), chatted and generally relaxed.\u00a0 It was wonderful and I had much more patience to  deal  during the Thanksgiving marathon week when the Roc was home from school.\u00a0 We will definitely repeat the experience. The Party: While I was away on my mini-break GC took the Roc to a birthday party at a roller skating rink.\u00a0 Hello sensory overload!\u00a0 According to GC (who is always a little short on details for me) the party went fine.\u00a0 The Roc tried rollerskating but it was more like him hanging from GC\u2019s arms while GC slowly pulled and pushed him around the rink.\u00a0 The end of skating came quickly after the Roc got his leg tangled in GC\u2019s and they both tumbled down.\u00a0 He shed a few tears and wanted to watch from the sidelines after that.\u00a0 The birthday boy came over a few times and sat with the Roc, which was very nice of him.\u00a0 Apparently this little boy figured out that the Roc likes to be tickled so he kept coming over to tickle him.\u00a0 I wish I could have witnessed those interactions.\u00a0 The rink was loud and busy with no less than 6 birthday parties going on at once so lots of people, movement, noise, and flashing lights.\u00a0 Basically a sensory nightmare for someone with some sensory issues.\u00a0 The Roc coped and GC said he did seem to shut down toward the end, but he held himself together long enough to get his cupcake.\u00a0 I\u2019m so glad he went, and that GC took him despite his reservations, and that the Roc tried rollerskating! Annual IEP: We had the Roc\u2019s annual IEP meeting last week and it went well.\u00a0 His teacher had given me a list of goals she wanted to add to his IEP during the conference and I thought they were written well and was pleased to see some academic goals being added.\u00a0 He has met, or almost met most of the goals written while in preschool and his current teacher kept many and just altered them to reflect the next phase of development for him.\u00a0 Following one step directions was expanded to following two step directions, working on a non preferred task was expanded to working on task for 5 minutes, responding to verbal cues to interact with peers was expanded to sustaining conversations for 5-6 turns, etc.\u00a0 Overall it was a good meeting.\u00a0 Only at the end when we briefly touched on getting together again in the spring for a placement meeting to decide which setting will be appropriate for next year, and that short conversation started my anxiety about whether to have the Roc repeat a grade.\u00a0 I mentioned that I was told that he could do this more supported Kindergarten this year and do a regular inclusion Kindergarten next year.\u00a0 The special ed administrator firmly stated that if the Roc is still doing so well academically at the end of the year there won\u2019t be a valid reason to hold him back\u2026I\u2019m going to try to shelve my fears about this for a little while and see how he progresses by spring time.\u00a0 Maybe he will be ready for 1st grade by then.\u00a0 Last year I certainly didn\u2019t think he would be ready for Kindergarten at 5 and he\u2019s doing well, he may surprise me again. Thanksgiving: I started a Thanksgiving post that morning and planned on taking pictures throughout the day to emphasize what I was thankful for.\u00a0 I photographed the pie I baked that morning, our annual \u201cHarvest Pie\u201d (apples, pears, & cranberries \u2014\u00a0 sooo yummy!), but I just didn\u2019t continue taking them throughout the day and I abandoned that idea.\u00a0 We did have a nice day and we have a lot to be thankful for.\u00a0 In the interest of length I won\u2019t list them all, it\u2019s the standard stuff anyway.\u00a0 Instead of just the three of us we had one other person attend our Thanksgiving meal, GC\u2019s friend Greg who started medical school in Washington D.C. back in August.\u00a0 The Roc had lots of fun playing basketball with Greg and he commented on how much the Roc has changed since the last time he saw him during the summer.\u00a0 It was nice to have company during a holiday. Odds & Ends: The puppy comes home in two weeks!\u00a0 They are getting their 6 weeks shots today and GC and I are going to see them on Friday morning after getting the Roc on the bus.\u00a0 I\u2019m so excited.\u00a0 What the heck are we getting ourselves into?! We have decided to rip up our carpet on the first floor and put down laminate wood.\u00a0 The \u201cwood\u201d is scattered about the house now and I\u2019m supposed to be unloading the entertainment center and getting stuff out of the way today.\u00a0 Instead I\u2019ve been talking on the phone, reading blogs, and writing this one.\u00a0 I\u2019d better get to work.\u00a0 The carpet is coming up tomorrow night!\u00a0 Yikes. Did you read this whole thing? Yes? Well, you must have lots of time on your hands or you\u2019re my mother (or both!)

{"date": "September 4, 2009", "body": "The Roc has been surprising me lately with the stuff that comes out of his mouth.\u00a0 His imagination is slowly, slowly, slowly emerging and sometimes he sounds just like a\u2026a\u2026kid. Echoalic speech is still sometimes present but usually it\u2019s used appropriately.\u00a0 As in, he will repeat something, but in the right context.\u00a0 For example, at the end of the preschool year his teacher just had to tell me about overhearing him conversing with another student at the sensory table.\u00a0 The other child said something to which the Roc replied \u201cthat\u2019s not funny, and I KNOW funny\u201d and then they continued.\u00a0 She said that she and the para were just giggling at this exchange.\u00a0 What she didn\u2019t know was that it is a line from  Finding Nemo , the movie of that particular month!\u00a0 Another example was when he told his Great Aunt Sandy in Colorado \u201cthat\u2019s a good observation\u201d when she was talking to him about the brownies they were making.\u00a0 She was astounded by this little comment from him and I told her that I say that to him a lot, and she pointed out that he totally used it correctly even though he was repeating me.\u00a0 This new version of echoalia is such a step above the past when he would burst into the bathroom and spew lines from the Little Einsteins cartoon before barreling away.\u00a0 That used to be his way of conversing with me.\u00a0 Not anymore. Beyond the echoalia and scripted speech we are starting to have little conversations with the Roc.\u00a0 This is HUGE.\u00a0 I waited a long time to hear \u201cMommy\u201d and it now seems to be his favorite word.\u00a0 I waited for yes/no questions to be answered and cheered when he finally got it.\u00a0 I patiently waited for the pronoun reversal to right itself, and now I cannot even remember when it happened, sometime in the last 6 months I\u2019m sure.\u00a0 Lately I\u2019ve been itching to converse with the Roc, for him to say something other than yes, no, or good when I ask him a question, for him to  talk  to me, really talk to me.\u00a0 And now it\u2019s starting.\u00a0 We are having little conversations and I am learning so much more about him as his ability to express himself grows.\u00a0 I was thrilled with the following exchange last Friday as we sat at the table eating dinner, just the two of us. me:  \u201cTomorrow is the weekend Roc.\u201d the Roc:\u00a0  \u201cI already went to school today.\u201d me:\u00a0  \u201cYup, no school tomorrow.\u00a0 Tomorrow is Saturday.\u00a0 The weekend.\u00a0 No school on the weekends right buddy?\u201d the Roc:\u00a0  \u201cI did a picture that looks like a friend.\u201d me:\u00a0  \u201cOh?\u00a0 at school?\u201d the Roc totally looking me in the face and seeing my confusion:\u00a0  \u201cMommy doesn\u2019t understand what I am saying.\u201d me silently gasping at this announcement:\u00a0  \u201cI don\u2019t.\u00a0 Can you explain it again?\u201d the Roc:  \u201cYes.\u00a0 I did a picture that looks like a friend at school.\u201d me:\u00a0  \u201cOh!\u00a0 Did you draw or color a picture that looks like a friend at school?\u201d the Roc:\u00a0  \u201cYes, and I was supposed to cut on the red line but I cut right through her.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do a good job.\u00a0 I knew better than that.\u201d me:\u00a0  \u201cOops.\u201d the Roc:\u00a0  \u201cI just got two at once!\u00a0 Look Mommy!\u201d   (two pastas on his fork at once.) me:\u00a0  \u201cVery good.\u201d the Roc:\u00a0  \u201cI can try again next time I go to school.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do a good job.\u201d me:\u00a0  \u201cThat\u2019s right, you can try again.\u00a0 Your teacher says you\u2019ve been doing good in school though!\u201d the Roc:\u00a0  \u201cI ate it all!!\u201d  (completely cleaned out his plate of pasta) me:\u00a0  \u201cDo you want more?\u201d the Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMrs. Mommy, can you get me more?\u201d me:\u00a0  \u201cOf course!\u201d  I got up to get him more pasta and he jumped around the kitchen describing what I was doing. It was a simple, quick conversation and he was easily distracted but I was floored that he spontaneously offered up some information about his day \u2013 he wanted to share something with me, and that he read my facial expression/tone of voice to know that I didn\u2019t know what he was talking about!\u00a0 Lately I\u2019ve watched him struggle with finding the words in his brain to describe what he is trying to tell me.\u00a0 I can see the wheels turning in there and see the frustration this causes him.\u00a0 It has made me realize that he has known and understood much more than I gave him credit for. I\u2019ve waited so long and I won\u2019t take for granted the effort it took to get here or how many people I know who would give anything, anything to have a simple, quick conversation like I had with my son.

{"date": "December 3, 2009", "body": "We did something on Saturday that I thought might put the Roc over the edge and cause GC and I to question our parenting skills as well as our sanity.\u00a0 We took the Roc to a New Jersey Devils hockey game\u2026 Professional hockey.\u00a0 A Saturday home game that was sure to be crazy.\u00a0 New Jersey Devils vs. New York Islanders. An event packed with people, both little and big, talking, laughing, shouting, and cheering.\u00a0 At the same time.\u00a0 A place buzzing with energy, lights, noise, and action.\u00a0 A sensory smorgasbord if you will.\u00a0 Hell on Earth for some.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t know how it would go.\u00a0 We were prepared to leave early if need be, but hoped against hope that we would be able to stay for the whole game (those tickets were expensive!)\u00a0 The Roc has watched hockey on TV with us (though never sat through the whole thing) and expressed interest in attending a game.\u00a0 We talked about where we would be sitting (14 rows of the ice!), that there would be MANY people there, lots of lights and that it would be very noisy.\u00a0 We bought noise canceling headphones for him to wear during the game if it was too overwhelming. Not knowing if those preparations really sunk in with the Roc we left on Saturday morning to catch the train in Princeton.\u00a0 The train was packed, standing room only and as we walked through 2 cars I started to worry.\u00a0 The Roc was not going to enjoy standing for 45 minutes on a bumpy train.\u00a0 Lucky for him a young woman scooted over and allowed him to sit with her.\u00a0 We thanked her profusely (in that same car a group of blond decked out women with extra seats didn\u2019t offer him a seat!\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until a man with his heavily pregnant wife (who was carrying a toddler!) asked if they would move over did they squeeze out a fake smile and allow her to sit down!\u00a0 She stood in the aisle by them for TWO stops before her husband asked!\u00a0 What is WRONG with people?)\u00a0 I stared at them while the Roc sat quietly for the rest of the ride.\u00a0 (I gave him a lollipop\u2013it keeps him quiet.) There was quite a crowd when we arrived at the Newark station and GC plopped the Roc on his shoulders for the couple block walk to the Prudential Center (also known as \u201cThe Rock\u201d).\u00a0 He is much happier up there where he can see instead of being stuck on the ground watching adult legs scissor about.\u00a0 We had to wait in a long line to get into the stadium and we could see people being patted down and searched.\u00a0 I started to get a little nervous.\u00a0 The main thing I was worried about (besides a major meltdown during the game) was getting into the stadium with food.\u00a0 The Roc is on a special diet and I knew that none of the overpriced garbage would meet his dietary needs and the website says no outside food.\u00a0 GC had called and emailed \u201cThe Rock\u201d asking if we could bring special food inside and got no reply.\u00a0 He finally emailed the New Jersey Devils organization and someone got back to him right away stating that they make exceptions for those with special circumstances and to ask to for guest services manager if we were to encounter any problems.\u00a0 I stuffed that email as well as documentation stating the Roc\u2019s Autism diagnosis and his IGG bloodwork showing his food sensitivities in my purse which was already packed with a thermos of beef soup, lots of snacks, the headphones, and my camera.\u00a0 I gulped a little and prepared to state my (the Roc\u2019s ) case over the deafening noise of the crowd chanting \u201cLet\u2019s Go Devils!\u201d when I handed my purse over to be searched.\u00a0 She asked me about my Thanksgiving, unzipped and glanced inside my purse before smiling at the Roc and handing it back.\u00a0 Whew! After getting a kids jersey for free (gotta love Family Day) and his ticket scanned the Roc resumed his high perch on GC\u2019s shoulders and we made our way to our seats.\u00a0 The game was just about to start.\u00a0 The Roc looked a bit shell shocked to see the ice, the players, the crowd, the lights, etc. but he quickly settled into his seat and started asking for food.\u00a0 From then on he ate and enjoyed the game.\u00a0 He consumed way too much sugar (more lollipops!) along with his beef soup but he was thoroughly entertained.\u00a0 He loved being able to scream at the top of his lungs along with the crowd but we had to teach him NOT to scream when things were intense and the crowd was quiet(er).\u00a0 He startled the ladies in front of us quite a few times, but they were good about it.\u00a0 (After turning around and seeing how abnormally cute he is.)\u00a0 At one point during the first period I noticed the Roc was wide eyed and edgy looking so I asked him if he wanted to wear his headphones.\u00a0 He wore them for about 10 minutes before taking them off and handing them back to me.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t wear them again during the rest of the game even though I asked if he needed them. He did awesome during the game. No meltdowns.\u00a0 No panic.\u00a0 No overload.\u00a0 No whining.\u00a0 No complaining.\u00a0 No asking to go home. Amazing for him. He made it through the whole game.\u00a0 The whole thing!\u00a0 Three 20 minute periods and two 15 minute intermissions. He was a bit more hyper (sugar!) and it was hard to get him to look at the camera for a photo but we snapped some anyway. GC\u2019s friend Greg attended the game with us.\u00a0 (Attention single ladies!\u00a0 Greg is an Army captain, 1st year medical student, marathon runner, and not married!\u00a0 Quite the catch!) The Roc was shouting \u201cLet\u2019s go Devils\u201d even though the game was over.\u00a0 Note the lollipop. The Roc rode on GC\u2019s shoulders during the walk back to the train station and we were all relieved when a double decker train pulled up.\u00a0 We were all able to sit this time.\u00a0 Lately the Roc loves to go places in the dark so he was thrilled that the sun was going down and he got to ride the train in the dark.\u00a0 This kid cracks me up. The adults were famished by the time we got back to the car so we pushed our luck and stopped at the Thai food restaurant GC and I frequented when we lived in Jersey.\u00a0 I had another thermos of beef soup in the car and the Roc quickly polished that off while we were eating our appetizers.\u00a0 I had to give him yet another lollipop to keep him quiet while I gulped down my Pad Kee Mow (yum) but considering the stimulating day he had and all of the sugar he consumed I was pretty impressed that his behavior didn\u2019t completely crumble to the floor.\u00a0 We knew we were precariously close to the edge but he didn\u2019t fall off. It was a good day. Oh yeah, and the Devils beat the pants of the Islanders. 6 \u2013 1 \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf00161.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf00202.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf00221.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0023.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0024.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0027.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/dscf0022.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2009/12/03/1st-devils-game/", "title": "1st Devils Game"},
{"date": "December 8, 2009", "body": "For many years the Roc rode in the car in complete and utter silence.\u00a0 I, on the other hand, always talked the duration of the ride until we reached our destination.\u00a0 On the way home I was usually silent like him, completely worn out. As time went on and the Roc grew he started talking a bit more in the car.\u00a0 I would ask things like  \u201cBuddy, do you see the police car?!!\u201d  and he would whisper  \u201cYes\u201d  from the back.\u00a0 Not much more than that, but he was looking, observing, and absorbing.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always known more is going on between those ears than could be seen from the outside.\u00a0 The wheels are always turning in there. More time went by and he started to say  \u201cI see a truck!\u201d  or  \u201cI see a flag!\u00a0 I see a flag moving!!!\u201d  and I would get all excited and keep pointing things out, trying to keep the connection flowing.\u00a0 I\u2019ve received many strange looks while sitting at red lights, I guess I\u2019m fairly animated and amusing to other drivers while keeping the Roc entertained.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care, if it gets the Roc talking, I\u2019ll act like a lunatic. As always, the Roc is changing with time.\u00a0 In the past few months a new kind of dialogue has emerged from the backseat. Orders. Instructions. Demands. Directions. And none of it in whispers. \u201cTurn right Mommy, I don\u2019t want to go left.\u201d \u201cMommy, don\u2019t run into those trees.\u201d \u201cWatch out Mommy!\u00a0 Don\u2019t Do THAT!\u201d  (When I happen to push the breaks a little too hard for his liking.) \u201cThe light is green.\u00a0 GOOOOOOO!\u201d \u201cNo!\u00a0 Don\u2019t stop the car.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to get the mail!\u201d \u201cWe made it!\u00a0 Good job Mommy.\u201d  (While going through a green light.) \u201cI want to go on the other road.\u00a0 Take the other road Mommy!\u201d \u201cNo!\u00a0 Don\u2019t stop!\u00a0 Keep going!\u00a0 Move cars!!!\u201d \u201cWe almost crashed.\u00a0 Be more careful Mommy.\u201d  (We were cut off in traffic and I had to slam the brakes to avoid hitting the car in front of us.) \u201cOh no, the light is red.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t make it.\u201d  (light turns green)\u00a0  \u201cGo!\u00a0 Go Mommy!\u00a0 Hurry so we can make the next one!\u00a0 That light is green!\u00a0 AHHHH!\u00a0 It turned red!!!!\u00a0 You will have to turn now so we don\u2019t stop.\u201d  (We were actually turning right at that light.)\u00a0  \u201cThat\u2019s better Mommy.\u00a0 Turn right.\u201d \u201cGo slow so we don\u2019t crash into any animals.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to crash into a deer again.\u201d  (We  almost  hit a deer one night and he is now very worried about it happening again.\u00a0 Rightly so.\u00a0 It was scary.) \u201cGo, go, go!\u201d \n \u201cThe light turned yellow, that means slow down!\u201d  (Yup, and it also means go thru it so you don\u2019t get stuck at a red light listening to your 5 year old scream in the backseat.) \u201cWatch out for that grass!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t crash the car Mommy.\u201d \n \u201cI want to drive in the dark.\u00a0 Make it dark so I can see the lights Mommy.\u201d \n \u201cLet\u2019s Go!\u00a0 Make the car GO!\u00a0 Faster Mommy!\u00a0 Push the pedal!\u201d \u201cThe animals come out at night.\u00a0 Watch out for animals.\u201d \u201cBe more careful Mommy.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to go this way!\u00a0 I want to go THAT way!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t see!\u00a0 That TRUCK is in my way!!!\u00a0 Arrrgggghh!\u00a0 Move truck!\u201d \n \u201cTUUUURRRRRNNNN!\u00a0 Go!\u00a0 Turn NOW!\u00a0 GOOOOOO!!!\u00a0 I\u2019m READY to go!!!\u201d  (While waiting for cars to pass before pulling out into traffic.) \u201cWhoops!\u00a0 We almost crashed.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t good Mommy.\u201d \u201cI want the light to turn GREEEEEEEEN!\u00a0 Make it turn GREEN Mommy!\u00a0 Do it!\u00a0 Do it!\u00a0 Do it!\u201d \n \u201cGo the fast way Mommy!\u00a0 Turn left!\u201d  (We don\u2019t usually take the toll road, which I call \u201cthe fast way\u201d but he likes to go that way.)\u00a0  \u201cWe missed it!\u00a0 Go back!\u201d \u201cWhoa Mommy!\u00a0 Don\u2019t DO that!  \u201cDon\u2019t stop and talk to anyone Mommy.\u00a0 Just go.\u201d  (I\u2019ve been known to roll down my window and talk to neighbors.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t like that.\u00a0 Come to think of it, neither does GC.) And finally today: \u201cWatch out Mommy!\u00a0 Don\u2019t go onto that grass.\u00a0 You will get stuck just like bear gets stuck in his door.\u201d  (From the book  Bear Wants More .\u00a0 Bear gets so fat he can\u2019t fit into his den.) Rereading this it seems that I drive both too slowly and too fast, that I need to pay better attention to my surroundings, and that I narrowly escape crashing my car on a daily basis.\u00a0 Not so.\u00a0 I\u2019m a very good driver.\u00a0 Yes, at one time I was reckless, I drove too fast and I didn\u2019t pay enough attention.\u00a0 That all changed once the Roc entered my world.\u00a0 I am very careful now. I\u2019m a good driver. Really, I am. Just ask\u2026well, the Roc is the only one who rides with me\u2026so maybe you shouldn\u2019t ask him.\u00a0 At least he could tell you that his Mommy will never drive a minivan because according to him those are  \u201cold Mom cars.\u201d Okay, he\u2019s just echoing a phrase that I\u2019ve said.\u00a0 (So sorry minivan drivers.)\u00a0 Much like the  \u201chomework sucks\u201d  phrase GC taught him the other night. Oh well, it\u2019s all good.\u00a0 Good sentence structure.\u00a0 Correct pronoun usage.\u00a0 He\u2019s letting me know what he wants.\u00a0 It shows that he can get thoughts out of his brain at a pretty quick speed.\u00a0 Good language progression all around.\u00a0 I\u2019ll take it. Demands and all. Okay, I\u2019d like a please every once in awhile. And maybe the volume could be turned down a bit. That will come. We\u2019re working on it.

{"date": "January 4, 2010", "body": "We spent a week in South Carolina visiting GC\u2019s parents, his Grammy, and his youngest brother and family.\u00a0 The Roc had already been off school for a week so I was ready to flee the house and the cold and get somewhere we could thaw out.\u00a0 It was a bit warmer (50s) so we got the Roc out on the beach every day, and he loved it. Guinness (who we have begun calling \u201cPupper\u201d) also loved the beach! (Yes\u2026my dog is wearing a coat\u2026He gets cold!\u00a0 He hardly has any fur!) We also went to Brookgreen Gardens to see fountains, birds, and even an alligator! We had lots of fun with the family.\u00a0 Nonna got to read the Roc stories, Grammy enjoyed holding a sleeping Guinness, and the Roc got to play games with his cousin Aiden and GC. The Roc also enjoyed watching baby Anderson.\u00a0 Every time Andrea changed the baby\u2019s diaper the Roc was right there watching and talking the whole time.\u00a0 Not only did he watch the diaper changes, he also watched the baby eating, and helped by saying \u201cOpen Sesame!!!!!!!!\u201d while Auntie Andrea directed the spoon, and the Roc enjoyed tickling Anderson!\u00a0 So cute! We also taught Auntie Andrea how to do \u201cchicken nugget neck\u201d with the Roc. It looks like she\u2019s choking him, but he likes it!\u00a0 He\u2019s super ticklish! (Auntie Andrea is most definitely horrified that this photo is now on the internet.\u00a0 Heehee.) Overall it was a great trip.\u00a0 It was so nice to visit with family, eat yummy food, and celebrate the New Year together.\u00a0 The Roc did have his moments, especially towards the end of the trip, and I had a little breakdown of my own, which seems to happen at least once when we are on \u201cvacation.\u201d\u00a0 Hopefully I\u2019ll get better about that as time goes on, just like the Roc is getting better at traveling.\u00a0 I guess those two probably go hand in hand, but whatever. We\u2019re both learning how to hold ourselves together apparently. (I also learned that I really like Vodka and cranberry juice.\u00a0 Who knew it could help so much in the holding it together department?\u00a0 I guess we\u2019ll be naming our next dog Smirnoff or Grey Goose.)

{"date": "January 7, 2010", "body": "I have wondered for some time how the Roc views me.\u00a0 What does he think \u201cMommy\u201d means?\u00a0 What does it mean to him?\u00a0 I\u2019ve been told many times that he is a \u201cmama\u2019s boy\u201d and it\u2019s true. If you give him the choice between me and anyone else on this planet, 99% of the time he\u2019ll pick me.\u00a0 He follows me through the house, from the kitchen to the bedroom, upstairs, downstairs, to the back door while I take Guinness out to potty, and he even follows me to the bathroom.\u00a0 (I am working diligently to put a stop to that.\u00a0 Now that the Roc has begun to ask questions \u2013 there are certain things I don\u2019t have the desire to explain just yet.\u00a0 This mama deserves a little bit of privacy!)\u00a0 He wants me to play trains or pretend picnic, the same way every time, it is just so hard to get him to deviate from the scripts I made up long ago.\u00a0 There really is no spontaneous imaginative play at our house, unless I am present, prodding and coaxing him along.\u00a0 Recently we\u2019ve started playing board games, and they are definitely breaking the monotony as well as helping to develop some great new skills for the Roc.\u00a0 But it\u2019s exhausting.\u00a0 At the end of a full day with him I am wiped out.\u00a0 Forget about winter break where he was out of school for 16 days\u202616 days of entertaining him. Oy. This mom gig is  hard .\u00a0 Many say it\u2019s the hardest job they\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 And all special-needs moms know that our job is often harder than most.\u00a0 Every mom wears many hats: chef, chauffeur, teacher, maid, homework helper, boo-boo kisser, etc.\u00a0 The special-needs mom wears those hats and even more: occupational therapist, play therapist, speech therapist, physical therapist, researcher, IEP team member, activist, advocate, administrator of special diets and supplements, cheerleader, and the list goes on and on. We do all of this because we love them, we want what is best for them, we try our hardest to do this job right.\u00a0 We wouldn\u2019t trade it for not having them.\u00a0 I know I wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 Most kids do not consider all of their mother\u2019s hard work, and very few say thank you, at least not until they are older and have kids of their own. (Thanks Mom!) And of course, we are not looking for thank yous.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t in the job description and we signed up anyway.\u00a0 But most kids show their love, in their own ways. The Roc\u2019s smile has always been my proof of his love.\u00a0 He may not have cuddled with me, laid his head on my shoulder and snuggled in the way I physically ached for him to, (and sometimes still do, every mother wants to hold her child), but I know he loves me.\u00a0 Now that he is much more verbal more of his love is being exposed, when I least expect it. While we were down south we visited both the state park beach and our favorite beach, Pawleys Island.\u00a0 The Roc likes Pawleys because the beach huge and has an inlet side where there are no loud waves to scare him, and he can get close to the water.\u00a0 He was busy throwing sand into the inlet when I decided to walk across the beach to the ocean side for a breather.\u00a0 These vacations exhaust me and I just needed 5 minutes of space.\u00a0 If the Roc is attached to me at home just imagine what he\u2019s like when we go stay with family.\u00a0 I stated my intentions and started across the beach.\u00a0 Immediately the Roc started screaming.\u00a0 Guttural screaming and screeching.\u00a0 I glanced over my shoulder at his stiff form and kept moving knowing GC could handle it, mama needed some air.\u00a0 I could hear him screaming most of the way until I got down to the water. I stood in front of the waves and stared across the ocean searching for some peace.\u00a0 I cherish the time we spend with family, but it opens me up to things I tend to shove in the background.\u00a0 Differences I know exist, but do not focus on in my home life, become so apparent they choke off my air at times.\u00a0 I flounder with myself as I try to balance disciplining the Roc in front of family and keeping in check all the sensory issues he is dealing with in an unfamiliar house.\u00a0 I struggled with envy again on this trip, and I felt myself splintering apart while watching GC really connect with his nephew\u2026and seeing the Roc watch from the sidelines.\u00a0 All of this swirled through my mind as the wind whipped my hair and the waves crashed at my feet.\u00a0 I looked over my shoulder to see that the Roc had gone back to throwing sand in the water.\u00a0 I took a deep breath and turned to rejoin my family. As we were leaving the beach GC asked me if I knew the Roc had been hysterical when I went down to the ocean.\u00a0 Oh yeah, I knew.\u00a0 Apparently after he had screamed for a bit, all the while GC telling him I would be coming back, he turned his blotchy, tear streaked face up to GC and said: \u201cBut I don\u2019t want Mommy to go away\u2026She\u2019s my best friend.\u201d He may never understand how hard I try, how much work we have done together, but I don\u2019t doubt that he loves me or how he sees me.

We know that we have a seriously big cat.  He has an eating disorder of the overeating kind.  We KNOW that he has a problem, but we just can\u2019t seem to stop him.  A few years ago when we only had two cats we put him on a diet\u2026.it didn\u2019t go so well.  In the middle of the night he would get in my face and MEOW, then bite my nose and pull my hair.  Not fun.  GC would throw him out of the room to which he learned to open the door.  We locked the door.  Most cats stick their paws under the door to jiggle it \u2013 not Basil\u2026he would stand up on his back legs and jiggle the door handle.  GC changed the door knob to the round kind.  He learned to open that.  We locked it.  He would stand up and jiggle the door handle. Not only did he participate in these lovely evening activities, he stalked our little girl cat, tried to steal her food, and tackled/wrestled her all day long. AGGRESSIVE is an understatement.  It didn\u2019t take long before we gave up and went back to the \u201cfeeding trough\u201d That was four years ago.

{"date": "September 26, 2008", "body": "Playgroups are a totally typical thing that most stay-at-home moms participate in.  The kids all play and the moms sit in the kitchen and drink coffee.\u00a0  I did too (though I spent most of my time with the kids trying to get the Roc to play and listening wistfully as the moms talked in the kitchen).\u00a0  After I figured out about the autism and the Roc started preschool we dropped out of the playgroup. \u00a0 It became too painful, like a knife in the chest, every time we would get together.  I finally  SAW  the difference that had always been there. \u00a0 I even had the same experience this summer when some of the \u201cspecial\u201d kids from preschool were all together and the Roc couldn\u2019t handle it. After a bunch of these knife-in-the-chest moments I realized I would feel much better if I  DID  something (beside pulling the knife out and dropping out of play dates). \u00a0  I approached my awesome neighbor/friend Tracy and asked if I could borrow her adorable son Luke one morning a week for some playtime with the Roc. \u00a0 Lucky for me she agreed (it might have to do with the fact that she has 3 children aged 3 and under!).  So on Friday mornings the Roc and I go over and get Luke and bring him back to our house. \u00a0 We play and have fun, but most importantly we work on those vital but elusive (for ASD kids) social skills.\u00a0  This is our third week and it\u2019s been going GREAT! Luke is totally comfortable at our house and the Roc really looks forward to seeing his friend. \u00a0 Right now I\u2019m letting the kids take the lead (mainly Luke) and we play whatever they want to play.\u00a0 I help the Roc work on his play skills and he learns some new things by imitating Luke. \u00a0 (and I get to play too! How fun is that!) Today we played with a bowling game (Luke\u2019s go to game when he gets to our house \u2013 a definite x-mas idea for that kid!), Elefun, little people, puzzles, and finger paints (fun!). The most fun (and fun for me to watch) was when they played in this together: \n I added a few balls and it became a ball pit and they had a blast!  (I know it\u2019s a pitiful ball pit- we need more balls!)  They jumped around, in and out, and then Luke pretended to be asleep and the Roc would wake him up and they would scream and start it all over.  (very much like a game he played with his cousins in South Carolina this summer) Next week I\u2019ll take pictures of what happens when we drop Luke off at his house:  the Roc, Luke, and Luke\u2019s little brother Daniel (22 months)  WRESTLE!!  and I\u2019m not joking!  If you would have told me a year ago that my child who didn\u2019t like to be touched would be  WRESTLING  and  CHASING  two boys around\u2013I would not have believed you.

{"date": "January 8, 2009", "body": "I wrote a few weeks ago that the Roc has been having a tough time at school lately.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t sitting where he was supposed to during group time, was resisting hand over hand assistance, and has been having trouble with transitions, especially during arrival.\u00a0 He was getting very frustrated and was very LOUD about it.\u00a0 So for the past few weeks I\u2019ve been scratching my head wondering what the heck is going on with him, if it\u2019s a phase, something he was eating/not eating, a developmental thing, a reaction to being treated for a virus, etc.\u00a0 I\u2019ve poured over his food logs and tried to talk to him about being \u201cgood\u201d in school.\u00a0 They\u2019ve given him a new location to put his coat during arrival and he has his own picture schedule so he knows what to do.\u00a0 Yesterday we had a breakthrough and may have figured out a trigger and why he\u2019s been having a tough time lately. Yesterday, as he was getting ready to go to the bus stop he looked at me and said \u201cdon\u2019t like the crying at school\u201d and I asked him if he was crying at school and he said \u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0 He told me someone else was crying but couldn\u2019t explain further than that.\u00a0 Later I got an email from his teacher saying that he had a better day and that he was FINALLY able to tell them something that was bothering him at school.\u00a0 Apparently, there is a student in the preschool class next door who screams very loudly, sometimes all day, and it is loud even in the Roc\u2019s classroom.\u00a0 Yesterday during group time it was quiet and then suddenly this boy started screaming and the Roc said \u201cIt is screaming!\u00a0 It is very loud!\u201d\u00a0 His awesome preschool teacher asked him if it bothered him and he said \u201cYes.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like it when that boy screams.\u201d\u00a0 They went on from there and had a little discussion about how that boy wasn\u2019t hurt or in trouble but that he was having a hard time at school.\u00a0 The Roc asked to sit by a little girl to help him feel better and his awesome preschool teacher allowed him to move and really praised him for USING HIS WORDS!\u00a0 The screaming lasted just about all day yesterday so they had more opportunities to talk about it with the Roc.\u00a0 They tried to put something under the door to minimize the noise but it didn\u2019t help much.\u00a0 The screaming next door started a little after thanksgiving break, which is when they started to have problems with the Roc.\u00a0 One trigger found! I\u2019m just so glad that he was able to verbalize what was bothering him!!\u00a0 It explains so much about why he was moving around during group time \u2013 they sit on the floor on the side of the room that connects to the other preschool class \u2013 where the screaming is taking place.\u00a0 I know that he talks more at home than at school and this shows that he\u2019s starting to communicate to the teachers better!\u00a0 Exciting stuff. The other thing that has been happening these past few weeks is that he\u2019s been referring to his teacher as the \u201cbig hand teacher\u201d and when she tries to help him he says things like \u201coh no, the big hands are touching me!!\u201d and when he gets angry/upset he squeezes her hands really hard.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know where this came from and he isn\u2019t able to explain why he\u2019s calling her the \u201cbig hand teacher.\u201d\u00a0 She has been explaining to him that when he needs help she has to use her hands to help him.\u00a0 On Tuesday she gave him a choice of whether he wanted to have his hands under or on top of hers and he chose on top.\u00a0 Yesterday when he needed help again she told him she would have to use her hands to help him and he very gently (without saying anything) placed his hands on top of hers.\u00a0 Awesome!\u00a0 He also told the para as she was walking him out to the bus \u201cthe big hands were cold today.\u201d\u00a0 I can\u2019t explain it and I don\u2019t know what to tell the \u201cbig hand\u201d teacher since he doesn\u2019t say anything about it at home, but it does makes me laugh and his awesome preschool teacher thinks it\u2019s amusing as well. I just love his awesome preschool teacher.\u00a0 She emails me when she has concerns, and sometimes just to share a funny story about something he did that day.\u00a0 She always emails me back right away when I have concerns/questions of my own and she even calls to talk about the Roc.\u00a0 She also said this at the end of her last email to me: \u201cI do want you to know that even though all this is very difficult- for all of us- I am enjoying every minute of it.\u00a0 He is so funny, unique, complex, observant, smart, and just very enjoyable.\u00a0 I love how he teaches me everyday how to \u201cspeak his language.\u201d\u00a0 So, please don\u2019t ever think that I am complaining about things that he says or does to me or about me.\u00a0 That is just who he is.\u201d It\u2019s so nice to have someone other than his Mommy and Daddy see and describe him that way!

{"date": "January 26, 2009", "body": "I love Mondays.\u00a0 Back to routine and I get my much needed break in the afternoon.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s my favorite day of the week! We\u2019ve had a lot going on the past couple weeks and I feel like I\u2019ve been going up and down on a see-saw.\u00a0 The Roc\u2019s been up at the Children\u2019s hospital a couple times for various doctor appointments, I\u2019ve started the process of trying to figure out if he should go on to kindergarten this fall (I oscillate between the two choices and drive myself crazy), I\u2019ve been researching the two areas we are considering moving to, we\u2019ve been trying to adjust the Roc\u2019s diet to make him \u201cgo\u201d regularly, and I\u2019ve been reading some autism books (ya know, in my spare time).\u00a0 Which brings me to my 3 things: 1.\u00a0 I recently finished reading Karen DeFelice\u2019s book titled \u201cEnzymes for Autism\u201d and started adding enzymes to the Roc\u2019s diet this weekend.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known for awhile that he probably needed enzymes because I would find things in his diaper that he should have been able to easily digest (gross I know, sorry!).\u00a0 According to her book, many people have had success using enzymes to break down foods and facilitate gut healing and health.\u00a0 Some people were even able to add problematic foods back into their diets without side effects or regression.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious to see if this treatment will help the Roc and some of his gut issues.\u00a0 It would also be nice if he could eventually eat some of the things that have been taken out of his diet. 2. Shrimp, scallops, and green peppers.\u00a0 Oh my!\u00a0 The Roc ate all three of those food items yesterday, FOR THE FIRST TIME!\u00a0 The Roc has always shunned shrimp.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t try it.\u00a0 No way.\u00a0 Don\u2019t even think about putting some on his plate or even near him on the table! I don\u2019t know what changed but yesterday GC made fisherman\u2019s rice (yum!) for lunch and the Roc didn\u2019t just try it, he gobbled it up!\u00a0 He kept asking for more shrimp and scallops.\u00a0 We ate the leftovers for lunch today and I ended up giving him all my shrimp.\u00a0 He loves it!\u00a0 I wonder how long this will last? 3. Stranger Anxiety.\u00a0 For a long time now the Roc has had stranger anxiety.\u00a0 I actually think it\u2019s an aversion to touch or the fear of being touched, but while we are out in public it must appear to other people as a \u201cstranger issue.\u201d\u00a0 Usually when we are out running errands the Roc will continually look over his shoulder and if anyone, ANYONE, is following us he gets very agitated and yells \u201cthere\u2019s a people right there!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cwant them to go away!\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s lovely. Now I know that I\u2019m premature about commenting on his behavior the last two days, but I can\u2019t help it.\u00a0 Both yesterday and today we ran a bunch of errands, in and out of 3 separate stores both days, and not once did the Roc emit his usual response to other people being near us.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t even look over his shoulder.\u00a0 It was wonderful to be able to walk through a store holding his hand, and just walk.

Last night GC and I stood at the sink, with our backs to the Roc, shaking with silent giggles because he sounded so funny, so  typical  as he whined about eating his dinner.\u00a0 And then he uttered the phrase that has now become a part of our dinner routine: \u201cI wanna make a deal!\u201d I\u2019ve already stated that I don\u2019t like ultimatums, but I also do not like whining, and by the end of most days I\u2019ve had enough whine to kill a rhino.\u00a0 So lately, to save my sanity, I\u2019ve been \u2018making deals\u2019 with the Roc to get him to eat.\u00a0 It usually starts at the beginning of the meal, the vegetable.\u00a0 He whines and I remove half of what\u2019s on his plate and say:\u00a0  \u201cOkay Roc, I\u2019ll make a deal with you.\u00a0 You eat this half and I\u2019ll get rid of the other half, okay?\u201d  and he eats it!\u00a0 It\u2019s working for now, except that he\u2019s starting to say  \u201cOh, I wanna make a deal\u201d  as he\u2019s walking to the table!!\u00a0 Last night while we made our \u2018deal\u2019 I dropped half of the food back onto his pile before I threw the other half into the disposal, so he\u2019s not really eating half, it\u2019s more like 3/4 of what I originally gave him, and he didn\u2019t even notice. I don\u2019t know how long this wheeling and dealing will work, but it shows his progress in so many ways, and it\u2019s making me laugh!

{"date": "January 29, 2009", "body": "I\u2019ve noticed something interesting in the last year since the Roc has been diagnosed with Autism.\u00a0 Almost all my friendships have all changed.\u00a0 Some for the better and some\u2026not so much.\u00a0 There have been two distinct reactions to the announcement of \u201cmy son has Autism.\u201d The first being either an immediate or a slightly delayed response, as I did tell a lot of friends over email because I was too emotional to say the word out loud, and I usually choked on my own tears and snot so much that it was hard to form a coherent sentence.\u00a0 I had a hard time, and still do, expressing my overwhelming fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, rage, disbelief, all encompassing and ongoing grief at what has happened to my little family.\u00a0 How our dreams have changed, how my fears for my son have changed, how everything going forward has changed.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had quite a few friends who have tried to understand and continue to check up on us. The second reaction is the one I was not expecting.\u00a0 The deafening silence to my announcement surprised and cut me deeply.\u00a0 I\u2019ve thought about it a lot lately as it is happening again when I reconnect with people I knew in another lifetime on Facebook.\u00a0 We chat back and forth a few times and then as soon as I mention the \u201cA\u201d word all communication stops.\u00a0 It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon and since it has happened with people I consider real-life friends I wasn\u2019t really shocked when it happened with those past-life friends.\u00a0 There have been a few of my past-life friends who are just like they were back then, lovely and caring (hats off to you miss Candi!), and I know that we were/are friends for a reason. My best guess is that most people are just at a total loss for words about what to say in the face of this kind of pain, and many people carry their own heartaches and sorrows.\u00a0 They cannot offer me a solution, relieve my suffering, so they pretend it\u2019s not there.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gotten together with friends I haven\u2019t seen for a long time and they finally ask about my son as I\u2019m gathering my purse and coat to leave, or if we\u2019re on the phone they ask right after they\u2019ve told me they have to go soon, like he is an afterthought.\u00a0 I\u2019ve even have a friend talk to me as if I don\u2019t have a child of my own and make no move to connect with him. He is real!\u00a0 Please don\u2019t ignore him!\u00a0 He is himself and a delightful child!\u00a0 I  AM  a mommy, just like you!\u00a0 Our paths are different and the same! If I sound mad, I\u2019m not.\u00a0 Oops, that\u2019s a lie.\u00a0 Being spoken too like I didn\u2019t ever have a baby of my own and watch other people physically ignore my son DID piss me off.\u00a0 But I understand the fear of saying the wrong thing or not knowing what to do around a child like mine.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been there.\u00a0 I\u2019ve stumbled around with words or sat with my fingers paralyzed over the keyboard.\u00a0 I\u2019m not the most wonderful friend in the world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve ignored, taken too long to respond to email, haven\u2019t used my calling card enough, taken for granted, forgotten birthdays, missed important celebrations.\u00a0 I know this and I\u2019m sorry. I guess the point of this post is one, to get this off my chest because I have too much other stuff I\u2019m carrying and I really need to lighten the load.\u00a0 Second, I\u2019ve learned some important lessons about friendship in the last year and I am trying to get better.\u00a0 We all need friends and I need mine desperately.\u00a0 Thanks for your emails and your phone calls.\u00a0 Thanks for letting me spill my guts, complain about how hard this is, agonize over things that might seem little to you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll never forget the kindness. If you\u2019ve been silent, I understand and I\u2019m still here.\u00a0 I don\u2019t hold a grudge.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been there too.\u00a0 Maybe we will find our way back to each other one day.

How did I manage to surround myself with Republicans?!\u00a0 Yikes!!

{"date": "November 25, 2008", "body": "We had the Roc\u2019s fall conference, 4-year eval, and IEP meeting yesterday and my head is still buzzing with all the information we were given.\u00a0 Some of it disheartening, some of it good, and many things I already knew to be true about the Roc. His awesome preschool teacher let me know he\u2019s doing well transitioning to the afternoon class and is working on being more independent.\u00a0 He still has trouble asking for help and needs prompting to work on and finish things he doesn\u2019t like to do and/or are hard for him.\u00a0 Fine motor and expressive language tasks are especially difficult for the Roc.\u00a0 He is showing a lot more interest in other children this year and has continued to make eye contact and smile a lot when other children interact with him.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t yet respond other than to repeat what they are saying or do a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on what they are doing.\u00a0 They are working a lot on teaching him how to interject himself and respond appropriately.\u00a0 Progress is always good. The school psychologist broke my heart a little when she went over the IQ testing she did on the Roc.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t score very well.\u00a0 He was in the average category for one part and the others were in the low category pulling his total score down.\u00a0 So hard to hear.\u00a0 But at the same time I wonder how in the world can you test the IQ of a 4 year old?\u00a0\u00a0 Especially a child like mine who will not \u201cperform\u201d if he doesn\u2019t want too and will choose not to answer and participate.\u00a0 AND has such a hard time with expressive language.\u00a0 So, while disheartening to hear, that label doesn\u2019t jive with me. Especially when we went over the school speech eval that scored him at the very bottom of the normal (gosh, I hate that word!) range.\u00a0 I knew that was possible because I watched him during a speech eval at the children\u2019s hospital in the spring.\u00a0 He immediately liked the therapist and totally performed for her (and was a charming flirt!), thus scoring at the bottom of normal (which prompted our insurance to deny extra services, argh!).\u00a0 So, apparently he really likes his school speech therapist and again \u201cperformed\u201d for her.\u00a0 Luckily, she was able to show that pragmatically he does need help so they will continue speech services.\u00a0 The blood drained out of my face when she first showed me the score and said that by the number he didn\u2019t qualify! He almost didn\u2019t qualify for OT services too!\u00a0 Which is totally crazy.\u00a0 The evaluation only has two questions about grasping technique.\u00a0 So again he scored just below normal range.\u00a0 Um, Hello?!! The kid definitely needs fine motor help and luckily they will be continuing that service as well.\u00a0 He is also going to be evaluated for some additional PT services. We signed off on paper work for him to be evaluated by the district\u2019s \u201cautism team\u201d and if he meets their criteria then he will have an educational diagnosis of autism (to go along with his medical one-I still don\u2019t understand how that isn\u2019t good enough for them).\u00a0 Right now the school has labeled him as developmentally delayed which will last until he turns 5 in the summer.\u00a0 I can\u2019t see how they won\u2019t find him to have an educational diagnosis of autism but stranger things have happened. I\u2019m going to be observing the 2 different types of inclusion kindergarten\u2019s in our district this winter and we will decide placement for him in the spring.\u00a0 I\u2019m still VERY worried about the Roc starting kindergarten so soon after he turns 5.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious to observe the classrooms and maybe that will put my mind more at ease.\u00a0 I just wish his awesome preschool teacher could move on with him and be his kindergarten teacher! So, it was a looooonnnggg 2.5 hour meeting and we left feeling a bit flat.\u00a0 Definitely not the kind of conference I envisioned four years ago while I cuddled my infant.\u00a0 At the same time I know how lucky we are.\u00a0 As GC\u2019s Aunt Sandy stated in an email to me \u201cThe Roc is a gift.\u201d\u00a0 I agree.\u00a0 We are lucky.

I mentioned that my head is full of other people\u2019s words so I have to share this beautifully written post by asdmommy.\u00a0 I have a link to her blog (What We Need) on the sidebar, check her out.\u00a0 I read it for the first time the other night and it definitely sums up the way this Mommy feels.\u00a0 Thank you Darcy for letting me share it on my blog.\u00a0 Here ya go: The Other Mother She watches mothers, constantly, and is fascinated by their sheer volume.\u00a0 She wonders if she will ever take up that much space again?\u00a0 She feels smaller than she used to, less a presence in the outside world, but more a presence in her own home.\u00a0 She feels dependent; on schedules, routines, the refrigerator, her child\u2019s mood.\u00a0 She feels depended on for sheer life.\u00a0 She wonders what would happen if she were no longer here, and she worries about it.\u00a0 She knows kids can survive without mothers, but what about these kids?\u00a0 What about her kid?\u00a0 She wants to download all the information about her child from her brain to something else \u2013 just in case. She watches mothers, on the playground, at the grocery store, and at school, wondering if they are even aware of mothers like her.\u00a0 What must their lives be like?\u00a0 She pictures their households, and pictures an easy life.\u00a0 Not easy as in simple, but easy as in normal.\u00a0 Are those mothers blissfully unaware of mothers like her?\u00a0 She reminds herself not to judge her insides by someone else\u2019s outsides (she read that somewhere), but she can\u2019t help but wonder what that normalcy must be like.\u00a0 Not normal in terms of her child being not normal, but normal in terms of just being a typical, average family.\u00a0 She gets lost sometimes in the added layers of complication of their lives; the trying to find the afterschool activity that promises the largest chance of success for her child, the hope of her child finding a playmate that might become a real friend. She watches mothers, and she reminds herself she wouldn\u2019t change one thing about her child (he is perfect) save the chance to make things easier for him.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t want him to learn the tough lessons, but rather that she wishes he didn\u2019t have to learn so many of them.\u00a0 Where\u2019s the equity?\u00a0 Why do these kids, already challenged, have to be challenged so much more?\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes her cry. She watches mothers, with a feeling she can\u2019t quite describe building in her heart.\u00a0 It\u2019s not envy, judgment, anger, self-pity or sadness.\u00a0 It\u2019s distance.\u00a0 She feels on the fringe.\u00a0 She feels like her son.

How cute it that!!\u00a0 He came up with that totally on his own! The second cool thing happened when I told the Roc it was time to get ready for school.\u00a0 He went to the bathroom, opened the door, turned on the light (he seems to be getting better about the dark), opened the lids, peed, flushed, closed the lids and then came out and pulled up his pants! He needed a little help adjusting the pants but he did all that on his own without prompts!! Yay!!\u00a0 I think using a schedule has really helped him. His awesome preschool teacher made this up with a bunch of pictures I requested.\u00a0 Just another reason she\u2019s awesome! (and no, she has never read this blog!)

{"date": "November 28, 2008", "body": "I woke up this morning listening to the Roc talking through the baby monitor.\u00a0 He still doesn\u2019t come out of his room on his own in the morning.\u00a0 Our master bedroom is on the first floor and his room is on the second so I still use a baby monitor to know when he is awake and sometimes at night just so I know he is still breathing.\u00a0 Yup, I am  that  kind of Mom.\u00a0 I readily admit to the need to check him every night just before I go to bed.\u00a0 But it\u2019s more than just knowing that he is still alive, it\u2019s my chance to see him quiet and peaceful, to kiss him without bothering him, and sometimes to gaze upon him with an apology for not being the best Mommy I could have on that particular day but with the promise that I will do better tomorrow. So, when I went into his room this morning I told him that today is Thursday and it\u2019s also Thanksgiving \u2013 to which he immediately replied \u201cYou get to go to school today!!\u201d (pesky pronoun reversal).\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 Sorry buddy.\u00a0 Next week we will get back to our regular routine (and we\u2019ll all feel much better, except GC who will have to go back to work).\u00a0 The Roc doesn\u2019t understand gratitude yet, but I do and on this Thanksgiving I have so much to be thankful for: I am thankful for our family.\u00a0 Even though we are far away from everyone again this year we are thinking of them and we know they are thinking of us. I am thankful for our friends.\u00a0 Not everyone understands what we are going through but they let me know they care. I am thankful that my sister (hi sis!) prodded me to start this blog and through it I\u2019ve come across other Mommies who feel just like I do.\u00a0 It really helps with the \u201cI\u2019m all alone in this\u201d feeling that sometimes completely overwhelms me. I am so thankful for the Roc\u2019s big grins and giggles.\u00a0 I\u2019m especially grateful today that the Roc woke up happy.\u00a0 It can be very telling when he wakes up in a bad mood.\u00a0 It can sometimes set the tone for his whole day. I am ever so thankful to have a husband that cooks and is willing to deal with the bird!\u00a0 Ewwww! I am thankful the sun was shinning today and the Roc and I got to go to the playground (a little bundled up). I am thankful for the three little girls at the playground who talked to the Roc and included him in their game of \u201chide & go seek\u201d even though he didn\u2019t really understand the game. I am thankful that the Roc tried a new food tonight for the first time.\u00a0 It\u2019s no small feat when a kid like mine tries something new for the first time.\u00a0 (We did promise him some of his special ice cream as a reward.) I am thankful for the little rituals that bring the Roc joy, like my running and jumping on his bed every night before we read stories.\u00a0 The squeal he lets out as I come running is ear piercing and adorable all at the same time. I am thankful for the spontaneous original speech that slides out when I least expect it.\u00a0 For example, he was putting on his underwear and told me \u201cI can do it all by myself.\u201d\u00a0 Floored me! I am also thankful for the progress in play skills I see everyday.\u00a0 Before I read to him he had to act out a little scene with his Bobby the Bobcat and a dinosaur stuffed animals. Most of all, I am just so very thankful that the Roc is mine.\u00a0 I look back on my pregnancy filled with worry and a 3 month bed rest and remember that I prayed to who ever might be in charge to let me keep  this  baby, I wanted  this  baby, and I would be the best mother I could be to  this  baby. I pleaded again when he was in the NICU. And it\u2019s something I remind myself on our very bad days. The Roc is now sound asleep and I\u2019m off to have some pie! Thanks to Nonna for the recipe!

{"date": "March 14, 2009", "body": "Things got quieter at our house the last few days.\u00a0 Tuesday was the worst day of the screaming.\u00a0 The Roc went to time out over and over and over and maybe it sunk in.\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 Or was it the fact that I realized his diet was a bit wacky this week and that I switched up his enzyme and added some pro-biotic?\u00a0 Or the fact that by the end of the week he had a cold?\u00a0 All of those things?\u00a0 This week has been up and down (mostly down) for the Roc. I do know that I want to get to the root of the screaming because I believe that every behavior happens for a reason.\u00a0 At this time the Roc does not have the ability to explain himself and we are reading lots of books about feelings.\u00a0 I know that he cannot communicate what he is feeling and I think the resulting behavior has a lot to do with that.\u00a0 I went back over the Roc\u2019s food log to see what has been happening this last week and I realized that in my zest for better health for the Roc I changed a lot of little things at once, and all those changes could have affected his behavior. The Roc has been corn-free for months and has been begging for corn at dinner-time and also for a cereal with corn in it.\u00a0 On Monday after school I gave in and let him have the cereal made with corn and he also had some corn with dinner.\u00a0 The result of ingesting all that corn could have produced all the screaming on Tuesday.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure because I also changed some other things in his diet this week.\u00a0 Pretty stupid of me. I few weeks ago I started the Roc on some enzymes to help him properly digest his food and try to get him to \u201cgo\u201d more.\u00a0 It has really seemed to help and as the next step in his \u201cenzyme therapy\u201d I decided to switch out two bottles of enzymes for one all-around enzyme formula.\u00a0 Well, without realizing it, I picked the most potent formula that has pro-biotics added to the mix.\u00a0 The Roc has never had any pro-biotics and his behavior this week definitely could have resulted from a die-off reaction.\u00a0 He is frequently constipated and most likely has an overgrowth of bad bacteria in his gut.\u00a0 The probiotics in the enzyme cause the bad bacteria to die off and when they die-off they release toxins that the body then has to clear out.\u00a0 Not fun for the Roc. I had a feeling this enzyme might be doing something to him so I ramped down the dosage with each meal.\u00a0 I should have stopped there and waited to see if he would even himself out, but I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 Again, pretty stupid of me.\u00a0 I decided to give him a little bit of the pro-biotics I\u2019ve had in the fridge because I knew he just had to have an over growth of bad stuff growing in his gut.\u00a0 At this point I still hadn\u2019t realized that the new enzyme HAS pro-biotic in it.\u00a0 Duh! So, on Thursday I gave him a 1/4 tsp of the pro-biotic at the end of his lunch.\u00a0 And he cried the whole day at school, completely abnormal. But, to throw another curve into the mix, the Roc came home on Thursday with a runny nose and a cough.\u00a0 He had an asthma attack that night and now has a cold.\u00a0 So his behavior this week could also have been him getting sick.\u00a0 It could have been all those things combined.\u00a0 Argh! I pulled everything out his diet yesterday and he had a good day at home and at school.\u00a0 I\u2019m going back to the store to replenish the original two bottles of enzymes and am going to start over.\u00a0 I think I may wait until spring break to try the pro-biotic in case he has another die-off reaction. This week was exhausting and after talking to some of my other friends with special kids it seems that crazy behavior is not just happening in our house.\u00a0 Is it the time-change, the change of seasons and our crazy up and down weather lately, or did the full moon this week have any affect?\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 I do know that by the end of the week I was wondering if mommies of typical kids know just how lucky they are?\u00a0 Do they think about all the things they feed their children?\u00a0 Do they worry about intestinal permeability and phenols?\u00a0 Magnesium levels?\u00a0 Do they realize what it would be like to log their child\u2019s food intake, bowel movements and resulting behaviors?\u00a0 Do they worry about CORN?!\u00a0 Do they rush to their children with a nebulizer when they can\u2019t breathe and then spend the rest of the night \u201csleeping\u201d with them to make sure they keep breathing through the night? Do they cringe when they read about their child\u2019s behavior in teacher emails?\u00a0 Do they prepare to fight for OT, ST, PT? I don\u2019t think they do, and I don\u2019t blame them because I know that I didn\u2019t, until the tables were turned.\u00a0 Some days I just really wish that I could go back to that ignorance.

{"date": "April 15, 2009", "body": "Last night the Roc and I got to the riding center a few minutes early and I got to talking to the mom whose son rides before mine.\u00a0 One thing led to another (very quickly) and we started talking about our son\u2019s diagnosis.\u00a0 Turns out her 14 year old son is also on the spectrum. \u00a0 She went on to tell me that at 7.5 years old he was non verbal and now at 14 he has Aspergers.\u00a0 The love and pride in her eyes while she talked about her boy warmed my insides.\u00a0 We went on to talk about the work and the struggles these kids face and how being their moms has changed everything in a way that only we can understand.\u00a0 She put her hand on my arm before she left and said I had an amazing little boy who is well on his way.\u00a0 I felt lighter after talking with her for only 5 minutes and as she and her son left the barn I tucked a nugget of hope up under my ribs, right next to my heart. When the Roc was done riding his instructor said it was his best lesson in a couple months.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t fight her, he listened, he was focused, and he followed directions.\u00a0 He did his best.\u00a0 That nugget of hope got a little bigger and I carried it home. Today while uploading pictures from the camera onto the computer I came across this photograph and had to stop and stare. It\u2019s not perfect and it doesn\u2019t show off his big grin and cute dimples, but I see so much in this one photo of my beautiful son. I\u2019m so proud to be his mommy.

{"date": "April 14, 2009", "body": "We are a few days into the Roc\u2019s \u201cspring break\u201d and I\u2019m already looking forward to next week when school starts again!\u00a0 I\u2019m terrible.\u00a0 I know.\u00a0 I can\u2019t help it.\u00a0 It\u2019s just so hard to spend all my time entertaining the Roc.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t play on his own and by the end of the day I\u2019m really done playing.\u00a0 The only time I can sneak away is when I put him in front of the TV and then I feel guilty. He was off last Friday and by the afternoon I was knocking on my neighbors door asking if she wanted to join me for dinner and a margarita at the Mexican place across the street when my husband got home from work.\u00a0 She did and I had two margaritas.\u00a0 Now after two more days with the Roc I\u2019m about to ask my other friend if she wants to come down and have dinner and margarita with me.\u00a0 What kind of mother needs to drink to get through spring break? Someone please tell me I\u2019m not the only one! Besides sneaking out at night for margaritas I have been trying to keep the Roc busy.\u00a0 We got a \u201cbouncy house\u201d on sale and the Roc has been jumping when the weather has allowed. We dyed eggs for Easter. And the Easter Bunny brought the Roc a present instead of candy.\u00a0 (yes, that is Christmas wrapping paper\u2026pretty lame Easter Bunny!) Yesterday it was sunny so we spent the whole afternoon outside and I  forced  taught the Roc to pedal his tricycle.\u00a0 Back in October he figured out how to steer and it made pushing this so much easier. But I still had to push and remind him to watch where he was going, and lately I\u2019ve been pretty sick of pushing this thing.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to outgrow it soon so I thought it might be a good time to  force  teach him to pedal it on his own.\u00a0 Plus, my sister was just telling me the other day how my nephew rode his trike 3 MILES, and yesterday when we left for the playground we ran into a neighbor whose 2 year old was riding a bike (with training wheels, but still!)\u00a0 I looked down at the Roc and figured now was as good a time as any.\u00a0 Nothing like a little comparison to kick my butt into gear to  force  teach the Roc a new skill. It wasn\u2019t easy.\u00a0 In fact it took us 30 minutes to get past the retention pond we can see from the back door.\u00a0 The Roc was not happy with my decision to  force  teach him to pedal.\u00a0 I was repeating lots of encouraging phrases like: \u201cyou can do it!\u201d\u00a0 \u201ckeep it up!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cgood job!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cleft, right!\u201d\u00a0 \u201clet\u2019s go!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cyou\u2019re a big boy now!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cwow!\u201d The whole time I cheer-leaded he swung his arms, kicked his feet, and SCREAMED!\u00a0 He kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t do it!!!!!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cARGRRRRGUHHHGGGGG!\u201d\u00a0 It was entertaining to say the least, though I don\u2019t know what any of my neighbors thought. I then told him that \u201cI am such a terrible mother\u201d\u00a0 a\u00a0 \u201cmean Mommy making him ride a tricycle like all the other little kids\u201d\u00a0 to which he screamed \u201cNOO, a GOOD MOMMY!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cARRRRGGGGUUUUGHGHH!!\u201d Sounds fun right? We made it to the first playground in just under an hour (it takes about 5 minutes to walk there\u2026I\u2019m serious).\u00a0 I made a big deal about how he was learning to ride and pushed him on the swings for a long time (his favorite).\u00a0 He played on the playground for a while and then I decided we were going to head to the next playground in a neighboring neighborhood.\u00a0 He did a bit better and used his feet, and again it took us a long time to get there, with many stops for screams of \u201cI can\u2019t do IT!\u201d\u00a0 He got to swing there and then played on the playground again.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t too happy when we left and I (gasp!) made him ride the trike back home.\u00a0 He did pedal and he did scream and throw a few tantrums and it did take us almost an hour to get back but, he did it! I told GC about our day when he got home and during dinner GC asked the Roc if he learned to pedal his trike and the Roc\u2019s face split into the biggest grin when he said \u201cYES!\u201d\u00a0 So cute.\u00a0 I asked him if he wanted to show Daddy on the sidewalk and he again very enthusiastically said \u201cYES!\u201d\u00a0 I should have brought my camera outside because he was so proud of himself when he pedaled away (very slowly) down the sidewalk.\u00a0 He kept looking back over his shoulder with a big smile to see if we were watching.\u00a0 So I guess my sunburn, the tantrums, the screaming, and the snail walking yesterday were worth it. It\u2019s raining today and the Roc\u2019s watching TV while I type this.\u00a0 He\u2019s already been in time out a few times and had to go up to his room once.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have any plans for today and it\u2019s only 10 am.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to be a lonnnggg day and I might just have to break out the blender and make myself a margarita  for  with lunch. As GC left for work I jokingly asked him while the Roc was screaming in time-out: \u201cdon\u2019t you wish you were me?\u201d His reply:\u00a0 \u201cNope, not at all\u201d and he walked out the door. Only 146 hours until the bus comes next Monday\u2026.

{"date": "April 30, 2009", "body": "The Roc is perfecting the art of the bedtime stall.\u00a0 The following was what happened when I tried to put him to bed on Tuesday night.\u00a0 His nightly routine is to take a bath, brush teeth, get dressed, and then we read stories (3 stories has turned into 5 or 6 a night, I\u2019m a total sucker).\u00a0 This particular night he interrupted me over and over to point out something on the page.\u00a0 We have been reading a set of 4 books on sad, happy, scared, and angry feelings.\u00a0 He would talk over me and point to the bunny\u2019s face, or the little stuffed animal dog the bunny always has, or the sky on the page.\u00a0 When I finally finished the last book I asked him if he had to go potty one last time (this \u201clast potty\u201d has now been added to the nightly routine) he said yes, and this is what followed as he walked out onto the upstairs landing: Roc:\u00a0  \u201cMommy, can I have a glass of water?\u201d Me:\u00a0  \u201cYes, Roc, I\u2019ll go get it, you go potty.\u201d  I start down the stairs.

{"date": "December 15, 2008", "body": "I took the Roc to a birthday party on Saturday.\u00a0 Usually I feel very apprehensive before bringing the Roc to a party.\u00a0 I worry about the amount of new children, the amount of strange adults, the new and different locations, the noise, the general chaos, and how all of that will affect the Roc.\u00a0 I worry that he will break down, meltdown, and cause a scene.\u00a0 I worry that he might \u201cruin\u201d the party for the birthday kid and that the adults may regret inviting him in the first place. Not this time. This party was for my new neighbor\u2019s kids, her 9 year old son with Autism and his 7 year old brother.\u00a0 It was the first party we\u2019ve gone to where I just knew that the birthday momma would \u201cget it\u201d and I wasn\u2019t worried about her being annoyed by the Roc\u2019s behavior and/or regretting inviting him.\u00a0 What a feeling! The party was at the Little Gym and we got there right as it was starting.\u00a0 The kids were lining up to go in the gym so I quickly pulled off the Roc\u2019s socks and shoes and told him to go line up\u2026and he did!\u00a0 He went in with the other kids and followed along sitting down on the mat.\u00a0 Parents were allowed inside so of course I went, camera in hand.\u00a0 The Roc totally enjoyed himself and just surprised the heck out of me.\u00a0 He was usually at the back of the line or the back of the group (less kids to touch him), and most of the time a beat behind because he wasn\u2019t listening to the instructions but was imitating what the other kids were doing (which is awesome in itself!), but I was just so happy that he joined in.\u00a0 When the Roc was much younger we attempted the Little Gym and it proved to be too much for him and I was so glad back then that I didn\u2019t sign up for 10 weeks of class.\u00a0 Now I think it might be a good thing for him, especially in the winter.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t attempt any of the bar activities but got a huge kick out of running and falling on this gigantic wedge.\u00a0 Hello deep pressure! His favorite was the balance beam, again, a surprise to me! He did everything with a smile and seemed so pleased with himself.\u00a0 After the gym activities it was time for pizza and cake.\u00a0 He rain toward the room with the other children yelling \u201cpizza and cake yay!!.\u201d\u00a0 I was a little worried, but he didn\u2019t balk at not getting pizza and happily munched on his GFCF pretzels and then wolfed down the cupcake I brought for him (the cupcake being the reason he didn\u2019t care about the pizza!).\u00a0 After the party we went back to the birthday boy\u2019s house (they live down the street) and the Roc had great fun being chased around by the 7 year old.\u00a0 It was a fun afternoon.

She said he has been having a tough time for the past two weeks, not wanting to sit where he\u2019s supposed to, difficulty with transitions, resisting hand-over-hand assistance, and they\u2019ve been having to use time-outs, picture schedules for arrival and departures, and a special blue chair during carpet time (which he may need during the holiday concert on Friday).\u00a0\u00a0 She asked if there\u2019s been a change in his diet because she knows he\u2019s GFCF and left her phone numbers for me to call.\u00a0 Sigh\u2026 THEN as I was about to call the Roc\u2019s awesome preschool teacher GC called me to tell me about the company meeting he had at 5 pm\u2026on a Monday night\u2026with the CEO down from Massachusetts.\u00a0 Turns out they are closing down the Delaware office and GC has two options 1) keep his job and relocate to Massachusetts or 2) Lose his job come May and possibly get some severance, if he stays in good standing with the company\u2026 Bye-bye pretty bubble.\u00a0 It was nice to see you while you were here.\u00a0 Come again real soon\u2026 So, we have some decisions to make.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know anything about Massachusetts or anyone in Massachusetts.\u00a0 We did always say that we wouldn\u2019t stay here forever but haven\u2019t been able to agree on where to go.\u00a0 So much to think about.\u00a0 So stressful.

-GC interviewed and got a new job!\u00a0 The offer letter came in the mail yesterday.\u00a0 He\u2019s only going to be unemployed for about 2 weeks.\u00a0 L-U-C-K-Y are we.\u00a0 His last day of work at his current job will be sometime this week.\u00a0 Whew!\u00a0 We were both stressing about him getting laid off and feel so relieved that he has another job lined up. -I had lots of anxiety last week about stuff that was happening on the bus (as well as finding out about the hitting).\u00a0 The typical boy that sits next to the Roc is no longer wearing a harness (he\u2019s 5 and they don\u2019t have to wear them once they turn 5) seemed to be bothering him.\u00a0 They were struggling with each other one day and the bus driver told me that he had to stop the bus and reprimand them.\u00a0 At the end of the week we figured out that the Roc was pulling on this boy\u2019s jacket and didn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d when this boy said to stop.\u00a0 The Roc seems to think it\u2019s a game and this boy was getting annoyed with him.\u00a0 They were separated and now the Roc sits alone in a seat (directly behind the bus driver).\u00a0 Totally fine with me.\u00a0 He\u2019s been asking to sit alone for about 2 weeks now.\u00a0 Every time I would get on the bus to buckle the Roc into his seat that little boy would put his bag on the Roc\u2019s side and said \u201cNo seat here!\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHe can\u2019t sit here!\u201d\u00a0 Totally reminded me of Forrest Gump when none of the kids would let him sit with them and I wanted to push this little smiling 5 year old over.\u00a0 I\u2019m so nice. -The bus stuff has me stressing about the fall when he is 5 and no longer needs a harness.\u00a0 I know that he is going to need to have an assigned seat on the bus because there is no way that he will be able to defend himself when a kid says he \u201ccan\u2019t sit here.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m leaning towards asking for him to wear a harness so he feels safer, is safer, and always has a seat, but worried that it will set him apart from his peers and they will pick on him (I know, I know, they\u2019re only 5, but I\u2019ve seen 5 year old be mean!).\u00a0 I wish we had special ed busing, but at the same time that would set him up to get teased in the future when kids start making cracks about the \u201cshort bus.\u201d\u00a0 I want to drive him so I know he\u2019ll be safe, but I want him to have independence from me, he needs to learn it, and he likes to ride the bus.\u00a0 Stress. -I went to a \u201cRomance\u201d party on Friday night.\u00a0 You know, one of  those  parties.\u00a0 My sister knows what I\u2019m talking about and I\u2019m sure some of you know too.\u00a0 I won\u2019t go into too much detail because my mother reads my blog (and lots of other family too) but there are 2 things I should have done differently at this party.\u00a0 1) I should have had MORE to drink and should have started as soon as I walked through the door, and 2) I shouldn\u2019t have raised my hand when they asked if it was anyone\u2019s first time at one of  those  parties\u2026 -Speaking of people who read my blog, I\u2019ve seen some funny ways people have come to find me and the most interesting is someone, or maybe multiple people since I\u2019ve seen it a few times lately, with this same question:\u00a0 \u201cWhat looks good with Cowboy Boots?\u201d\u00a0 They find  this  post. -The Roc has started to go \u201cleft right\u201d up the stairs.\u00a0 He needs to be reminded to and most of the time he\u2019ll say \u201cNO!\u201d but I\u2019ve seen him do it spontaneously this week.\u00a0 Go gross motor skills! He also asked me for a real bike yesterday. -I started lifting weights about a month ago and I have a teeny, tiny bit of definition in my bicep muscle.\u00a0 I was so proud of myself I had to go and flex for GC the other night.\u00a0 I have been running lately too.\u00a0 It seems that working out is just about the only thing I can control in my life.\u00a0 I cannot seem to control what I put in my mouth so at least the running and lifting is off setting all the junk I eat out of anxiety. -I figured out that the fish sauce GC uses when he cooks Thai food makes me sick.\u00a0 Not pleasant. -After 8 weeks of social skills group the Roc has settled into the routine, for the most part.\u00a0 On Monday he was noted to have lots of energy, referred to himself in 1st person (he usually speaks in 3rd), initiated sharing with his friends, and he earned enough good behavior tickets to get a prize from the prize box.\u00a0 More crayons! Score!\u00a0 I forked over more money for the next 8 weeks.\u00a0 Ouch. -One thing (among many) that drives me nuts is the way the Roc is so back and forth on things.\u00a0 A while back I mentioned that he was eating shrimp (wow!) and seemed to be getting over his intense anxiety about  other people   while out in public.\u00a0 We are back to NO shrimp on his plate and lots and lots of anxiety about people while out at stores, the park, the playground, the fitness center, the mall, basically every where there are other people walking\u2026the Roc is worried about them touching him.\u00a0 He was able to get that across to me by saying \u201cShe\u2019s not going to touch you on the back\u201d in a very worried voice while looking back over his shoulder at a lady running while we were walking to the playground.\u00a0 Ack!\u00a0 How do I aleve this anxiety about  people ? -He is back to eating eggs in the morning.\u00a0 Our month run of pancakes for breakfast every.single.day is over.\u00a0 That\u2019s something I guess. -The gray spot on the back of my head is getting bigger.\u00a0 After reading this far (if you\u2019re still reading) you can see why right?!\u00a0 Someone recently asked me how I get my hair \u201cso shiny like an Asian person\u201d\u00a0 and I promptly asked if she meant my brown hair or the large amount of gray hair on the back of my head.\u00a0 I probably should stop alerting people to the fact that I have all that gray hair, you can\u2019t see it from the front, maybe I should always keep my back to the wall.\u00a0 The answer to her question was Aveda.\u00a0 Love that hair stuff. -We put all our cats (4, yikes!) on a diet.\u00a0 My 30 lb cat is now down to a slimmer 25.5 lbs.\u00a0 He\u2019s slightly agressive and annoying now.\u00a0 They get fed twice a day and about 2 hours before their scheduled feeding time he tries to trip me, I guess to remind me that he\u2019s around and I need to feed him.\u00a0 Or else he\u2019s trying to kill me.\u00a0 He also climbs on me while I\u2019m sleeping, pulls my hair, and MEOWS in my face in the early morning hours.\u00a0 I figured out that the slinky is his kryptonite and I always make sure I bring it to bed with me.\u00a0 We are saving lots of money on cat food and he\u2019s starting to look more like a cat and less like jabba the hut. -I got the summer school letter and the Roc will be going from 8:45 am \u2013 3:15 pm, Mon-Thurs, June 24 \u2013 July 29th!\u00a0 That\u2019s the WHOLE DAY! for FIVE WEEKS!\u00a0 The first thing GC said was \u201cNow you won\u2019t be able to complain about not having enough time to yourself\u201d\u00a0 I guess not. -I\u2019m accompanying the Roc on the farm field trip this Friday and his awesome preschool teacher made a social story for us which we have been reading.\u00a0 A line in the book says \u201cThere will be no screaming at the farm.\u00a0 Screaming scares the farm animals and that is dangerous.\u201d\u00a0 Of course, now the Roc says \u201cI\u2019m going to scream at the farm.\u201d\u00a0 Wonderful.\u00a0 I\u2019m preparing to look like the worst mother on the planet.\u00a0 Get my plaque ready, and my tiara.\u00a0 Oh, and I\u2019d like a pink sash this time. -On Friday we have the meeting to discuss whether or not the Roc meets the criteria for the educational label of Autism.\u00a0 If he does then he would be able to attend the Delaware Autism Program (DAP).\u00a0 I have so many mixed feelings on this subject.\u00a0 All of his doctors have said that he needs to be mainstreamed with typical children, not at DAP where he would be with other children like him and only mainstreamed for things like lunch and gym.\u00a0 He has come so far since starting preschool and I think some of that has to do with modeling off his typical peers.\u00a0 I am split 50/50 on whether I think they are going to give him the label.\u00a0 He behaved terribly (I think) at their evaluation, but then his awesome preschool teacher said that he had a pretty good day when they did the classroom observation.\u00a0 They got to see him interacting with his peers, asking and answering questions during lesson time, basically participating in the regular classroom.\u00a0 If he doesn\u2019t fit DAP\u2019s criteria then I won\u2019t have to make any decisions so I\u2019m trying to wait until Friday to see what they say. -And lastly the Roc  BIT  a teacher yesterday.\u00a0 Oh. My. God.\u00a0 I read the email after watching the Devils lose to the Hurricanes in the last 2 minutes of game 7, so I was already a little down.\u00a0 But to find out that he put his teeth on the para was so upsetting.\u00a0 They said he was put in time out, got a stern talking to from both of the teachers, lost privileges for the rest of the day and some for today too, and that he seemed to grasp the idea that he \u201ccrossed a line.\u201d\u00a0 I find it interesting that he didn\u2019t tell on himself as soon as he got home.\u00a0 He usually does as soon as he gets off the bus or when I pick him up from social skills group (another place he started to hit the teachers).\u00a0 I\u2019m at a loss there.\u00a0 It\u2019s also interesting that he doesn\u2019t hit or bite ME.\u00a0 What the heck? Whew.\u00a0 I\u2019m done.\u00a0 For now. Are you still reading?\u00a0 You are?\u00a0 That probably means that we are related.\u00a0 Eveyone else checked out after the first couple paragraphs!

Something else I\u2019ve been hearing, which is equally musical to this Mommy\u2019s ears, is \u201cLook at ME!\u201d\u00a0 Over the summer I taught the Roc to say that when he got to the top of the slide, which I\u2019m sure seemed a bit funny to the other parents at the playground that day, and lately he\u2019s been saying it when he wants my attention.\u00a0 When I\u2019m cooking, on the phone, writing a list, on the computer, just about anytime I\u2019m not looking at him.\u00a0\u00a0 What we need to work on now is saying it with an inside voice since he\u2019s still using it as if he\u2019s at the playground. \u201cMOMMY, LOOK AT ME!!!!!\u201d He wants my attention and it\u2019s just so\u2026lovely.

{"date": "December 24, 2008", "body": "Our morning started off with a runny nose\u2026.Uh-Oh.\u00a0 \u201cOh NO, a runny nose!!!!!\u201d the Roc said in the whiny, high pitch he uses whenever he is the least bit upset.\u00a0 Runny noses (and \u201csweaty butt\u201d when he used to wear a pull-up full time) really throw the Roc off.\u00a0 He can\u2019t get past the sensation of the runny nose.\u00a0 It completely distracts him and he doesn\u2019t like it one bit, and he lets me know\u2026all day long.\u00a0 I gave him a towel to carry around for the day, which I regretted later when he had a raw nose, and figured I\u2019d just add it to the laundry tonight.\u00a0 Even though it\u2019s just the three of us, laundry never seems to end around here.\u00a0 Besides waking up with a runny nose, the Roc also woke up in a wet bed. Wet bed = Laundry for Mommy + something spinning for the Roc to look at. Warm laundry on the floor = cats on the laundry. After breakfast the Roc and I headed off to his favorite store for some last minute shopping. It\u2019s his favorite because they have fountains. Lots and lots of fountains. He found a Christmas tree ornament right as we walked in, literally in a basket by the door, and carried it around with him.\u00a0\u00a0 So I bought it for him.\u00a0 Of course I did, this is a boy who never asks for ANYTHING.\u00a0\u00a0 He was very happy. And we hung the ornament on the tree when we got home. Later as I was making the Roc\u2019s lunch I heard him saying \u201cmeow\u201d \u201cmeow\u201d and I turned around to find him \u201ctalking\u201d to Lucy. oops!\u00a0 There\u2019s a cat tail in that picture!\u00a0 Then as Lucy went to rub on the Roc he said \u201cROAR!\u201d and tried to scare her.\u00a0 He\u2019s always liked the cats but this was the first time he\u2019s interacted with them quite like that.\u00a0 Funny. After lunch the Roc relaxed on the couch and watched a movie while I made him some bean soup to eat for dinner.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t look that appetizing but it is really tasty and he likes it (and he eats carrots without realizing it!) While making the soup I accidentally clogged the sink\u2026oops, time to get a new disposal, this one doesn\u2019t like carrots. The Roc and I made cookies for Santa. And this was when I realized that the Roc really wasn\u2019t feeling all that great.\u00a0 Whenever we bake he hangs around the oven and waits for the first batch of whatever we are making to come out.\u00a0 Then he usually whines the whole time said food is cooling.\u00a0 Not today.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t even wait for the first batch of cookies before he requested to watch another movie and lay on the couch.\u00a0 Poor guy.\u00a0 Around this time GC got home from work and unclogged my sink. Since the Roc was occupied with his movie and the cats were busy watching the birds, I decided to visit my little friend in the basement, my treadmill. When I got back upstairs, and after I had showered, I found this sad little guy on the couch. He requested to \u201crelax on the couch while Mommy watches a show\u201d\u00a0 which is what we did back in February while he recovered from a double ear infection \u2013 he dozed while I watched about 30 Giada cooking shows.\u00a0 Tonight we watched A Charlie Brown Christmas and Shrek while GC cooked dinner. After dinner we let the Roc open a few gifts from far away relatives and then it was time for bed, after we put out the cookies for Santa.\u00a0 The presents and cookies seemed to cheer him up a bit. The Roc is sleeping now and I\u2019ve put the presents under the tree.\u00a0 GC is putting together the one item the Roc asked Santa for \u2013 a train table. There\u2019s only been a small amount of cursing during table construction and most of it has happened when GC figured out that a couple wooden pieces are missing for the \u201croundhouse.\u201d\u00a0 I thought we would just leave that item off the table for now until the company sent us the pieces, but GC wants it to be completed for the Roc and so he\u2019s out in the garage sawing little wooden dowels he bought a few months ago and trying to fix the roundhouse himself while I write.\u00a0 And he did it!\u00a0 He\u2019s so happy. He said he was worried that Christmas would be ruined for the Roc.\u00a0 Crisis averted.\u00a0 What a good Daddy.\u00a0 Now we have to wrap this thing and hope the cats don\u2019t drive us crazy tonight because we are leaving the table in our room and having the Roc open it last. I\u2019m so excited for the Roc to see all the presents under the tree tomorrow.\u00a0 I know he doesn\u2019t feel well tonight but he made my Christmas when I was putting him to bed.\u00a0 As I pulled up covers and leaned down to kiss him he said in his little voice and pronoun reversal: \u201cMommy makes you happy\u201d and that\u2019s the best Christmas present I could have asked for!

We had a feedback meeting before we went to South Carolina.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t get an educational label of Autism\u2026wwhhhaattt?\u00a0 Here\u2019s why: Delaware has a unique program called the Delaware Autistim Program (DAP) which is in a school district north of ours.\u00a0 It is a special education school just for children with Autism.\u00a0 They have one school that is PreK through 12th grade and they have an off site program for children who can be mainstreamed part of the day.\u00a0 They use the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to teach the children in the program.\u00a0 DAP did the testing on the Roc, which included a parent interview, an evaluation at their school, and a classroom observation at his preschool.\u00a0 Based off of what they saw from the Roc they decided that he doesn\u2019t fit their criteria and therefore he doesn\u2019t deserve an educational label of Autism.\u00a0 Basically, he\u2019s not Autistic-enough for their program so in their eyes he doesn\u2019t have Autism (educationally).\u00a0 How stupid. I wasn\u2019t surprised by this.\u00a0 I had a feeling that he wouldn\u2019t meet their criteria and all three of the \u201cprofessionals\u201d who gave the Roc his medical diagnosis (agreed with me when I said he has Autism) stated that the program wouldn\u2019t be a good fit for him.\u00a0 His neurologist said DAP is very picky about who they let into their school and was very adament about it not being a good fit for the Roc, and that they wouldn\u2019t accept him anyway.\u00a0 His neurologist has said that the Roc needs to be mainstreamed with his typical peers.\u00a0 I was worried about having to make the decision if DAP said they would accept him and am kind of relieved that the decision was made for me.\u00a0 I feel that he has progressed so much since starting the special ed preschool in our school district and I want him to keep making that progress.\u00a0 But I still find it laughable that because he didn\u2019t fit the strict and selective criteria for the DAP program we now have to come up with another educational label for him.\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing our school district will now label him as \u201clearning disabled\u201d\u00a0 when he really has AUTISM!!!!!!!!

{"date": "December 27, 2008", "body": "We are fast approaching the one year anniversary of the Roc\u2019s \u201cA\u201d day, or Autism diagnosis day, and I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about what it was like last year during the holidays.\u00a0 It was an especially difficult time for us.\u00a0 We were also going to be alone for the holidays for the first time.\u00a0 Last year the Roc didn\u2019t get excited about presents, other than playing with the wrapping paper, and I had to help him along on Christmas morning.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t play with anything we got him.\u00a0 I remember GC and I looked at each other and said something to the effect of \u201cThis is so depressing.\u00a0 It\u2019s not supposed to be like this.\u201d\u00a0 It really was an especially difficult time for us. What a difference a year has made, for all of us.\u00a0 We were alone, just the three of us, again this year but it wasn\u2019t anything like last year.\u00a0 For one, the Roc \u201cgets\u201d gifts now.\u00a0 He understands that there\u2019s more to it than just wrapping paper, and that there is something under all that pretty paper.\u00a0 Another change is that he willingly went and sat on Santa\u2019s lap this year at the mall, and he asked for a specific toy, a train table.\u00a0 I was pretty excited to see if he would like that big present, and little worried that maybe we had coached him to ask for that specific item and that he wouldn\u2019t really care about it.\u00a0 Needless to say I was so excited that I was the last one to fall asleep on Christmas Eve and the first to wake up in the morning, so I photographed the tree, again. When I went into the Roc\u2019s room and wished him a Merry Christmas he seemed worried by this change in our normal routine and probably by my visible excitement.\u00a0 I asked him if he knew who had come the night before and if he wanted to come out and see what was under the tree and he said no.\u00a0 Uh-Oh!\u00a0 He then asked if Santa was downstairs and I quickly figured out that he was worried that Santa came and was still here!\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to come out if Santa was downstairs.\u00a0 I reassured him that Santa came at night while he was sleeping, that he didn\u2019t sleepover, and only then did the Roc come out to see the tree.\u00a0 As soon as he saw the presents he wanted to go down and start opening.\u00a0 He got right to it and opened everything on his own, no coaching from Mommy needed, and even developed his own gift opening technique.\u00a0 He started every present at the corner. The first couple things he opened were little games and so everything after that he said \u201cwhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d\u00a0 \u201coooh, a game\u201d\u00a0 as he was opening it.\u00a0 He even played along with the whole show me what you got so Mommy can take pictures thing. Sometimes he put put the items up too early and/or in front of his face. But for the most part he got the hang of it. The one thing he asked to take out of the package as soon as he unwrapped it was this wooden birthday cake set. Score!! It was such a great feeling to know that he was excited about something we got him!\u00a0 I just knew when I saw that in Toys R Us that he would like it.\u00a0 The kid loves cake! After all the presents were opened we told him that there was one more big surprise in our bedroom and we would bring it out to him\u2026 and then we ran into a slight problem.\u00a0 GC built the train table in our bedroom and we made sure it would fit through the doorway  before  he put the drawers on it!\u00a0 Dumb! When we tried to bring that huge wrapped table out of the room the drawer handles made it too big to pass through the doorway!\u00a0 ARgH! \u00a0 I really didn\u2019t want the Roc to unwrap it in our bedroom so GC did the only logical thing, took the door off the hinges. Wah-lah!\u00a0 It fit!\u00a0 The train table was out and ready to be unwrapped.\u00a0 The Roc was doing the happy poodle dance and he correctly guessed what was under all that wrapping paper.\u00a0 He even said that it was was what he asked Santa for! The Roc was so excited!\u00a0 As soon as it was free he immediately started playing! GC played too! He liked it, he really liked it!\u00a0 He even played with it by himself and didn\u2019t need to have Mommy or Daddy play with him, though that is always preferred.\u00a0 GC and I couldn\u2019t stop smiling.\u00a0 We marveled at all the changes the Roc has undergone and how different this year was compared to last year.\u00a0 One thing for sure, Christmas was fun this year!

{"date": "May 11, 2009", "body": "We got back from South Carolina last night.\u00a0 A looonnnngggg 10 hours in the car with the Roc.\u00a0 He does pretty well on these long car rides and only said \u201cMoommmiieeee\u201d about 700 \u2013 800 times.\u00a0 Not joking.\u00a0 I\u2019ll take \u201cMoommmiiieeeeeeeee\u201d over screaming and tantrums any day.\u00a0 We left super early last Wednesday (before 5 am!\u00a0 ack!) and as soon as we got there the Roc started asking to go to the beach. So we did.\u00a0 It was sunny.\u00a0 Sunny = Squinty Later we went out to eat and all of us (except the Roc) had all you can eat shrimp.\u00a0 YUM! While the men were finishing up their beers my mother-in-law, the Roc, and I went outside to listen to the live music.\u00a0 I wish I wouldn\u2019t have stashed my camera in the car because the Roc grabbed his stuffed Horton elephant and sat on my lap grinning at the man playing the guitar on stage.\u00a0 He was the only kid at the bar and he was clutching a stuffed animal.\u00a0 Totally cute.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t have a picture.\u00a0 You\u2019ll just have to use your imagination. Before going back to the house we took a walk in Murrells Inlet.\u00a0 It was windy. GC tried to keep up his lifting regime while we were visiting.\u00a0 We always eat lots of good food whenever we visit his family and this trip was no exception.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t fond of my documenting it though.\u00a0 Can you tell? While we were in SC we got to see our new nephew, Anderson, who is totally adorable.\u00a0 GC says he really wants another baby\u2026 We\u2019ll see on that one.\u00a0 Anderson is pretty dang cute and I did get a little \u201cbaby fever\u201d while holding him. And he wasn\u2019t fussy like the Roc was at the same age.\u00a0 Here\u2019s proof.\u00a0 The Roc\u2019s early tantruming days. Though I do have to say that looking at this picture 4.5 years later I realize something\u2026he\u2019s wearing a fleece sleep sack\u2026in August.\u00a0 Maybe, just maybe, that attributed to his screaming in this particular instance\u2026 Anyway, while we were invading my sister-in-laws house we tried to get a picture of the grandparents with all four of their grandchildren.\u00a0 This is what happened.\u00a0 The Roc did not want to sit on the couch so he stood in front of me, and I just got the top of his head. We tried that one again. We finally got the Roc to sit with the group by telling him to sit next to Annabella.\u00a0 His favorite.\u00a0 He LOVES her and followed her around all afternoon.\u00a0 He was talking about seeing her on the car ride down and was so excited when we pulled into their driveway. We also got a picture of Great-Grammy with all the grand kids. I\u2019m glad we took the time to get these shots.\u00a0 I know they will be treasured. We also took the Roc to Pawleys Island and he had a blast.\u00a0 Last August I had to literally carry him onto the beach.\u00a0 He was terrified of the waves and he wasn\u2019t too fond of the sand.\u00a0 It was hot, it was windy, and he got stung by a jelly fish.\u00a0 It was a looonnnnggg 10 days at the beach.\u00a0 8 months later he walked onto the beach, walked far down to a tidal pool in fact, and was thrilled to get into the sand. GC took a walk down to the ocean. Which tired him out so he took a nap. Auntie Andrea and baby Anderson even made it to the beach that day. After the beach we hit the pool to wash off the sand. Later GC gave his mother a Thai cooking lesson.\u00a0 He loves that I took this picture\u2026(catch that sarcasm?) Before we left SC we went back to Huntington Beach State Park to walk on the beach.\u00a0 The Roc even got over his fear of the waves a teeny, tiny bit to let go of my hand and RUN on the beach. Overall the Roc did very well during this visit.\u00a0 He had his moments and I had mine.\u00a0 It\u2019s sometimes hard to watch him struggle to interact and I tend to lose my cool more easily while on \u201cvacation.\u201d\u00a0 It was nice to see him talking to his Nonna and Nonno more and very nice to hear about the positive changes they see in him.\u00a0 He even gave what we call \u201creal hugs\u201d using his arms (instead of just leaning into the person) and that was so sweet to see.\u00a0 I am so thrilled that he had fun at the beach this time around too.\u00a0 We were so bummed last summer when we scheduled a 10 day visit and had a child who wanted nothing to do with the beach!\u00a0 That\u2019s progress.

The field trip was canceled the first time around because of rain, so we had lots of extra time to read his \u201cMy Farm Trip\u201d story.\u00a0 Two weeks in fact.\u00a0 In the story there is a line towards the end which says \u201cThe farmer will take us on a hay ride\u201d which was supposed to happen the first time around, but didn\u2019t happen when we actually went to the farm two weeks later.\u00a0 The Roc LOVES to go on hay rides and that was what he was most looking forward to and talked about when we discussed this field trip. Going on a hayride was also what he talked about DURING the field trip.\u00a0 He talked about while we looked at the cows. He talked about it while we watched some cows get milked, saw the big storage tank and milk tanker truck.\u00a0 He talked about it while we saw all the baby cows (and the farmer said a few of them were to be shot soon\u2026yikes). It was near the pigs that his awesome preschool teacher heard him and mentioned to me that we were NOT actually going on a hayride this time, we would have on the date that we were rained out, but the tractor driver was too busy on the farm the day we were actually there.\u00a0 Sigh.\u00a0 I tried to explain to a very upset Roc that even though I told him we were going on a hayride, we were not.\u00a0 He was not happy but I did get him to look at the pigs and horses with a bit of enthusiasm, and then he was happy to ride the bus back to school. In all it was a good field trip, way better than the  first  one of the school year, so even though he was stuck on the hayride that never happened, he was able to get over it and move on without throwing a complete tantrum.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something in of itself.

Totally cute!\u00a0 Apparently he walks in to school with her everyday like that. The \u201cGet Fit Day\u201d was a program to promote fitness and get the kids moving.\u00a0 The preschoolers participated in a bunch of different activities including the hot potato game, soccer, and the big moon bounce, which the Roc saw as soon as we got onto the football field and was totally stuck on, and talked about while playing hot potato and soccer.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t get in it fast enough, but was very good about waiting his turn (sometimes too good and kids would butt in line ahead of him-good thing Mommy was there to stand up for him!) He totally shocked me by how much he was willing to climb. The only activity he refused to participate in was the \u201cice skating\u201d station.\u00a0 He was at the end of the line so he had to wait for most of his class to go first and when it was finally his turn he was just \u201cdone.\u201d\u00a0 There were lots of kids from different classes around and one of the volunteers working the station tried to pick him up and put him on her hip to talk to him.\u00a0 He was NOT happy about being picked up by a stranger and he went down hill from there, so I took him over to the playground where half the class already was.\u00a0 They played for awhile and then went back inside for snack. I have a hard time whenever I go to these school events.\u00a0 I try not to compare, but I just can\u2019t seem to stop myself and it pains me sometimes to see how different the Roc is from his classmates.\u00a0 I always leave feeling slightly sick to my stomach with worry about the future. What is even more painful is to see him want to play with his peers but not understand the rules of their games or get flat out rejected.\u00a0 After snack the kids did \u201cfree play\u201d and the Roc went over to two boys playing with soft blocks and asked \u201cDo you want to build a HUGE tower with me?\u201d to which one of the boys looked up and said \u201cNO!\u201d and the other completely ignored him.\u00a0 My heart cracked a little as I watched the Roc sit down and play with the blocks by himself.\u00a0 It made me so unbelievably sad for the Roc.\u00a0 He\u2019s come so far, yet he is still so far away from his classmates. Now, more than a week later I\u2019ve have had a time to think about the event, and I can come up with some positives about the day. The Roc kept telling me \u201cthis is different\u201d while we were doing the activities on the field and when we were waiting for the ice skating, which is awesome using his words.\u00a0 He tried most of the activities even though it was loud, hot, and very busy on the football field, lots of change and sensory overload, and he handled it.\u00a0 He followed along with his classmates while they played on the playground.\u00a0 He spontaneously asked a couple classmates to play with him at the block station and when they rejected him he didn\u2019t throw a fit, or try to wreck what they were building.\u00a0 All good things that a year ago I wondered if he would be able to do. It was a nice event and I\u2019m so glad the Roc was able to participate.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got to learn not to compare so much though.\u00a0 The Roc is his own person and I am so proud of him. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2009/05/28/get-fit-day/", "title": "Get Fit Day"},

I gave half the paparazzi duties to GC on this trip and he caught my parents in a photo while hiking (I even appear in some photos on this trip. gasp!) On Thursday we went to Sabino Canyon.\u00a0 It\u2019s a long hike so the Roc rode in his stroller.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t really fit in it anymore and we know this is probably the last trip we will be using it.\u00a0 Sigh.\u00a0 That thing is so good at containing him and he feels safe in it.\u00a0 We did hike the whole 7.4 miles instead of wussing out and taking the tram (which we\u2019ll have to do next year because of the stroller issue).\u00a0 It was a gorgeous day and we had a lot of fun (and GC and I got sunburned. ouch.) We found a really nice spot for a picnic lunch, and for the Roc to throw rocks and see some little waterfalls (his favorite). On Friday we went to the desert museum.\u00a0 We stopped at the other Saguaro National Park for a picnic lunch and some giggling. When we got to the museum my parents decided to sign up for an annual pass.\u00a0 While they were filling out the necessary forms the Roc decided to ride a javelina. GC thought it looked like fun so he tried it out too\u2026they don\u2019t go very fast. We saw lots of cool stuff there.\u00a0 Mountain lion, Wolf. We tried tried to take a family picture but the Roc was busy running these ramps. So we got these two pictures instead. Before we left we visited the bird area where GC found a bird he liked\u2026but who didn\u2019t like him back. (Yup, that\u2019s a size 4T sweatshirt my husband is wearing.\u00a0 Nice huh?) We also went into the hummingbird enclosure, a bird that always makes me think of my mother-in-law who loves them. On Saturday we took the Roc to the neighborhood playground where again I caught him going down a tunnel slide! After lunch we headed over to Agua Caliente Park to walk around. The Roc just loved sprinting down the trails away from us.\u00a0 He always stopped and waited for us to catch up before racing off again. On Sunday we went downtown to a wonderful Mexican restaurant where my father tried to see if he could eat more than my husband (who is an \u201ceating machine\u201d) He ended up taking more than half home!\u00a0 After eating we took the Roc to see some fountains. He didn\u2019t sit still for long and soon enough GC was chasing him around so he didn\u2019t fall in the water, which caused him to get really silly and GC to get a little annoyed. On Monday I finally got outside to snap a few photos of the guys playing tennis. After lunch we went back to Saguaro East and took a hike.\u00a0 The Roc  loved  this hike because we climbed up and up and up.\u00a0 I was calling him my little mountain goat.\u00a0 We had to keep telling him to slow down! When he finally started to slow down we stopped for a rest, and looked out at the view. He did do some complaining on the way back down but we were all surprised at how far he hiked and how far we went UP. We flew back East yesterday and after a delayed first flight, re-booked second flight, 2.5 hour layover, 45 minutes sitting at the gate  while on the plane  because of a mechanical problem, and sitting in evening rush hour\u2026 we arrived home.\u00a0 Sigh. It was a great trip.\u00a0 The Roc had his moments, not wanting Grandma to sit by him in the truck, some tantrums, and a lovely screaming outburst in the Dallas airport (there\u2019s nothing like 50 heads swiveling in your direction to make you feel like a great parent!) but overall he was good.\u00a0 He just loves to be outside and to keep moving.\u00a0 GC  loved  Arizona and didn\u2019t have to take his asthma medication once.\u00a0 He even went running with me and didn\u2019t use his inhaler.\u00a0 He has decided that we need to move to an area like that.\u00a0 With his layoff coming in May we just might take that chance.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see. *** edited to add:\u00a0 I\u2019ve been getting some emails about moving to AZ.\u00a0 We aren\u2019t thinking of moving to AZ.\u00a0 We are still continuing our ongoing debate about MN vs. CO. \u00a0 GC just got another vote in for CO since he could breathe there without asthma meds just like he could in AZ.\u00a0 The debate continues\u2026 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/vacation/", "title": "Vacation"},

When they got home GC mentioned to me that the Roc got hit at class again this week.\u00a0 It was news to me that another child hit him last week, but I didn\u2019t ask the Roc any questions about the incident(s) right away.\u00a0 I knew he wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u00a0 He already had it in his mind that he would be having a smoothie and then playing plants vs. zombies on his iPad during the forty five minutes he would be home before he had to get back into the car to drive to the barn.\u00a0 I knew I could ask him about it in the car. Time and growth have changed so much for the Roc.\u00a0 I can clearly remember driving down Rt. 13 in Delaware and pointing out the farm equipment and big trucks to a silent Roc.\u00a0 The fluttery panic I felt when I glanced in the rear view mirror and couldn\u2019t catch his eye.\u00a0 Now he is rarely silent, but many of our conversations are monologues from the Roc about plants vs. zombies, a place we have been, or a movie the Roc has watched.\u00a0 Or a series of questions of which he already knows the answers.\u00a0 But that too is slowly changing and I know that he will sometimes talk to me on the many car rides we take.

Sitting next to him on Friday night I realized that he had been watching the show without any judgement or criticism.\u00a0 He is all about the facts and never had anything bad to say about anyone on the show.\u00a0 In fact, I don\u2019t ever hear him say anything bad about anyone.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t work that way.\u00a0 In a world where we so often hear people around us making judgements and being critical of others, when they don\u2019t know anything about them, it is absolutely refreshing to see that those thoughts do not come naturally to my child.\u00a0 It\u2019s not something I did, a way I did or did not parent him, it\u2019s just part of who he is.\u00a0 Though I would hope that some of the our conversations about negative experiences he has had with peers and the right way to treat others have sunk in\u2026it\u2019s just not in his nature to be judgmental or critical of others. I love that about him. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/couch-conversations/", "title": "Couch Conversations"},

We even took our crazy dog to the beach one evening! It wasn\u2019t sunny every day, but even light rain won\u2019t keep the Roc away from the water.

{"date": "August 10, 2010", "body": "Do you remember what it felt like to be a kid?\u00a0 The feeling that the world is a bright and shiny place, you are at home in your own skin, and nothing bad is going to happen. I do. I remember what it felt like to run unabashed, the wind across my skin, my hair whipped into a frenzy.\u00a0 No worries and no fears.\u00a0 Not a care in the world.\u00a0 I remember the sun in the summer, the ice cold of Lake Superior, the squish of mud between my toes, the shock of plunging into a northern Minnesota lake, the smell of dirt, the sting of snow, the feel of grass on my bare feet, the laughter.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until much later when I realized that not all children have childhoods like mine.\u00a0 Then having the Roc has shown me a whole other side of childhood I never knew existed. Sensory Issues. Fear. Anxiety. All three of those tied together to create a perfect storm.\u00a0 A storm when the sun is shining, a storm when the birds are singing, a storm when the waves are crashing on frolicking children, a storm when they are laughing the airy laughter of childhood, splashing in the foam and sand.\u00a0 A storm in my beautiful son\u2019s body, in his mind, a storm that I would give anything to calm.\u00a0 A storm that steals the carefree spirit I remember from childhood. The Roc has been afraid of waves for the last 2 years.\u00a0 We did not travel to South Carolina last summer, opting to take a vacation to Colorado instead.\u00a0 So the Roc hadn\u2019t been back to Pawleys Island since 2008.\u00a0 The year he wouldn\u2019t set his feet on the sand because it was too hot, the year he screamed if I tried to lower him down or walk with him towards the ocean, the year he wouldn\u2019t get anywhere near the ocean side, preferring to sit near the waterway when we forced him onto the beach (on my hip.)\u00a0 A beach vacation that was spent at Nonna and Nonno\u2019s pool.\u00a0 The family vacation in which we one day left 1/3 of our little family watching a movie so we could go to the beach, only to eyeball the other families romping through the tiny swells, and feel the gaping hole of the one we left behind. The fear of waves is still present 2 years later, but the Roc really likes the beach now.\u00a0 He asks to go all the time, he wants to watch the waves from a safe distance, and he likes to play in the sand.\u00a0 When we went down to South Carolina in June he thoroughly enjoyed walking at Huntington Beach State Park in the evening, up by the sand dunes, ever watchful of the water.\u00a0 He loved going to Pawleys Island to play in the sand and was even willing to get into the tidal pools, as long as the tide didn\u2019t start to come in and make little waves.\u00a0 And I tried really, really hard not to compare him to his cousins and his friend P, who we met up with and who LOVES to go in the waves.\u00a0 But I had a hard time letting go of the longing I felt as I stood in the surf, waves crashing against my knees, the Roc\u2019s cousins and my best friend\u2019s son lit up with delight while playing in the foamy rushing water.\u00a0 I wanted the Roc to be out there too.\u00a0 I wanted to roll around in the waves with him, I wanted him to experience the abandon the other children felt.\u00a0 I would look back over my shoulder at him building a sand castle all alone and wish I could wipe anxiety, sound sensitivity, and fear from his beach experience.\u00a0 It was hard for me to let go of my vision of what I wanted the day to be like.\u00a0 I struggled with it. When we went back to South Carolina for the second time this summer I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t  push  the ocean experience, that I would let the Roc be, that I would  let go .\u00a0 On the first evening we went walking at Huntington and I tried to smile and push back the twinge as I again watched the Roc\u2019s cousins splash in the surf while he stayed up by the dunes constructing a sand castle. I reminded myself to  let go  as we starting walking down the shore and I watched the Roc run, knowing that he never before would have strayed so far from my side, only the influence of his cousins could get him to swallow his fear of the waves. GC and I encouraged the Roc to play in the tidal pools along with his cousins.\u00a0 It took awhile of him watching those waves, and watching his cousins, before he took the shallow plunge and got in. Always keeping at least one eye on those waves. Later that night as I looked back over the photos I was just so happy that he participated.\u00a0 That he didn\u2019t allow his fear to overcome him, that he made memories with his SC cousins.\u00a0 He had fun. Three days later GC, the Roc, Guinness and I headed to Pawleys ready to soak in the sun, play in the sand, and watch those waves.\u00a0 I forced GC to trudge our stuff to the end of the beach where the inlet meets the ocean.\u00a0 I had a feeling we might be able to get him close to the water there and even from far away I could spy a huge tidal pool.\u00a0 We set up our stuff and let Guinness run wild, chasing his ball.\u00a0 I gently prodded the Roc into the tidal pool and was very surprised when he mentioned the tiny waves and then SAT DOWN amongst them. There he stayed as they got bigger. Eventually the ocean invaded the tidal pool\u2026and the Roc was still there.\u00a0 Still in the waves\u2026!!! Not long after Nonna came walking down the beach with the Roc\u2019s cousins and I laughed out loud when she first saw the Roc in the waves.\u00a0 Her jaw dropped open, her eyes popped, and she flung her arm up and pointed at him, agape that he was in the ocean!\u00a0 The Roc had the biggest grin, he was so proud of himself. I was too and I finally got to see something I had ached to witness, the Roc letting go and just being a kid at the beach, with his cousins, all three carefree. Is there anything better? \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_22691.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_22791.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_23111.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_23131.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_2323_21.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_23411.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_24491.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_24601.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_25541.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_26551.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_26321.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_26611.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_26381.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_26671.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_2663.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/carefree-kids/", "title": "Carefree Kids"},
{"date": "April 11, 2010", "body": "As spring break winds down (insert choir of angels singing here) I am now getting the chance to post about the last 7+ days. We were very low key about Easter this year.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t dye eggs, or go on any Easter egg hunts.\u00a0 I did put together an Easter basket for the Roc and \u201claid\u201d a trail of plastic eggs in our bedroom for him to follow.\u00a0 I had to wait until he was taking a morning bath to do so, the cats would have rolled those eggs all over our wood floor if I left them there for too long.\u00a0 When I mentioned to the Roc that there was something downstairs, he was very excited to see the eggs in our bedroom.\u00a0 He quickly vaulted the gate, and started collecting.\u00a0 It made me laugh to see the methodical way he picked up each egg, one at a time, opened it, and took out the sticker inside before picking up another.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t last a second in an egg hunt! It took him a few minutes, but he finally found his Easter basket. No candy, only presents.\u00a0 That\u2019s how the Easter bunny rolls in our GFCF household. Beach toys, squirt gun (which I may regret later,) dinner game, and a wooden pizza set.\u00a0 He loves to unwrap and spent a good amount of time playing in the ripped up wrapping paper. We spent the rest of the day outside, cleaning out our messy, messy garage.\u00a0 We set up the sand & water table, bubbles, and chalk on the sidewalk in front of the house, as well as a soccer net in the side yard and the Roc kept busy while we worked.\u00a0 He played.\u00a0 By himself.\u00a0 And he didn\u2019t just pour sand and/or water repeatedly, though he did do a fair amount of that, he played.\u00a0 He buried toy cars and then exclaimed \u201cI found it Mommy!\u201d\u00a0 He bounced balls on the driveway and caught them, he kicked the soccer ball into the net.\u00a0 It was the first time that GC and I worked on something together and the Roc kept himself occupied.\u00a0 Something of an Easter miracle\u2026or maybe just progress.\u00a0 Nice either way. *** Later that evening as we sat down to dinner together the following exchange happened between the three of us, and it blew my mind. GC:\u00a0 \u201cMmm, Roc this pot roast is amazing.\u00a0 Do you remember  Great-Grammy  down in South Carolina?\u00a0 Back when she could cook, she made the best pot roast in the world.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cBut she died.\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cYes, she did die.\u00a0 She\u2019s not here anymore.\u00a0 We won\u2019t see her when we go to South Carolina this year.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cWhere  did she go?\u201d GC and I say  at the same time, GC:\u00a0 \u201cNo one knows,\u201d\u00a0 Me:\u00a0 \u201cHeaven.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cAnd you can\u2019t come back.\u00a0 Why can\u2019t you come back?\u201d GC:\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s how it works when you die.\u00a0 You don\u2019t come back.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cThat won\u2019t happen for a long, long, long time.\u201d Roc:\u00a0 \u201cWhy did she die?\u201d GC:\u00a0 \u201cRemember your book What\u2019s Alive?\u00a0 Every living thing dies someday.\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cShe was very old buddy.\u00a0 That\u2019s when people die, when they are very old.\u00a0 You are only 5 and Grammy was a lot older than you.\u201d GC:\u00a0 \u201cJust remember to have fun every day and keep smiling.\u201d Me: \u2026at a complete loss for words, I couldn\u2019t come up with anything else.\u00a0 It was as if my mind was frozen.\u00a0 I was left wondering if I heard everything correctly.\u00a0 The Roc moved on to something else but this conversation rolled around in my mind. I wanted to dedicate a post just to this conversation, but the words to describe my shock and awe never solidified.\u00a0 So, so much about that conversation completely amazed me.\u00a0 A first I never saw coming.\u00a0 GC and I talked about it later, and I thought about it while laying in the dark late that night.\u00a0 I thought about the post I would write during the week.\u00a0 But I had no time while the Roc was home\u2026and we\u2019ve had more conversations about death since Easter. Driving home from swimming lessons on Wednesday the Roc pipped up from the backseat and told me that he didn\u2019t want to get old and die.\u00a0 I was glad to be driving, the need to face forward and concentrate on the aggressive nature of my fellow rush hour drivers keeping me centered.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember exactly what I said other than I talked about how every living thing dies and this fact is a part of life.\u00a0 The following night as I tucked the Roc in bed he asked me what Grammy was doing in heaven.\u00a0 I was shocked that he remembered and felt completely unprepared for the question.\u00a0 We talked a little bit about heaven and what Grammy might be doing there.\u00a0 He said she was probably eating sweets, and I smiled remembering Grammy eating the \u201ccracker candy\u201d I would make and bring down just for her, knowing she would love it.\u00a0 Then he told me that he didn\u2019t want to go to heaven because he couldn\u2019t come back. I almost broke apart. I held myself back from exclaiming that I didn\u2019t want him to go either.\u00a0 That I do not want to be in this world if it does not include him.\u00a0 That I cannot decide which is my biggest fear:\u00a0 my dying and not being able to see him grow up and be his mommy, or him dying and me having to live on without him.\u00a0 Instead I bit my tongue and tried to assure him that he didn\u2019t have to worry about that right now. I left his room that night stunned anew by this series of conversations about death.\u00a0 I sat on the top step of the landing trying to get a handle on myself.\u00a0 I just didn\u2019t see it coming.\u00a0 Every time we had a small conversation this week I was blown away by the questions he was asking and how to answer them.\u00a0 He continues to show me that he has been paying attention all this time and is thinking things over even when I assume he doesn\u2019t understand.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t know how much he would understand about Grammy, and he\u2019s showing us, and asking for us to explain those things that he doesn\u2019t. Simply Amazing. Makes me wonder what he is going to ask next. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/img_0224.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/img_0228.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/img_0236.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/img_0241.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/img_0240.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2010/04/11/easter-a-conversation-that-blew-my-mind/", "title": "Easter + A Conversation (that blew my\u00a0mind)"},

{"date": "August 9, 2010", "body": "I spent a lot of time last night weeding out my gazillion beach photos in preparation for the posts I am in the process of writing about our trip to South Carolina.\u00a0 Some pretty cool stuff happened during those 8+ days and I\u2019m excited to share it.\u00a0 But we are starting the 3 weeks of all day togetherness before school starts on August 30th, and the Roc is home all day, so my computer time is extremely limited, as in non existent unless he is asleep.\u00a0 So the first post I\u2019m working on didn\u2019t get any attention today, minus the words, thought fragments, and phrases floating around in my head.\u00a0 The Roc is now in bed, and the plan I had since I opened my eyes this morning was to put those thoughts, fragments, and phrases together as soon as I said good night and closed the door.\u00a0 But I have to write about what happened today, because it deserves a post of it\u2019s own, and it\u2019s been a long time coming. The Roc and I stayed busy today weeding the gardens and running errands, and when we found some plants on sale I just had to bring them home, knowing that we could kill some time in the yard potting, digging in the dirt, and planting.\u00a0 The Roc was willing to help, for a little while, and then he wanted his little toy lawn mowers.\u00a0 As I wrestled them from the netting of his soccer goal I spied his bike, brand new and dusty sitting behind the real lawn mower.\u00a0 After I handed over the teeny, tiny toy lawn mowers to the too tall for them Roc I stepped back into the garage and pulled out his Spider-man bike.\u00a0 The big Christmas gift of 2009.\u00a0 The bike that when asked if he would like to learn to ride he has always answered, \u201cNot today, maybe another time.\u201d\u00a0 The bike that I have moved around in the garage all spring and summer, waiting for the right day.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been wondering when the right time would be to pull it out.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t want to push. I pushed the tricycle.\u00a0 I literally had to push it by the big handle in the back, but I  pushed  it too.\u00a0 Too soon, too fast, too impatient was I when I tried to teach the Roc how to peddle his first tricycle when he was 4 years old.\u00a0 I was frustrated with his level of frustration and I know that I sighed too much, and he must have felt my annoyance at his inability to master peddling, not to mention steering.\u00a0 He screamed and refused to get on the tricycle for awhile and I had to back track and take things really slow, first teaching him to steer and then trying to teach peddling, which he never quite mastered.\u00a0 So for months I have wondered what it was going to take to teach the Roc to ride his new little bike. I decided to give the tiniest of nudges, to see if today would be the \u201canother time\u201d he has spoken of for months.\u00a0 I carried the bike down our short drive and placed it on the sidewalk in front of him and casually asked him if he would like to ride it today.\u00a0 I was astounded by his enthusiasm when he said \u201cYes, I would!\u201d and tried to climb on.\u00a0 I ran for his bike helmet and inside for some scissors to release the zip tied tags, and after he donned the matching Spider-man helmet we haltingly headed off down the sidewalk.\u00a0 Back and forth down our street we crept, me coaching and encouraging, him frustrated while trying to figure out how exactly to move his feet, how to make the bike GO.\u00a0 I felt his irritation building, swirling through his chest like a geyser about to erupt, but instead of feeling riled up like I did 2 years ago, I stayed calm and let him take his time.\u00a0 Let him screech his frustration and stomp his little feet on the peddles.\u00a0 I lightly pushed the bike to keep him going, but I didn\u2019t  push . Slowly he got it.\u00a0 I watched him stare at his feet for 45 minutes and I felt him figure out when to push down on the peddles.\u00a0 I watched the slow smile start on his face as he said \u201cI\u2019m driving it now.\u00a0 I can probably do it myself.\u201d We wound through the paths in our neighborhood and he got better and better, faster and faster.\u00a0 45 minutes later, I could barely keep up with him and had to run down the trail and quickly turn around to get a shot of him coming towards me. Today turned out to be the perfect \u201canother time\u201d for the Roc.\u00a0 I now know what we will be doing tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that!

He asked me before we left GC\u2019s parents house if he could take a bath when we got home.\u00a0 He said he wanted to play with his fountain toy.\u00a0 He asked me again not 15 minutes later while on a back road near the their house.\u00a0 Staring at the clock reading 7:28 am I knew this would be another long car ride filled with repeated questions.\u00a0 He used to ask us his own version of \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d a couple years ago and came up with a new and much longer version this year.\u00a0 We had this conversations many, many, many, many times today: \u201cMommy?\u201d\u00a0 He pipes up from the back. \u201cYes Roc?\u201d I answer, ever obliging. \u201cWhat town are we in?\u201d\u00a0 He asks. Sometimes I know and other times I say, \u201cLet me see what the next sign says\u201d and then I answer \u201cDunn\u201d (or Micro, or Selma, or Colonial Heights, and one time I said \u201cCracker Barrel\u201d because it was the first sign I saw and then GC admonished me and told the Roc what town we were really in.\u00a0 I bet on the 15th time you would have fished around for an answer too!) Then he will ask, \u201cWhat comes after that?\u201d And I always answer,\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see when we get there and I can find a sign.\u201d\u00a0 (As a side note, we really should have a map in the car.\u00a0 Not only for questions like these, but also for those detours we sometimes take when we miss exits.\u00a0 But hey I got to see the Pentagon today and a glimpse of Arlington National Cemetery!\u00a0 I\u2019ve never been there before!\u00a0 Maybe next time we\u2019ll get out of the car and look around and maybe the driver won\u2019t be so revved up too.) Anyway, after my standard answer listed above the Roc\u2019s voice will go up an octave and he will screech, \u201cNO!!!\u00a0 Virgina is next!\u201d or \u201cNo!\u00a0 Maryland is usually after Virginia!\u201d and then we go on to list the order of the states and and how many we will have to traverse before arriving in Delaware (where?) It was fun at first, and I giggled at the \u201cusually\u201d in his statement about Maryland, but after awhile it\u2019s grating.

He has AUTISM! Their logic is that the problems he presents at school are for the most part behavioral and so he falls under that category.\u00a0 I was so shocked, I thought they were going to label him learning disabled, that I LAUGHED in the meeting.\u00a0 I asked the psychologist to stop and said \u201cAre you telling me that you are going to label my son, who has Autism, as Emotionally Disturbed?!!\u00a0 Are you kidding me?\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to be kidding me!!\u201d\u00a0 Then I put my face in my hands and laughed.\u00a0 My stomach was in my toes and I felt like crying but I was sitting there laughing at the injustice of it all.\u00a0 The laws in this state are so backwards.\u00a0 He isn\u2019t \u201cAutistic enough\u201d for the Delaware Autism Program so he cannot have the label of Autism, but he has Autism, and the modifications they make for him at school are because of his Autism.\u00a0 The challenging behaviors he presents both at home and at school are because of his Autism.

{"date": "January 5, 2009", "body": "We took the Roc down south to visit the in-laws for a week.\u00a0 We mistakenly called it a \u201cvacation\u201d and Autism doesn\u2019t take a vacation, actually, Autism doesn\u2019t like to go on vacation.\u00a0 The problem is that the Roc DOES like to travel, but as I\u2019ve already mentioned, his Autism doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 I may be making it sound like it was a terrible time, and it wasn\u2019t, we did have fun, and it was so wonderful to see GC\u2019s family, and man did we eat well!\u00a0 We just had a few more \u201cmoments\u201d (read: tantrumish, guttural screaming, arm-swinging, whiny, wanna rip my hair out, lots of tears episodes) than we do at home and it\u2019s so hard to deal with them away from home.\u00a0 It\u2019s also hard to deal in front of family we only see 2 times a year.\u00a0 I know they love the Roc and it\u2019s not that I\u2019m embarrassed, it\u2019s that I wish they could see him at his best, not his worst, because they only see him 2 times a year, and he really is a marvelous kid. The Roc likes things to be routine and he needs to be warned when things change and that was my first mistake.\u00a0 I should have prepared him better, what was I thinking?\u00a0 I knew that!\u00a0 I guess I got that word vacation in my head and forgot about the reality of my life, there is no such thing as vacation.\u00a0 I did talk to him about where we were going and who we were going to see and about the ocean (he was terribly afraid this summer).\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t talk enough about the house, the amount of people, the amount of space, the change in his routine, his cousins, how to share, how to ask if they wanted to play, how it might be loud when football was on the TV, the unexpected loud noises, that we may leave him with his Nonna and Nonno so we could go out alone\u2026.and many other changes to his normal life.\u00a0 All these things threw him off and suddenly everything turned into a big deal for the Roc.\u00a0 I know that he is not alone in this \u201cBig Deal\u201d phenomenon and there are many other children like him, but man I wish that it would go away sometimes, it\u2019s so frustrating!\u00a0 And he is so loud about it! Our second mistake, and it was a big one, was to let the Roc stay up three hours later than normal on New Year\u2019s Eve\u2026seriously, WHAT were we thinking?\u00a0 The Roc needs his sleep and usually goes to bed around 7-7:30 pm and we let him stay up until 10 pm and I skipped part of his bedtime routine.\u00a0 Mistake.\u00a0 Big mistake.\u00a0 I think that set the tone for the next couple days.\u00a0 He was O. F. F and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it but kick myself for changing his routine while on \u201cvacation.\u201d\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t even drinking, but I should have been!\u00a0 The Roc was miserable on the 1st and so was I.\u00a0 He threw some pretty awesome tantrums and we both cried.\u00a0 There was much of the same on the 2nd and again we both spent some time crying.\u00a0 Not what a \u201cvacation\u201d is supposed to be like! We did have fun though, and we did a few things we don\u2019t normally do when we visit South Carolina because we usually go in the summer.\u00a0 We went to Brookgreen Gardens one day and made good on our promise to see some fountains, one of the Roc\u2019s favorite things.\u00a0 You can tell that he\u2019s smiling by the big apples on his cheeks!\u00a0 The kid loves water! He even got to get up close to an alligator, and we saw a fox sleeping in a tree.\u00a0 How strange. There were some cows who mooed for us \u2013 man, they are loud! And we saw one of my favorite birds on the planet.\u00a0 An owl. We also went to the Aquarium at Broadway at the Beach one afternoon and the Roc really loved that!\u00a0 More water. He really loved the tunnel that went underwater and we went through it three times. I finally got him to stand on the moving walkway the third time through.\u00a0 I think GC\u2019s favorite were the eels as I found about 6 pictures of them on the camera when we got home! The thing the Roc was the most excited about was the ocean, which was a big change from how he felt about it in August.\u00a0 He still didn\u2019t want to go anywhere near it but he really enjoyed walking on the beach and collecting shells, as long as he wasn\u2019t too close to the waves. So we made sure to go back before we left even though the weather wasn\u2019t as nice at the end of our trip. We are home now and the Roc is happy to be back.\u00a0 He hasn\u2019t fussed, screamed, or whined at all since we\u2019ve been home.\u00a0 It will be nice to get back to our regular routine.\u00a0 I need my sanity back.\u00a0 I\u2019m so glad we went to see everyone, and we had fun, I just wish they could see him now\u2013when he\u2019s so happy and himself.\u00a0\u00a0 He was so excited to get on the school bus and I\u2019m excited to have a little time to myself again.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t button the top button on my jeans this morning so I wore a long shirt and my longest jacket down to the bus stop so I wouldn\u2019t offend the bus driver.\u00a0 I\u2019m off to run on my treadmill now.\u00a0 Gotta work off all the amazing food I stuffed down over the last week.\u00a0 I\u2019m not making any new year\u2019s resolutions other than I intend to fit back into my jeans before we go to Arizona in Feb!

We arrived in CO on Saturday, August 1st after an uneventful flight but nerve wrecking check in.\u00a0 The flight was overbooked and we didn\u2019t have seats (even though I PAID for the tickets! so aggravating!) and we waited at the gate while they started boarding the plane hoping that someone would give up their seats so we could get on.\u00a0 I was seething.\u00a0 Luckily, a few people did take the offer of free airfare and we were able to get on board though we were not seated together.\u00a0 The Roc and I were seated together of course, but GC got a seat in row 2 and the very large man next to me wouldn\u2019t switch with him because it was a window seat.\u00a0 So GC got to rest and relax for 3 hours and I got to entertain the Roc.\u00a0 Fun fun! After picking up our rental car we drove to GC\u2019s Aunt and Uncles house.\u00a0 The Roc was a bit overwhelmed after our long morning of travel and lots of waiting and so this is how he greeted his Great Aunt and Uncle. He warmed up quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before he flashed his adorable smile. We settled in, did some grocery shopping, and got Thai food for dinner (yum!). On Sunday we had a birthday party for the Roc (a day early) to celebrate his FIFTH birthday!\u00a0 He was very excited to have a little party in Colorado, with balloons, cake, his uncle Marcello, and of course presents! After he opened his presents we suited up and headed over to a nearby pool that has a big water slide and a few water features in the shallow end.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t bring my camera but the Roc had a blast and totally impressed his Great Aunt with his swimming skills. On Monday we figured we had adjusted to the altitude enough to head into the mountains so we set off for Breckenridge.\u00a0 I was so excited to get into the mountains and the Roc was very smiley in the backseat. After a VERY nerve wrecking drive up, up, up we stopped at LoveLand Pass to take some pictures.\u00a0 It was WINDY and CHILLY way up there. Then we drove on to Breckenridge.\u00a0 We walked around the town a little bit and stopped for Mexican food, which turned out to be a mistake \u2013 CORN overload for the Roc.\u00a0 He did eat a GFCF hotdog I brought in a thermos but nothing could stop him from eating ALL the corn chips at the table. While he did enjoy the chips, he ended up weepy and cranky not long after.\u00a0 After lunch I was able to pop into a shop to get the Roc a t-shirt, and then he snoockered us into buying him a very expensive jack rabbit puppet which he now calls \u201cJack.\u201d\u00a0 We had planned to go on a little hike but with a weepy Roc, some rain, and figuring out that the trail was at about 11,000 feet we decided to head back down to Denver and take it easy.\u00a0 I was feeling a bit \u201cfunny\u201d and attributed it to the altitude and thought the Roc might need to get to a lower elevation as well. We knew we had the rest of the week to get back into the mountains. More to come tomorrow:\u00a0 Rocky Mountain National Park!

GC read online that the hike around Bear Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park was an easy 0.6 miles and that there was a waterfall 1 mile away from the lake.\u00a0 We never thought about the fact that MANY other people would also opt for this easy and picturesque hike and as we drove through the park we saw a big sign that said \u201cShuttle Buses to Bear Lake.\u00a0 Parking Lot FULL\u201d Oh No.\u00a0 CRAP. The Roc would definitely NOT like being smashed on a shuttle bus with lots of strangers.\u00a0 We decided to drive on to the parking lot and see if we could luck out and get a spot.\u00a0 A park ranger stopped our car at the parking lot entrance to tell us to keep moving through so the shuttle buses could get by.\u00a0 The Roc was yelling \u201cGET OUT!\u201d from the back seat and my heart was sinking as I tried to explain that there was no parking and we had to drive back down and take a bus when we rounded the corner and a big SUV backed out of a spot!\u00a0 SCORE! We all got out and got our stuff ready.\u00a0 A shuttle bus dropped off a load of people and everyone started down the same trail.\u00a0 GC and I looked at each other as the Roc started to get agitated, anxiously looking over his shoulder, and saying in his very LOUD high pitch \u201cthere\u2019s PEOPLE here!!\u00a0 No!!\u00a0 They want to come TOO!!\u201d We glanced at Bear Lake and then started down a side trail hoping that if we got away from the mass of people the Roc would calm down a bit.\u00a0 We stopped to have a little lunch. The Roc didn\u2019t want to eat and was still agitated by the people passing by on this less crowded trail.\u00a0 I bargained with him and let him have one cookie after eating a certain amount of his lunch.\u00a0 I kept the second cookie aside and we made that cookie \u201cwhat he was working for.\u201d\u00a0 We decided against trying to hike around Bear Lake and instead started up this new trail after having a chat about being nice and saying \u201cHi\u201d instead of screeching every time someone passed us on the trail.\u00a0 Each time we saw a person or group coming down the trail I told the Roc it was his chance to practice saying \u201cHi\u201d and asked him what he was working for to which he replied \u201cmy second cookie.\u201d\u00a0 It worked and he \u201cworked for\u201d that second cookie the rest of the day! We hiked the 2 miles to Bierstadt Lake all the while GC and I had little conversations about how we would have to turn around and hike the 2 miles back to the car.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t see many people on this trail and even though we were a little worried about the Roc being able to hike back we were happy to be in such a beautiful place.\u00a0 Eventually we made it to Bierstadt Lake and stopped for a snack and took some pictures. We climbed onto the big rock in this next picture, and a young duck came up onto the rock to investigate us. We were all pretty excited about this which caused the little duck to quickly join his siblings back in the water! Before we started the hike back to Bear Lake the Roc got some tickling out of the way, and we took a family photo. The hike back went just as well as the hike in, no complaining (except for when it sprinkled-the Roc doesn\u2019t like rain falling on him-which is strange considering his water fascination). Eventually we made it back to Bear Lake and it was a little quieter so we were able to stop and take a few pictures. As we got closer to the parking lot I noticed the sign advertising that Alberta Falls was 1 mile away down a different trail.\u00a0 The Roc LOVES waterfalls and we\u2019d been telling him that he would see waterfalls in Colorado.\u00a0 We asked him if he wanted to hike more to see a waterfall and of course he said \u201cYES!\u201d (even though he\u2019d already gone 4 miles!).\u00a0 As we started down the path, and I do mean down-we were going down in elevation, GC and I looked at each other and said \u201cthis may be a bad idea!\u201d\u00a0 We went slow and eventually made it to the waterfall.\u00a0 The Roc was not as steady on his feet so we kept tight control over him when we got close to the edge. He LOVED it and seeing his excitement totally made up for the fact that after about a 1/2 mile back, just as the trail started going UP in elevation, the Roc told me \u201cmy legs don\u2019t work\u201d and I had to piggy back him to the car! He was exhausted. We were too.\u00a0 We decided we had to come back before our trip was over.

{"date": "August 12, 2009", "body": "On Wednesday Aunt Sandy and Uncle Allen took us to Red Rocks in the morning.\u00a0 It was just like I\u2019ve seen in pictures but hotter up there than I imagined.\u00a0 That Colorado sun is intense!\u00a0 Very neat to go inside and see the wall listing the different artists who\u2019ve played there through the years.\u00a0 The Roc wanted to climb down the stairs but also wanted to be piggy backed a lot so I didn\u2019t let him climb around too much, it was just too hot to carry him around.\u00a0 We did get a few nice photos up there before we headed back to the house. That afternoon we left the Roc with Aunt Sandy and Uncle Allen for a babysitting trial. We planned to go back to Rocky Mountain National Park with GC\u2019s brother Marcello the next day to tackle an 8.5 mile hike and the Roc wouldn\u2019t be able to come with us.\u00a0 We wanted to make sure he was comfortable and more importantly THEY were comfortable watching him!\u00a0 We\u2019ve only ever left him with family, and considering that we are marooned in Delaware without any family, GC and were nervous to leave him for the whole day so the trial was a good idea.\u00a0 GC and I went out to lunch and then drove around an area of Denver we were considering moving to in the future all the while wondering how it was going back at the house.\u00a0 The drive proved to us that we didn\u2019t want to live in that part of town when we move, but we were pleasantly surprised to find out that the Roc only had one minor \u201cincident\u201d and they even took him out to the grocery store proving that he was comfortable and that Aunt and Uncle are BRAVE!\u00a0 We decided to go ahead with our plans to leave him for the day \u2014 so rare for us! So on Thursday we got up early, fed the Roc breakfast, then left him behind and headed over to Marcello\u2019s bachelor pad (and it totally is: nice couch,  NICE  TV, and cool boy art all in the living room and then a bed and floor lamp in the master bedroom! too funny!)\u00a0 We drove back up to RMNP (long-legged Marcello was nice enough to let me sit in the front seat!) and got started on our LONG hike.\u00a0 GC and I made Marcello stop numerous times to take pictures.\u00a0 We were literally 5 minutes into the hike when we made him take the first photo! We calmed down for a bit after he told us that there was much more to come. We kept going up, up, and up on this hike but the scenery and Marcello\u2019s promise (he\u2019d done this particular hike before) that it would only get better kept us pushing on.\u00a0 It was really one of the most beautiful places I\u2019ve ever been and the pictures do not do the mountains justice, nor do they convey how small you feel in their presence, and how it feels to breathe that mountain air-a far cry from the thickly polluted East Coast air I normally breathe. The boys were very excited to find a patch of snow and Marcello almost got me with a snowball! Not long after the snow we arrived at the first lake of three we were hiking to.\u00a0 Absolutely gorgeous! We stopped for a snack, watched a man fishing from an inflatable boat, hiked around the rest of the lake, and ended up hiking along a stream rushing with water. We stopped to catch our breath when Marcello pointed to a waterfall in the distance and told us we would be climbing UP the right side of that waterfall to get to the two lakes beyond it!\u00a0 Yikes! I grew a little nervous as we got closer and I had a better view of the side we would be climbing. We climbed up a little farther and then stopped to catch our breath again \u2014 dang altitude makes breathing hard! We also had to stop to let a bunch of people climb down the waterfall before we started up \u2014 didn\u2019t want anyone falling on us!\u00a0 We did make it up and GC said it best when he exclaimed to Marcello that it was \u201csketchy as hell!\u201d\u00a0 Here\u2019s the view from the top.\u00a0 Can you see the tiny people on the trail?\u00a0 That will give you perspective of how HIGH up we were! Marcello was right though, it was worth the climb.\u00a0 The view was spectacular. The clouds coming over the mountains started to look threatening, and being on the top of a mountain during a thunderstorm didn\u2019t sound like a good idea so we quickly started back.\u00a0 I was already anxious about falling off the waterfall and leaving the Roc motherless, I didn\u2019t want to add being struck by lighting to my worry list!\u00a0 We got down the waterfall, which was less scary going down than it was going up, just in time for the sky to unload.\u00a0 We were significantly quieter on the return hike than going in.\u00a0 I was tired and my ankles were aching from the down hill trek as well as the monstrous blister that was forming on the inside of my ankle (which exploded when I touched it later in the car spraying me with blister juice \u2013 ack!). After taking the shuttle bus back to the car we decided to drive down Trail Ridge Road before leaving the park, again because Marcello said it was worth it, and it was even though it was cold as heck up there!! We were all exhausted and as we drove through Estes Park the sun was sinking into the west so I called Aunt Sandy and Uncle Allen to see how the day went with the Roc.\u00a0 I was so happy to hear that they had a great day together, found the PECS schedule I left very useful, and only had one \u201cminor incident\u201d this time about a pillow while he was building his \u201cnest\u201d in the TV room.\u00a0 Aunt Sandy even took the Roc to the outdoor pool with the fountains and said he behaved wonderfully there for about 2 hours and then they came back and baked GFCF brownies!\u00a0 I was thrilled to hear all this and it made the long ride back and my illegal pete\u2019s (restaurant in Boulder) chicken burrito taste better.

{"date": "August 13, 2009", "body": "We were still wiped out from our long Thursday hike on Friday so we took it easy during the day.\u00a0 GC and I took turns going out to lunch.\u00a0 I went out with Aunt Sandy while he stayed back playing with the Roc, and then he met Marcello for lunch while I stayed back at the house.\u00a0 Earlier in the week Aunt Sandy found an activity that the Roc LOVED \u2013 picking raspberries in their back yard!\u00a0 He got to do this a couple times before we left and we rarely brought any berries back inside as these photos demonstrate \u2013 notice the empty container he holds! Later that afternoon we took the Roc back to the pool with the fountains and he thoroughly enjoyed himself.\u00a0 Again, I left my camera back at the house and regretted it when I saw how empty the pool was \u2013 I could have gotten some nice photos there.\u00a0 We all went to bed early that night. On Saturday we took a tour of the \u201crich people\u201d neighborhood in the valley and then went to a nearby park to take a little walk.\u00a0 The Roc was a pretty good sport and walked a little ways down the trail and posed for a photo. We relaxed for the rest of the afternoon, still a little sore from Thursday, and took the Roc to the playground before dinner. He had good night hugs for everyone before bed. After he was tucked in bed Marcello, GC, and I went out for Thai food one last time before we had to leave to go home.\u00a0 Amazing little restaurant. On Sunday we packed up in preparation to leave, played with the poodles in the back yard, and took the Roc to the playground one last time.\u00a0 While I was finishing the packing I just had to peek back down in the basement and take a couple photos of the quilt Aunt Sandy is making GC and me (me really!). She promised us a lap quilt for our 5th wedding anniversary last year and I could never come up with a color scheme or any ideas for the quilt.\u00a0 Upon arrival in CO she showed me her quilting area in the basement and this quilt was hanging on the wall.\u00a0 I wondered who she was making it for but didn\u2019t ask, silently cursing whoever convinced her they love cats more than I do.\u00a0 Later in the week when we were discussing the quilt she would eventually make for us and what kind of design I would like she slyly told me that the \u201ccat quilt\u201d was available!\u00a0 Yippee!\u00a0 Then she told me that she started it with me in mind and wanted to see if I liked it before telling us that we (I) could have it if we wanted it!\u00a0 I\u2019m very excited to see the finished quilt. We eventually had to say our goodbyes and head to the airport.\u00a0 I was smarter this time around and checked in online and printed out our boarding passes \u2013 this I time I KNEW we had seats and that we were seated together!\u00a0 We got to the airport WAY too early and ended up walking to the end of a concourse and watching the planes take off for awhile.\u00a0 Of course the Roc didn\u2019t let go of Jack, the jack rabbit puppet he got us to buy him in Breckenridge, unless his Daddy was tickling him. He flashed his smile for the camera too. I took the opportunity of GC sitting next to me on this flight to snap a picture of the Roc in his seat before take off \u2013 I had to LEAN on him and I\u2019m pretty sure the large man I sat next to on the flight out to CO wouldn\u2019t have appreciated it.\u00a0 Not sure if GC really appreciated it, but he tolerated it.\u00a0 He is used to my constant photography.\u00a0 The Roc is too, but that doesn\u2019t mean he always allows it. The flight went well though it was slightly bumpy due to the thunderstorms we flew near.\u00a0 I watched lightening for a long while out the window while pretending to watch a movie with the Roc.\u00a0 Once the sun went down and we got close to Philly the Roc was enamored with all the lights below.\u00a0 I would have flown at night more often if I\u2019d have known that he was that easily entertained! I\u2019m so glad that we took this trip to CO.\u00a0 GC has been talking CO up to me ever since I met him in 2001, and it is a place we\u2019ve talked about moving to on more than one occasion.\u00a0 I told him I would have to see it for myself but I doubted it would be hard to sell me on the place since I grew up camping and hiking in Minnesota.\u00a0 I was right, it wasn\u2019t a hard sell!\u00a0 It is a spectacular place to be if you like the outdoors, lots of sunshine and low humidity are nice too.\u00a0 I really enjoyed visiting with GC\u2019s Aunt and Uncle, his brother, and getting out to explore a little bit of the mountains.\u00a0 It was one of those trips where I really wasn\u2019t ready to be done with it yet. Definitely a sign of a good trip.\u00a0 I hope the next time enter Colorado it will be on the interstate with all of our crap and cats in tow!

{"date": "August 23, 2009", "body": "Kindergarten starts tomorrow (yikes!) and we\u2019ve spent the last few days of summer escaping the heat and humidity at the community pool.\u00a0 The Roc is becoming quite the little fish!\u00a0 He just started to go under water for me and jump off the side of the pool.\u00a0 He can swim all the way across the pool now instead of just from person to person like he was a few weeks ago.\u00a0 Yesterday he even got over his fear of the deep end beyond the rope and started jumping in there and swimming around! I also started throwing him in the water this weekend and he got a big kick out of GC throwing him in the deep end!\u00a0 (Which is really hard to do when you can\u2019t touch the bottom of the pool.) This summer flew by and I cannot believe that the Roc is starting kindergarten tomorrow.\u00a0 I think he is well prepped for this transition, but only time will tell for sure.\u00a0 His teacher during summer school is the special ed teacher in his kindergarten room, so they got to know each other, and she loves him \u2013 of course!\u00a0 We got the busing situation worked out, he will be on a bus with just a few other students and there is an aide on the bus.\u00a0 The Roc and I have been talking about kindergarten, reading books from the library about kindergarten, and we did an individual Meet the Teacher and school tour on Wednesday, opting out of the chaos of the regular Meet the Teacher night on Thursday.\u00a0 After we\u2019d been in his new room for a few minutes he said \u201cI\u2019m excited to go here!\u201d so I think he will have fun.\u00a0 I hope he has fun.

{"date": "August 24, 2009", "body": "The Roc was bouncing off the walls with anxiety and excitement this morning before we headed down to the bus stop on his first day of kindergarten.\u00a0 We put his personal schedule together and he couldn\u2019t get through the steps to get out the door fast enough!\u00a0 He kept repeating what he saw in the classroom last Wednesday and telling me that kindergarten is \u201cjust for friends and teachers\u201d which was my response to his repeatedly asking me last week if \u201cif Mommy could go to kindergarten too?\u201d\u00a0 I tried to get the obligatory first day of school pictures in front of the front door but the Roc wasn\u2019t having it.\u00a0 I then had him stand by the tree and tried to snap a picture but he wouldn\u2019t stop moving and all I got was the back of his head.\u00a0 He just wanted to get to the bus stop.\u00a0 He was all smiles after being introduced to his new bus driver, the bus aide, and donning his harness.\u00a0 I tried to get a picture of him with that adorable grin but again, he wouldn\u2019t stop moving and wouldn\u2019t look at the camera! To make up for my lack of first day of school pictures featuring the Roc, I took one of the bus driving away.\u00a0 Oh well, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have gobs of photos of this kid! I thought I would be sad to see him go away for the whole day but I\u2019d already gotten a chance to experience that during summer school, so I was fine (aside from the worrying)!\u00a0 I went for a run, did 3 loads of laundry, cleaned the kitchen, vacuumed, cleaned off my desk, organized my photos, (I\u2019m prepping for some mini album creativity) and watched a movie.\u00a0 Before I knew it, it was time to head to the bus stop, which turns out to be across the street so I sat on my front stoop and waited for the bus to appear. The Roc was all smiles when I got on the bus to unzip him, and when I asked if he\u2019d had fun during his first day of kindergarten he enthusiastically replied \u201cYES!\u201d\u00a0 I was anxious to see if his teacher had written anything in his communication book and so I was excited to read this from her: He did GREAT!!!!\u00a0 No time out!\u00a0 He listened to directions ALL DAY!!!\u00a0 I am so impressed!\u00a0 He loved reading \u201cChicka Chicka Boom Boom!\u201d\u00a0 He did very well at lunch & recess!!\u00a0 Woo-hoo!!!! Have a great night! Woo-hoo is right!\u00a0 All day while I was doing stuff around the house I was wondering about him.\u00a0 How was he doing?\u00a0 Did he throw any tantrums?\u00a0 Was he completely overwhelmed in the new building with new kids and new teachers?\u00a0 Did he listen?\u00a0 Or did he scream?\u00a0 Did he do okay during lunch in the cafeteria?\u00a0 Did he eat what I put in his lunch box or was he too overstimulated to eat?\u00a0 Did he play on the playground?\u00a0 Or were there \u201ctoo many kids\u201d as he would say and just sit on the sidelines?\u00a0 Would he be a mess when he got home?\u00a0 Would there be a terrible note in the communication book? He was able to tell me \u201cthere were too many kids in the kitchen\u201d and I am assuming he meant the play kitchen area in the classroom because that was one of the things he kept talking about this morning.\u00a0 He also told me \u201csome kids cried, but I didn\u2019t\u201d when I asked him about his classmates.\u00a0 When I told him he would be going back tomorrow he said \u201cyay!\u201d so I am assuming he had fun.

The first photographic evidence I have of this love affair is of the baby Roc and Baby.\u00a0 \u201cWell hello there little guy\u201d the Roc seems to be saying.\u00a0 Notice that lovely bit of drool hanging down to the floor?!\u00a0 I just noticed it myself! Not long after that first photo EE or Baby was around for all sorts of things like learning how to walk, and even a little mischief! Also for those pesky Christmas card photo shoots. And for when said photo shoot goes on too long. They\u2019ve been toted all around the house. And even to my Grandma\u2019s house in Indiana.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been on more plane rides than most people! The used to go on every car ride no matter how long or short. Now they only leave the house for out-of-state trips.\u00a0 Next up \u2013 Arizona! They even toured the neighborhood with the Roc when he dressed up as an Elephant for Halloween when he was 2 years old. They\u2019ve slept in a crib. And they accompanied the Roc during the transition to his big boy bed.\u00a0 I just noticed the packing tape on the Roc\u2019s pj shorts! We used to tape his pants to his shirt at night to keep him from digging in his pull up and pulling UP his pee-pee, thus preventing pee all over the bed.\u00a0 I was so sick of washing sheets every morning that I came up with the packing tape idea.\u00a0 I called it his belt. They even used to take summer time naps on the floor. They hung out with the Roc while he recovered from a double ear infection a month after starting school this past February. They are always up for a good time as evidenced in this tickling photo taken in South Carolina this summer. They only appear in a handful of photos from 2008 but they still go to bed with the Roc every night.\u00a0 I wonder when he will give them up, or if he every will!

I started crying and was having a hard time getting myself under control.\u00a0 I haltingly tried to explain to the nurse that I was having a hard time controlling the Roc which was doubly hard to do under the scrutiny of the packed waiting room.\u00a0 She said something to the effect of \u201clittle boys will be little boys\u201d\u00a0 and her son always behaves worse than her daughter.\u00a0 But it\u2019s more than that.\u00a0 Those people looked at him like he was a bad, naughty little boy and at me like I was a total moron who couldn\u2019t control her kid.

The next day we went \u201cup north\u201d to a cabin on Lake Superior.\u00a0 Love it up there.\u00a0 The Roc loves climbing around on the rocks, and hiking. My Dad and nephew Brian took a canoe out for a ride. Later we went to Split Rock Lighthouse State Park. Then we went to Gooseberry Falls State Park. Which is always a little nerve wracking as these next 2 photos demonstrate: Back at the resort we spent each evening in the lodge\u2019s (indoor) pool and hot tub, of which I have no pictures, too busy in the water.\u00a0 I got a couple great shots of the Roc when he was all worn out after swimming. He still needed breathing treatments while we were there, but the big bathtub made up for it. On our way back down to the cities we stopped in Duluth and got to see a big ship leaving. and I finally got photographic evidence of the Roc WEARING a baseball cap.\u00a0 Rare. After our \u201ctrip within a trip\u201d was over we got to see some of my girl friends from high school and their kids.\u00a0 Melissa & Ella: Hilary with 2 of her 3 kids in the doorway to their new HUGE travel trailer: Kamie has 2 kids but is holding a kitten in this photo. The Roc enjoyed playing on their play set and pouring sand down the big slide. He finally started to play with the kids about 15 minutes before we had to leave.\u00a0 A chasing game of course. We also went to the nearby parks and saw a little waterfall, and took a walk in the woods. I also got together with an old friend and we took the Roc to Minnehaha Falls in Minneapolis. Have you noticed a waterfall theme on this trip yet?\u00a0 The Roc is slightly obsessed with all things falling, especially water. Before we left to fly back to the East Coast we spent an afternoon at my sister\u2019s house.\u00a0 The Grandparents played croquet with a couple of their grandchildren, the Roc played on the playset with his cousin, and Molly showed off her amazing dog trick. The trip went by very quickly and it was strange to be sitting in my kitchen after I got home the same day I woke up in my childhood bedroom in Minnesota.\u00a0\u00a0 The Roc had more than a few moments that made me want to tear my hair out because of his sickness, the 2 different medications he was taking, the trip within a trip, etc.\u00a0 But it was a fun trip nonetheless and I\u2019m so glad I was able to see my family and friends and all these trips are learning experiences for the Roc.\u00a0 Hopefully I\u2019ll get GC to come back \u201chome\u201d with me so he can see \u201cup north\u201d for himself.\u00a0 Maybe next year.

It\u2019s the second thing I\u2019ll do differently the next time we go to the beach, put his socks and shoes back on before we go back to the car (he won\u2019t wear sandals, don\u2019t even suggest it).\u00a0 The first thing I\u2019ll do differently is set up camp way down the beach to get away from all the people who like to sit on top of each other to be near the beach entrances.\u00a0 Seriously!\u00a0 Did you SEE all that beach in the above pictures?

Suckers: Another new little skill, completely unrelated to swimming, has developed because of swimming lessons.\u00a0 Figuring out how to eat a sucker.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t sound too hard right?\u00a0 It is hard for the Roc because he has an aversion to putting his lips on things, as in a fork or a spoon or a sucker or a straw.\u00a0 He regularly bites his applesauce off his spoon, and until just recently he couldn\u2019t figure out how to drink from a straw (I always have a plastic cup in my purse for those pesky juice boxes people always offer at parties and play dates).\u00a0 As we leave the building after swimming lessons the Roc is allowed to pick a lollipop out of the basket, and his desire to eat said lollipop has finally got the best of him and after a few months of bringing them home (and his father eating them) he figured it out (after some demonstration and verbal coaching from me) how to eat them!

I\u2019ve been trying to teach that concept to the Roc and haven\u2019t had much luck.\u00a0 I\u2019ve scheduled play dates to teach him the concept of sharing, taking turns, playing games and how to make and keep a friend but it\u2019s not sinking in.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me, or him, or the both of us but I\u2019ve been pretty frustrated during these recent play dates.\u00a0 I feel like a failure that I can\u2019t teach my kid to  play with other kids without screaming when something doesn\u2019t go exactly as he wants it to.  Things that are instinctive for other kids my kid just doesn\u2019t get. So imagine my excitement when I heard about a place that runs social skills groups!\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 Someone else can give this a try and maybe it will stick!\u00a0 A few weeks ago the Roc and I visited the facility where the Roc played in a big pirate ship ball pit, swung on the swing and did some puzzles while I talked to the therapist.\u00a0 She came across as very knowledgeable about Autism and the Roc seemed to like her.\u00a0 So even though I cringed when I saw the price, I signed him up anyway. The Roc had his first Social Skills Group this morning.\u00a0 It was 1.5 hours long and I stayed in the waiting room the whole time (I brought something to occupy myself) in case they needed me.\u00a0 I was the only parent to stay!\u00a0 I was hoping to make some new Autism Mommy friends\u2013you can never have too many of those right?!\u00a0 Oh well. So far there are only two other children in the group and two adults leading it.\u00a0 They start in a \u201csensory room\u201d where there is a big ball pit, trampoline, swing, basketball hoop and a bunch of puzzels and toys.\u00a0 Then they have circle time where they must introduce themselves and talk to their neighbors.\u00a0 Later they do a craft project, play some games, have a snack and participate in some directed free play.\u00a0 I could hear the Roc talking a lot, talking about what the other kids were doing, which we call his \u201crunning commentary,\u201d and talking about what he was doing.\u00a0 I heard him squealing when they played in the tunnels and I was happy that he seemed to be having a good time, for the most part. I also heard him scream a few times.\u00a0 He gets so easily frustrated and has some personal space issues.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been working on getting him to use his words instead of screaming and so far he\u2019s not listening to me, probably because he can\u2019t hear me over his own screams.\u00a0 He has an ear splitting, wanna rip out your hair, stick a fork in your eye scream.\u00a0 I HATE it when he screams in public, or when we have the windows open and my neighbors are outside like yesterday.\u00a0 My stomach clenches and I feel like a terrible parent (I also want to scream back at him\u2013is that normal?)\u00a0 So, I cringed this morning in the waiting room when I heard his terrible screech\u2026and then I remembered the money I forked over (actually, it was my credit card) and smiled.\u00a0 Let someone else deal with it for 1.5 hours.\u00a0 I think this social skills group is going to be really good for him.\u00a0 I really hope they can get through to him about using words instead of screams.\u00a0 And the concept of an inside voice.

That\u2019s when I really learned about our food supply.\u00a0 The way our food has changed in the past few decades.\u00a0 What Genetically Modified really means.\u00a0 Here I thought GM was something like taking a granny smith apple and crossing it with a pink lady to get a new kind of apple.\u00a0 WRONG!\u00a0 GM means plants are altered at the molecular level.\u00a0 Now we have plants that produce and release a pesticide to kill certain kinds of bugs,\u00a0 plants with terminator genes so the seeds can\u2019t be saved and replanted, plants altered to withstand the onslaught of being sprayed with Roundup, shrimp and other non-plant DNA in plants, etc.\u00a0 The lack of long term testing on the effects of GM foods.\u00a0 The way seed patents have hurt family farmers.\u00a0 The nutrition that has been lost from everyday produce.\u00a0 Not only does GM food have me worried, other things about our food do as well.\u00a0 The pesticides.\u00a0 The fertilizers.\u00a0 The concentration of animal feces in toxic waste lagoons.\u00a0 Growth hormones.\u00a0 Antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\u00a0 The 4 big corporations that control so much (and I used to work for one of them, I was a chemist at a corn milling plant.)\u00a0 Feedlots.\u00a0 Chickens that never see the light of day and are so altered that they grow and gain weight so fast that their legs cannot even support them and they fall down after taking a few steps.\u00a0 Cows that are by nature intended to graze grass, being fed not only grain their multiple stomachs cannot digest, but also blood and the meat of downer cows.\u00a0 The physiological and psychological stress the animals raised for consumption in this country endure. Michael Pollan wrote in his essay  Food with a Face :\u00a0 \u201cMore than any other institution, the American industrial animal farm offers a nightmarish glimpse of what Capitalism can look like in the absence of moral or regulatory constraint.\u00a0 Here, in these places, life itself is redefined-as protein production-and with it, suffering.\u00a0 That venerable word becomes \u2018stress,\u2019 an economic problem in search of a cost-effective solution\u2026. The industrialization-and dehumanization-of American animal farming is a relatively new, evitable, and local phenomenon: no other country raises and slaughters its food animals quite as intensively or as brutally as we do.\u201d That is what really did me in, and turned me on about turning away from the big name animal products at the local grocery store.\u00a0 The stress, the suffering, the basic going against the nature of the animal and the way farming should be.\u00a0 So we joined a Amish co-op and have been getting all of our eggs, meat, and dairy products from a fully sustainable Amish family farm.\u00a0 Yup, GC and I have been drinking raw, unpasteurized milk, (just like many of your grandparents used to drink), since August.\u00a0 I was skeptical, a little worried I would get sick, and the mire fact that I loved skim milk, but the raw milk, oh my!\u00a0 The taste, the creaminess\u2026yum is the only word I have for it.\u00a0 (I haven\u2019t gotten sick, in fact, I think my immune system may be stronger as GC and I have gone through the whole of winter without nary a sniffle, AND GC has not had to take his daily asthma medication since the summer-explain that to me!)\u00a0 GC also found an organic CSA near his work and we bought our produce there over the summer all the way into November and have been supplementing with organic produce we find at the local health food store until the CSA starts up again in the early spring.\u00a0 We cut out a lot of processed food, so we have those extra pennies to put towards fresh, organic produce.\u00a0 Anything we can buy at the grocery store down the street doesn\u2019t even come close to the taste of the fresh, locally grown, organic produce we\u2019ve been eating.\u00a0 And now we want to grow our own.

Later, the Roc\u2019s cousins went to a carnival with their grandparents so my sister, BIL, GC and I took the Roc on a pontoon ride.\u00a0 GC and Mike fished off the back of the boat, and the Roc tried hard to give me his best angry face. On Sunday the kids all had a great time on the lake. Molly did too. Guinness preferred to watch from the dock. The guys decided to take the dock out, move it over about 6 inches, and then put it back in\u2026 In the afternoon we convinced the Roc to try tubing behind the pontoon, and his cousin Marissa was nice enough to go with him. He was nervous, but ready. He said he enjoyed himself, but I cannot tell by the pictures! Marissa did! GC went for a ride, and Mike did too (a short one.) The Roc loved riding on the pontoon so much he had to draw a picture of it. Originally we said we would leave on Sunday night, thinking the Roc would be done, but because he enjoyed himself so much and did pretty well, we decided to stay Sunday night and leave early Monday morning.\u00a0 It was a great weekend!

It already seems like a long time ago.\u00a0 I waited for it to come, looked forward to it for weeks, and then it was over so quickly.\u00a0 Our time in the desert. I was a little nervous this year, the Roc has more behaviors that are hard to manage, like mouthing off for instance, than he did last year.\u00a0 I was also remembering that while our flights  to  Arizona last year were fine, our return flights to Philly were long and exhausting when he refused to watch the DVD player I brought, wouldn\u2019t watch the (free!) in-flight TV, didn\u2019t want me to read to him, didn\u2019t want to draw, and none of the snacks I packed were satisfactory.\u00a0 Long. Painful. Exhausting.\u00a0 So I was a tad nervous. I was also obsessing about getting through security this year.\u00a0 Last year the line was enormous and GC (who wasn\u2019t actually traveling with us) badgered a man into letting the Roc and I \u201cbud\u201d in front of him, then he left for work leaving me to feel the angry stares of all those behind me blister the back of my neck, and deal with the Roc who has terrible trouble waiting in line with gobs of talking, moving strangers.\u00a0 Of course, this year security was a non-issue and we breezed through no problem. We did have some interesting moments during the flights and during our layover in Dallas.\u00a0 He got the attention of a young lady at our gate\u2026and not in a good way.\u00a0 She stared daggers at us while we had a little picnic, the Roc was being a bit unruly and he did not agree with the lunch I had brought for him, very loudly.\u00a0 There were some loud moments during our flight as well and when we landed I realized that she was 2 rows behind us \u2013 she stood in the isle and wouldn\u2019t let us out, after she gave the Roc and I another nasty look.\u00a0 I was half tempted to shove my chest with it\u2019s \u201cI love someone with Autism\u201d slogan plastered across it into her face\u2026but I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I did however smile sweetly at her and then mutter a nasty name under my breath, I\u2019m such a grown up.\u00a0 To quote my husband \u201ceff her.\u201d\u00a0 I did tell my parents about her, but her looks and obvious disdain did not affect me like it would have a couple years ago.\u00a0 I guess I am growing thicker skin after all.\u00a0 I\u2019ve also learned that some people suck\u2026and that\u2019s all there is to it. The Roc was ready to hike as soon as we found my parents at baggage claim and it was a gorgeous day so after a snack at the house we took a little walk at Saguaro East National Park.\u00a0 I love leaving the deary East Coast and arriving under blue skies and sun, it\u2019s the perfect escape in the winter. The Roc immediately started following my dad, just like he did last year. On Saturday we drove up the road towards Mt. Lemon and hiked in the Coronado National Forest.\u00a0 We hiked in order again, this time with the dogs too. We had a picnic, and then hiked back, the Roc and my dad getting way ahead of my mom and I (we were gabbing.)\u00a0 They are in the middle of the next photo! On Sunday we drove downtown to go to our favorite restaurant (it\u2019s the Roc\u2019s favorite because you can sit outside in the courtyard near a fountain.) After we ate we walked to the fountains and I let the Roc climb in one that was off. On Monday we went to Sabino Canyon, the place the Roc was most excited about going.\u00a0 The place he talked about weeks before we left for Arizona.\u00a0 We rode the tram into the canyon again this year. The Roc couldn\u2019t wait to get down to the creek and climb around on the rocks. We had a picnic lunch, and the Roc complained about being too hot \u2013 this was our first year that we actually wore shorts \u2013 it was hot! check out that knife! Then we continued hiking out of the canyon and the Roc was a little disappointed that there wasn\u2019t any water flowing over the road this year. The Roc did good this year and even though he complained some during the day he hiked all the way back to the car no problem, where he wouldn\u2019t used the restroom, even though he clearly had to go. On Tuesday we went back to Saguaro East for another picnic, this time my dad grilled and the Roc was afraid the fire in the grill was going to get him. The view from our picnic spot. After we ate we went for another hike. Of course the Roc followed my dad, dragging his walking stick through the dirt, raising big clouds of dust! He posed by a huge cactus long enough for me to snap a picture.\u00a0 Seriously!\u00a0 Look at that thing! On Wednesday my parents got to witness a huge tantrum in the car on the way to the desert museum.\u00a0 35 minutes of screaming because I sat in the front seat of the truck and not in the back next to him, Grandma sat in the back with him.\u00a0 Lucky for him, they didn\u2019t seem too fazed, might have lost some hearing though!\u00a0 Lucky for me, they didn\u2019t tell me to reconsider moving out to MN. We all enjoyed the museum.\u00a0 It is interesting to visit the same places and see the difference a year makes for the Roc.\u00a0 This was the first year that he wanted to sit down and draw a picture at the little station in the cave. He was also willing to climb into this turtle shell! Some things stayed the same, like his desire to climb the rocks and be photographed. On Thursday we went to Colossal Cave Mountain Park for a picnic, a quick photo with a cowboy, then another hike \u2013 this one was about 5 miles! We saw a house that looks like a castle, and after seeing signs to watch out for cows\u2026we saw one on our drive out of the park!\u00a0 (I made my dad back up so I could take a picture with my phone!) On Friday we went to Catalina State Park for a picnic and hike (another 5 miles!) The Roc was excited to find a big rock to climb (resulting in one of my favorite photographs of the trip) and a little waterfall by a huge rock where we stopped for a snack before heading back. On Saturday rain was in the forecast, but we went to Agua Caliente Park just to get out of the house for awhile.\u00a0 It was cloudy and windy but it didn\u2019t rain. I had to pack up because we were leaving the next day.\u00a0 Our return flights this year went really well.\u00a0 The Roc drew for most of our flight to Dallas and then he was very good during our 1+ hour layover (except for when he got really upset when a couple of kids and a toddler tried to get close to him)\u00a0 He did awesome on our second flight and we broke the rules right at the end as the plane was taxing to the gate.\u00a0 The poor kid was going to pee his pants!\u00a0 The flight attendant was really nice, as she saw him coming down the isle she lifted the rope and let us get back to the bathroom. The trip was wonderful.\u00a0 It was so great to visit with my parents and for them to see the Roc.\u00a0 I love that he loves to hike and be outside and I love to see him happy.\u00a0 He had his moments during the trip, and there were times I wanted to rip my hair out, but looking back, those moments are not as sharp and in focus.\u00a0 Looking through the pictures reminds me of how he was very good most of the time, how happy he was, how he talked more than he did last year, how he gave hugs each night and patted the dogs too, and how he hiked and hiked without complaining. Until next year, with the hope the GC will join us!

{"date": "March 29, 2011", "body": "I have a secret.\u00a0 A guilty little secret.\u00a0 It\u2019s something I try to do when GC is not home, not because it\u2019s wrong per say, but because he makes fun of me if he catches me, and I\u2019ll admit, I am slightly embarrassed.\u00a0 I\u2019m hooked on a soap opera.\u00a0 Totally cliche for a stay-at-home mom, I know, but stay with me, this is autism related. The Roc, like so many people with autism, has trouble reading facial expressions.\u00a0 I truly believe that this struggle is a big part of his anxiety about people, especially strangers.\u00a0 Strangers are unpredictable anyway, add in not being able to read facial expressions, and it must be terrifying for him when strangers approach him while we are out around the town.\u00a0 Early after the diagnosis, I was told that reading facial expressions was critical and I should try to help the Roc any way I could.\u00a0 GC and I wondered, how do you go about teaching someone to read facial expressions?\u00a0 It was our first foray into the world of teaching our child the things that come naturally to others. When the Roc entered preschool we started small, drawing a simple happy and a simple frowny face, and taught him the difference.\u00a0 Not long after I bought a set of flash cards with photographs of children all making different faces on them at a teacher supply store, and I would go over them any time the Roc would let me.\u00a0 We added sad, tired, surprised, scared, and angry to the original happy/unhappy faces he learned, with the added bonus that these were photographs of people instead of drawings.\u00a0 GC and I also would make faces at him and have him guess what emotion we were trying to portray. Then during a break, while the Roc was home from school for a long, long week he watched part of a soap opera with me and was memorized by what he saw.\u00a0 I realized right away the teaching potential in the overacting.\u00a0 Technically you do not even need to have the sound on to know what is happening during a soap opera.\u00a0 I started pointing out the most easily read/identifiable emotions and after awhile the Roc chimed in.\u00a0 It became a ritual during that school break and he really got the hang of identifying the variety of emotions (during a soap opera.) The Roc is currently on another school break, and after a day of packing and playing we sat down to eat dinner together, GC had plans after work, so it was just the Roc and me.\u00a0 I decided to put my soap opera on low while we ate, figuring it would be a good way to get the gist of what happened that day.\u00a0 The Roc kept turning around to see what was happening and eventually he started asking questions. \u201cWhy is she upset?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know baby, she\u2019s upset though, I can see that, look at her face\u201d\u00a0 (she\u2019s upset because the man she just kissed is married to her sister! Yikes!) \u201cIs there a reason?\u201d \u201cYes, there is always a reason when someone is upset.\u00a0 That is a great question!\u00a0 When you see someone is upset what could you do?\u201d\u00a0 (she kissed her brother-in-law! and he asked her to have an affair!\u00a0 Eww!)\u00a0 also (HOLY CRAP, did you catch that question from the Roc?) \u201cI don\u2019t like that Mommy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like when people do that.\u201d \u201cI understand sweetie, but it\u2019s a part of life.\u00a0 You get upset right?\u00a0 Sometimes Mommy and Daddy get upset.\u00a0 Everyone feels angry sometimes.\u201d Then he changed the subject by asking the question he always asks me as soon as we start dinner, \u201cMommy, is it a dessert night?\u201d and we moved away from discussing the lady on the TV.\u00a0 But the whole exchange reminded me of where we started, how we would go over the facial expression flash cards, pointing out different emotions, to now him asking questions about the emotions, wanting to know the cause, giving me a insight to where he is and what we need to be working on next. I never thought watching a soap opera with my son would 1) ever happen, and 2) turn out to have so many teachable moments.\u00a0 It\u2019s definitely an unconventional teaching tool, not something a therapist or teacher would ever point me towards, but it has potential! (p.s. I always fast forward through the kissing scenes, and anytime girls start to fight, as inevitably one of them calls the other a bitch, not something I want the Roc to repeat.)

{"date": "September 18, 2011", "body": "I wasn\u2019t able to write and post properly this summer. No time. It was consumed with moving across the country, settling into my sister\u2019s basement, searching and buying a new (to us) home, moving out of my sister\u2019s basement into our new home, buying a car to replace my totaled Camry, and getting unpacked and settled into our new home. \u00a0The summer went fast. \u00a0Now school has started, we are getting into the swing of things, setting up a routine, and I am finally able to begin to record, reflect, and process. There are so many stories from this eventful summer. \u00a0So much change for all of us. \u00a0But life keeps surging on, and there is so much happening  right now . \u00a0I\u2019ll never be able to go back and give this summer the written words it deserves. \u00a0But I have proof in the photos. \u00a0We accomplished a lot this summer, and we had fun too. The Roc turned 7 years old in August, and we had a party to celebrate. \u00a0Complete with a water slide bouncy house, an ice cream cake, and presents, of course. *** The Roc loves water, and there is a lot of it in Minnesota. \u00a0We didn\u2019t get \u201cup north\u201d like I had hoped we would, but I did take the Roc to see water \u201cfalling\u201d over a few dams in the area. *** My Mom and I took the Roc and his cousins up to St. Cloud one afternoon for a picnic, to see another dam, some fountains and flowers, and to swing in the garden. *** Even though we didn\u2019t get the chance to take the Roc to see the waterfalls along the north shore, he was thrilled when my Mom and I took him down to Minneapolis to see Minnehaha falls. *** We were invited back to my sister\u2019s inlaws cabin in August. \u00a0There was beautiful scenery to capture and contemplate. All the kids liked to get out on the water. The Roc especially liked riding in the back of the pontoon where he could watch the wake of motor. Jumping off the pontoon in the middle of the lake, where it wasn\u2019t weedy made for some great photos, and after watching his cousins swim in the lake long enough, the Roc was willing to brave the chance of weeds. Despite\u00a0his life jacket, the  dog  never did take to the water. \u00a0There was a lot of fishing, of which I never could quite get a shot of GC holding up a catch. We ended our weekend at the cabin tubing, where my sister caught some of my favorite photos of my husband. *** Labor Day weekend we took the little boys (the Roc and one of his cousins) to a historic farm to take a tour and see the threshing demonstrations. (GC was up in BWCA for the weekend.) \u00a0The boys had a great time seeing all the animals, old farm equipment, and doing some of the hands on stuff. *** Looking back at the photos this weekend I realize just how much we actually did this summer. \u00a0So much change, all for the good, but it wasn\u2019t easy. \u00a0I\u2019d be lying if I posted all these photographs of fun and happiness and not mention that I chose to capture the light, the good, the positive. \u00a0I didn\u2019t photograph the hard parts, the times when the Roc was out-of-control, when his verbal stims nearly sent me over the edge, and how when his behavior plummeted it was all I could do to get through the day. \u00a0I didn\u2019t record the times I cried, out of frustration, fear, and anxiety. \u00a0I didn\u2019t record the way it felt to watch the Roc struggle to connect with his cousins and to see the neighbor children recoil when the Roc had a meltdown outside. \u00a0I felt like I may come apart at the end of the summer. \u00a0I said more than once that I was hanging on by my fingernails by the end of August. But now, having a chance to look back, I\u2019m so glad that I did photograph all the good and the positive. \u00a0Because even though we have our hard times, the good times are what I want to remember, and are what I hope the Roc remembers when he looks back on the summer we moved to Minnesota.

{"date": "September 19, 2011", "body": "The Roc started 1st grade two weeks ago, and again I did a little hop as I closed the door on another summer. \u00a0It may sound callous, mean spirited, or even that I am not a very good mother to want my son to go back to school, for us to have some time apart\u2026but it\u2019s the truth. \u00a0There it is, and I\u2019m willing to own that truth. So much so that I had to giggle at all the facebook statuses I saw leading up to the first day of school. \u00a0Back in Delaware school starts earlier than here in Minnesota, so I was seeing some of my mom friends writing about shedding a few tears as the the bus pulled away, or even how a few of them followed said bus to school and then cried the whole way home. \u00a0I read through some of the comments left on one mom\u2019s status, \u201cAw, sending you love\u2026 It\u2019s hard, I was there last year. Big hugs.\u201d \u201cAw, you\u2019re such a great mom. I still tear up too no matter what age the kids get.\u201d \u201d The 1rst & the last were the absolute hardest for me..but I cried with every one.\u201d \u201d I sobbed as my baby girl left too\u2026it goes by so fast!!!\u201d \u201d \u200e:-( I feel your pain\u2026hang in there mama!!\u201d \u201cI did the same thing with my youngest\u2026cried all day!\u201d and I had to leave a comment of my own, which apparently resonated with no one on her friends list, \u201d I guess I\u2019m in the minority. I did a happy jig when Roc went to K! Lol. (but he rode the bus to prek so that\u2019s when I was a twisted up.)\u201d In\u00a0actuality\u00a0I was all twisted up when I left him in his special ed preschool class for the first time when he was 3.5 years old, not when he eventually rode the bus to preschool later that same year. \u00a0I cried so hard I could hardly see the parking lot and get to my car. \u00a0I did cry the whole way home that day. \u00a0But not because my baby was going to school, but because he was going to a special preschool because he has autism. \u00a0I worked and worked to get him evaluated and into school where he would get some help as soon as I figured out he was on the spectrum. \u00a0When I finally dropped him off for his first 2.5 hours of special preschool I felt shredded. \u00a0No one but a special needs parent really knows how that feels. So I welcomed the start of school with joy this year. \u00a0We had such an eventful summer, so full of big life changes that we needed to get some balance back. \u00a0Because we need our routine. \u00a0He needs his routine. \u00a0And he needs his services to start back up, speech, occupational therapy, friendship group, and social skills group. \u00a0He needs to be around other children. \u00a0He needs more people working with him, challenging him, to keep him stretching and growing. I was also looking forward to seeing how this first year would play out at this new school, with all new (to us) teachers and administrators. \u00a0I worked hard to get a good program set up for the Roc in Delaware and so I was nervous going to our first official IEP meeting a week before school started here in Minnesota. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely that meeting went, we still tape recorded it, I still wore my IEP outfit, I still came with my big binders of information about the Roc, and my notebook of questions, concerns, and points that were really important to me, but it went better than I had anticipated. They didn\u2019t try to remove any of the services we had upp\u2019d in Delaware and the special ed teacher had already worked in a \u201cmotor break\u201d for the Roc that would happen each day after he\u2019d been in school 2 hours. \u00a0The social skills group would actually be a social skills group in this school as opposed to just the Roc and the school social worker, as it was in Delaware last year, because he was the only one who had the educational label of autism in his kindergarten center, therefore he was the only one eligible for the social skills group. \u00a0The friendship group is something separate from the social skills group, and again, new to us this year. \u00a0When I raised concerns about how chaotic recess and lunch would be for the Roc, they had a suggestion right away \u2013 that the Roc would get to leave recess a few minutes early, head into the cafeteria with a couple other children, find his lunch bag, and get started at his table. \u00a0Again, before lunch is over, the Roc is allowed to leave a few minutes early with a few other children (who presumably cannot handle the chaos of the whole 1st grade leaving lunch at.the.same.time) and head to a story time. \u00a0I was impressed by all the teachers who will be working with the Roc and how excited they were to get him this year. \u00a0We left the meeting feeling cautiously optimistic. The Roc and I skipped the craziness that is open house and instead went to the school at an alternate time so he could see his locker, his classroom, put his stuff in his desk, and meet all of his new teachers and therapists. \u00a0He was able to tell them that he would be anxious on the first day and articulate that he was worried he wouldn\u2019t know where his classroom was. \u00a0The special ed teacher immediately came up with a solution and made him a tag that said his name, grade, and teacher, and we put it on his backpack so if he was lost and tongue-tied, he would be pointed in the right direction. \u00a0The Roc was able to see exactly where the van would drop him off and where he was supposed to go from there. \u00a0The teacher also printed out a sheet with all of his teachers and therapists pictures and names on it and we went over that in the days leading up to the first day. When the big day finally arrived the Roc was excited, and he got out of bed willingly to get ready. \u00a0He was bathed and fed with time to spare and so we waited by the front door with the sheet of teacher photographs right beside him. After he had been waiting for a little while, his anxiety got the best of him and he got really silly on the front stoop, jumping, waving his arms around, and letting out some\u00a0repetitive\u00a0yells. He did pose for one more photo before the van came. And when the van drove out of sight I exhaled into our foyer and grabbed the leash, ready to take the dog for a nice long walk, alone. About and hour later I got an email from the special ed teacher, complete with a couple photographs of the Roc in school. \u00a0He was doing fine, following directions, still smiling. I relaxed. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_6329.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_6330.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_6335.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_6339.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/1st-day-of-1st-grade/", "title": "1st Day of 1st\u00a0Grade"},

I did not cry when I told her about the pain, the blood. \u2026 \u2026 Tears pricked my eyes as she rolled the wand across my belly. As the screen lit up with my empty uterus, I cried. Cold tears seeped from my eyes and slid down into my ears. There was no heartbeat to be found. And I cried.

{"date": "September 23, 2011", "body": "I didn\u2019t feel well on Saturday morning. \u00a0I just wanted to lie in bed, cozy warm under the striped duvet, my hand pressed into the pain that had started in my lower abdomen the night before. \u00a0I could see the gray sky peeking through the curtains as the Roc padded into our room, his steps muffled by the carpet. \u00a0It felt like a good morning to stay in bed, and I rarely do. \u00a0I am usually up on the weekends. \u00a0Dog out, cats fed, water obsessed boy in the bathtub. \u00a0Not on Saturday. The Roc climbed into our bed. \u00a0A wiggly, giggly mess of arms and legs, wild hair and stale morning breath. \u00a0I tickled him and he rolled around, rocking our old\u00a0mattress\u00a0and causing GC to wake up, and then leave the room for the office and his computer. \u00a0The Roc eventually asked to take a bath, and I told him to ask his Daddy to set him up with a breathing treatment first, and then when that was through I convinced him to go ask his father for some medicine for his stuffy nose. \u00a0I had decided that I wasn\u2019t moving from that bed. \u00a0How very lazy of me. Seeing the pattern forming GC told the Roc he would start his bath for him and followed him as he reentered the master bedroom. \u00a0But the Roc did not like that. \u00a0The nebulizer, the cold medicine, the bath\u2013those are all things that Mommy usually does, automatically. \u201cNoooooo!!!!!\u201d the Roc shrieked. \u00a0\u201cI want Mommy to do  IT! \u201d \u201cRoc, I\u2019m turning on the water. \u00a0If you want a bath, here\u2019s your chance,\u201d GC told him. The Roc began to unravel. \u00a0I stayed in the same\u00a0position, watching the Roc\u2019s reflection hop up and down with frustration in the closet door mirror, hands balled up into fists, arms straight and stiff. \u00a0GC tried to reason with him, but he wouldn\u2019t have it. \u201cIt makes no difference who turns on the water Roc. \u00a0This is\u00a0ridiculous,\u201d \u00a0GC told him as he got up from his knees. \u201cNo! \u00a0Mommy does it better! \u00a0Leave the bathroom Daddy! \u00a0LEAVE!!\u201d \u201cLet me know when you are ready to take a bath Roc,\u201d GC told him as he left the room, heading back to the office. \u201cMOMMY!! \u00a0Get UP! \u00a0Get out of your bed right now!\u201d the Roc wailed as he rushed to the bed. I laid perfectly still. \u00a0Not feeling well gave me pause and a good reason to wait him out. The Roc was mad. \u00a0I swear steam could have seeped from his nostrils and I would not have been surprised. \u00a0He yanked the pillow out from under my head, ripped off the comforter, then sheet underneath, pulled on my arm telling me, \u201cI\u2019m going to pull you off the bed so you have to get up and turn the water on!\u201d I stayed still and quiet. \u00a0The Roc ran from the room and came back with a big cardboard block. \u201cI\u2019m going to push you off the bed now!\u201d \u00a0he growled at me, poking my arm lightly with the block. I remained on my side, quiet and calm, my bare feet cold and exposed. Eventually after much exclamation, the Roc got the sheet, climbed back up on the bed and attempted to cover me up. \u00a0He put a pillow behind me and commanded me to put my head on it. \u00a0I thanked him for giving me a pillow for my head. \u00a0He struggled to get the heavy comforter back on the bed. \u00a0He screamed at me to help him. \u00a0I quietly told him to ask his father. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said and ran from the room to interrupt his father, again. \u00a0I giggled to myself as I heard GC\u2019s heavy footsteps betraying his annoyance as he entered the room. \u00a0He threw the comforter on the bed and left. The Roc struggled to right the heavy duvet and I helped him before telling him, \u201cCome up and cuddle with me Roc. \u00a0Let\u2019s talk about our feelings.\u201d \u201cI wanted YOU to turn on the water,\u201d \u00a0he started to loudly whine as he slid under the cover and laid his head on the pillow next to mine, \u201cYou are the one who always does it.\u201d \u201cI know, I usually do. \u00a0But it\u2019s okay for things to change. \u00a0It\u2019s okay for Daddy to turn on the water too. \u00a0Things can be different. \u00a0Things change. \u00a0It\u2019s a part of life.\u201d \u201cBut Daddy has never turned on the water in that bathtub before.\u201d Ahhhh , I think to myself. \u00a0The heart of so many of our issues, I already knew this. \u00a0His need for routine, his need for things to be the same. \u00a0How hard even the smallest changes in our routine are for him. \u00a0I need to remember to talk about this more, to validate how he is feeling, to help him grow in this way. \u201cI know. \u00a0It\u2019s hard when things change. \u00a0But it happens. \u00a0You cannot keep everything the same. \u00a0You can only control how you react to the changes. \u00a0I know it\u2019s hard and it\u2019s unexpected.\u201d \u201cI was trying to get you to turn on the water.\u201d \u201cIs that why you took my pillow and blankets away?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he sniffled. \u201cDid it work?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said as his eyes filled up with tears. \u00a0\u201cI feel bad that I tried to push you off the bed.\u201d \u201cI understand that you were angry and frustrated. \u00a0Let\u2019s think of a different way to react when something changes unexpectedly. \u00a0What could you do instead of screaming and pushing?\u201d He stared at me for a beat before I said, \u201cHow about next time you tell me how you are feeling just like you are right now? \u00a0Isn\u2019t this so much better?\u201d \u201cYes, I feel better now that I talked to you Mommy.\u201d \u201cGood, I do too. \u00a0This is much better than screaming. \u00a0I\u2019m so glad you told me how you felt.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to ask Daddy to turn on the water now,\u201d the Roc said hoping off the bed. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you want to say to me Roc?\u201d \u201cNo\u2026.\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mommy. \u00a0I\u201dm sorry I was mean to you.\u201d \u201cThank you Roc. \u00a0That makes me feel good. \u00a0You did the right thing apologizing to me.\u201d \u201cDude you ready for a bath?\u201d \u00a0GC asked him as he entered the room. \u201cYES!\u201d As I listen to the Roc chattering on about waterfalls and commanding his father to watch him make waterfalls I exhale and look up at the ceiling. Lately I feel myself slipping into frustration so quickly, not the most effective way to deal with the Roc when he\u2019s having a hard time. \u00a0I need to remember that all behavior is a form of communication. \u00a0What is he trying to tell me? \u00a0What am I missing in each situation? I know I need to be quiet and calm more often. \u00a0I need to wait and be\u00a0patient. \u00a0Not feeling well forced me to wait him out on Saturday. \u00a0I didn\u2019t have the energy to get up and just go run the damn water, like I would have any other day. \u00a0Dealing with my own pain, I waited. And while waiting I saw and focused on the progress. He is learning to correctly identify and express his emotions. \u00a0His outburst wasn\u2019t as long as it had been in the past. \u00a0He expressed remorse for being unkind. \u00a0He was able to see and articulate that the choice he made did not work for him. \u00a0He told me what he felt. \u00a0He apologized. \u00a0He was able to get over it and let go. Progress. I need to focus on the progress.

{"date": "May 5, 2011", "body": "Tears glittered on my eyelashes as I stepped out the door for a run with Guinness this morning.\u00a0 I could see them clumping my lashes together as I gazed at the blue sky, the puffy white clouds, the beauty of a bird taking flight from the pond.\u00a0 I wondered how long they would stay and if I would notice when they were gone, dried up, freeing my lashes to expand to their single status once more.\u00a0 I watched those tears as I replayed the morning in my mind, my angst huffing out in short breaths, my emotions roiling in my belly, my feet slapping the pavement. I cried this morning.\u00a0 I cried while the Roc raged in the corner, slamming his hands on the walls, screaming out his frustration.\u00a0 I cried after he hit me, with an open palm on my side, hard enough to sting.\u00a0 I cried as he screamed, \u201cI don\u2019t like you Mommy!\u00a0 I want a new Mommy!\u00a0 You\u2019re not a good Mommy\u201d over and over.\u00a0 Cold tears slipped down my cheeks as I averted my face from him, stretched out my arm so he could see that I was resetting the timer.\u00a0 The timer counting down the minutes of \u201ctime out.\u201d\u00a0 I reset it and reset it and reset it. Finally, finally he was quiet for the determined amount of time, but still my tears were present, filling my eyes and seeping from the corners as I knelt down to help him with his coat.\u00a0 The bus was coming.\u00a0 I felt sick to stomach and so very tired. \u201cWhat\u2019s around your eyes Mommy?\u00a0 I don\u2019t like when your face looks like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m crying because I am sad baby, people cry when they are sad.\u00a0 Do you know why I am sad?\u201d I asked him.\u00a0 \u201cBecause you hit me Roc, and it hurt.\u00a0 It hurt and it hurt my feelings that you were being mean and saying mean things to me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mommy,\u201d he said while reaching down to give me a hug.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you upset.\u00a0 I made Mommy upset Daddy,\u201d he told GC as he came down the stairs. I shepherded the Roc out the door as the bus rounded the corner while wiping the tears off my face.\u00a0 I plastered on a smile and gave him a hug and a kiss and watched his now familiar routine of turning back two times to wave bye and then repeat my \u201chave a good day!\u201d Inside I leaned heavily against the door to close it and met GC\u2019s eyes.\u00a0 \u201cWell, that was fun eh?\u201d I said.\u00a0 The tears fell again as I stuttered out how I normally do not cry, but standing there, feeling the brunt of his slap, hearing his words and all the anger directed at me caused me to have a flash of fear about the future.\u00a0 \u201cWhat if in 10 years from now, he is still hitting?\u201d\u00a0 I said.\u00a0 \u201cWhat if my 16 year old son gets mad at me and punches me?\u00a0 What do we do then?\u201d I closed my eyes and tried to close  that  door.\u00a0 The door behind which is the Roc\u2019s future.\u00a0 The future no one can forsee, but some say \u201cnever.\u201d\u00a0 Never get married, never hold down a job, never live independently, never, not going to.\u00a0 I hate the nevers.\u00a0 No one should say never about a child. \u201cEveryone deals with this in their own way, and I\u2019ve dealt with it.\u00a0 If it doesn\u2019t happen\u2026that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 He\u2019ll be okay.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be okay,\u201d\u00a0 GC tells me, \u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with it Kim.\u201d I haven\u2019t.

{"date": "May 8, 2011", "body": "So Thursday morning was really hard.\u00a0 Hard enough that I couldn\u2019t get it out of my mind and had to write (while GC cooked dinner no less) about it even though I originally planned to document the school field trip the Roc (and I!) went on.\u00a0 This autism ride is a roller coaster people.\u00a0 Up and down, up and down, the highs of highs, and then 2 seconds later the bottom drops out, quite literally. So I am back tracking, because Tuesday\u2019s field trip needs to be recorded, for me, for the Roc, for those of you signing the field trip permission slips with wishes of participating, but knowing it\u2019s not your time yet, your presence alters the already altered routine of the school day, and it\u2019s just too much.\u00a0 Because that is how it was for me.\u00a0 Inappropriate behaviors, acting out, not listening, the dreaded hand obsession, all of it would be present if I appeared on a field trip, and it sucked.\u00a0 So I waited, I signed the slips and I stayed home, until Tuesday. The Roc\u2019s teacher had emailed me after the permission slip came home to see if I wanted to be a chaperon, and the Roc expressed a clear desire to have me accompany him, so I said yes. I still sent him to school on the bus, keeping that routine in place, and I arrived at the school after he had unpacked his backpack and was standing in line waiting to answer the question of the day.\u00a0 I still feel a surge of happiness to see him in the classroom.\u00a0 To see him amongst the other children, following the directions, going about his business just like any other kid.\u00a0 After he answered the question of the day with some help from the spec ed teacher (the question being did someone put sunscreen on you?\u00a0 Nope, I didn\u2019t, and yes, he answered it correctly!) he turned to go to his table and saw me standing there.\u00a0 He smiled but instead of coming to me like I thought he would he did what he was supposed to, got his paper, sat in his seat, and set about coloring the train on the page. When it was time to get on the bus the Roc was happy to sit with me, as he had requested. We rode together peacefully, and he even dealt with the small stop we had to make when one of the buses had a door malfunction and all the children on that bus had to be dispersed throughout the other 3 buses.\u00a0 Once at the train station the Roc followed directions and took a class photo and then it was time to board the train!\u00a0 All the kids got a little scavenger hunt worksheet and he started right away. The train ride was peaceful, and while he didn\u2019t talk to the other two little boys in our group, it was wonderful to hear him sound out words as he worked on the worksheet.\u00a0 After our train ride we had lunch and then because there was ample time, his teachers called the class over to play duck, duck, goose, and I stayed behind at the picnic table watching.\u00a0 Another mother sat across from me, and as I watched my boy sit in the circle, waiting to be picked, watching the other children run with a smile on his face, I so wanted to grab her and say, \u201cCan you believe that!\u00a0 LOOK at him!\u00a0 He\u2019s playing the game, he understands, he\u2019s participating!\u00a0 Holy smokes!\u00a0 This is what I pinned my hopes on 3 years ago.\u00a0 Kindergarten!\u00a0 Do you have any idea how THRILLED I am right now?\u201d\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I knew from when we introduced ourselves in the morning that she was a kindergarten teacher, so I wasn\u2019t surprised when she asked me, \u201cSo what do you do?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a stay at home mom,\u201d I replied. \u201cOh, how old are your other kids?\u00a0 How many do you have?\u201d she asked eagerly, ready to talk the talk of motherhood. \u201cIt\u2019s just him.\u00a0 I only have him,\u201d I responded.\u00a0 She stared at me blankly for a few seconds, and I could see the thought turning in her mind,  what do you do all day? \u00a0 I rarely explain that I have a college degree, that I worked for a large corporation as a chemist, and then as an environmental consultant.\u00a0 None of that really matters anymore. What do I do all day?\u00a0 You have no idea lady!\u00a0 Autism lives at my house, and it\u2019s a full time job.\u00a0 I left it alone, I didn\u2019t feel like explaining, there were too many words to be said in the short amount I had before the game would be over, and I wanted to soak in my excitement over duck, duck, goose while I had the chance. The children had been playing for a while by now, and my stomach was sinking a little as I watched and watched and the Roc wasn\u2019t picked.\u00a0 I got up to snap a picture with my phone, even if he didn\u2019t get picked, it was wonderful to see him so engaged, so present, a part of the class\u2026and then he was picked! and I wanted to dance around as he chased the little boy and then did his part to pick the next \u201cgoose.\u201d Not long after it was time to get back on the bus.\u00a0 The Roc hugged me a few times while we rode back to his school and my heart melted.\u00a0 Even though I could have signed him out and taken him home, I let him finish out the day at school, leaving another routine in tact.\u00a0 I smiled as I walked to my car, no matter what the rest of the day would look like, the field trip had been a smashing success. It was a wonderful day. A day worth recording.

{"date": "May 23, 2011", "body": "Our house is in shambles right now.\u00a0 We are moving across the country in 2 weeks.\u00a0 2 WEEKS, my stomach flips over whenever I think about it.\u00a0 As I was mindlessly scrolling through Perez Hilton (shut up) last night I thought about my wedding video, it\u2019s location to be exact.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t seen it\u2019s white box in a long, long time.\u00a0 I mentally searched through the all the boxes I\u2019ve packed and couldn\u2019t come up with it.\u00a0 The entertainment center has been packed and dismantled, the storage closet is almost packed, my office area is packed (minus my computer of course.)\u00a0 I came out onto the landing and asked GC if he knew where it was (dumb question to ask the man who cannot find things on a regular basis, sorry babe.)\u00a0 Of course, he had no idea.\u00a0 My face dropped and I felt sad.\u00a0 GC didn\u2019t understand why I would feel that way, we only suffered through viewing it with his family after we got back, as we were married in St. Lucia and only my parents were physically present at our wedding.\u00a0 His question was \u201cIf you haven\u2019t wanted to watch it all these years, does it really matter?\u201d\u00a0 Well\u2026no, I do have pictures, but I wanted to show it to the Roc one day, and it\u2019s sweet to hear the tears in GC\u2019s voice as he says his vows, and to see us dance with the ocean in the background.\u00a0 Then GC said, \u201cWhat makes me sad is all the time that went by that we didn\u2019t video the Roc.\u201d True. We bought a video camera when I was pregnant and used it sporadically until the Roc was about 2.5 years old.\u00a0 Then it stopped working and we didn\u2019t get it fixed and don\u2019t have any video of the time he was 2.5 to more recently when we started recording him with our iphones.\u00a0 I always feel a bit sad when I realize this too.\u00a0 \u201cDid you pack the video camera?\u201d he asked me, \u201cgo get it, let\u2019s watch what we have of him as an infant.\u201d And so we sat down at 10 pm last night to watch the Roc as in infant, something we hadn\u2019t done since he was diagnosed with autism, and I watched with new eyes.\u00a0 Eyes full of questions, eyes with knowledge I didn\u2019t have 6 years ago.\u00a0 Was it there all ready?\u00a0 Did he have autism from the start?\u00a0 Was I going to see the signs I knew I missed back then?\u00a0 While watching GC and would turn to each other and comment on these snatches of frozen time.\u00a0 The Roc on his first day home from the hospital, after spending 5 days in the NICU with a last minute transfer to the children\u2019s hospital.\u00a0 Sleeping in my arms, the camera turning off when he started to cry.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t believe how dark my hair was, or how much hair he had when he was born, or my boobs!\u00a0 Holy Moly!\u00a0 Then the Roc in his swing, the Roc in his bouncy chair.\u00a0 The Roc not looking at us, memorized by the dangling toys on the bouncer.\u00a0 Me wondering out loud if he should have been more engaged with us at 2 months, 3 months, 4 months.\u00a0 Remembering how my MIL commented that she had never seen a baby fight sleep like mine did, or how he was staring at the light coming through the mini blinds, making flickering patterns on the wall and ceiling.\u00a0 How cute he was in his exersaucer, how he laughed and threw his head back when GC stuck his finger up through a hole where a toy should have been.\u00a0 How the Roc squealed each time the finger appeared, but didn\u2019t connect it to GC, and didn\u2019t look at him when he stopped.\u00a0 Should he have?\u00a0 I still don\u2019t know for sure\u2026but probably. We got to his first Christmas and marveled at the scenes with his cousin, a year and a half at that time, spending Christmas at our house.\u00a0 He was engaged, looked when you said his name, opened his presents, tried to talk\u2026and I knew that the Roc didn\u2019t do that the next year when he was a year and a half at Christmas.\u00a0 While watching his cousin we wondered a loud if we would see the Roc look when we called his name, if he would be engaged, I knew he didn\u2019t open his presents when he was a year and a half, I slightly dreaded those scenes I knew were coming. We watched snippets of his first spoonfuls of solid food, bath time (GC careful that no private parts made it into the video,) the Roc figuring out how to crawl \u2013 his motivation being the 2 kittens we had found the week before.\u00a0 He watched those cats all the time, I had forgotten about that.\u00a0 I was lucky to have the camera out when he started to walk.\u00a0 I knew it was coming, he was taking a few steps and sitting down.\u00a0 Watching the video I saw what I had forgotten, that day when he walked across the whole room, maneuvered around a laundry basket\u2013he was again following a cat.\u00a0 I also saw him happy, smiley, and he did turn to us when we called his name.\u00a0 \u201cSee that?\u201d GC and I said in unison as one of us called the Roc and he looked at the camera.\u00a0 GC and I watched him giggle and squeal as I pushed him in a baby swing at the park.\u00a0 We remembered how that\u2019s all he wanted to do and how he started to label things around that time, when he turned one.\u00a0 We heard his little voice on the video say \u201cdoggy\u201d and heard our past selves exclaim that \u201cyes, a doggy!\u201d\u00a0 We watched his first experience in the little blow up pool, how he repeatedly kicked and kicked and kicked his legs splashing the water.\u00a0 We commented on the serious look he so often had, and gosh he was a chub, all rolls and pudge, so cute. We got to the Christmas when he was one and a half, watched how I prompted him to open his present, his detachment from the process, he disinterest in the toy.\u00a0 We saw how he laughed and squealed in delight as he swiped his favorite stuffed elephant into the Christmas tree, over and over and over again.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t care about the gifts or the toys, but he loved the way that tree shook and the noise the elephant made when he hit the tree with it.\u00a0 It was such a stark contrast to the scenes of his cousin exactly a year before.\u00a0 I watched my blissfully ignorant self and wondered what I could have changed for the Roc had I known then what I know now. Fast forward to the spring when he was around 20 months old and we watched my past self ask the Roc, \u201cdo you want to water the flowers?\u201d and heard his little voice \u201cwahhr flower, wahr flower, wahr flower\u201d as he waited for me to give him the hose.\u00a0 He immediately grew impatient and started saying the then familiar phrase \u201chooooold eeet, hooooold eeet, hoooooold eet!!!\u201d after I asked him, \u201cdo you want to hold it?\u201d\u00a0 GC and I remembered how he loved to water the flowers, he would water them, the grass, the bushes and the air, we had to jump out of the way when he had the sprayer.\u00a0 We exclaimed at our then puny tree and compared it with the monster it has turned into out front.\u00a0 We watched me direct the Roc and him follow my command before doing exactly what he wanted.\u00a0 We remembered the echoalia, something we didn\u2019t understand then. I remembered the solo trip to took to Indiana for my grandmothers birthday party that summer the Roc turned 2.\u00a0 How the Roc would freak out if I tried to take him in the house where all the people were.\u00a0 How he didn\u2019t even want to be under the covered porch and preferred to be out on the wet grass in the drizzling rain pushing a toy lawn mover back and forth across the yard all alone.\u00a0 How loudly he screeched when I tried to get him to come inside.\u00a0 The cold anger I felt in the pit of my stomach when my young cousin laughed at him, I was upset and didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 How I cried in a back room of my aunts house when they kept trying to get me to bring the Roc out to join in the prayer and to sing to my grandma.\u00a0 I eventually took him back to my grandma\u2019s house alone and read him books in my grandfathers lazy boy chair, marveling at how he relaxed into me now that we were away from the party.\u00a0 What I wouldn\u2019t give to go back and tell my younger self that it wasn\u2019t my fault, I was doing a good job, I was a good mother.\u00a0 Because on that day, in front of my extended family, I felt like a failure. The final scenes we had video taped were of Christmas when the Roc was 2.5 years old.\u00a0 Again I prompt him to open his presents, and I do it for him while he sits by me drinking from a sippy cup.\u00a0 The morning was filmed on a tripod and so we fast forward and watch as the Roc keeps his back or side to my in-laws and Grammy, all three lined up on our only couch.\u00a0 He moves closer and closer to me until he eventually turns himself around and backs onto my lap.\u00a0 We stopped the tape and looked at the clock. Midnight. We wished out loud that we had more.\u00a0 I would love to see video of the Roc at 3 and 4, after he started preschool and the language started to change and progress.\u00a0 I cannot remember exactly when he stopped calling himself \u201cyou,\u201d and when he started to answer my questions.\u00a0 When exactly did he ask questions of his own?\u00a0 When did he stop telling me lines from Little Einsteins as a way of communicating? One thing is for sure.\u00a0 The Roc\u2019s personality was there from the beginning.\u00a0 He has always been who he is meant to be. Autism or not. Man do I love that boy.

A year later, in September 2009, he rode in the Special Olympics Horse Show and loved it. Last June he rode in the Horse show at The Center, where he took lessons. He remembered last night that he won 2 red ribbons and 1 blue. My Mom got to see him ride in September when she came for a visit. She commented on how much he had changed while riding, and it\u2019s true, he grew a lot in the last couple years, and in more ways then just the physical.\u00a0 I remember when he first started, how little he talked, how he was afraid of trotting, and there was a period of time when I had to stay inside the lounge because he wouldn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d if he could see me and get my attention.\u00a0 Sometimes we had trouble transitioning from school to home to horseback riding, but if I asked him if he wanted to stop lessons he would shout, \u201cNO!\u201d I watched him through the lens of my camera last night.\u00a0 Noticing how he talked so much more to Ms. Becca, I could hear him asking her questions while they walked out of the barn and let the horse get a drink. He was happy to be there, happy to get to ride, and even happier that he was going to go on a trail ride.\u00a0 His favorite. At the end of his lesson the Roc gave his horse Flo a big hug, and then I think Flo wanted to nibble that leaf he was holding! I will always be grateful to wonderful people like Ms. Becca.\u00a0 She was awesome with the Roc, she knew how to handle him, she was calm and positive, and he worked for her.\u00a0 We will miss her.

{"date": "June 24, 2011", "body": "We made it.\u00a0 We are in Minnesota.\u00a0 We have been here for 2.5 weeks now.\u00a0 I had great plans of posting about the time leading up to our departure.\u00a0 I have a post in my draft box about our townhouse titled \u201cThis House\u201d that I cannot pick up now.\u00a0 It will languish there for eternity, or for a year until I go through and delete those posts that are no longer relevant.\u00a0 I had good intentions and I really wanted to record all the craziness before we moved\u2026but I was too busy. I meant to post about the days in which my best friend Christa and I kept pushing off our final goodbye.\u00a0 The day we spent at Winterthur, a place I had never been, but found fascinating and beautiful. I wanted to write about how it was so very hard to say goodbye to the Roc\u2019s swimming teacher, Ms. Kay.\u00a0 How the Roc worked hard on a picture for Ms. Kay and he was so proud and excited to give it to her. He held that picture in the car on the way to his last swimming lesson and was still holding it after we were rear ended at a stop light just a few miles from the pool.\u00a0 After spending rush hour on the side of the road we eventually made it and we were able to give Ms. Kay the picture and a plant we had potted, now uprooted and missing half it\u2019s dirt from the impact.\u00a0 She still gave him his last lesson, 2 hours late and I cried trying to tell her how much she meant to me and the Roc. Our final 2 days were jammed with final packing, dealing with the crumpled car that was no longer drivable \u2013 but was supposed to be driven to MN, picking up the moving truck, the Roc\u2019s last day of Kindergarten, and prepping him to fly to Minnesota the very next day. I really wanted to write about the upheaval in the house and how the Roc handled it so much better than I had anticipated \u2013 his toys being packed, the house full of boxes. How he slowly seemed to get that we wouldn\u2019t be coming back to our townhouse.\u00a0 First asking when we were going to the nearby pool, when we would be coming back to our house, progressing to saying that we wouldn\u2019t be going to the pool and that someone else was going to live in our house.\u00a0 We questioned the depth all of this change was sinking and waited for an explosive fallout\u2026which never came.\u00a0 He was excited to fly to MN and excited to stay with his grandparents while I flew to back Philly so I could turn around and drive back to MN! When the Roc and I left for the airport GC and his friends were busy loading the truck, while the Roc watched from the driveway. The Roc was a peach at the airport, saying hi to the lady at check-in, (unprompted!) smiling bashfully as she complimented his cuteness.\u00a0 He sailed through security, was thrilled to pick out a muffin, and then happily drew pictures at the gate while we waited to board the plane. Our flight was uneventful and we soon arrived at my parents house.\u00a0 I got the Roc settled and then printed out my return ticket for the next day.\u00a0 I was worried when I got up the next morning, anxious that the Roc would throw a fit when I left for the airport because he cried when he went to bed saying that he would miss me\u2026but he didn\u2019t, he said, \u201cGoodbye!\u00a0 Have fun at the airport Mommy!\u201d and so I left.\u00a0 I sent GC a picture while my dad drove me to the airport, showing him the blue skies of Minnesota, a stark contrast to the haze of our east coast home. My best friend Christa brought us dinner that night, our last night in our townhouse, and she promised to come back the next morning to see us off (and we effectively put off our final goodbye one more night.) GC and I slept on the floor in the Roc\u2019s old room feeling nostalgic remembering all the firsts in our first home.\u00a0 The next morning we loaded the last of our boxes, took a couple final pictures, and then loaded the cats and dog into GC\u2019s tiny Celica, the car I would be driving across the country. Then Christa and I shed a few tears because the time had come, we had to say goodbye.\u00a0 No longer could we call each other on a whim and meet for lunch or get our boys together over breaks.\u00a0 It was so hard to say goodbye to her, she is a one of a kind friend, and I am incredibly lucky to have her in my life.\u00a0 We will always be friends. I drove out of the neighborhood filled with a mixture of sadness over what I was leaving behind and excitement about the future. We drove over 9 hours the first day through beautiful western Maryland and then into Ohio where we stopped for the night.\u00a0 The dog was an excellent traveler and the cats only meowed when the road was really bumpy or if I talked to them, so I stayed quiet.\u00a0 We drove about 10 hours the second day and stopped in Wisconsin for the night.\u00a0 My back was getting really sore from the accident and driving for 2 days, so when the receptionist at the hotel asked if I would like a luggage cart\u2026I said yes. I was worried the cats would really freak out in the hotel room, but again they surprised me and handled it just fine. Of course the dog was unfazed by it all.\u00a0 He was happy where ever we were. We had a short 4 hour drive the final day and arrived at my sister\u2019s house around lunchtime.\u00a0 We unloaded, went to storage and unloaded some more, and then came back and set up in my sister\u2019s basement.\u00a0 The Roc was happy to see us and he was excited to stay at my sister\u2019s house. He had a rough transition when we got him back and it was undoubtedly all the changes in his life that attributed to his downward spiral.\u00a0 I tried really hard to keep that in mind as we struggled with him those first few days.\u00a0 He is so excited to be with his cousins and at the end of the night, when I go in to check on him, that is what I remind myself. More changes are in the near future as we have an accepted offer on a house, a street up from my sister!\u00a0 We allowed the Roc to come and look at the house during the inspection and he was very excited, most notably about the big screened in porch off the back and the fact that his room overlooks the roof of said screened in porch. So, here we are. So many changes, good changes.

I concentrate on my breath. Finally, after many long minutes it is silent in his room.\u00a0 I look down at my knees as I grasp the cool doorknob and turn it, push open the door to see him sitting on his bed in the exact same position I had been assuming in the hallway.\u00a0 I glance at the rabbit hole and step over it.\u00a0 This is not the time to feel my grief and so I try to push it down and leave it behind as I lock onto his blue eyes, ready to have another conversation about appropriate behavior.

I head downstairs to put some things away. Not long after I hear the screen door open and the Roc yell out for me, \u201cMoooommmmy!\u201d\u00a0 I sigh waiting for him to ask me to push him on the swing and am shocked into stillness when he says, \u201cCome look Mommy, I can do the swing all by myself!\u201d \u201cNo way!\u201d\u00a0 I exclaim as I glanced around for my phone, thinking that if it is true then I will need to record it, but also not believing he is actually swinging by himself.\u00a0 My heart is full of hope as I step out onto the patio fully expecting to see him push off the ground with his feet and then sit still.\u00a0 I grin, lift up my phone, and start recording: I am ecstatic watching him and I can\u2019t wait for GC to get home and see him swinging all by himself!\u00a0 I smile as the Roc says \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself for swinging!\u201d What a statement. When my sister got back from the store I pointed out back and stage whispered, \u201cLOOK!\u00a0 the Roc is SWINGING all by himself!\u201d\u00a0 She asked me if I felt liberated and I laughed out loud.\u00a0 That\u2019s definitely one way of putting it.

GC and I care about food.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t call myself a foodie, or even a good cook.\u00a0 GC on the other hand is a good cook, the kind where he tastes whatever he is making and then adds a little of this and a little of that, and it tastes better.\u00a0 I need a recipe and exact measurements.\u00a0 We do agree that we care about our food and the choices we make with what and how we eat.\u00a0 We care about where our food comes from, who grows it, the quality, and the impact on our health and environment.\u00a0 When we lived in Delaware we belonged to a Co-Op and got all of our beef, chicken, pork, eggs, and dairy products from an Amish farm in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 We could taste the difference in the meats, see the difference in the eggs when the deep orange yolk hit the frying pan in the morning, loved the creamy consistency of the milk right from the cow, and we felt good buying from a sustainable farm where we knew there were no antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides, or genetically modified ingredients used. GC did some research recently and convinced me that we needed to go visit a farm almost 2 hours away from our new home.\u00a0 I agreed thinking it would be fun for the Roc to see some cows up close.\u00a0 We went on Saturday and the farmer was so nice, giving us a tour of his property and explaining some of the things they were doing.\u00a0 First we saw some cows, the Roc was warned to stay far away from the electrified fence, and he did, thank goodness. (hello there cows, we\u2019re thinking of buying 1/2 of one of you\u2026) We checked out the \u201cegg mobile\u201d and got the freshest egg possible. (don\u2019t mind us Ms. Chicken.\u00a0 We\u2019re just watching you lay an egg\u2026.keep going.) We spent a lot of time talking to farmer Mike, learning that he has 5 areas where his cows graze and that 3 days after the cows move on to the next paddock, the egg mobile is moved into that paddock and the chickens go to town eating bugs and bug larvae.\u00a0 It was refreshing to see the cows and chickens outside, the real definition of \u201cfree range,\u201d and listening to farmer Mike talk about how they started and how he felt providing individual buyers as well as restaurants with good quality beef.\u00a0 Plus, it was a beautiful day and a beautiful area. (hey there chickens!) Farmer Mike told us what he had done for a living before buying the old farmland and turning it from corn/soybeans to a salad bar for cows.\u00a0 GC was relaxed and happy as he chatted with farmer Mike and he started asking questions about how one gets into sustainable farming.\u00a0 He blew out a big sigh and said he wished we could do the same, at this time in our lives, that he could farm for a living instead of sitting behind a computer, working for a bank.\u00a0 I flashed to a memory of a conversation I had with my book club friends back in Delaware. Someone asked the question, \u201cwhat would you do if you won the lottery and never had to work again?\u201d\u00a0 Everyone was saying what they would buy, a bigger house, a fancy car, trips around the world, a yacht.\u00a0 When it got to my turn I said I knew exactly what I would do.\u00a0 I would buy a huge piece of land and start a farm and a therapy complex for individuals with disabilities.\u00a0 A sustainable farm that could support farm animals as well as crops, a place where people could come to ride horses, go swimming, and other outdoor activities in a safe, accepting, compassionate environment.\u00a0 A place that would make a difference for many people, for people like my son. Remembering this conversation I asked GC, \u201cDid you tell him about the Roc?\u201d\u00a0 GC then told farmer Mike that the Roc has autism.\u00a0 Mike smiled and said he has an adult son with Down Syndrome.\u00a0 Here we were standing and chatting with him about sustainable farming and health, and we find out that we share something else, something huge (to me,) we are both special needs parents.\u00a0 He told us a little about his son, and I smiled when he said \u201che\u2019s the most normal of the bunch of us.\u201d \u201cThere is no normal,\u201d I replied. The Roc was getting antsy, so I stuck a movie into the DVD player, (so happy with this car!) left GC to talking and went off to take a few more pictures. We drove out a few minutes later, both of us happy we came. During the quiet ride home GC and discussed how well the Roc went with the flow that morning.\u00a0 We had only told him we were going to a farm that morning, that we would definitely see some cows and meet a new person.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t able to give him any other details and he went along with a smile. We were both excited to see how the night would go\u2026we had big plans for the Roc.

{"date": "August 2, 2011", "body": "I was going to smoosh our Saturday evening into yesterday\u2019s post about our morning adventure at the farm, but the evening deserves a post of it\u2019s own.\u00a0 It\u2019s that special, that noteworthy, that\u2026 absurdly wonderful. We took the Roc to his very first concert on Saturday night. Read that again.\u00a0 We took the Roc to a concert on Saturday night.\u00a0 A concert. Anyone with a child on the spectrum knows this is H.U.G.E.\u00a0 Big.\u00a0 Very, very big.\u00a0 The crowds, the noise, the lights, the movement, the buzzing energy, the vibrations, the sensory overload potential would seem insurmountably, and it did to me. To be honest, taking my soon-to-be 7 year-old to a concert was not my idea.\u00a0 It was GC\u2019s.\u00a0 He deserves the credit for the idea and the adventurous spirit.\u00a0 The Roc loves music.\u00a0 He can sing a tune, on key, after only hearing it a couple times, though he won\u2019t if you ask him, you have to catch him singing when he doesn\u2019t know you are listening.\u00a0 Awhile back GC introduced the Roc to a band called  Owl City  and he wants to listen to it in the car and at home, and we hear him singing the lyrics while he\u2019s taking a bath at night.\u00a0 While we were still living in Delaware GC showed the Roc some youtube videos of the musican/songwriter/singer of Owl City,  Adam Young  performing live and the Roc started asking to go to a concert.\u00a0 GC immediately thought it would be fun\u2026I wasn\u2019t so sure.\u00a0 See the sensory overload list above. GC convinced me and we bought tickets for their last US show, which happened to be in St. Paul on Saturday night.\u00a0 We wavered on whether we should tell the Roc or surprise him.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t take much discussion before we both concluded that we should tell him. He showed him pictures of the venue, what the stage would look like, pictures of concerts so he could see all the people there in the dark listening and watching just as he would.\u00a0 We talked about the flow and direction of the evening, that we would go to dinner at a restaurant first, about the amount of people, how loud it would be, that people might cheer, clap and sing along.\u00a0 I showed him his headphones and reassured him that I would bring them and he could wear them if he needed to.\u00a0 We told him that we would sit in a row, just like a movie theater, and he would sit in between us, just like he did when we went to a  Devils game .\u00a0 We also told him that Owl City would play last and  Unwed Sailor  and  Mat Kearney  would perform first.\u00a0 On the way up to the farm we listened to Mat Kearney and Owl City.\u00a0 After only hearing Mat Kearney a couple times we heard him humming along to the songs. When we got home from the farm we went over these specifics again, the crowds, the noise, that we were going out to eat first.\u00a0 I convinced the Roc to change his outfit, GC and I took a deep breath and we left.\u00a0 As we drove down the highway I asked the Roc if he was excited and he said \u201cYes!!\u201d We found the parking garage and then walked a couple blocks to a Thai restaurant we wanted to try.\u00a0 We are blessed with a child who is willing to try new foods and he likes Thai food. I realized right away that the guys from Mat Kearney\u2019s band were at the same restaurant and really wanted the Roc to say hi, but knew better than to push it.\u00a0 I pointed out the guys to him, and said they would be on stage later.\u00a0 He watched them through the whole meal. As we walked over to the auditorium the Roc said, \u201cI think they are going to be late.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d I asked him. \u201cThose guys, they are still there and they are supposed to be on stage.\u201d \u201cOh!\u00a0 I\u2019m sure they will get there in time, don\u2019t worry,\u201d\u00a0 GC tried to reassure him. We made our way to the balcony and I was relieved that there wasn\u2019t a throng of people to push through, we quickly went through some people waiting at to buy tickets and then found our seats without a fuss.\u00a0 The Roc had a grin on his face that made my heart swell.\u00a0 GC and I looked at each other over his head and smiled, things were going great so far.\u00a0 The woman sitting directly in front of the Roc turned around and asked him if it was his first concert.\u00a0 He squirmed in his seat, he didn\u2019t want to answer her, talk to her.\u00a0 I smiled at her and prompted him, he finally whispered yes.\u00a0 Seeing my camera she offered to take our picture. GC got a shot of the Roc and I, a rarity as he usually squirms and gets really silly whenever I want a picture with him. The lights started to dim and I got a quick shot of the Roc, he was so excited. When the first band, Unwed Sailor, began playing the Roc clapped his hands over his ears and rocked back in his seat.\u00a0\u00a0 The look on his face was pure pain and fear.\u00a0 I fumbled around for the headphones and my heart beat wildly to see his face contort.\u00a0 As I slid them down over his ears, the Roc visibly relaxed and smiled again.\u00a0 I caught GC\u2019s eyes, widened my own, and swiped my hand across my forehead.\u00a0 We would have been out the door if I would have forgotten those headphones! The Roc sat through the whole set, eating the candy I had brought in my purse.\u00a0 It was at the end when he started asking for a drink, and so during the first intermission GC got up to buy a bottle of water (ca-ching!)\u00a0 I asked the Roc if he wanted to take off his headphones and he did not, his refusal was immediate and I didn\u2019t ask again. Then Mat Kearney came on stage and the Roc turned his attention back towards the stage.\u00a0 About halfway though this second set the Roc started to get squirmy, touching his headphones, and grimacing.\u00a0 He would look at me and talk, and I couldn\u2019t hear a word.\u00a0 I pulled him onto my lap, the vibration of the music running through my body was so intense, I knew it must be even more so for the Roc.\u00a0 I squeezed him tight, hoping to deliver the pressure he needed.\u00a0 I swayed him to the music and he smiled. During the second intermission the Roc still did not want to remove his headphones.\u00a0 He was starting to look dazed and GC and I exchanged looks over his head.\u00a0 We were hoping he would make it to see Owl City, the whole reason we brought him there in the first place.\u00a0 He did. He sat up and smiled when Adam Young and his musicians came on stage.\u00a0 He sat on my lap and then GC\u2019s lap.\u00a0 He was entranced through most of Owl City\u2019s performance.\u00a0 Towards the end he started to squirm around in his seat and I could feel our time running out.\u00a0 I asked him if he wanted to leave, and he vehemently said \u201cNO!\u201d\u00a0 GC and I locked eyes, we both were feeling the same dread, a meltdown was coming.\u00a0 The air around him was charged.\u00a0 I looked at my phone, 10 pm, and couldn\u2019t believe he had made it this far.\u00a0 We had been there for 3 hours.\u00a0 The last two songs were announced.\u00a0 Then the final song started.\u00a0 I grabbed the Roc\u2019s hand and pulled him to his feet, the opening to the stairs was 2 rows behind us.\u00a0 We clomped down the stairs and the hallway was empty.\u00a0 I grabbed his hands and we danced around.\u00a0 I told him it was almost over and I was so proud of him for going to the concert.\u00a0 We walked back up to the top of the stairs and danced together.\u00a0 I took a picture of him watching. It was the final song, there were people on stage throwing bags of cotton candy to the crowd.\u00a0 The Roc was grinning.\u00a0 GC joined us and we walked out.\u00a0 We both knew there would be an encore.\u00a0 But at that moment it really didn\u2019t matter that we would miss it. He did it. As we three alone walked across the skyway to the parking garage the Roc said, \u201cI had a great time at the concert!!\u201d with a bounce in his step. \u201cI did too buddy,\u201d I said with tears in my throat. I did too.

{"date": "April 7, 2011", "body": "It has been a stressful week.\u00a0 It is said that moving house is one of the more stressful events one can undertake, and even though I knew that, up until we got the inspection report from our buyers, I hadn\u2019t felt it.\u00a0 When we got the 32 page report and their 2 page list of demands last Friday night, both GC and I were filled with dread.\u00a0 The small petty grievances are an easy fix, yes we will replace the missing screen (it was in the garage awaiting repair anyway.)\u00a0 Yes, we will fix the drywall where you deem it blemished, tack down the transition strip, pop the wheel back into the garage door track, etc.\u00a0 It was the larger items, mold in the attic, cracked truss, window seal failure, and the bit about our furnace possibly being too small for a home of our size that really made my chest constrict.\u00a0 Dollar signs flashed before my eyes as I read through the addendum and I watched what little money we do have slide between my fingers, because in this market, the buyers have the power.\u00a0 After the settlement help we agreed to, paying the realtor fees and state transfer tax, we are not walking away with much, anything really.\u00a0 After being on the market 7 months, our main hope was to break even, have enough money to move (ourselves) and be able to pay closing costs in our new state.\u00a0 So we began working the phone, setting up contractors, getting estimates, and I again dealt with insomnia, and it brought me right back to those early diagnosis days. The days when my stomach and chest were so tight, so filled with dread and anxiety over the unknown and the monumental task set before me that I couldn\u2019t eat, could only focus on what was directly in front of me, and couldn\u2019t sleep.\u00a0 Every night for the past 5 days I went to bed with furnaces and figures on my mind, watched our meager savings disappear on the backs of my eyelids, and then I awoke an hour before my alarm went off to the same worries and fear.\u00a0 I forgot to eat and in late afternoon when I did remember, nothing appealed to me.\u00a0 GC kept reminding me about our desired end result of this move: family, help, support, and I tried hard to put everything into perspective. The early diagnosis days were the same, for months I couldn\u2019t sleep and couldn\u2019t eat, the worry and fear about my 3 year old son canceling out absolutely everything else in my life.\u00a0 I thought about this often during the last couple days, how the stress of the autism diagnosis and subsequent life changes filled my life for at least a whole year.\u00a0 As we gained information, autism friends and allies, set up programming and watched the Roc grow and change, my initial gut wrenching, body consuming anxiety lessened.\u00a0 I learned to channel it into productivity, sometimes, and often at the expense of other things in my life.\u00a0 But it rears its ugly head during times of stress, especially in relation to the Roc, and now during another life changing event.\u00a0 Moving across the country, with the Roc. But I am working hard to control and contain it, because after all we still have our lives to lead, we still have to parent the Roc.\u00a0 Usually when GC and I are stressed, our parenting skills go down the tubes.\u00a0 But last week, before we got the buyers repair requests and that stress started, we made a pact.\u00a0 We agreed to stay calm and in control of ourselves when he starts to push the limits, we agreed to tag out when we couldn\u2019t handle it and the other person agreed to step up to the plate, and we agreed on a strategy to combat the behavior/control issues we have with the Roc.\u00a0 And I have to pat us on the back, because we have been doing it, and it\u2019s paying off.\u00a0 The Roc has his moments, but we are reacting to them differently and in turn, he is reacting differently.\u00a0 We are able to diffuse situations that used to end in massive tantrums, and I feel so much more in control having a plan and following through with it, and I think the Roc feels better knowing exactly what will happen when he crosses the line.\u00a0 So while the house selling has been stressful, the Roc has been doing great. So great in fact that I feel a line of communication has opened up between us.\u00a0 It could be that we are handling him differently this week, or he is maturing and we are seeing the beginning of the next stage, or something is connecting within him that he is starting to be able to talk about how he is feeling.\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 While the Roc finished breakfast the other morning I hurried to take a shower.\u00a0 Not long after I heard him enter the bathroom, trying to avoid the repetitive conversation about monsters we\u2019ve been having lately I reminded him that he was going to bring his street sweeper to school that day to show his class (he is star of the week this week,) and then we had the following conversation: \u201cMommy, will my teachers know that I\u2019m anxious about talking about my street sweeper?\u201d \u201cNo sweetie, they won\u2019t know that.\u00a0 You have to tell them and they will help you okay?\u00a0 Make sure you tell them \u2013 they will definitely help you.\u00a0 That is part of their job.\u00a0 You can tell any adult in the room how you are feeling and they will help you.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Okay?\u201d\u00a0 I wondered if he was still in the bathroom as I rapidly started shaving my leg. \u201cOkay Mommy.\u00a0 I will\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I kept shaving, waiting to see if he would say more. \u201cMommy I feel better now.\u201d\u00a0 My hand holding the shaver hovered over my leg as I lifted my eyes and stared at the wall. \u201cRoc I\u2019m so glad.\u00a0 That makes me happy.\u201d There was a long pause while I kept still and held my breath. \u201cI like talking to you Mommy.\u201d\u00a0 My mouth dropped open as I continued to stare at the shower wall feeling the water ping off my back.\u00a0 The weight of this conversation started to sink in. \u201cThank you sweetie.\u00a0 I love talking and discussing things with you too.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so nice to me Mommy.\u201d I realized I was grinning and I had cut my knee, I started to repeat this exchange in my head, hoping that I could remember it long enough to write it down when I got out of the shower.\u00a0 Then he pulled back the shower curtain and said, \u201cI have to pee now, I\u2019m going to share your bathroom now, OKAY?\u201d and I laughed out loud. Before he entered the bathroom I had a running list of all the things I needed to get done that day floating through my mind, all the people I needed to call or follow up with, the dentist appointment I hoped I wouldn\u2019t forget and I had reminded myself to eat.\u00a0 He put it all into perspective for me and reminded me again of what is important.\u00a0 I sent him to school with the reminder to tell his teachers if he felt anxious and then I tackled my to-do list and tried hard to push my anxiety back down in it\u2019s place.\u00a0 The stress can bring back memories of those terrifying early days, but taking a step back to see how far we\u2019ve come, all of us, reminds me to keep my eye on the prize and keep moving forward. Onward and upward. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/stress-shower-conversations/", "title": "Stress + Shower\u00a0Conversations"},
{"date": "August 4, 2011", "body": "For three evenings in a row last week my Mom watched the Roc while GC and I ran around to different dealerships in search of a car to replace my crumpled Camry.\u00a0 The first two nights she watched him at our house, we came home to find her resting on the couch the first night, and reading to the Roc the second.\u00a0 The third night we went car shopping my Mom had plans, so we were at the gas station, with Roc in tow, when she called to say she had gotten home from her outing and did we decide when we were going to go out looking for a car again. \u201cRight now actually, we are at the gas station, the Roc\u2019s in the backseat,\u201d I told her. \u201cWell see if he wants to come here instead, I\u2019ll watch him that way you can go alone,\u201d she immediately replied. Whew, I felt a balloon of air leave my chest, I didn\u2019t even know I was that wound up about bringing him with.\u00a0 I had packed a little cooler of food, the portable DVD player, movies, books, markers and paper.\u00a0 I figured we would make it to the one dealership, an hour away, and the Roc and I would sit outside while GC negotiated.\u00a0 I was actually dreading it. After asking the Roc if he wanted to go to Grandma\u2019s instead of car shopping, to which he immediately said yes, we changed course and headed over to my Mom\u2019s house.\u00a0 I quickly dropped his stuff in the door and left.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t phased at all.\u00a0 GC and I went on our way, down to the dealership where we negotiated, GC got fed up, walked out, I begged to go back and buy the car I wanted, he held fast, the dealer was actually being really jerky, I was super bummed and stressed.\u00a0 After talking to him on the phone again from a parking lot 2 minutes down the road I too agreed that the dealer was a jerk, we would move on.\u00a0 We went to the final dealership of the night, it was getting close to closing time, and we ended up test driving and then buying a car.\u00a0 Weeee! It was then that I started to wonder about the Roc.\u00a0 It was late, past his bedtime, past my parents bedtime.\u00a0 This was the third night in a row that my Mom was spending with him.\u00a0 I hoped they were okay, that the Roc wasn\u2019t throwing any tantrums, or giving my Mom a lot of grief.\u00a0 I hoped she wasn\u2019t sick of entertaining and dealing with him.\u00a0 I was a little nervous when we finally pulled up to their house.\u00a0 My dad was outside with the dogs and GC stayed out to show him our new (to us) car, while I headed inside to see how the Roc and my Mom were faring. The house was quiet, I called out for them, walking first down the hallway thinking they might be reading stories in one of the bedrooms, I headed back to my parents bedroom next, wondering if he was taking a bath in their giant bathtub.\u00a0 Walking back into the kitchen I saw faint flickering lights on the screened in porch out back, I smiled.\u00a0 I slid open the door, stepped out into the darkness, and saw their lumpy forms under an afghan on the couch. \u201cWhere\u2019s Roc?\u00a0 I cannot find him anywhere?\u201d I said loudly. \u201cShhh!\u201d My Mom stage whispered to the Roc. The afghan was wiggiling and the Roc was giggling.\u00a0\u00a0 I thumped down on the couch next to the smaller lump and the Roc squealed, \u201cWe\u2019re having a sleep over on the porch Mommy!!!\u201d My Mom poked her head out and said, \u201cHow did it go?\u00a0 Did you come back with a car?\u201d \u201cYup!\u00a0 It\u2019s out front!\u201d\u00a0 I started to tell her about our failed negotiation at the first dealership when the Roc interrupted me and demanded she get back inside the \u201ctent.\u201d \u201cOkay! Here I come!\u201d she enthusiastically replied. \u201cHow did it go?\u00a0 Was he okay for you?\u00a0 Thank you so much Mom, there was no way we would have been able to do what we did tonight without your help,\u201d I told her. It was true.\u00a0 We would have stalled out at the first dealership.\u00a0 There was no way we would have been able to negotiate and then think clearly with him present, vying for my attention. My mom poked her head back out, \u201cHe was  wonderful  Kim, we had a great time, he did such a nice job here, he was  so  good.\u201d she gushed.\u00a0 She went back under the blanket.\u00a0 She and the Roc where talking, he was giggling. I leaned back against the couch, looked out into the night and felt my throat close up with tears\u2026 She said  wonderful . She thinks he is  wonderful . She had fun with him. For the third night in a row. She enjoyed him. She sees my son. She really  sees  him. This is why we moved.\u00a0 Not only to \u201cget help\u201d with him, though that is what we said, what we thought while we struggled through the tough times alone in Delaware. What I really wanted all along was for someone to see my baby.\u00a0 For all the good, and the fun, for the silly, and the smart. To see him not as a list of can\u2019t do, won\u2019t do, never going to do, a list of behaviors to squash, challenges to beat, or a child broken\u2026but a wonderful child worth celebrating. The Roc giggled uncontrollably, spewed out a few lines from the movie \u201cDespicable Me.\u201d\u00a0 He was falling into silly.\u00a0 It was late. \u201cOh Roc, I love you, you are such a silly, funny kid,\u201d my Mom told the Roc as she pulled him to her. My heart swelled as I watched them together.\u00a0 I blinked back tears as I stood up.\u00a0 It was time to get the Roc home.\u00a0 Time to let my parents go to bed.\u00a0 My dad was headed to bed as we brought the Roc out to see our new car.\u00a0 We hugged my mom goodbye and I said thank you again, knowing that she could not know how thankful I really am. So Thank You Mom. Thank you for loving my child, for taking the time to meet him where he is right now, for celebrating all that is good about him. Thank you for seeing him. It means everything to me.

{"date": "April 15, 2011", "body": "While talking to my mom on the phone the other day, I showed her how to do a search on trulia.com for houses.\u00a0 So we sat for at least 30 minutes, separated by 1,000 miles, each looking at the same thing on our computer screens.\u00a0 It was fun to show her the houses I liked and to hear her excitement about our pending move travel through the phone.\u00a0 In all honesty I have been looking at houses ever since we put our house on the market back in September, and since we got the offer a few weeks ago, almost daily. Looking at the houses on a satellite image I started to wonder about the neighbors we will eventually have.\u00a0 Because right now, in my little neighborhood, I have nice neighbors.\u00a0 We live in a \u201ctwin home\u201d and the family we are connected to, whose teenager happens to share a wall with the the Roc\u2019s bedroom, have been nothing but nice.\u00a0 I apologize with regularity for the noise and the tantrums when we are having a bad week, and she always, always says \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it, we understand,\u201d and I am grateful.\u00a0 Both of her children say they cannot hear us, or that \u201cit\u2019s okay,\u201d when they answer the phone instead of their mother.\u00a0 On our other side, the neighbors are wonderful grandparents, the wife got teary eyed when I first told her about the Roc\u2019s diagnosis 3 years ago.\u00a0 She goes out of her way to talk to the Roc, and always invites him to swim with her grandchildren when they are out in the blow up pool during the summer.\u00a0 We have other nice neighbors on the street as well, who always say hi to the Roc, and always notice the changes and progress he has made.\u00a0 I have been friends with a mom of 3 typi kids since she moved in, and she always invites the Roc to play when we are outside and to her son\u2019s birthday parties.\u00a0 I have laughed and cried with some of my neighbors. I also have had my share of interesting and gut wrenching conversations about the Roc in the last 3 years.\u00a0 From, \u201cHave you tried putting him in the corner, having him stand with his nose pressed up against wall and his arms out?\u201d or \u201cwhat about a sticker chart, that works for us,\u201d and \u201coh my kid gets upset too, that\u2019s just a kid thing!\u201d when the Roc was going through a terrible behavior phase.\u00a0 Or, \u201cOh!\u00a0 Autism, so he\u2019s going to be an engineer or a scientist, they are all geniuses right?\u201d\u00a0 and \u201cOh yeah, I saw Rainman once, like that?\u201d\u00a0 To \u201cMy wife knew there was something wrong with him when he was a baby, so we aren\u2019t surprised,\u201d when hearing the diagnosis news for the first time.\u00a0 Many of my neighbors have seen the Roc since he was a baby, and they have seen the good, the progress, the language that emerged and the gross motor skills we worked hard on outside.\u00a0 They have also witnessed the tantrums, either in person, through the walls, or through our open windows.\u00a0 They have seen me cry and rejoice, heard me yell and laugh, and have their own ideas of autism is based off what they have seen at our home. So I have begun thinking about what our new neighbors will be like, what their impression of our family might be, and how I will have an opportunity to shape strangers ideas about autism, my family, and my son.\u00a0 Maybe they know someone with autism, but maybe they don\u2019t.\u00a0 The numbers don\u2019t lie, but unless you actually know someone either with autism or who has a child with autism, most people aren\u2019t likely to pay attention to this fast growing developmental disorder.\u00a0 The Roc may just be their 1 in 110, or 1 in 70 boys, or whatever statistic is the most touted at the time.\u00a0 I know that the Roc is\u00a0 likely the 1 in 110 for most of my old high school friends back home.\u00a0 When I ask them if they know anyone with a child with autism in their area, no one does, that will change when we move, but it again reminds me how isolating autism can be.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want it to be that way for us, but I know that we will have to work at it. So I have been thinking about the best way to tell the new neighbors.\u00a0 What do I want them to know first about the Roc? \u00a0If we should \u201cout\u201d the Roc right away or if maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be the very first thing they hear about him.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it does.\u00a0 I want the Roc to be seen for all of him, not just the fact that he has autism.\u00a0 Also, we are in a different place in our journey now, I think we have an opportunity to impact our new neighbors in a different way.\u00a0 The neighbors we have now have known us from the beginning of our journey, some have cried with me, some have said they are \u201csorry for me,\u201d and some have just been a witness to the more difficult struggles. Things are different now, I am more at ease and centered, and I know that I don\u2019t want or deserve pity.\u00a0 My boy is smart, funny, kind, gorgeous beyond measure, artistic and creative.\u00a0 He wants friends, he wants to go to parties, he wants to have fun and be a kid just like any other.\u00a0 He has certain challenges and road blocks to overcome, and GC and I will do anything to help him along the way, including giving thought to how to approach our new neighbors when the time comes. Let\u2019s just hope they are ready to receive.

{"date": "April 26, 2011", "body": "We are not traditionalists around here, nor are we particularly religious, so when the young man at Trader Joes asked me if I was going to be celebrating Easter (after calling me Miss instead of the usual Mama, yay!) I stuttered and said, \u201cYes, well sort of\u2026 we do something for my son.\u00a0 I guess he celebrates the Easter Bunny.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s true, we\u2019re heathens, and I\u2019m okay with that.\u00a0 For now the Roc thinks Easter is about a giant bunny who sneaks into our house at night, leaving plastic eggs and presents.\u00a0 He is very much like Santa, and in no way does the Roc want his picture taken with him. I woke up before 6 am on Easter, because I  am  the Easter bunny and since we have 4 cats, I have to lock them in the basement to hide the eggs, otherwise we would hear the plastic rolling across the wood floor all night followed by thumping and running.\u00a0 I had wrapped the few gifts in the only wrapping paper we have at the moment, Christmas wrapping paper.\u00a0 I figured I would just tell him the Easter bunny wraps the gifts here before he hides the eggs and it was the only paper he could find, which is true, if he happened to ask.\u00a0 After hiding the eggs and with the cats safely meowing behind the door to the basement, I went back to sleep, only to be woken up by, \u201cMommy, the Easter Bunny came!\u00a0 There are eggs!\u00a0 LOOK!\u00a0 There\u2019s a present!\u201d\u00a0 And so we began our morning. The Roc was thrilled to follow the little trails I made to each of his 5 presents (new ball, a couple sets of markers, a game, and a toy helicopter) and he had to open each egg in which I had placed either jelly beans or little jelly candies. He truly enjoyed the process this year, and actually cared more about what was under the wrapping paper than the paper itself, which is a step up the progress ladder.\u00a0 We did let him have a few candies, but luckily he doesn\u2019t seem to associate these kinds of holidays with candy consumption, a pleasing side affect to having done the GFCF diet for a few years. Even though there are things we have to do around the house to prepare for our move and the grass is almost taller than our little boston terrier, we decided to head down to the beach.\u00a0 We won\u2019t have many chances left before we move to the middle of the country in a few weeks.\u00a0 It was deceptively warm, and when we go onto the sand and saw some kids playing in the water GC went down to get his feet wet.\u00a0 It was not warm enough! We had a picnic lunch and then went walking.\u00a0 The Roc just loves the beach.\u00a0 It is one of the things I am going to miss about this area. It was a nearly perfect day capped off by a bubble bath, another rare treat for the Roc.

I stared up at his door imagining him climbing into bed and then GC caught my eye and we grinned across the couch at each other.\u00a0 A year ago I was so exhausted from fighting him every night.\u00a0 I wondered if it was our new norm.\u00a0 A year ago I could not imagine such a calm exchange. * For a long time just getting the Roc to speak his own spontaneous sentences was my biggest wish.\u00a0 I wanted to hear him talk, really talk, with words that he was choosing, not a script.\u00a0 Now he does and I realized that I in my zest for original speech I overlooked manners.\u00a0 We get a lot of \u201cI want\u201d or \u201cI need,\u201d statements to celebrate for sure, but no please or thank you.\u00a0 So I started prompting the \u201cplease\u201d and the \u201cthank you\u201d along with the sentence to be in question format (something we still work on from time to time as I do not like to fulfill demands, a polite request I am much more likely to respond to, but the Roc tends to be a demanding child.)\u00a0 It became the norm for me to say \u201cAsk me using nice words,\u201d and \u201cWhat do you say when someone gives you something?\u201d\u00a0 Months and months, I do not even know how long I\u2019ve been requesting the \u201cnice words,\u201d when suddenly the nice words are coming out without prompting. \u201cHere you go Roc, here\u2019s your fruit.\u201d \u201cThank you Mommy.\u201d \u201cOooh, I like to hear those nice words Roc!\u00a0 Good job!\u201d It still startles me from time to time when I do not have to prompt him, when it is just a reflex for him to say please and thank you.\u00a0 GC and I still nudge each other and lock eyes when he is being polite on his own. * I play every day.\u00a0 Every.\u00a0 Day.\u00a0 How many parents play little people with their 6.5 year old everyday?\u00a0 I\u2019m betting not many, unless they have a kiddo like mine.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been working on play skills for so long, so very long, and they have been slowly emerging and morphing over the last year.\u00a0 When I started to try to teach how to play with trains at 3 years old, I was initially rebuffed, he didn\u2019t want me in his space moving his things around.\u00a0 Then we had to play the same way or he would throw a tantrum, later we had to follow the same script every time, otherwise he would throw a tantrum. Now, for very short periods of time he will play on his own, usually to set something up that we are going to play together.\u00a0 He will create \u201cbouncy houses\u201d for our little people to have parties, drape towels over his bed to make waterfalls, arrange his instruments for us to have a concert, line up blocks for a runway for his helicopter, design a backyard for the little people castle complete with a pool, patio and picnic table.\u00a0 He can set the scene but he still needs me to move the people with him, play talk and make the little figures have mock conversations. But he\u2019s starting to get the hang of playing and using his little people or stuffed animals to act out a scene. \u201cOkay Mommy, it\u2019s time for Kitty\u2019s birthday party!\u201d \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll be right there Roc.\u00a0 Ohhh, can I use the puppy and the elephant? \u201d \u201cYes, and all of these too.\u00a0 They are sitting at the table.\u00a0 It\u2019s time for cake now.\u201d Me using the doggy, \u201cYay!!\u00a0 I love cake!\u00a0 Happy birthday Kitty!\u201d Roc using the kitty,\u00a0 \u201cI like cake too says Kitty!\u201d It makes me smile to hear him getting the hang of play conversations.\u00a0 He used to answer me as if I were asking him the question instead of whatever little person or stuffed animal he was holding.\u00a0 He\u2019s starting to find  their  voices now, even if he still adds the \u201csays Kitty\u201d at the end.\u00a0 It\u2019s making playing the same things every day a bit more fun! * Monday morning I was floating in the haze of sleep right before my alarm was set to go off when I heard the Roc\u2019s feet patter into my bedroom.\u00a0 I reached for my glasses as he said, \u201cMommy, I loseded a tooth Mommy.\u201d As I cracked my eyes open I saw his little hand stretched out towards me, and sure enough, there was a little white tooth.\u00a0 I pushed myself up while asking him if it hurt, if it fell out on it\u2019s own, and was he bleeding? \u201cI pulled it out Mommy, it only pinched a little,\u201d he said while placing the tooth in my hand and then asking if he could take a bath.\u00a0 I slipped out of bed and set the perfect little tooth, no blood, on a shelf above my dresser thinking it a safe place for the day until we could leave it for the tooth fairy.\u00a0 We moved on to the rest of the morning, and I forgot about the tooth until again I was relaxing on the couch long after I though the Roc was asleep, when I heard his little voice, \u201cMommy, did you put the tooth under my pillow?\u201d \u201cOpps, I don\u2019t think it is Sweetpea.\u00a0 Let me just run and get it, good thing you remembered!\u00a0 The tooth fairy needs that tooth!\u201d I exclaimed while trotting into my bedroom to claim the forgotten tooth. \u201cThe tooth fairy will turn it into money right?\u00a0 Right Mommy?\u00a0 Right?\u201d the Roc questioned me as I resettled him with the tooth in a little baggie under his head. \u201cSomething like that baby.\u00a0 Remember to look under your pillow in the morning okay?\u201d The calm manner in which he lost that tooth and then the fact that he remembered later in the day that he lost it, that it was not under his pillow, that it should be, that he would get money for it\u2026amazing.\u00a0 I came back downstairs to a quizzical look from GC.\u00a0 I placed my hands on the edges of the sink, leaned heavily against it, and said, \u201cCan you believe how that all happened today?\u00a0 He pulled out his own tooth like it was no big deal, and then many hours later, after he was already in bed he remembered it wasn\u2019t under his pillow!\u00a0 I\u2019m kinda floored.\u00a0 He\u2019s just been a bit calmer lately, more rational, he still fights me about stuff, don\u2019t get me wrong, but he\u2019s different \u2014 in a good way.\u00a0 Do you feel that way too?\u201d I felt warm and a lump rose in my throat when GC causally responded with a shrug, \u201cHe\u2019s growing up.\u201d Yup, he is. I don\u2019t know what I thought 3 years ago.\u00a0 My mind was buzzing and fuzzy and I had a list to tackle, everything and everyone else be damned.\u00a0 I know that I was worried about all the \u201cnevers.\u201d\u00a0 Never going to do this, do that, go here, there\u2026you know, the doom and gloom that some professionals dump on you seconds after telling you your three year old is autistic.\u00a0 I know I didn\u2019t think it was possible for them to be correct.\u00a0 How can you look at my child, who has been walking the planet for only THREE years and tell me all the things he won\u2019t do. They can\u2019t. They shouldn\u2019t. Never say never. My baby is growing up.

{"date": "November 3, 2011", "body": "Halloween. It\u2019s come and gone, and now there is a bucket full of temptation sitting on the top of my fridge. \u00a0The Roc was super excited about Halloween in Minnesota, his first time trick-or-treating in this neighborhood, and more importantly, with his cousin Matthew. It\u2019s funny how some things that are so different, a complete departure from what he has done for 3 years in a row, he anticipates with glee; and then the events I do no think will register on the anxiety scale completely throw him off. When we lived in Delaware we carved our pumpkins the weekend before Halloween, let me restate that, GC carved our pumpkins while the Roc watched and I took pictures. \u00a0This year, my sister invited us over to carve pumpkins on Saturday. \u00a0I told the Roc, but didn\u2019t think much of it, figuring he would be super excited to go down to my sister\u2019s house. \u00a0When we pulled into my sisters driveway, (yes, one street away, I wasn\u2019t carrying 6 pumpkins on foot (and YES, we had SIX pumpkins)) the Roc told me he was anxious. \u00a0He didn\u2019t want to get out of the van, he looked worried and scared. \u201cBaby, you\u2019ve been here before, we\u2019re going to go and find your cousins,\u201d I told him as I walked up to the front door looking for my sister\u2019s family. He stayed put on the driveway. \u00a0I found everyone on the patio, plunked my pumpkins down and went to grab a couple more. \u201cCome on Roc! \u00a0Everyone is on the patio. \u00a0Let\u2019s go carve our pumpkins!\u201d \u00a0I tried to move him along. \u201cI\u2019m too anxious,\u201d he told me. I carried the remaining pumpkins to the backyard and got started. \u00a0Eventually the Roc came to the back with GC, but he still wasn\u2019t happy. \u00a0I was cutting the top off my pumpkin and I exhaled, realizing that he needed some validation. \u00a0That even though I didn\u2019t plan for him to react this way, he was, and I needed to say something to him, to help him. \u00a0I could feel his unease and sense his internal pressure was building. \u201cI understand, this is different from what we did in Delaware right?\u201d I asked him. \u00a0\u201cUsually it was just Mommy and Daddy and you, and we would carve the pumpkins at our table, right?\u201d \u201cThis is different!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI understand, but we can do things differently. \u00a0It\u2019s okay to do things differently. \u00a0And this will be fun! \u00a0We get to see what your cousins carve into their pumpkins.\u201d I tried to encourage him. \u00a0Inside I was shocked at myself for being shocked that he was anxious at my sister\u2019s house. \u00a0I know better. After I scooped a pumpkin I handed it over to GC. \u00a0It\u2019s his punishment for being so creative and handy with a knife. \u00a0I convinced the Roc watched GC carve. My sister\u2019s kids were busy with their pumpkins. \n I kept GC busy carving for a long time. \u00a0We even got him to try to make an \u201cangry bird\u201d (but we forgot to poke some holes, or leave the lid off and the darn thing didn\u2019t stay lit on Halloween, but it did look really cool!) and the NJ Devils pumpkin he does every year. \u00a0He may act like he doesn\u2019t want to carve, but look, he\u2019s smiling! The Roc wanted to play more than carve, and he got my mom to chase him around the yard for awhile. After dinner we lit up the pumpkins. The Roc was super excited about Halloween when he got home from school. \u00a0The first trick-or-treaters came before it was even dark, and the Roc cut his dinner short to get into his costume. GC took him around the neighborhood with my BIL, Matthew, and a few other dads and kids from my sister\u2019s street. \u00a0I sat in the circle with some of the neighbors, by a fire, and handed out candy (totally the way to do it!) \u00a0When they came back 1.5 hours later the Roc was all smiles, he had only worn the mask for a few houses. \u00a0GC said it wasn\u2019t long after they had started that the Roc fell flat on his face and he was sure that the evening was over, that he was going to meltdown. \u00a0But the Roc choked back his anger and\u00a0embarrassment\u00a0and kept going. \u00a0HUGE! \u00a0He ran with the other kids and this year he didn\u2019t try to go into every house. The whole evening was a success. (A funny thing \u2013 he could really care less about the candy. \u00a0The bucket is on top of the fridge and he doesn\u2019t ask for any of it. \u00a0He wants to keep eating the same desserts he always does. \u00a0Yay for that!)

{"date": "October 14, 2011", "body": "Camping has been a part of my life since I was a child. \u00a0We tent camped when I was young, my sister and I sleeping in the back of our mustard yellow van, and when I was a bit older my parents purchased an RV and we traveled out West, to Canada, to Michigan, and to the \u201cnorth shore\u201d of Minnesota. \u00a0I have so many good memories from our camping trips and I am so thankful that my parents took me. \u00a0I always hoped that my children would love the outdoors as much as I do and that we would camp as a family. But all your best laid plans seem to change when your child is diagnosed with Autism. \u00a0As I watched the Roc struggle to communicate as a 3 year old, seeing him through eyes filled with the diagnosis, I worried about so many things, life had suddenly seemed to veer off course. \u00a0I also wondered if we would do the things I had dreamed of doing, and one of them was camping. I knew early on that the Roc was an outdoor kid. \u00a0He\u00a0cemented\u00a0it when I started to take him out to Arizona during the winter to visit my parents and he would hike. \u00a0What 3 year old will hike a few miles willingly? \u00a0We took the Roc to Colorado around his 5th birthday and the boy hiked 5 miles in the mountains, all for the promise of a waterfall, and he didn\u2019t complain. \u00a0I\u2019ve reveled in the fact that I got my outdoor kid. \u00a0With our move to Minnesota, I started to think more about camping. Could we? \u00a0Would he like it? \u00a0What if it rained? \u00a0(The Roc is like a cat when it comes to rain, don\u2019t rain on him) \u00a0Would he sleep in the tent? \u00a0What about all of our daily routines that would most definitely be out the window while camping? \u00a0Would he eat camp food? \u00a0and on and on. There are so many variables with camping, so many things that would roll off another kids back, but would greatly bother the sensory sensitive Roc. We decided to give it a try. \u00a0Because you never know until you try. I told the Roc on Thursday morning that I had a surprise for him when he got home from school. \u00a0He immediately wanted to know what it was, but I told him to wait, I would tell him when he got home. \u201cWhat\u2019s the surprise?\u201d the Roc asked me as soon as the van door opened. \u201cHow would you like to go to Duluth tonight, stay in a hotel with a pool, and then tomorrow we\u2019ll see waterfalls and go camping?\u201d I asked him excidedly, sure that he would burst with joy. \u00a0Hotel! \u00a0Pool! \u00a0Waterfalls! \u00a0Lake Superior! \u00a0Camping! \u201cI thought we were going to Coon Rapids Dam!\u201d the Roc screeched at me. Oh boy. \u00a0After talking him down and explaining how we could drive to the dam any old day, but that hotel/pool/waterfall/camping is something special he got excited. \u00a0We left when GC got home from work, and the evening went well. \u00a0We arrived at our hotel, stashed the dog and our stuff, went to 5 Guys for dinner, and then came back with enough time for the Roc and I to take a dip in the hotel pool and whirlpool. We woke up early on Friday, not sure what time the park office opened, but without a reservation we were banking on getting a non-reservable site, and were hoping for a \u201ccart-in\u201d site to maximize the distance between us and other campers, therefore reducing the chances of us greatly\u00a0disturbing\u00a0anyone should a meltdown occur. \u00a0It was still dark when we left our hotel. We watched the sun rise out of Lake Superior. The park office wasn\u2019t open when we got there, so we checked out all the empty non-reservable sites and got our first choice when the office opened. \u00a0We were lucky and got a great cart-in site at the end of the campground, set back in the woods. \u00a0We quickly went to work setting up our site. \u00a0Well GC did, the Roc, Guinness and I went down to check out the lake. After set up and a quick lunch, we packed a bag and headed off to see some waterfalls and hike to the top of Carlton Peak, the trail sign stating a 3-hour round trip hike. \u00a0At the top of a series of waterfalls we asked a guy with a big camera to take our picture, and enjoyed the view before setting off to the peak. It was a long hike and a strenous climb to the top, but the views were worth it. We rested and had a snack before heading back down. \u00a0We knew it would take awhile to get to the bottom, and even longer to get back to our campsite down by the lake. \u00a0The last bit is a scramble to the top, which took awhile, and took even more time to get back down. We made it back to our campsite and started dinner. \u00a0GC had some trouble with his little portable cook stove, that he had  just  purchased from a guy at work and had never used, and we ended up eating dinner and washing up in the dark. \u00a0The Roc was good throughout it all, he sat by the fire, he ate his dinner, he repeatedly asked when we were going to make s\u2019mores, and around 8:30 he announced he was tired and he wanted to go to bed. \u00a0He went to sleep in the tent with the dog and a lantern. \u00a0GC and I looked at each other in amazement. The next morning GC got his little stove working and he made us some eggs and bacon. After breakfast we drove up to Cascade River State Park and hiked around the waterfalls there. We picnicked down by the lake and then drove up to Grand Marais to walk around and check out the Coast Guard area. We went back to our campsite earlier and cooked some pasta over the fire, (in the daylight!) When it got dark we went down to the lake with a lantern and watched the water shimmer in the moonlight, heading back when it got really dark and when we realized that the Roc wasn\u2019t going to sit quietly! \u00a0Of course we made more s\u2019mores that night and again, when the Roc got tired, he told us so, and then went to sleep in the tent with the dog and a lantern. We woke up to gray skies and a screechy Roc on Sunday, he was upset that we couldn\u2019t watch the sunrise and it took a little coaxing to bring him back down, so we ate breakfast and packed up our stuff to head home. \u00a0On our way south we stopped at Split Rock Lighthouse State Park, but it had started to lightly rain, so we went down to the lake to check out the view of the lighthouse, and the Roc threw rocks. We drove home happy, dirty and tired. You never know until you try. \u00a0I was\u00a0apprehensive\u00a0about camping with the Roc, but I\u2019m so glad we gave it a shot. \u00a0He was so happy, he kept telling us he was having fun, and really, is there anything better? When your kid is having fun, and he tells you about it? I know enough to deeply cherish those moments.

{"date": "January 13, 2012", "body": "I started a post about the holidays a couple weeks ago\u2026and never finished it. \u00a0I have a few other unfinished posts in my dashboard, a couple in my head that are screaming to get out, (basketball! swimming!) and one that I wrote in a margarita haze last night after coming home from a neighborhood gathering. \u00a0But I am a little OCD and even though no one but the Roc is thinking about Christmas anymore I just have to say something about it, and of course post a few pictures. The Roc was pumped about Christmas, our first here in Minnesota. \u00a0He was sad that we didn\u2019t have any snow and I felt like a HUGE liar for telling him over and over since we got here in June that we would go sledding, and build snowmen, and that he would get to play with his cousin in the snow over winter break. \u00a0The anticipation of opening those  presents  under the tree and waking up to find more presents on Christmas morning was enough of a balm to relieve the brown Christmas\u00a0disappointment. GC wanted to keep his family tradition of having lots and yummy seafood on Christmas Eve so he got to work in the late morning making us a lunch feast, and don\u2019t worry, even though he looks unhappy in the following photo, he is very happy\u2026 I took one of my favorite pictures of the Roc while trying to get GC to smile for my camera, take note GC, this is how it\u2019s done\u2026 I wanted to photograph the food, but GC wanted to serve it up right away. So I settled for a pic of my two guys, the fried goodness, and the Roc eating a lemon (which he tried to eat after we told him that his cousin Aiden in SC used to eat lemons when he was younger!) The Roc was so excited about the presents from our extended family under the tree, and wouldn\u2019t stop asking if he could open some of them that we let him pick three to open before we were due at my sister\u2019s house for Christmas Eve dinner. We had a lot of fun at my sister\u2019s house that night. \u00a0The boys drank and told stories before dinner, and after dinner the kids couldn\u2019t wait to open a few presents from family. I got a great shot of my dad, and after all the presents were unwrapped the little boys opened up their new art stuff and went to work. We exited around the Roc\u2019s bedtime knowing it would be one night that he wouldn\u2019t balk at going to bed and staying there. \u00a0He was just a little keyed up\u2026 but he slept the whole night through. I woke up to a little voice whispering that there were presents under the tree at 7 am on Christmas morning. We didn\u2019t know if we would ever get a reaction like we did  last year , but there was one thing the Roc had been asking for. \u00a0The Polar Express. He was pretty happy to get it! My parents came over later that afternoon and we had dinner together. It was wonderful and relaxing and fun! The Roc had the following week off of school for \u201cwinter break\u201d and by the time it was over I felt like I needed a vacation! \u00a0He had lots of new toys to play with so we played a lot, and he took a long bath everyday to play with his new boats. \u00a0We went over to my parents house the day before the left for Arizona to say goodbye. \u00a0I will admit to feeling a little teary when I pulled out of the driveway, I had gotten used to seeing them on a regular basis. \u00a0I took the Roc to see a movie one afternoon and he did great, only needing to be shushed a few times. And now it\u2019s mid-January, it\u2019s cold and grey and I\u2019m dreaming of spring. Whew, now that this holiday recap is out of the way I can concentrate on the here and now, and those two subjects that are screaming for posts of their own \u2013 basketball and swimming!

{"date": "December 5, 2011", "body": "So often we hear the negative about our kids. \u00a0We hear about all they cannot do after their evaluations, how far behind they are at conferences, what they have to work on during IEP meetings. \u00a0It\u2019s hard to hear these things, to read the reports full of these details, to craft the goals we hope will help them shorten the gap. \u00a0Our hearts are pricked to read and hear our children dismantled in this way, because they are so much more than the sum of the things they need to work on. \u00a0So much more. To combat all the negative we celebrate the positive. \u00a0No matter how small, every step of progress is noticed. \u00a0We know our children better than anyone, and we know where they started, we know the hours they (and we) have put into the skills they have acquired. \u00a0And we often deal with the fall out of how hard they have to work every single day. The Roc works hard at school. \u00a0He works hard to keep himself together all day, to be  in  the classroom and be a part  of  it. \u00a0He works hard to be around his peers, to be socially appropriate. \u00a0He works hard against his anxiety and the sensory onslaught that is the elementary school. \u00a0And he does. \u00a0He is mainstreamed in a first grade classroom, with para support, most of the day. \u00a0He goes to the \u201cresource room\u201d for the second half of reading and math, to get more direct instruction. \u00a0There is friendship group once a week and a social skills group once a week. \u00a0It\u2019s not easy for him. \u00a0But he\u2019s doing it. The\u00a0academics\u00a0are coming along. \u00a0Math is clicking for him, his writing is clearer, but he is behind in reading. \u00a0We work everyday on his sight words, to keep the kindergarten words and add the new 1st grade words every week. \u00a0When we work on his spelling words I hear him sounding them out, I know the information is there. \u00a0At conferences we were told he is at \u201cbeginning kindergarten\u201d in terms of his reading ability. \u00a0I swallowed those bulging words and \u00a0tried hard to lift my sinking stomach,  a whole year behind,  a\u00a0little voice whispered in my ear. Last week as I was leaving the school after volunteering the Roc\u2019s special ed teacher, Ms. G, and I saw each other in the hallway. \u00a0We stopped and chatted a bit and she very excitedly described how the Roc read a couple little sight words books to her that morning. \u00a0Books that he hadn\u2019t read in a while, but could read at one time. \u00a0At first he said he couldn\u2019t do it, and after her prompt he started to read. \u00a0He even self corrected when he made a mistake, and then went back and reread the sentence. \u00a0I grinned when I told her that I started to write her an email that morning, because he finally started to read those little books to me the night before. \u00a0She has been sending a couple home every few weeks as he mastered them, but he would never read them to me, until now. It was so nice to see her, to connect for a few minutes face to face, and to hear her joy at his progress. \u00a0I love that she sees the positive and that she shares it with me. Then on Friday when I got home from running an errand there was a message from Ms. G. \u00a0I will admit to my heart kicking when I first heard her voice, one of the last times she called me it was to warn me that the Roc had not had a good afternoon. \u00a0But it was a \u201cgood news call,\u201d and I don\u2019t know if all teachers do this periodically or if it is something just she does, either way, it\u2019s wonderful to hear the positive and to know that she is celebrating it just as much as we do. Her message: Hi there, it\u2019s Ms. G calling with a good news phone call for the Roc. \u00a0He has done an awesome job this morning. \u00a0He did his sight word test with me for his first grade sight words from Mrs. H and got 36 out of 55 and breezed through them which was so amazing to see. \u00a0Then, he\u00a0is bringing 3 books home today. \u00a0He even went and read one to Mr. H (assistant Principal) to show off which was a huge step because he was super nervous to do it. \u00a0He got down there, walked in and he read the book! \u00a0When we walked out he said \u201cthat was really fun, can I do it again?\u201d \u00a0So that was pretty awesome. I just wanted to call and tell you he was doing a great job and to have a great weekend! All of that  is  pretty awesome. But what is really awesome is that she shared it with us. \u00a0That she took the time to call me and let me know that he willingly read his sight words, and that she had him go down and read a book to the assistant Principal! \u00a0 What a confidence booster for him! \u00a0What a great idea! When I asked the Roc about it he grinned and said, \u201d I did! \u00a0I read a book to Mr. H even though I was nervous! \u00a0I did a good job!\u201d It makes me smile every time I think about it. \u00a0I\u2019m happy to send him off to school knowing that he is being seen for more than just the deficits. \u00a0The progress is also celebrated. \u00a0That means more to me than words can describe.

{"date": "December 2, 2011", "body": "\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything with my blog in a long time,\u201d I said to my sister last night. \u201cI KNOW! \u00a0I keep checking and it\u2019s still on effing HALLOWEEN!\u201d she responded, quite passionately. \u00a0I had no idea anyone was still reading it. \u00a0I rarely check the stat counter anymore. So much has happened, yet it\u2019s really the same old, same old stuff. \u00a0Joy and heartache, progress and the ever present gap. \u00a0Leaps forward, backward, and sideways, all in the same day, and sometimes in the same breath. We had fall conferences, we had an IEP meeting, we signed off on evaluations to make sure the Roc meets MN criteria for autism, we have another meeting scheduled to go over the results. \u00a0I feel a sense of peace for the placement he is in right now, and my heart constricts when I think of having to figure this all out again next year. \u00a0I am amazed by the work that comes home and feel the gap widening between him and his peers. \u00a0There is just so much to teach, and so much of it isn\u2019t just the\u00a0academics. \u00a0But he\u2019s learning! \u00a0He started to haltingly read small sight words books to me and the pride in his eyes is so bright it brought tears to mine. \u00a0We work every day, and there isn\u2019t enough time in the afternoons/evenings to get to it all. \u00a0There has to be some balance, he needs time to be a kid. \u00a0I feel the weight of responsibility riding high on my shoulders, I am such a huge piece of the school puzzle. \u00a0Some days I feel strong enough to carry it, and just as often the pressure makes me feel as if I am drowning. We had  Thanksgiving  at my sister\u2019s house and it was good to be with family this year. \u00a0We arrived right as the food was being served up, a little later than we should have perhaps, but perfect timing for the Roc who has a hard time waiting for things to get started and was already anxious about the fact that my sister\u2019s in-laws would be there (never mind that he spent time at  their cabin  this summer!) \u00a0After dinner the kids did a feather hunt \u2013 the big kids hid the brightly colored feathers all over the yard and the Roc and Matthew had to run around find them all. \u00a0Later we went on a \u201cnighttime walk\u201d which the Roc completely enjoyed. After years of not being here, I was really glad to participate in the annual tradition of  baking cookies  all day on \u201cblack Friday\u201d instead of getting maced at Walmart by people racing to buy cheap towels. \u00a0The Roc made it the whole day, helping make cookies, going on more feather hunts, and playing outside. \u00a0He wouldn\u2019t have made it the whole day 2 years ago. \u00a0We would have had to go home, it helps to remind myself of these facts. The Roc is even keeled one day, unglued the next. \u00a0He asks me questions he knows the answers to, repeatedly, and I balance my gratefulness for the asking with the need to teach him to \u201conly ask these questions once.\u201d \u00a0The Roc asks questions I never saw coming, and he comments on things I never knew he was thinking about. \u00a0Again I balance my gratefulness for the asking with the fear of questions to come, and whether I\u2019ll do a good enough job to answer them. \u00a0Have I so far? \u00a0I am still thinking about talking to him about autism, but is he ready? \u00a0Or did I wait too long? \u00a0Should I have done this already? \u00a0I am paralyzed and am waiting for the right moment, I do not think it\u2019s a conversation I can schedule. The Roc plays more than he ever has, and he adores his cousin Matthew. \u00a0I often hear, \u201cMatthew is my favorite cousin,\u201d from the Roc. \u00a0The first thing he asks me every day when he gets home from school, \u201cCan Matthew come over?\u201d \u00a0I often have to remind him not to boss, that he needs to take turns doing what Matthew wants to do, and that we must end the day nicely \u2013 he never wants Matthew to leave. \u00a0We have days where Matthew has to go home not long after he gets here because the Roc threw the fit of all fits, and then the polar opposite days like yesterday where they made up a game with stuffed animals and when it was time for Matthew to go home because it was getting dark the Roc said goodbye nicely. \u00a0There is so much to teach the Roc about social skills, I am overwhelmed sometimes listening to him converse with Matthew, and then doubly overwhelmed when I think about the fact that he is conversing\u2013 with a peer!  \u00a0It\u2019s been so good for him, in so many ways to be able to see his cousin so frequently. \u00a0I am so glad we bought this house, one street up from my sister and her family. \u00a0Now if I could only get the Roc to relax his stance about talking to Matthew at school. \u00a0They even have recess together and the Roc won\u2019t play with him, \u00a0he tells me, \u201cI\u2019m too anxious on the playground to talk to him,\u201d and my heart hurts and I simultaneously rejoice that he can tell me that he feels anxious, that he can articulate himself in this way. Around and around, up and down. We are plugging along at this life. New location, same stuff. Joy, heartache, pain, progress. Life. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://littlepopblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/happy-thanksgiving.html", "http://littlepopblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/cookie-day.html"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/life-a-fall-recap/", "title": "Life + A Fall\u00a0Recap"},
{"date": "December 6, 2011", "body": "I\u2019ve been a little nervous lately, actually I\u2019ve been nervous ever since I clicked submit on the online registration for the local community education basketball program a few weeks ago. \u00a0Whenever I think of what\u2019s to come, my stomach gets cold and tight. Did I make a mistake? Is he going to flip out? Is this too much too fast? What if he hates it? I have a deep fear of him having horrible childhood memories. \u00a0Scars from things I made him try or attend. But then I remember \u2013 he did baseball, and he liked it. \u00a0He tried soccer, and even though he didn\u2019t like it as much as baseball, he kept at it. Then I remember those were programs for children with special needs, this will not be, and my stomach clenches again. This will be typical children with typical families. \u00a0Parents that know nothing about how different some children can be, and how to talk to their own children about accepting differences. Some parents will not judge, but I know that many will. \u00a0It\u2019s so easy to judge what you don\u2019t know, what looks like bad parenting, or bratty behavior. Some will have patience, many will not. Some will be compassionate, many will not. Some parents are letting their kids try it out, maybe they signed them up, or maybe the kids asked to join. The kids are in 1st grade, it\u2019s not competitive sports\u2026yet. \u00a0I know that some parents will competitive, but I hope most are not. \u00a0It should be about fun at this age, I know that the fun mentality is fading fast from the \u201cmy kid is so advanced\u201d generation. \u00a0(I used to hate those words stringed together in that order, oh wait, I still do.) It\u2019s when I think of these things that my stomach clenches and I worry about the Roc. \u00a0How he will handle it all. But then I remember that on the morning of the last day to sign up for the cheaper price, (hey, $5 is $5) while the Roc was taking his daily morning bath (don\u2019t eff with morning or bedtime routines around here people, sacred ground) I sat down in the bathroom to talk to him. \u00a0I needed to know what he really thought before he left for school. \u00a0I had waited to the last moment to ask the question for real, after bouncing it off my autism mama friends and after asking myself many times if I should even make this attempt. \u00a0Rather, if I should have the Roc make this attempt. I told him that there would be practices once a week and a game on the weekend. \u00a0That the practices would be in a large gymnasium with lots of kids, all bouncing basketballs, shooting, tossing to each other, and shouting. \u00a0The parents would be there too, watching, possibly clapping and cheering. \u00a0That it would be loud, with lots of movement, and I kind of choked saying the words, waiting for him to speak. \u00a0I said the games would be similar to the practices but there would definitely be lots of clapping and cheering, but it would be possible for him to sit on the bench and not play. \u00a0To watch if that was what worked for him. He stared at me over the bubbles. \u00a0I wondered what was going to come out, if he was going to answer my question, or start up his monologue about waterfalls and birthday parties. \u00a0After a long pause he spoke. \u201cWell, I go to gym class and all the kids bounce balls and run and yell and I got used to that\u2026.so I think I will get used to basketball too,\u201d the Roc said to me. I leaned back, feeling that familiar prickling behind my eyes, and found that I couldn\u2019t speak. Then he said, \u201cI think I would like practice, but could I maybe sit out during the games? And don\u2019t sit far away or up high on the bleachers okay? I want to be able to see you.\u201d \u201cSounds good Roc, I\u2019m going to sign you up today okay?\u201d I told him. \u201cOkay Mommy,\u201d the Roc said before launching into his favorite questions about the water slide we got for his birthday party this summer. Later that morning, after he got on the van, I completed the registration online, filled in my credit card information, and clicked submit. \u00a0Then I wrote to my mama friends, a \u201choly shit, I just signed the Roc up for basketball, my heart is racing,\u201d kind of thing. \u00a0I got the love I needed and the advice to ease him into it and I remembered my friend Carrie\u2019s wise words that success looks different for our kids and that\u2019s okay. \u00a0It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t want to play, if we spend a lot of time watching. \u00a0Whatever works for him, if he can be a part of it, because he wants to, that\u2019s success. Now, whenever I feel that cold tightness taking hold, causing me to doubt myself and the Roc, I think of this conversation. \u00a0I gave him a choice and this is what he chose. \u00a0He wants to try, and I need to give him lots of credit for that. \u00a0It may not work out, I am preparing myself for that, but I am also preparing myself for him to be successful, however that looks for him. \u00a0In the words of my mama friend  Jess , \u201cWe prepped as though we knew it would work, because we knew that it *could*.\u201d All I know for sure right now is the Roc loves basketball and he wants to try. We\u2019ve prepped. Tonight we go to pick up his schedule, roster and basketball jersey. The kickoff is on Saturday. A big \u201ctoo be continued\u2026.\u201d \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/ho-ho-ho/"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/basketball/", "title": "Basketball"},
{"date": "December 15, 2011", "body": "Everyday I cringe as I pack the Roc\u2019s lunch. \u00a0He won\u2019t eat a sandwich of any kind, not meat, not cheese, no nut spreads, not even nutella! \u00a0I tried leftovers in thermos containers, but those came back untouched. \u00a0So I send him in with yogurt, cheese, juice, fruit, cereal, and a cookie. \u00a0Every day. \u00a0And he eats it all. \u00a0Every day. I wince because it doesn\u2019t seem like enough food for my boy who EATS. \u00a0I worry that he is still hungry when he leaves the cafeteria. \u00a0Hunger =\u00a0irritability, frustration, ramping behaviors, and eventual meltdowns. \u00a0I push those worries aside because he is holding himself together all day long at school. Also, he eats a good breakfast. \u00a0He gets on the van with a full tank, though just like his lunches, breakfast for the Roc isn\u2019t typical. Examples: Monday: \u00a03 bean chili with cheddar cheese (think pinto beans, black beans, kidney beans, zucchini, carrots, red pepper, tomatoes, corn) Tuesday: \u00a0chicken burrito (chicken, cheese,\u00a0re-fried\u00a0beans & salsa) Wednesday: \u00a0Shepards Pie (potato, beef, carrots, peas) Thursday:\u00a0Cincinnati\u00a0chili with\u00a0spaghetti\u00a0and cheddar cheese Definitely not what I crave in the morning! \u00a0But it works for him and that\u2019s all that matters.

{"date": "February 2, 2012", "body": "GC and I were sitting on the couch watching TV, I had the foot rest extended, dog curled up at my side, blanket on my lap protecting me from the cold bowl of ice cream I was enjoying. \u00a0I had put the Roc to bed 45 minutes earlier and I assumed he was sleeping peacefully. I was wrong. \u201cMommy?\u2026\u201d came a small voice from the landing overlooking the family room. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Roc? \u00a0I thought you were sleeping,\u201d I said, looking up at him, waving my hand for GC to turn the volume down on the TV. His voice cracked, his face crumpled, and the tears came when he said \u201cI don\u2019t have any friends. \u00a0How come I don\u2019t have any friends Mommy?\u201d Time stood still, my mouth dropped open, and I felt my stomach plummet so fast I thought it might go through the floor. \u00a0I have wondered if and when he would utter those words, when he would ask, when he would feel the pain of isolation. \u00a0It was more painful to hear them than I had imagined. \u00a0The anguish in his voice cut me to the bone. \u00a0I know that it took so much for him to come out and tell us what he was thinking. \u00a0I know that he was laying in bed thinking them, thinking about himself, thinking about the kids at school, the kids in the community, and feeling pain that he wasn\u2019t connected in friendship with any of them. I thought I might throw up as I got up off the couch, silently placed my bowl on the counter and started upstairs. \u00a0My mind raced and my heart thumped in my chest, my thoughts spinning over, wondering where to start. \u201cLet\u2019s talk Roc, climb into bed, schooch over a bit, I want to lay down with you,\u201d I told him as he ground his hands against his eyes, he\u2019s always hated the sensation of tears. \u00a0A memory of the Roc as a toddler screaming at his reflection flashed in my mind. \u00a0My baby hitting himself in the face, trying to smash his tears, and the desperation I felt as I tried to keep him from hurting himself. \u00a0I push the memory away, the desperation I feel now so similar to then. \u00a0I try to concentrate. \u201cRoc, you do have friends,\u201d I start, but he interrupted me, \u201cAt School! \u00a0I don\u2019t have friends at school! \u00a0I don\u2019t have a friend to play with on the playground\u2026\u201d he said tearfully. I searched my mind for what to say, because the reality is that the Roc does not have friends. \u00a0He has family, but there is no one from school he talks about, he cannot tell me the names of his classmates, no one comes over to play with him that isn\u2019t related to him. \u00a0He is so painfully anxious around unfamiliar children, and almost every single time we interact with a child, I have to prompt him through the introduction and how to ask the other child his name. \u00a0Most typical first graders do not have the patience and persistence needed to be friends with the Roc. \u00a0Again, memory floods my mind and I cannot help but think about seeing the Roc during lunchtime the week before while I was working as a substitute paraprofessional at his elementary school. \u00a0I got to see my boy sit in the same spot he does everyday, and while being in that noisy, busy lunchroom, and eating his lunch is a huge success; it doesn\u2019t take away the sting of watching him surrounded by children but utterly alone. \u00a0No one talked to him, and he talked to no one but the para who helped him open his yogurt. \u00a0My heart ached as I searched for the right things to say to his tearful face. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you love to play with A and N in Ms. G\u2019s room, I\u2019ve seen the pictures Ms. G sends me on the computer! \u00a0You guys play camping and pizza party, right?\u201d I asked him enthusiastically. \u00a0\u201cAre there any other kids in your class that you talk to?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know their names,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk about friendship and how to be a friend, okay?\u201d I asked. I went on to talk about how friends greet each other, share toys, play nicely, and listen to each other speak. \u00a0I also talked about how some things are harder for some children and then some things are easier for others, and that everyone has things they are good at and things that are hard for them. \u00a0I could see him processing. \u00a0I hoped that what I said made sense, and that it wasn\u2019t overwhelming. I left his room that night feeling like I could have done or said more. I went back in a couple hours later to sit on the floor next to him while he slept, tears slipping down my cheeks, feeling utterly powerless. Here we go , I thought to myself as my battle weary heart thumped in my chest. \u00a0A few years ago our battles were different, not harder, not easier, but closer to home. \u00a0Food issues, potty training issues, going to the store without screaming, getting a haircut without a meltdown, echoalia, pronoun reversal, getting on a bike, going down a slide alone, asking questions, stimming, etc. These social skills issues are a heartache of a different variety, and now his heart is hurting too. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/friendship-heartache/", "title": "Friendship + Heartache"},
{"date": "February 7, 2012", "body": "Last week I subbed as a paraprofessional at the Roc\u2019s elementary school again. \u00a0Part of my job that day was recess duty. \u00a0I was\u00a0apprehensive about being out there during the 1st grade recess time, as the Roc didn\u2019t know I was going to be there. When I saw him, I could see anxiety written all over his face. \u00a0He started to climb the stairs, following a little boy in his class, I heard him ask \u201cdo you want to play with me?\u201d and when that little boy started chasing some other kids the Roc turned to me with tears in his eyes. \u201cI want to play with N, but he doesn\u2019t want to play with me. \u00a0No one wants to play with me. \u00a0It\u2019s more fun to play with a friend then by myself.\u201d My chest constricted as I looked at his face. \u00a0I was responsible for watching the whole playground, I couldn\u2019t spend all my time with my own child, even if that was what I wanted. \u00a0I flashed back to  the night  he told me he didn\u2019t have any friends and I felt so sad. \u00a0I looked around the playground, but it is hard to pick out the few kids I know in his grade out of 120 kids bundled up in winter gear. \u00a0I saw the special ed recess para over by the bin of balls and told the Roc to go to her and get a ball, maybe he could practice his basketball skills. \u00a0I watched him with my heart in my throat and kept an eye on the kids trying to sneak into the playground without snow pants and boots. \u00a0A few minutes later the Roc was back, again with tears in his eyes. \u00a0He spent the last few minutes of recess sitting on a bench under the big slide, his eyes and nose red from the tears he was holding back. \u00a0As the whistle blew and the children all ran to line up, my own eyes were filled with tears behind my sunglasses. \u00a0It is hard to see your child without a friend and desperately wanting that connection, painful to watch him be so upset at school, gut wrenching to know he is going to sit in the same spot in the cafeteria, feeling alone the whole time. But I also knew that I was lucky. \u00a0I saw without a doubt an area that needs to be tweaked in the Roc\u2019s day and skills that I need to do more to teach him at home. \u00a0There is no denying that what he told me that night is true, he wants a friend and is having a very hard time connecting on the playground. \u00a0The Roc participates in a social skills group and a friendship group at school, and his special ed teacher is absolutely wonderful. \u00a0She has done little\u00a0activities\u00a0in her room and had the Roc invite a classmate, and there is time everyday that he plays with two children in her room. \u00a0I also knew that I needed to bring the conversation I had with the Roc the other night, and what I just witnessed on the playground to his teachers attention. \u00a0We need to come up with more strategies\u00a0to help him start to build the skills needed to be a friend. \u00a0The desire is there, now he just needs the tools. There was a 10 minute break before the next grade came out for recess so I went to see if the Roc\u2019s special ed teacher was in her room, my eyes were burning with tears as I entered and told her about the conversation I had with the Roc, and what had just happened on the playground. \u00a0She immediately told me about the things he is doing right when he interacts with the small group in her room, and the things that are tripping him up outside at recess\u2013the biggest being his refusal to do what someone else wants to do. \u00a0He has an idea of what he wants to play and how he wants to play it when he gets outside, and when the child he asks to play doesn\u2019t want to do exactly what he wants to do, he walks away. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen him do this, so I know this rigidity is an issue. \u00a0She showed me a book she had started reading with him and told me I could take a copy home at the end of the day. \u00a0She said she would sit down with the special ed recess para and they would try to figure out some good matches to hook the Roc up with on the playground. For the rest of the day, in the back of my mind, I thought about the Roc. \u00a0I knew it was time for me to get more involved, time to reach out and arrange play dates with my friends kids, with the other parents I know with children on the spectrum, and to try to connect with some of the children he does know at school. \u00a0Those are all things that I can do and need to do for him to develop the social skills he needs to participate in life the way he obviously wants to. \u00a0I talked to GC later that evening and told him we needed to get more involved in helping the Roc navigate and learn social skills. \u00a0He needs preteaching and lots of practice, and it is up to us to make some connections for him outside of school. A few days later at a support group meeting for parents of children on the spectrum I brought up the painful conversation I had with the Roc and what I had witnessed on the playground on Monday. \u00a0I had to stop and look up at the ceiling, willing myself not to cry, while recounting watching him hold back sobs of\u00a0sadness. \u00a0There were some suggestions and lots of empathy as some have children dealing with the exact same issues. \u00a0But it was the quick conversation I had with another mom at the end of the evening that gave me hope. \u00a0She asked if we could set up a play date for our boys, her\u2019s needing some time to practice social skills too. \u00a0I was flooded with gratitude and told her we would love to have them over. \u00a0We are setting up a play date for this week after school. \u00a0Then another mom from the group emailed me and told me how she was thinking about what I said at the meeting and asked if the Roc liked to jump as she had a couple passes for a jumping place in a town nearby. \u00a0I immediately emailed her back and said we would love to join them. \u00a0I also contacted one of my friends who lives a couple miles away and has two young boys to see if they would want to get the boys together soon, and they said yes. I was heart broken that night when he cried and told me he didn\u2019t have any friends. \u00a0I dropped down into a grief I haven\u2019t felt in a long time. But he is different, so different from the little boy he used to be. \u00a0The little boy who needed a bubble of personal space around him, who literally pushed other children away from him. \u00a0Who would freak out and scream when we would go to a new house for a play date. \u00a0The little boy who didn\u2019t understand how to play with toys, and would grab things away from other children. \u00a0The little boy who clung to my side while all the other children ran through the house, making up games, laughing and squealing. \u00a0So different. Now he wants to be a part of everything he shunned when he was younger. He wants a friend. Read that again, because it\u2019s HUGE. He  wants  a friend. He just needs the tools and lots of practice. That I can provide. From grief to hope. The cycle continues.

{"date": "February 8, 2012", "body": "I was rushing to get the dog crated and grab my things before we headed out to basketball practice the other night, thinking it would be better to get there a little bit earlier than we had been, to give the Roc time to shoot and get comfortable before the actual practice started. \u00a0I didn\u2019t expect to find him sitting at the bottom of the stairs, tears glistening in his eyes, his nose and cheeks red. \u00a0GC was sitting on the floor in front of him and we made eye contact and exchanged a silent message as I sat down next to the Roc and put my arms around him. \u00a0He turned his face from mine and leaned slightly away from me, but I hung on, he moved back toward me within seconds. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong sweet-pea?\u201d I asked him. \u00a0He\u2019s been anxious before every practice and the couple games he\u2019s been in so far, but I assumed it would get easier each week. \u00a0I didn\u2019t think it would get harder for him. \u201cI\u2019m upset,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cAre you nervous about going to basketball practice?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOh sweetie, it\u2019s just practice tonight. \u00a0You like practice don\u2019t you? \u00a0You do such a good job!\u201d I tried\u00a0unsuccessfully\u00a0to get him excited. \u00a0His face crumpled and a tear slipped down his cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know when to play defense!\u201d he exclaimed. I fumbled around for the right thing to say, GC and I exchanged another look. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t go tonight,\u201d GC said. \u201cDo you want to go?\u201d I asked the Roc. \u201cYes,\u201d he said and sniffled loudly. \u00a0\u201cBut I think I\u2019m going to be upset for awhile.\u201d \u201cWell, I think you\u2019ll feel better when we get there and you get started, okay?\u201d I said the words, but wondered if tonight was the night he was going to crack, if this was too much pressure. \u00a0We have watched him, so anxious, not always paying attention to directions, a bit awkward and stiff in his movements, but out there all the same. \u00a0Out there. \u00a0On the court, the noisy gym ringed with parents all watching, kids moving in different directions, balls flying, and him in the mix of it all. \u00a0I have been so proud of him. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said standing, another tear sliding down his face which he swiped away. He continued to cry as he put his shoes on and as I helped him shrug into his coat. \u00a0He gasped for air as we drove down the road toward the elementary school. \u00a0My insides hurt and I screamed silently in my head as I looked back at his face contorting as he tried to talk. \u00a0 This shouldn\u2019t be so hard for him! \u00a0He loves basketball! \u00a0It\u2019s not fair! \u00a0He\u2019s just a little kid! \u00a0He shouldn\u2019t be racked with\u00a0paralyzing\u00a0anxiety about going to a basketball practice! \u00a0He\u2019s SEVEN! \u00a0When does this poor kid catch an effing break?!! I held his hand as we walked into the school behind a little boy racing ahead of his mother to get into the gym and get started, his energy trailing behind him as his mother quickened her step to keep up. \u00a0The Roc stopped outside the double doors leading into the gym and I helped him through the motions of getting his track pants off and his shoes back on. \u00a0His eyes were red ringed as he shuffled through the doors and over to get a ball. \u00a0GC and I sat near a basket and waved him over, he started to shoot. \u00a0Shot after shot went in. \u00a0We gave him thumbs up, after thumbs up, big grins on our faces. \u00a0Slowly, so slowly he started to smile just a little when we would catch his eye. \u00a0Then the whistle blew and the kids all ran every which way to their respective coaches. \u00a0We pointed at his two coaches and the Roc quickly shuffled over to them. \u00a0I let out all the air I had been holding in, the food I\u2019d eaten right before we left sat solidly in my stomach. We watched him go through the four stations the different coaches were in charge of the first half of practice. \u00a0He didn\u2019t look at us as much as he did at the previous weeks and we saw him do a few new things he hadn\u2019t done the week before. \u00a0Watching him try to figure out how to jump off one foot and shoot was\u00a0particularly\u00a0interesting and had GC and I chuckling as we watched him watch the coaches feet and try to do what he was told. \u00a0It\u2019s a lot to process and the Roc wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t quite get it. \u00a0I breathed easier as we watched him rotate through all four stations. \u00a0His tears were long gone, and even though he didn\u2019t look at ease with everything and his body was stiff, he was trying, and when he did look our way we gave him big thumbs up signs and a tiny crooked smile would grace his face. The second half of practice, the Roc\u2019s team moved to the cafeteria where they could have a court to themselves. \u201cHere we go,\u201d I said to GC. \u00a0\u201cDefense, the thing that makes the Roc the most nervous.\u201d \u00a0I figured they were going to play a practice game, and that is what was giving the Roc the most anxiety. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t understand when to play defense and when to play offense\u2026and I don\u2019t think he really understands the difference between the two. \u00a0The coaches called the boys over to talk, the Roc sat just on the outside of the group, as he does every time. \u00a0Instead of doing a practice game they did a few other skill activities, geared toward learning how to play defense. They broke off into pairs, one boy would dribble the ball and try to move down the court, the other boy would stay with him, arms out, trying to block the opportunity to shoot. \u00a0First the Roc had to defend. \u00a0One of the coaches talked him through it, reminded him to keep his arms out, stay with his guy, move his feet, etc. \u00a0He did a good job and he was smiling a little bit. \u00a0Then it was the Roc\u2019s turn to dribble and move around the court. That is when the Roc started to smile. \u00a0Really smile. \u00a0The smile I see at swimming lessons, the smile I used to see when he was horseback riding in Delaware. \u00a0 The coach walked over to where we were sitting, \u201cHe\u2019s really having fun! \u00a0Look at him smile!\u201d he said to us. The coach had noticed, noticed that this was the first time the Roc really smiled, and he was moving his feet and really trying to keep up. \u00a0I thought my own face might split open. \u00a0When practice was over the Roc came over to us, big grin still plastered on his face, and said, \u201cI did a good job Mommy!\u201d \u201cYou did sweetie, I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d I told him holding up my hand for a high five. GC and the Roc shot a few baskets and the coach who came over to say something about the Roc\u2019s smile during practice walked over to me again and said, \u201cHe did a good job tonight.\u201d \u201cI was worried,\u201d I told him. \u00a0\u201cThe Roc was in tears before we left, while we were driving here, and was still upset when practice started.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cYes, he was very nervous and he doesn\u2019t understand how to play defense and when to play defense. \u00a0He was really worried about that tonight.\u201d \u201cA lot of the kids don\u2019t get that yet,\u201d the coach told me. \u00a0\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you think I can do to help him, just let me know, okay? \u00a0If I need to explain something to him again I can do that.\u201d \u201cThat would be so great. \u00a0That\u2019s exactly what the Roc needs,\u201d I told him. \u00a0\u201cRepetition is key with him. \u00a0He needs directions repeated, he needs to be reminded to pay attention, and right now what\u2019s really throwing him off during the practice games and the real games on Saturdays is when to play defense. \u00a0He\u2019s incredibly lost out there and appears to be looking for his guy the whole time, even when his team has the ball.\u201d \u201cSure, I think a lot of the kids need help with that. \u00a0We are going to work on that. \u00a0You can talk to me anytime if there\u2019s something I can do to help him.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d I said, hoping he could see just how much I meant it. \u00a0These guys are giving up their time by volunteering to coach the basketball team, it means so very much to me that they take the time to look out for the Roc. As we walked down the hallway towards the exit, the Roc looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m not nervous anymore. \u00a0I did it. \u00a0I tried my best.\u201d \u201cYou did baby, you did your best and that\u2019s exactly what your supposed to do. \u00a0I am so proud of you.\u201d The reality is that pride doesn\u2019t seem a big enough word to describe how I felt at that moment. What matters most to me is that he did his best, he knows it, and he knows that is what is most important. What more could I ask for?

{"date": "December 22, 2011", "body": "***I started this post on December 6 th, right after I opened this:*** Then life got in my way. So here you go, the story of that box and one of my favorite people in the world: I have wanted to write about my best friend Christa for a long time. \u00a0But how do you encapsulate and explain a person like her? \u00a0She is one of the kindest, smartest, most generous and caring people I have come across. \u00a0How many times have you heard someone described that way? \u00a0Does it sound false? \u00a0Cliche? It\u2019s all true. I did not know her 4 years ago. \u00a0Autism brought us together. \u00a0When the Roc was diagnosed I told the few people I saw on a regular basis, one of which was my friend and neighbor Tracy. \u00a0I cried, and she cried with me, then she told me about her friend Christa, who she insisted I contact. \u00a0She told me Christa\u2019s son was also on the spectrum, and that she could be someone to lean on during this difficult time. \u00a0That it would be good to know someone who went through the same things I was. \u00a0I told her I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t feel up to meeting anyone new right then. I just didn\u2019t want to belong to that club. \u00a0I didn\u2019t want to talk about it to someone I didn\u2019t know. \u00a0I wasn\u2019t ready to talk. \u00a0So I waited a few months. Eventually I did call Christa and we had a long, heartfelt conversation. \u00a0I felt like I was talking to someone I had known for a long time and I felt like I was finally talking to someone who \u201cgot it.\u201d \u00a0Someone who got the anguish and pain I was feeling, understood the depths of my fear and worry like no one else did. \u00a0We got together not long after, and then again, and again and again. \u00a0We got our boys together and found that it was nice for them. \u00a0Tracy was right, I did lean on Christa, I still do. She has been the person I call or email when I feel that I am not good enough to do this autism mama job, not smart enough to figure out what the Roc needs, just not enough. \u00a0When I don\u2019t think I can be the mother that the Roc needs me to be, I call or email Christa. \u00a0She says and writes all the right things. \u00a0She throws me a rope when the waves are crashing over my head and I just cannot get a breath. \u00a0We spent a lot of time together when I lived in Delaware. In September 2010 we went on a  road trip together , she has been in the long process of writing her first book and needed to do some research. \u00a0\u00a0She asked me to come with, as her travel partner and photographer. \u00a0I jumped at the chance. \u00a0At that time I had never been away from the Roc for more than a night or two, and I could count those nights on one hand. \u00a0We flew down to Florida and then drove back up the coast, stopping where she needed to stop, eating, laughing, talking, and taking lots of pictures. \u00a0We had a blast. \u00a0We travel well together. \u00a0We had so much fun that we decided to try to get away for a long weekend together every year. It was hard to tell her when we put our townhouse in Delaware on the market last October. \u00a0It was even harder to leave her when we actually moved away in June. \u00a0She brought us dinner on our last night in town, and I\u2019ll never forget that she came to see Giancarlo and I off on our very last morning in Delaware. \u00a0She helped us load our travel bags and animals into our tiny Celica and she stood on the sidewalk waving goodbye as we drove out of our neighborhood. \u00a0I know that she got into her car and cried when we rounded the curve out of sight because I could hardly see through my own tears. \u00a0We were both worried that we would lose our connection, but we emailed a lot over the summer, sometimes late at night, catching each other just when we needed to be caught. \u00a0We also kept our promise to get together every fall and she flew out to see us in September. We had a great weekend together, tinged with the grief I was wrestling after my miscarriage, as she arrived days after I lost the baby. \u00a0I worried that she didn\u2019t have as much fun as both of us had anticipated, my heartache coloring my mood and affecting both of us by the end of the weekend. \u00a0I had wanted to show her a good time, my favorite places, and the beauty to be found in Minnesota. \u00a0And I did. \u00a0We went to up north, stayed in a hotel, ate out, and I showed her my favorite places on the \u201cnorth shore.\u201d We exchanged many lengthy emails after she returned to Delaware. \u00a0We\u00a0strengthened\u00a0our bond and deepened our friendship with what we were finally able to share, those things that weighed heavy in the air while we were actually together were finally examined. Christa and I keep in touch regularly, we talk on the phone when we get the chance, we exchange emails and facebook comments. \u00a0She recently got an iphone, but I haven\u2019t gotten her to text\u00a0regularly, yet. On December 6th I saw that she had posted on facebook about being an elf and I figured she had found the perfect gift for her son and was delighting in that small/big victory. \u00a0I was surprised later that day when I\u00a0received\u00a0a box and upon turning it over saw her handwriting. \u00a0I didn\u2019t put everything together until I opened it, saw what was inside and then read the enclosed document. \u201cOH MY\u2026WHAT IS THIS? \u00a0Well, it\u2019s a Mantle in a box, that\u2019s what it is. \u00a0Because I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not the kind of girl who sits around for hours on end daydreaming about how you can make your fireplace look like it came out of the Holiday Edition of the Pottery Barn catalog, I thought I would take the liberty of doing it for you. \u00a0And also because letting your gorgeous mantle go naked for the holidays is just a crime. \u00a0In Minnesota, anyway.\u201d Christa had included a contents list and some instructions including, \u201cTake the\u00a0pine cone\u00a0ornaments and Christmas balls out of the boxes and group them together to make clusters of ornaments (usually in threes.) \u00a0DO NOT group the\u00a0pine cone ornaments\u00a0with two balls or it will look like this:\u201d\u00a0 and she included a little drawing of how offensive that particular grouping would appear complete with the sentiment of,  \u201cand that\u2019s just gross\u201d  next to it. \u00a0I howled with laughter, tears in my eyes at first from her thoughtfulness, and then because of her humor. The document is a couple pages long, complete with drawings of how the finished mantle may appear, and also lots of suggestions of what I could do to it in the future, complete with pictures and notes. \u00a0Christa has a good eye and lots of good ideas! She knows me well. \u00a0I really wanted to decorate my mantle, I even went to look at some things and left the store empty-handed because I was too overwhelmed by all the choices. \u00a0The very morning that box arrived I had planned on stopping at Target to at least get some lights to go across the mantle but when I got to the exit, I kept on driving. I carried the box into my family room, agreed to let the Roc watch a Scooby-Doo movie, then looked up at my poor attempt to decorate my mantle. Then I got to work, following Christa\u2019s directions, shoving the dog away from the garland again and again, and finally I was done. \u00a0It\u2019s probably not as good as Christa would do, but I am pretty happy with it, and it\u2019s so pretty at night. So thank you Christa. \u00a0Thank you for being such a good friend to me. \u00a0Thank you for making me laugh, for cheering me on, for throwing me a rope when I need one, for always being there.

{"date": "December 23, 2011", "body": "3 situations that had me chuckling to myself this week: I ran into the Roc\u2019s special ed teacher as I was leaving the school after volunteering in the Roc\u2019s classroom on Tuesday. \u00a0We walked down the hall together and she said to me, \u201cYou\u2019re house must really smell\u2026\u201d and felt my eyes widen as I wondered how she was going to finish that sentence, \u201cwith all that  garlic \u00a0on your Christmas tree!\u201d I instantly knew what she was talking about as I heard the Roc\u2019s voice in my head. \u201cOh, Garland!\u201d\u00a0I laughed as she said, \u201cIt took me a minute to figure out what he was talking about. \u00a0He\u2019s such a cutie and he insisted it was  garlic , not garland.\u201d *** The Roc was quietly singing Jingle Bells while I loaded a movie for him to watch. \u00a0I turned around and asked him to sing louder, and sure enough, \u201cJingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way. \u00a0Oh what fun it is to ride in a wondrous sleigh, HEY!\u201d I giggled, but didn\u2019t correct him. \u00a0I would like to ride in a\u00a0wondrous\u00a0sleigh too. *** As gifts arrive from our far away relatives I place them under the Christmas tree and the Roc has been very excited about the presents with his name on them. \u00a0One of his gifts had a teeny, tiny tear in the wrapping paper and he spent some time trying to peer into that little hole. \u00a0Yesterday I was on my computer upstairs and could hear the\u00a0unmistakable\u00a0sound of paper slowly ripping. \u00a0I tiptoed to the railing and looked down into the family room. \u00a0There he is with that certain gift\u2026 Later when I asked him if he was looking at the presents under the tree he said, \u201cYes! \u00a0Guess what Mommy? \u00a0The hole got bigger in that present!\u201d \u201cHmmm, I wonder how that happened?\u201d I asked. \u201cI stuck my finger in there and tore it,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo what\u2019s in there?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt looks pink. \u00a0I think it might be a pink dress. \u00a0It says my name on it, but I don\u2019t want a dress.\u201d I love his honesty. \u00a0Any other kid would have lied and said they didn\u2019t do it, someone else did, or the dog ripped it. \u00a0That\u2019s what I would have done at his age! \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/img_0537.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/3-holiday-laughs/", "title": "3 Holiday Laughs"},
{"date": "January 16, 2012", "body": "Written on Wednesday night when I came home from a evening out in the neighborhood. I was feeling the happiness only a few margarita\u2019s can provide, buzzy, light, and slightly\u00a0numb. \u00a0I needed it, the evening had completely fallen apart around dinner time. \u00a0A meltdown. \u00a0Lots of screaming \u2014 you can\u2019t have a meltdown in this house without the eardrum shattering vocals. \u00a0I wanted to get out, but I also didn\u2019t want to go. \u00a0Because sometimes it feels like an act, like I am a big fake, because it feels like I have nothing in common with these other moms. \u00a0My desire to escape won over the part of me that wanted to hide alone in a bathtub full of bubbles. \u00a0I caught my sister as she and her next door neighbor were leaving, they drove up the hill to pick me up. But in the end the margaritas were not enough. \u00a0Because I cannot escape this reality, our reality, his reality. \u00a0It so often rocks me to my core. \u00a0And so even though I should be sleeping off my margarita(s), I am awake at my computer,\u00a0clumsily\u00a0typing out my thoughts, reliving the simplest of conversations. I had told a cute little story about my 1st grade nephew calling me his \u201cfriend\u2019 and then his \u201cmom\u2019s friend\u201d when a classmate asked him who I was at school a couple weeks ago. \u00a0I mentioned that I also saw my 4th grade niece in the hallway and said hi. \u00a0I worried that I may have been too enthusiastic the last time I saw her, I wondered if I embarrassed her. \u00a0 My sister reveals that her daughter tells her when she sees me at school\u2026and that one day a classmate had asked her how she knew the Roc\u2019s mom. \u00a0This girl\u2019s little sister (a first grader in the Roc\u2019s class) doesn\u2019t like the Roc\u2026 those words came in like a punch I didn\u2019t see coming. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t help it, I deflated. \u00a0I tried to ask what was said, knowing that I wouldn\u2019t know what actually was said, I asked who the girl was, who the sister might be, the faces of the Roc\u2019s classmates flashing through my mind. \u00a0A name was dropped with a question, and I saw this girl in my mind and felt an internal crushing. A little girl in the Roc\u2019s class talked about how she didn\u2019t like him at home or on the bus, it doesn\u2019t matter where really, somewhere and enough times that her 4th grade sister knew who I was. \u00a0Knew who the Roc was. \u00a0Spewed that her little sister didn\u2019t like my kid. \u00a0How many times has this happened? Someone next to me piped up that her son didn\u2019t seem to care about friendship and the ladies started sharing little bits about their own boys and friends, shaking their heads. \u00a0They went around the table, \u201cit\u2019s BOYS!\u201d they agreed. \u00a0\u201cThey just don\u2019t care or communicate like girls do!\u201d they said with smiles. \u00a0\u201cBoys just don\u2019t do friendships like girls!\u201d they took heart in their agreement. \u00a0\u201cBoys!\u201d they sighed. \u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s just because they are boys. \u00a0What can you do?  seemed to be the consensus. \u00a0Not for me, I felt no peace from these sentiments. I looked down at the table, my eyes memorizing the color and pattern of the wood, swiping over the chairs, comparing them to the chairs at my parents house.  \u00a0How alike , my mind registered as I detached myself from the conversation. \u00a0 Because it\u2019s so much more than the Roc just being a BOY. \u00a0So much more. \u00a0A gulf separates me from those who can shake their heads and mutter  Boys!  with a charming smile. \u00a0The mountain I climb stretches\u00a0out before me, the peak hidden in the clouds. A mountain I often feel that I do not have the tools to climb. \u00a0Wasn\u2019t I supposed to take classes on this? \u00a0Where\u2019s the instructor? \u00a0I forgot my book! \u00a0Do we have a quiz? \u00a0Aren\u2019t we going to do a test run? \u00a0I don\u2019t think I\u2019m physically able! \u00a0Where are the clamps? \u00a0The rope? \u00a0Huh? \u00a0I have to climb now? \u00a0No safety net? \u00a0No fall back? \u00a0It\u2019s just me? \u00a0What? \u00a0Are you kidding me?! \u00a0What if I fall? \u00a0Shit! \u00a0I don\u2019t think I can do this! I thought about my boy, my Roc, how hard he works to be in this world that doesn\u2019t always make sense to him. \u00a0I thought about this little girl and wondered what her parents say about differences, wondered if she ignores the Roc, or if she watches him, giggling at him with other children. My boy who is over run with\u00a0anxiety\u00a0all.the.time. \u00a0Who is mainstreamed, and as far as I\u2019ve been told, is holding it together\u2026but\u2026who still cannot hold an unprompted conversation with a peer. \u00a0Who cannot read facial expressions. \u00a0My kid who struggles with change, who struggles with certain academics, who struggles to interact and fit in. \u00a0My boy who likes to be around kids. \u00a0Who cannot figure out why he doesn\u2019t have friends\u2026who recently cried when he told me for the very first time that he didn\u2019t have a friend.and.it.broke.my.heart. \u00a0The air in the room was gone as his voice cracked and I held his gaze. \u00a0My boy. \u00a0He works so hard every day and 99.9% of people do not realize this about him. That is what I thought about as they smiled and grumbled about the nature of boys. Because it\u2019s so much bigger than that for me, for him. \u00a0So much so that I do not have adequate words to describe what it is like to see your child struggle, to try to teach your child to read people, to say hello, to not scream when things do not go the way they want, and on and on. \u00a0Everything must be taught. \u00a0From the simplest steps to the biggest. \u00a0Everything. \u00a0It\u2019s so much to carry, so heavy I feel crushed by it\u2019s weight, by my fears of the future. It is so much more than him being a  BOY . \u00a0So much more. As the buzz wears off, here I sit in front of a blinking cursor, not looking up, slightly grateful that the mountain peak is hidden in the clouds. \u00a0I\u2019m scared to see how far we have to go. \u00a0I remind myself again that we\u2019ve come so far, and we are still moving up. \u00a0One foot in front of the other. \u00a0I\u2019ll carry my heart and my son with me.

{"date": "October 31, 2011", "body": "\u201cThings are changing with him lately, don\u2019t you think?\u201d GC asked me as we sat at the dinner table. The Roc had just bounded up the stairs to do his\u00a0business. \u00a0Also new, and TMI, he will go, and go through all the steps \u2013 wiping, flushing, pulling his pants back up, washing his hands, turning off the bathroom light, without help from us. \u00a0Something I agonized over last year, a skill I broke down into steps and tried to teach him, but never found the time or energy to stay on task. \u00a0I hated fighting in the little bathroom. \u00a0And he is now doing it all by himself. \u00a0Sure, he still announces his intention, announces when he\u2019s done, and we\u2019ve got a ways to go teaching about toilet paper consumption and how it clogs the toilet, but we are not in the bathroom with him. \u00a0Lovely. But that\u2019s not exactly what GC was referring to, while it sure is a part of the big picture of growth and change we\u2019ve noticed recently. It\u2019s the little things. \u00a0Those things that most parents take for granted, the ones that mean the most to the tribe of parents I belong to, those of us who do break everything down, who teach each step, and then repeat, and repeat, and repeat. \u00a0Who wait for spontaneous, unscripted\u00a0conversation, for connection. \u00a0Who keep pushing and repeating and teaching, teaching, teaching with hope in their hands. It\u2019s the little, but really not so little, sparks of growth that have me sucking in air and widening my eyes at GC lately. The Roc is asking for help instead of immediately freaking out, screaming, and having a fit. \u00a0Not always, I get reminders of the way it used to always go down, but he\u2019s slowly beginning to manage his emotions better. \u00a0He\u2019s\u00a0grimacing\u00a0instead of flailing about, growling about being mad or frustrated instead of screaming at the top of his lungs. * He is also fluently asking questions. \u00a0What? \u00a0When? \u00a0Why? \u00a0It\u2019s usually about the same things over and over, but I\u2019ll take it, because I know it will advance. \u00a0\u201cDo turkeys fly?\u201d he asked me while decorating a turkey for school. \u00a0My eyes met GC\u2019s in the kitchen. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a great question Roc,\u201d GC said as he came into the dining room, grinning at me. * The Roc is saying \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d multiple times a day without prompting. \u00a0\u201cCan I have more cheese on my pasta please?\u201d \u00a0We still exclaim over this new unprompted politeness. * He is engaged with us everyday in a way he wasn\u2019t before. \u00a0He is present, he makes eye contact for longer and longer periods, he\u2019s soaking everything up, and we know it, he shows us. \u00a0He is asking about emotions, \u201cAre you mad?\u201d \u00a0he asked me the other day, searching my face. \u00a0He hears the changes in my voice, in GC\u2019s voice, and he asks us if we are mad. \u00a0He really doesn\u2019t want us to be mad at him. \u00a0He has always been paying close attention to our emotions, our voices, our facial expressions, and now he is putting it all together. * He tells me things about his day. \u00a0He usually won\u2019t answer questions about school, but mulitple times a week he offers up things that happened during the day. \u00a0Usually it\u2019s things that happen in the resource room, he earned time on the swing, they went to the courtyard to play for a break, he got to play a game during friendship group. \u00a0Or, \u201cHector got mad in Ms. G\u2019s room today,\u201d he blurted out last week after school. \u00a0\u201cHe screamed and said he wasn\u2019t going to do his math work. \u00a0Then he threw the phone. \u00a0We had to go to Ms. stepping stones room. \u00a0Ms. G wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d \u00a0 This sparked a short conversation about appropriate school behavior and what to do when you are frustrated. * Also, the Roc is happy to go to school. \u00a0Last year we fought a lot in the morning as the bus rounded the curve and came into sight. \u00a0He would scream, throw his backpack, say he wasn\u2019t going. \u00a0Not this year. \u00a0He says he likes his teachers, he smiles as he climbs into the van, he smiles when he comes home. \u00a0Everyone I\u2019ve come in contact with when I volunteer during the week says how much they enjoy the Roc. \u00a0The paras rotate every few weeks and I met the woman who is working with him and another little boy in his room for the next couple weeks. \u00a0\u201cI just love him, he\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said to me on Friday. \u00a0I touched her arm and said, \u201cI love him too, and thank you for saying that,\u201d \u00a0I told her. * We still battle over homework, so I\u2019ve been trying to slip little bits of it into the routines in our day. \u00a0While I\u2019m making breakfast he copies the spelling words I\u2019ve written down, we do sight word flashcards before the bus comes, and he gets a small treat for doing a little bit of the actual homework after his after school snack. \u00a0I was thrilled to pull out his spelling test last week and see he got 9 out of 10 right. * It\u2019s all these little, but not really so little, things that add up to big progress for the Roc. He works hard every day, and we know it. He\u2019s growing up. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/growth-change/", "title": "Growth + Change"},
{"date": "October 17, 2011", "body": "First, gloss over the small notice in the weekly flyer about the upcoming picture day. \u00a0Ignore the sticker that says \u201cpicture day this Wednesday!\u201d \u00a0in the student planner. \u00a0Then, file the picture form under a pile of papers on the floor next to the dog crate in your bedroom. Essentially, completely forget about picture day. On the big day dress your kid in a gray shirt\u2014to perfectly blend in with the gray background. \u00a0Pick a shirt that has big letters and maybe a guitar on it, bonus if it\u2019s got some small stains too. \u00a0Since he has bed head anyway, go ahead and spike up his hair in a messy mo-hawk. \u00a0You don\u2019t know anything\u2019s special is happening that day anyway, who cares? Don\u2019t send in the picture form or money, you forgot about that form as soon as it slipped under that stack of autism stuff in your room. As soon as your kid gets home from school, decide that it\u2019s the perfect moment to organize that growing stack of papers on the floor in your bedroom. \u00a0Gasp and say \u201cOh SHIT!\u201d when you find the picture form wedged between information about state disability benefits and homework that was due last week. \u00a0Take a peak at your kid to find that his mo-hawk is now in complete disarray. \u00a0Hope that the pictures were taken in the morning when at least his hair resembled a mo-hawk and he didn\u2019t have food on his face. Rattle off a quick email to the teacher, think to yourself,  she\u2019s going to think I\u2019m super unorganized and a ditz to boot.  \u00a0Admit to yourself that you are kinda ditzy sometimes, this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve forgotten stuff like this. Feel a bit of relief when the teacher emails right back and says that you can still send in the form, the photographer is coming back on Friday to pick up late orders, and btw, she liked his hair. Ask your kid if he had his picture taken today and if he smiled for the camera\u2026wonder what the heck this picture will look like as he stares blankly back at you and then asks for graham crackers. \u2026 Keep the picture when it comes home a few weeks later, because if you didn\u2019t remember the first time, you know you\u2019ll forget retake day, and it\u2019s the best school picture he\u2019s ever taken anyway!

{"date": "January 23, 2012", "body": "I press my hands together to keep them from shaking as I look back over my shoulder at the Roc in the dark, his eyes are wide and his face blank. \u00a0The oncoming traffic momentarily lights up his face and I recognize his look to signal fear. \u201cI\u2019m anxious\u2026\u201d he says staring straight ahead. \u201cMy tummy feels funny\u2026\u201d \u201cDoes it hurt? \u00a0Or is the funny feeling\u2026.a fluttery feeling like there are butterflies flying around inside your belly?\u201d I ask, wondering what exactly my literal boy is picturing in his mind. \u00a0Does that explanation even make sense to him? \u00a0He\u2019s nervous, he\u2019s never described nervous before, I do an internal fist pump, progress noted. \u00a0A new emotion to sit next to happy, mad, sad, and anxious in his little emotions piggy bank. \u00a0Another step forward in understanding his own emotions, a step to the side in helping him learn to manage those emotions. \u00a0All this movement equaling progress, of which I\u2019ll never take for granted. His clear blue eyes lock onto mine and he says, \u201cYeah, fluffy, my tummy feels fluffy.\u201d \u00a0My heart does a little flutter, I love to see his eyes, my heart will always remember when he couldn\u2019t look at me and how I longed to look into those beautiful blue eyes. I swallow my smile and tell him that it\u2019s normal and that what he is feeling is called nervous. \u00a0He asks me if I feel nervous and I tell him yes, a little bit, and\u00a0immediately\u00a0wonder if honesty of the best policy in this situation, too late to take it back. \u00a0I rush to tell him other times I felt nervous and that when I was a child like him, I often felt nervous when trying something brand new. \u00a0Again, I wonder if this way of explanation is the best way. \u00a0Does it make sense to him? \u00a0Does it help him to know that I feel nervous when I don\u2019t know what to expect? \u00a0These thoughts tumble together with the fear I\u2019m holding in my shaking hands. \u00a0 What was I thinking? \u00a0He looks so scared! \u00a0Did I make a huge mistake? \u00a0What if he freaks out? \u00a0He will be so upset if he loses control in front of so many people! \u00a0What was I thinking? \u00a0 I give the Roc a small smile and turn back around, watching the lights flash across GC\u2019s face, his hands tight on the steering wheel. We pull in to the parking lot, park, and get out. \u00a0The Roc appears white with fear and he limply holds my hand as I gently pull him toward the building. \u00a0As we enter the gym the Roc stops, rooted to the spot and I know I must find out what he is supposed to be doing very quickly. \u00a0Parents are leaning up against the walls while the boys shoot baskets, all baskets occupied by at least 8 boys. \u00a0I see a very tall man holding a clipboard and approach him, smiling, and ask if the Team B kids are in a certain spot. \u00a0I\u2019m hoping that I\u2019ve masked my own nervousness, also knowing that I am one of easiest people to read on the planet. He tells me that all the boys are shooting and they\u2019ll start the actual practice in a little while, and that he is one of the coaches for Team B. \u00a0He asks me where my boy is so he\u2019ll know what he looks like and when I look back over my shoulder the Roc is not where I left him. \u00a0My eyes sweep left and I spot GC who smiles and points to the Roc\u2026who is standing in line to shoot baskets. \u00a0My eyes widen and then I point him out for the coach, \u201cThere he is\u2026.um, did you and the other coach get any information on the kids before tonight?\u201d I ask, remembering the section in the online registration form asking about disabilities where I wrote,  The Roc has autism. \u00a0He loves basketball and really wants to be a part of the basketball program. \u00a0His biggest issue will be anxiety and sensory. \u00a0He can get overwhelmed in chaotic situations and will need extra prompting and help navigating. \u00a0 I remember the message I left at the community ed office asking if I could sign him up, was he welcome? I had stammered before I hung up. \u00a0I had a nice conversation with the woman who called back and she told me to sign him up, he was definitely welcome, and he could participate in what he felt comfortable with. \u201cNope, nothing,\u201d the coach says. \u201cWell, I want to let you know that the Roc has autism,\u201d I start, searching the coaches eyes, hoping he is a patient man. \u00a0\u201cHe really wants to be here, he loves basketball, he is very anxious and that is one of his biggest issues right now. \u00a0He may get overwhelmed by all the noise and movement. \u00a0He will need you and the other coach to repeat directions to him and give him a little processing time to answer you,\u201d I tell him, hoping that it\u2019s not too much information, knowing that this first practice will be an exercise in organized chaos. \u201cOkay, well I\u2019m glad to have him, thanks for letting me know more about him, we\u2019ll start the actual practice in a little bit,\u201d the coach says, smiling at me, and I feel that all too familiar bite in the back of my throat. \u00a0I will cry tonight, probably soon. I see GC leaning up against the wall and I go to stand next to him. \u00a0\u201cI got lucky and talked to the first guy I see holding a clipboard and it happens to be one of the Roc\u2019s coaches. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t gotten any information before tonight about the kids, so I told him about the Roc,\u201d I tell GC. \u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026look at him Kim\u2026\u201d \u00a0GC says, nodding his head toward the Roc. I look\u2026and my eyes prick with tears that I desperately try to blink away. \u00a0There is my boy, he just reached the front of his line, and when he sees me looking he smiles this little lopsided smile and his nose twitches. \u00a0It\u2019s not the face spliting grin I so often capture with my digital camera. \u00a0This is the anxious smile, when he is somewhere doing something that\u2019s hard for him, but his enjoyment is close the level of his\u00a0anxiety,and they are battling. \u00a0He shuffles forward, shoots and the ball goes in. \u201cThat\u2019s the third one in a row he\u2019s made,\u201d GC says. We continue to watch the Roc shoot. \u00a0He makes it most of the time, and when he doesn\u2019t he just grabs his ball and gets back in line. \u00a0No shouting at the ball like he often does at home. \u00a0The coaches blow the whistle and tell all the kids to line up on the black line ringing the gymnasium. \u00a0My heart goes into overdrive as I watch the Roc try to figure out what just happened. \u00a0He follows the herd of children, and runs to the end of the gym farthest from where we stand. \u00a0I squeeze GC\u2019s arm and ask him if he is nervous. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m super nervous,\u201d GC responds rubbing his palms together and then folding his arms. \u00a0\u201cBut look at him, he\u2019s doing it,\u201d he says, again nodding in the Roc\u2019s direction. \u201cI know, and I just can\u2019t believe we are here. \u00a0I know that I\u2019m going to cry tonight, in fact I might cry right now,\u201d I tell him, those tears threatening to fill my eyes once again. \u201cWell don\u2019t cry yet, it just started, see how it goes first.\u201d \u201cI know, I know, I just can\u2019t help myself,\u201d and as I say this I have a vision of the Roc having a tantrum in the middle of the gymnasium and myself rushing onto the floor to try to pick him up, arms and legs flailing. \u00a0I push that vision away as I watch him, he\u2019s not paying attention as the children are counted off, 1,2, 3, 4. \u00a0When the coach gets the end of the line he shouts, \u201c1\u2019s over here, 2\u2019s over there, 3\u2019s over there, 4\u2019s right here!\u201d pointing to the four corners of the gym. \u00a0\u201cGO!\u201d he shouts and all the children run in\u00a0opposing\u00a0directions. \u00a0I see the look of shock on the Rocs face as he stands still in his spot. \u00a0I wave my arms over my head and\u00a0miraculously\u00a0get his attention, hold up 3 fingers and point in the direction he is\u00a0supposed\u00a0to go. \u00a0He runs toward where I pointed. \u00a0I widen my eyes at GC as I return to our spot. \u201cIf he gets through this tonight we may really pay for it at home,\u201d GC whispers to me. \u00a0I nod in reply and my mind flashes to the ends of outings when the Roc had reached his maximum and fallen apart. \u201cI know, and it will be worth it,\u201d I respond, sending up a silent  please let him make it through  to the autism gods. As we continue to watch the practice I have to hold myself still. \u00a0The Roc misses many of the directions because he is so distracted by everything going on in the gym, and other times because I can tell that he has checked out. \u00a0I watch as he follows the other boys in his group when they start a new\u00a0activity, I watch him watch them, and then I see him imitate what they do. \u00a0He puts himself at the back of the line every time and he watches. \u00a0I see him listen to the coaches when they tell him something directly and he tries. \u00a0At all four stations he tries, except for the last one where the boys form 2 lines and they were to go after the ball that the coach tosses toward the basket. \u00a0The Roc is one of the least aggressive boys you will meet, and even though I can tell he wants to go after the ball, he holds back. \u00a0I see the other boys nudge him forward when it\u2019s his turn, but it\u2019s too much for him. \u00a0It is the only station we see a glimmer of frustration. \u00a0When the rebound comes in his direction and it doesn\u2019t land in his\u00a0outstretched\u00a0hands, the other boy gets it instead, and the Roc turns toward us and stomps his foot. \u00a0I shake my head, point to my eyes, and then point back to his coach. \u00a0When he turns around GC and I look at each other. \u201cThankfully, that station was last for him,\u201d I say to GC, my eyes wide. When practice is over GC and I walk down to collect the Roc and I ask him if he had a good time. \u201cI was at basketball practice Mommy!\u201d he exclaims, his face plastered with that characteristic smile. \u201cHe did good,\u201d Team B\u2019s second coach tells me. \u00a0I introduce myself and ask him if he was told anything about the Roc. \u00a0When he says no I tell him. \u00a0I tell him that the Roc is on the autism spectrum and he really wanted to be here tonight, but it was hard for him. \u201cI could just cry, I\u2019m so happy he made it through and he had fun,\u201d I say, my eyes misting over with tears. \u00a0\u201cA couple years ago I didn\u2019t think this was a possibility for him, he\u2019s come so far,\u201d I choke out as an explanation for my watery eyes. \u201cWell, he did good and we are happy to have him on our team,\u201d the coach says, looking directly into my eyes and smiling. \u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, those damn tears threatening to overflow. \u00a0\u201cThat means a lot to me.\u201d We prompt the Roc to say good bye and we navigate through the crowd to the exit. \u00a0As we walk through the front door into the cold, dark night GC asks the Roc what he thought of basketball practice. \u201cIt was\u2026.. awesome ,\u201d he answers. It was, and so is he. I process as we ride home, knowing that I must record this night.

{"date": "April 6, 2012", "body": "Last weekend was full of smiles and busy with lots of running around. \u00a0 A haircut, a sleep over with grandma, a gymnastic misunderstanding, a quick trip to a playground and then another with the new friend, different friends over for dinner, playing with their two boys \u2013 sidewalk chalk, bouncy house, trains, cars, dinner with the Roc in the middle, puzzles, ice cream\u00a0sundae\u00a0desserts, and finally one terrific crash leaving two boys with lumps and bruises on their heads and lots of tears from one and lots of screaming from another. So many moments where progress was noted, a moment when my eyes misted up to hear my parents talk about how many changes they\u2019ve noticed since we moved here in June, the moment that brought me back to the place when I broke apart inside, and I gasped at the searing pain, remembering when I breathed that pain every day. So many stories I wanted to write about. But my mind keeps coming back to one moment. The Roc and I were at a little park, our new friends had just left, we decided to walk down the trail before heading to the parking lot. \u00a0I took the Roc\u2019s hand in mine and again wondered how long I would be allowed to hold his hand. \u00a0When would he get to the age where that isn\u2019t cool anymore? \u00a0Will he get there? \u00a0Do I care? I looked down at the sun bouncing off the Roc\u2019s new hair cut, his blonde hair already turning blonder, signs of summer around the corner. \u00a0He turned his face up to mine and I saw those beautiful blue eyes. \u00a0Sometimes I am still startled to see them, to hold their gaze, to see him see me. \u201cI love you Roc, so much,\u201d I told him. \u201cI love you Mommy,\u201d he said. I stopped on the trail and wrapped my arms around him. \u00a0He did the same, his arms snaking around my middle, holding on. \u00a0I pulled him tighter, laid my cheek against his hair, breathing him in, eyes closed, remembering that first spontaneous hug outside his bathroom in Delaware. \u00a0I take none of this for granted. \u201cI like being with you Mommy,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, I always like being with you Roc. \u00a0You are my favorite little boy ever. \u00a0Do you know that?\u201d \u00a0I asked him. \u201cYou are my favorite Mommy,\u201d he replied. I felt the sun on my back, heard the wind in the trees, and my heart was full and thankful for the gift of the Roc. \u201cAm I your person?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispered into my shirt.

{"date": "March 12, 2012", "body": "I watched the snow covered ground\u00a0wiz\u00a0by my window when it\u00a0occurred\u00a0to me that I wasn\u2019t nervous. \u00a0Finally, the day of the Roc\u2019s very last basketball game, and I felt fine. \u00a0I glanced back over my shoulder and the Roc\u2019s eyes met mine. \u201cI\u2019m anxious Mommy. \u00a0I don\u2019t know how to play offense,\u201d he said, the fear tight around his eyes. \u00a0I may not have been nervous, but my little guy sure was. \u201cRoc, you have done great at every single game you\u2019ve been in so far. \u00a0I know you are nervous. \u00a0That\u2019s ok. \u00a0There\u2019s a lot to remember when you\u2019re playing isn\u2019t there?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYes, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d \u201cRemember when coach T helped you a couple weeks ago during a game? \u00a0He reminded you where to go and when you were on offense or defense? \u00a0Would you like him to do that again?\u201d \u00a0I asked him. \u201cYes\u2026 I think that would be very helpful,\u201d he responded. \u201cOk then, we\u2019ll ask him when we get there.\u201d \u201cCan you ask him, I\u2019m too nervous to do that,\u201d he said. I smiled and hoped he felt reassured with our plan to ask coach T for some assistance as I turned to face the front. \u00a0My insides burned to know the Roc was still as anxious as he was at the beginning of basketball in January, that he still felt so overwhelmed. \u00a0I deeply wished that it wasn\u2019t so hard for him, that he could feel more at ease with himself, with his body, with his ability, and with the other boys. \u00a0Every week my heart has both soared and ached watching him practice and play. \u00a0I\u2019ve felt his fear, watched his stiff movements, seen him miss all ques, watched the other children on his team ignore him \u2013 because he was never looking their way when they had the ball! \u00a0The game has been hard for him to understand, and the pace quickened as the weeks went by and the other children really \u201cgot\u201d into it. \u00a0Despite it all he\u2019s out there. He\u2019s  out there . He\u2019s  trying his best . Those two things are HUGE. \u00a0If you know autism, you know the enormity of the Roc playing basketball. \u00a0So many factors, the big gym, those awful lights, the children running the court, the\u00a0squeaking\u00a0shoes, the court ringed with parents all watching, the coaches yelling, the parents yelling, the buzzer sounding every 5 minutes, the whistles, and on and on. \u00a0All of those things an\u00a0assault\u00a0to his system, both while he was sitting watching and then huge for him to overcome while he was actually out on the court\u2026trying to remember which way to run, who to guard, what to do during offense and defense, to watch the ball, or get the ball, or what to do if he was actually passed the ball, and on and on. \u00a0A lot going on, a lot to see, a lot to do, a lot to process \u2013 all for a kid who needs a little extra processing time. He was  out there . As we set up our chairs to watch the final game I thought about it all and how much of it was never expected. \u00a0I thought about the  conversation  we had before I signed him up, and how he said he would probably sit out during the games, and then never mentioned it again when he wasn\u2019t given that choice, he went along and did his best. \u00a0I thought about the time  he cried , hard, before we went to a practice, how he was overcome by his anxiety, and then he worked through it. \u00a0I thought about how big his smile was after every game and how he would always say, \u201cMommy, I did my best!\u201d I thought about it all as I watched him shoot and then join his team to wait for the game to start. \u00a0My stomach tightened as I he was slated to go out with the first group of boys. \u00a0When they blew the whistle coach T ran along his side of the court, encouraging the Roc and giving him directions. \u00a0The Roc\u2019s special ed teacher Miss G showed up then, she had emailed me the day before with the hope that she would be able to come. \u00a0She came to his very first game, took lots of pictures, made a social story about basketball, and had been encouraging him every week during school to tell her about the game, and had him practice defense with two older boys in her room. \u00a0When the Roc looked over and saw her he grinned shyly. \u00a0He was so happy to see her, so happy to have someone come and watch him. \u00a0My heart felt like it would explode and I said without pause, \u201cI am SO proud of him, just look at him.\u201d \u00a0Miss G smiled behind the lens of her camera. \u00a0She knew. \u00a0Knew what it meant to have him out there, how hard he was working, how huge this was for him. When the game was over the Roc came to us and asked for the gifts we had put together for the coaches who volunteered their time. \u00a0We had made them brownies and gotten gift cards to a sporting goods store. \u00a0The Roc handed over each gift with a shy, \u201cHere you go,\u201d and a prompted \u201cThank you for being my coach.\u201d \u00a0I had told both coaches before how much their time and attention meant to me, and I said thank you again, feeling that it wasn\u2019t really enough to explain how grateful I really was for the way they welcomed the Roc onto the team. I asked the Roc if he wanted a picture with his two coaches and he surprised me by saying, \u201cYES!\u201d right away. I snapped a final picture of him, knelt down in front of him and told him again how proud I was of him playing basketball. He summed it up for me. \u201cI tried my best Mommy! \u00a0and it was fun too!\u201d I know he did and I really couldn\u2019t be more proud of the Roc.

{"date": "March 25, 2012", "body": "Spring break 2012. The Roc was excited to go to the zoo. \u00a0He kept saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the ZOOOO! \u00a0We\u2019re going to see ANIMALS!!! \u00a0We\u2019re going with my grandparents!\u201d that morning and it made me smile. \u00a0It also made me remember the last time we went to the zoo. June 2008. The Roc was three, would turn four in two months. \u00a0We had the knowledge that autism was a part of our lives for ten months, though it had been there much longer than we knew. \u00a0The Roc and I were visiting my family in MN for 10 days. \u00a0I lived with a deep thread of anxiety running through my body every single day during that time, and I choked on my grief if I tried to explain my thoughts and fears about the present and the future. \u00a0But I remember feeling hopeful and excited at the beginning of the day, thinking that all kids like the zoo. \u00a0All kids like animals! \u00a0It was a gorgeous day, the zoo wasn\u2019t over crowded, and I had hope. I was deflated by the end of that day. We attempted the bird show, but as soon as we sat in the little\u00a0theater\u00a0I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work so I left my family inside to enjoy the birds and the Roc and I waited outside the little theater alone. \u00a0I leaned against the floor to ceiling glass and watched the monkeys outside chasing each other while the Roc paced the window next to me, his hand trailing, looking in their direction, but not seeing the monkeys. \u00a0I wondered if he would ever be able to sit within a crowd, attend to a speaker, enjoy a show like the one we were missing. \u00a0I could hear the oooooohs and aaaaaaaahs inside as I watched my boy stim and my insides ached. \u00a0I smiled and shrugged my shoulders as my family excited the theater, and pushed down on the grief bubbling to the surface as we moved on. The Roc was more interested in looking at any water we could find that day than the animals I desperately pointed out to him. As the children around us rang out with, \u201cLOOK MOM! \u00a0LOOOOK!\u201d and I did the same, \u201cLook Roc! \u00a0Look at the BIG cat!\u201d the Roc would shrink away from the children, from their piercing shouts. \u00a0He never looked where I pointed, he didn\u2019t seem to care about the animals that made all other children shout with glee. \u00a0He climbed the display rocks, stared at the little streams of water in the enclosures, and then he would take off again. \u00a0He didn\u2019t look for the animals, even when they were right there. \u00a0I settled for getting a picture of him with an animal in the background. My heart hurt. We stopped by the farm and the Roc did not hesitate to touch a big horse, and I my eyes filled with tears behind my camera. I wished for him to look at me and smile, to share the moment with me, for connection. I followed him into the goat enclosure, most parents watching from the other side of the fence. \u00a0\u201cLOOK MOM!\u201d a common\u00a0exclamation from the children around us. \u00a0I again tried to get the Roc\u2019s attention, I showed him how to pet a goat and watched him giggle as his hand made contact with the goats back. I wished for him to look at me. \u00a0My heart hurt. I remember my mom looking over her shoulder at me as I buckled the Roc into his car seat at the end of the day. \u00a0She smiled and said, \u201cThat was fun wasn\u2019t it?\u201d but I saw in her eyes that she knew, she could sense how disappointed I was. \u00a0How much my heart was hurting. \u00a0We didn\u2019t go back to the zoo when the Roc and I visited the next summer. Almost 4 years have gone by since I snapped the pictures above. Spring Break 2012 The Roc kept asking, \u201cAre we there yet? \u00a0Are we close to the zoo? \u00a0It\u2019s taking SOOOO long to get there Moooommmmy!\u201d as we rode with my parents to the zoo two weeks ago. \u00a0The parking lot was filling up as we parked, and I felt that familiar anxiety creep up my spine, crowds and the Roc do not mix well. \u00a0We got our tickets and my parents noticed that the dolphin training show was going to start in about 25 minutes. \u00a0The Roc immediately said he wanted to see it. \u00a0The area was packed with people looking at the giant fish tanks and the station where you could get your hands wet. \u00a0We looked at what we could, the Roc enjoying the station that had a big gush of water like a wave. \u00a0Memory snippets of the last time we were at the zoo flashed behind my eyes and I wondered if he was going to look for water more than animals again. \u00a0As the time for the dolphin training drew closer we made our way to the viewing area to get seats. \u00a0It was filling up fast and I directed the Roc to sit between my mom and I. \u00a0I wondered how we were going to get out of all the people if the Roc suddenly decided he couldn\u2019t be there. \u00a0I didn\u2019t need to worry, he watched the water and asked over and over when the dolphins were going to come out. \u00a0The Roc was pressed up against me as the trainers came out and the show started. \u00a0When the first dolphin came into the front pool and started to interact with the trainer the Roc said, \u201cLook Mommy!\u201d and I looked at him instead and I willed myself not to cry. The Roc was so present, grinning and excited to see the dolphins. \u00a0He was sitting among a crowd in the bleachers, he was watching the dolphins, listening to the trainer talk. \u00a0I wished I could take a picture of his face, capture his pure joy. \u00a0He was so happy. \u00a0Over and over I looked at the Roc enjoying the show and my heart soared. \u00a0Tears pricked my throat the whole 15 minute presentation and I had to force them away. \u00a0Who gets emotional at a short dolphin training session? It wasn\u2019t about the dolphins. My mom grabbed the Rocs hand as the crowd poured down the stairs and I lost sight of them. \u00a0We met up outside and decided to go see the new (to me and the Roc) bear exhibit. The Roc was so excited to go see bears. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re in a cave!\u201d he told my Mom as they entered the area first. \u00a0\u201cBEARS!\u201d he shouted as we rounded a curve and came to the viewing area. \u00a0This time he smiled for the camera. We walked the outdoor portion of the zoo and the Roc stopped to see each and every animal. \u00a0He was excited to eat lunch outside with grandma and grandpa, and we adults couldn\u2019t get over the fact that we were eating outside in MN on March 15th! We visited the rest of the zoo after lunch and the Roc was so excited. \u00a0He enjoyed it all, loved finding all the different animals, always wanted me or one of my parents to see what he was seeing, and \u00a0I heard, \u201cLook Mommy!\u201d more times than I can count. \u00a0He did find a little waterfall that got his attention, but he watched it for awhile, came over when I told him I found flamingos and when he went back to the waterfall he said to me, \u201cI just want to go look at it one more time okay Mommy? \u00a0Then we can move on.\u201d \u00a0I leaned against the railing and watched him, marveling at how he is still attracted to water and waterfalls, but how he has changed in so many other ways. Almost four years ago we walked the same paths, looked at the same exhibits and I had felt crushed. \u00a0I was wishing for so much, for me, for the Roc, for conversations and connections. \u00a0I wanted what I saw all around me, I wanted what I had expected. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know we would come back almost four years later and I would have what I wished for, and so much more. \u00a0Conversations and connection being tip of how far the Roc has come. As we walked back to the car my Mom said, \u201cRoc, you did a great job today!\u201d and he replied, \u201cI really liked the zoo, that was really, really fun! \u00a0When can we go again? \u00a0Can we come back tomorrow?\u201d \u201cHe really did do a good job didn\u2019t he?\u201d \u00a0I said to my mom, memories from the last visit to the zoo dancing behind my eyes, contrasting images from the day flashing alongside. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t know how things would change in four years. \u201cHe did,\u201d she replied and smiled at me. He did.

{"date": "March 28, 2012", "body": "There was a time when I completely dreaded going to the store with the Roc. \u00a0That was when we used picture schedules to run our days and I always felt a little apprehensive when I stuck that \u201cshopping\u201d picture to the velcro strip. \u00a0There were certain stores the Roc absolutely hated, and of course we went to those stores pretty frequently. \u00a0We could never just pick up and run out to the store, if it wasn\u2019t on the schedule, it wasn\u2019t going to happen that day. \u00a0When the three of us were out together and we needed to make an unscheduled stop at a store I usually waited in the car with the Roc, who screamed about how he didn\u2019t want to stop at the store. \u00a0I\u2019ve had my share of pretty horrid shopping experiences with the Roc in tow, and I know they were infinitely more awful for him than me. \u00a0I\u2019ve had people stare in judgement, point at us, roll their eyes, I\u2019ve heard people mutter under their breath about \u201cparents these days,\u201d and one time a lady basically told me that I needed to spank him and everything would be different, that she would whip him into shape if he were her child. I know that going shopping with typical children isn\u2019t always a picnic. \u00a0But being able to say, \u201cWe have to go to the store now,\u201d and then pick up and go to the store is one of those little things that most people do not give much thought to. \u00a0It\u2019s an ease that parents like me wish for and then we work for. \u00a0It\u2019s why we do picture schedules, write social stories about what to expect at a store and what is expected of the child at the store. \u00a0We prep and prep, and then we practice, and practice, and practice. \u00a0We keep going even if it ended in disaster last time, holding onto the grain of hope that the next time will be a bit better. \u00a0We measure success in small increments. \u00a0The ability to enter the store, to stay for 15 minutes, to use words instead of screams, and on until we get to the stage where we can actually make a short list and then go to the store \u2013 with our child. For over a year every outing to Walmart in our little town in Delaware felt like a therapy session. \u00a0Have you ever stopped by the checkout on a busy day in Walmart, closed your eyes and just listened? \u00a0Adults talking, babies crying, children whining, music and the\u00a0occasional\u00a0in-store\u00a0announcement, rustling packages, squeaking carts, beeping scanners, the thump of items on the belt, the mechanical noise of the belt, register drawers slamming open, the whir of the air conditioner, cell phones ringing, the loud cell phone talkers, etc. \u00a0And that is just the auditory piece! \u00a0Visual overstimulation, the crowds, the lights, the fans, the changes, the unexpected, the anxiety about being touched by a stranger, an onslaught to an over sensitive system, Even though it was hard, I kept going to the store with the Roc. \u00a0Little by little, bit by bit, schedule by schedule, all the prepping and practicing began to pay off. \u00a0I would make a list, he would ride in the big part of the cart, we would get our couple things, and then get the heck out of there. \u00a0Eventually he got to the point where he would walk in the store with me if we only got a few things. \u00a0We still couldn\u2019t drop by a store\u00a0unexpectedly, but I could tell him that I was adding it to the afternoon schedule and he would go willingly. \u00a0We developed routines at certain stores, looking at the cakes in the bakery section of the grocery store, or visiting the gift shop and outdoor area of our local natural food store/nursery, and we had to do these things every time, which I did willingly. \u00a0He was always \u201cworking for\u201d something at every store, and there were times that I literally carried him out of a store abandoning what I had come to purchase when he melted down. \u00a0But we were there, he was there, it was slowly getting easier, and after awhile I stopped focusing so much on how hard it was to go to the store with the Roc. \u00a0We kept going, time went by and I didn\u2019t notice it\u2019s passing. A few weeks ago the three of us were out running errands. \u00a0We told the Roc we would be doing some shopping and we didn\u2019t know exactly how many stores we would be going too. \u00a0We decided to stop at a Thai\u00a0restaurant\u00a0for lunch. \u00a0Then we shopped. \u00a0We went into a couple craft stores, we looked around, I sent GC off with the Roc and looked by myself, and then they came and found me. \u00a0The Roc stayed with me for awhile, \u201chelping\u201d me and reminding me \u201cnot to get lost.\u201d \u00a0Even though his voice rang through the store and the lady next to me was doing her best to ignore him, I smiled at him and told him he was doing a good job. \u00a0He waited in line with us, again his voice too loud, and this time the lady behind us couldn\u2019t hide her annoyance, and again I smiled and told him he was waiting patiently. \u00a0We left the store and decided at the last minute to stop at Target before going home. The weather was gorgeous, an unseasonably warm breeze lifted my hair as I took the Roc\u2019s hand in the parking lot. \u00a0I looked up and saw the white tail of a jet expanding across the blue sky and I stopped and pointed it out to the Roc. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked, his head tilted back. I felt jolted at once by his question, the fact that we were out shopping as a family, that we\u00a0unexpectedly\u00a0stopped at a\u00a0restaurant\u00a0to eat lunch, that we spent 20 minutes in a craft store, and then moved onto another store, that he was managing himself. \u00a0Overwhelmed by all of that and more. \u00a0I looked over at GC as he explained the jet and then I closed my eyes and felt the sun on my face and the Roc\u2019s hand in mine. \u00a0We were out on a busy Saturday just like any other family. \u00a0There was an ease to the day that I had never felt before. The Roc was going with the flow. (Did you do a double take on that line? \u00a0 The Roc was going with the flow. ) Parenting isn\u2019t easy. \u00a0We all know that. \u00a0But there is an everyday ease that most people take for granted. \u00a0I\u2019ve wanted that so much, for me, for the Roc. \u00a0Not because I want it to be easy for us. \u00a0I want that ease for him. \u00a0For him to be able to do everyday tasks out in the world successfully and be at ease himself. That Saturday proved that we\u2019re getting there. \u00a0He\u2019s getting there. \u00a0The prepping, the social stories, and all the times I wanted to give up, to stay in the car, to shop alone at night\u2026but didn\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s paid off. That day happened. It can happen again. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/ease/", "title": "Ease"},
{"date": "April 21, 2012", "body": "Time is slipping away from me and when grabbed my camera today I realized that I hadn\u2019t recorded our Easter weekend, all the photos were still there on my Rebel. \u00a0I transferred them to my computer and imported them into Lightroom, sighing at the couple of photos I had taken the Saturday before Easter. It was a special day, but I didn\u2019t manage to capture it through the photographs. \u00a0I still have the memories. \u00a0The week before I had seen a posting from one of the MN autism pages I follow on facebook about discounted tickets to see the Harlem Globetrotters, and participate in a meet and greet before the game. \u00a0The Roc loves basketball and even though he hadn\u2019t been to a professional game, I figured he would enjoy seeing the Globetrotters. \u00a0What hooked me was the fact that it was with an autism group. \u00a0Being around fellow parents with children with autism during an outing is a no-brainer. \u00a0There is no pressure, no judgement, and no need for explanations. \u00a0I signed us up and showed the Roc a video of the Globetrotters on youtube. When we arrived the Roc held tight to my hand, and repeatedly told me he was nervous. \u00a0We got our tickets and then looked around the rapidly filling lobby for any signs of the group were would be a part of. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know anyone, but figured I would be able to spot \u201cour\u201d people. \u00a0Then we waited in the lobby of the Target Center for our meet and greet time. \u00a0There were a few other groups also waiting for their turn, and because not everyone from our group had shown up, we waited and waited in the lobby while the other groups went through the meet and greet first. \u00a0The Roc got restless and fidgety. \u00a0He started to whine about standing around, about wanting to go to his seat, and about the crowd. \u00a0Waiting is hard for any kid, waiting within a crowd of people is torturous for the Roc. \u00a0Finally we were lead through the arena to meet some of the players. \u00a0We always hang back in a group, the Roc is not fond of having a crowd follow him, so the small meet and greet area was jammed when we entered. \u00a0The Roc didn\u2019t care about the players though, there were too many people in that small space, he just wanted to get out to his seat. \u00a0But we tried, and held himself together, even entering the group photo when he was asked. When the \u201cgame\u201d started the Roc alternated between gazing around the arena and watching the players. \u00a0He was happy to be there, eating some of the snacks we brought, and even accepting a hunk of cotton candy from the family sitting right beside me. \u00a0(Then handing the sticky clump to me when he decided he was done with it. \u00a0I had no place to put it, so I ate it, holy sugar!) \u00a0 I ended up talking and talking to the mom sitting next to me, finding out that she is\u00a0originally\u00a0from Delaware! \u00a0We laughed at the coincidence and both agreed that we would attend the groups first support group meeting in May and see each other there. \u00a0We all had a good time! When we got home that evening we broke out the dyes and colored some eggs for the Easter Bunny to hide. The next morning the Roc woke up early and looked at the trails of eggs before he came to my side of the bed, or so he told me. \u00a0He was thrilled to see the eggs leading to a few small presents around the house and went right for them as soon as we came downstairs. Then he followed the final trail and found his basket. \u00a0(One of my favorite pictures of that day!) Later that afternoon we went over to my parents house for food and another egg hunt, this time outside. \u00a0The Roc raced around the yard looking for the 20 eggs my dad hid earlier that day. He loved it and was so excited that candy was inside each egg. \u00a0We found 19 eggs but couldn\u2019t locate the 20th! \u00a0My dad hid them so well that even he couldn\u2019t find it (remember where he put it!) \u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure he was still thinking about the location of the missing egg when we backed out of the driveway an hour later. Which still makes me smile a couple weeks later. \u00a0I wonder if they found it yet? \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_7070.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_7074.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_7092.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_7101.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_7110.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_7120.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_7118.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/basketball-eggs/", "title": "Basketball + Eggs"},
{"date": "May 15, 2012", "body": "We have been busy almost every weekend, and the last one was no exception. On Saturday we went up to GC\u2019s coworkers farm where they have cows, pigs, chickens, goats, and a few other animals. \u00a0We bought a pig from them awhile ago and every week we buy fresh eggs and fresh milk. \u00a0The Roc will only eat eggs from K\u2019s farm, we\u2019ve tried passing off regular organic eggs from the store when we\u2019ve run out of the fresh, and he tastes it right away and refuses to eat them. \u00a0He reacts the same to bacon from the store, he won\u2019t eat it saying it tastes funny. \u00a0After a couple years eating fresh eggs, milk, and meat from an Amish farm out East and now fresh food from K\u2019s farm, he is soured on store bought food. \u00a0Which is fine by us. The Roc was very excited to go to K\u2019s farm, but as usual he was very anxious when we got there. \u00a0He stayed by my side as K walked us around the property and showed us all the animals. \u00a0We got to see the mama pigs feeding some of the piglets. We met the cow whose milk we drink. GC got to help K move a calf, and after he decided he could definitely be a farmer. The Roc warmed up after awhile and played on the playset with K\u2019s boys. \u00a0We hung out and had lunch, the Roc wanting to be done as soon as K\u2019s kids went back outside to the play set. \u00a0 It was neat to look out the window and see him swinging with 2 new kids, chatting and laughing. \u00a0When it was time to leave, he didn\u2019t want to go. \u00a0I can always sense when the Roc is starting to head towards the cliff and I wanted to get going before he headed downhill. \u00a0 There were lots of warnings as the time to leave came near and we were able to leave without a scene. \u00a0It\u2019s always a treat when an outing can end nicely. \u00a0 It was a wonderful afternoon. Sunday was Mother\u2019s Day and all I wanted was to lay in bed instead of getting up to run the morning bath and to take our new canoe out for a ride. \u00a0I got both my wishes. We were all excited to get on the water. We paddled along the shore and then down a little waterway. At the other end of the lake GC and the Roc did a little fishing. While Guinness enjoyed the breeze. We had a great time and the Roc rode along for over 2 hours. \u00a0At one point I said, \u201cThis is my favorite Mother\u2019s Day so far.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cReally?\u201d GC asked, looking over his shoulder at me. \u00a0\u201cYup, I always dreamed of doing this.\u201d I did milk the Mother\u2019s Day card a bit later when I relaxed with a margarita at my parents house while GC put together a marble run, made the burgers, got the Roc everything he needed during dinner, and then played ladder ball with him while I talked with my Mom. Lots of animals and some time on the water equals a great weekend for us!

{"date": "July 10, 2012", "body": "My eyes swung up from the water as you and your son entered. \u00a0I immediately felt a connection blossom behind my navel. \u00a0A thin, invisible thread between you and me, though you were unaware of our\u00a0similarities. \u00a0I watched, as did some of the other mothers, from my bench as you and your son made your way to our end of the pool. \u00a0I saw your hands guiding him, the halting steps as his body leaned in so close, his eyes darting around, your cheeks pink from the heat of the room, or the heat of prying eyes. \u00a0As you passed by me I saw the dark circles under your eyes, the way you held yourself, and the determination in your jaw. \u00a0I did not avert my gaze and you looked down at me, our eyes locked, and I smiled big. \u00a0You smiled back at me. I wanted to watch you, but I didn\u2019t want to stare, as some of the other mothers were staring from across the small pool, their eyes wide and their faces blank. \u00a0In my\u00a0peripheral\u00a0vision I could see your son\u2019s hands, always moving. \u00a0Flitting about his face, to your hair, your shirt, your gentle smile. \u00a0He put his arm around your neck, his face so close to yours, and kissed you over and over. \u00a0You did not pull away, only redirected his attention. \u00a0I saw love. I couldn\u2019t help but watch as his lesson started, in the lane next to my son\u2019s, his long body immediately relaxing as he floated on a noodle. \u00a0I wanted to catch your eye again, but you were focused on him, just as I am usually focused on my own special son. \u00a0I noticed your towel bag, with the blue whale and the \u201cI love water!\u201d written on the side. \u00a0I thought about how it is the perfect bag for my son too, and I wanted to tell you. If you gave any thought to me at all, wondered which of the four boys was mine, I will never know. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t know how we are connected. The Roc\u2019s lesson ended before your son\u2019s. \u00a0I coaxed him to stay with me while I waited for the shower area to clear out. \u00a0When it was empty I let him stand under the spray. \u00a0Then I did glance back to our, now your, end of the pool. \u00a0You sat alone, leaning forward, elbows on your knees, chin in your hand, your cheeks still rosy. You never looked up, never looked around the small pool at the few small children remaining. \u00a0You were watching your boy. A small smile on your lips, your eyes full of pride. I smiled watching you, wondering about the years leading up to this point. \u00a0I saw myself in you, and then I saw what the world sees as they watch me while I watch my son. \u00a0I hadn\u2019t thought about it, always consumed by my feelings in the moment, and I felt that invisible thread once again. \u00a0Tugging on my heart, reminding me of how much I learn and gather strength from those who are also walking a different path. I don\u2019t know if I will see you again tomorrow. \u00a0If I do, I\u2019ll try not to stare, but I will catch your eye if I can, and I\u2019ll smile big. We are connected.

{"date": "July 2, 2012", "body": "The Roc and I muddled through the beginning of week 3. \u00a0We had been together non-stop since school let out and we definitely needed a little break from each other. \u00a0On Wednesday afternoon I dropped him off at my parents house for a 5 night sleepover. \u00a0FIVE nights. \u00a0GC and I had been gearing up for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) for a few weeks. \u00a0We spent Wednesday afternoon packing our packs, picking up a few last minute items, and grabbing some ice cream at Cold Stone to celebrate 9 years together. \u00a0We left the house around 3 am Thursday morning for a 5 hour drive to our BWCA entry point. After stopping at the ranger station we drove to our entry point on Brule lake. \u00a0It was too windy to photograph our start and it took some time to battle the waves across the lake. \u00a0We portaged and finally got through a few smaller lakes, where the wind wasn\u2019t as big of a factor. We entered Winchell lake pretty tired and it was still very windy, so we decided to find a campsite. \u00a0GC got to work setting up the tent, while the dog took a rest. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open. Later GC got to work again making us dinner. \u00a0(Are you wondering what I\u2019m doing while he\u2019s working? \u00a0I\u2019m documenting it all of course!) We were lazy on Friday. \u00a0We slept in, made breakfast, paddled around a little, (forgot our permit back at the campsite so we decided no to go too far in case we encountered a ranger) GC took a nap, and I sat down down by the water reading for over an hour. \u00a0It was pretty warm so I decided to go in the lake. I\u2019m smiling, but I was only in for a few minutes. \u00a0It was C.O.L.D! GC\u2019s face is a better representation of what the water felt like. We (GC) made dinner and we hung out around camp. Then I went down by the water and waited for the sun to set. The moon came out and we couldn\u2019t believe how light it was at almost 10 pm. On Saturday we decided to pack up, \u00a0move back towards our entry point, and look for a different campsite. We ended up back on Brule lake and all the sites we were paddling by were taken. \u00a0We had just about given up hope when we found that one of the best sites on the lake was empty. \u00a0I remembered paddling by it when we first entered the lake on Thursday and yelling over the wind to GC that it was an awesome site. GC did a little fishing, and kissed the pup. Who really wished he could swim after those sticks. We sat by the fire as the sun started it\u2019s decent talking about how crazy we were. \u00a0Most people go away to a resort for their anniversary. \u00a0We went into the woods. \u00a0I pointed out that we were on an island and we did have our own version of a palm tree\u2026 sort of. The lake was so calm we decided to go for an evening paddle. Which was totally worth it. On Sunday we got up, packed up, and headed for the van. Guinness was done. GC was still smiling. We said goodbye to one of the most beautiful places I\u2019ve ever been. \u00a0An awesome trip. \u00a0It was a wonderful, much needed break from the everyday.

{"date": "July 5, 2012", "body": "\u201cGosh I hope I don\u2019t hear screaming in the background when she picks up, maybe they\u2019ll be out somewhere,\u201d I said to GC as I touched my parents number on my cell phone. He shot me a look, then slid his eyes back to the road. \u201cYou should wait awhile to call maybe\u2026.\u201d But I couldn\u2019t wait, I wanted them to know we were out of the woods and I was curious to see how the Roc did at my parents house. \u00a0I knew they had some fun plans and I was keeping my fingers crossed that he had good behavior and they were able to get out and do those fun things. \u201cHey Mom! \u00a0We made it out alive!\u201d I said into the phone when my Mom picked up. \u201cHow WAS it? \u00a0Did you have a good time?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe had great weather, good campsites, and we didn\u2019t get eaten by a bear!\u201d I replied, listening to the background, not hearing screaming or the constant chitter-chatter that\u00a0accompanies\u00a0the Roc where ever he goes. \u201cWell, how did it go? \u00a0I don\u2019t hear Roc, what\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019s outside with the hose and your Dad. \u00a0He did really good, for the most part.\u201d Then she went on to detail how they spent their time. \u00a0They did a lot of stuff with water as it was very hot, went to the zoo, and a nearby lake to swim. \u00a0She tried to do a little of the school work I sent along, but he wasn\u2019t interested. \u00a0They stayed busy and he did well when they were busy. Then she told me about the complete meltdown he had on Saturday. \u00a0It was over how many bubbles were in the bucket when they went to wash the car. \u00a0One of those little things you cannot predict, and he\u00a0spiraled\u00a0out of control. \u00a0He screamed and threw the washcloth at her, ripped the leaves off her hosta plants, ran through the yard roaring. \u00a0He was red faced and sweating. \u00a0It was a big tantrum. I cringed listening, imagining the things she was describing, hearing that awful\u00a0guttural\u00a0roar. \u00a0I nodded along as she spoke, watching the sun shine off Lake Superior, the pine trees whipping by my\u00a0peripheral\u00a0vision. \u201cOh, I know. \u00a0I  know . \u00a0I know just what you mean.\u201d I told her. \u201cHe\u2019s got to be busy all the time, he needs lot of entertainment. \u00a0If you keep him\u00a0entertained\u00a0doing something he likes, he\u2019s happy. \u00a0But if not, or if you cross him, he spins off into space. \u00a0You never know when he might just go off. \u00a0I didn\u2019t anticipate that bubble thing, when he was melting down, it was a little scary. \u00a0He\u2019s like a Gieger counter, spinning, spinning, always spinning.\u201d \u201cOh man, I know just what you are saying Mom.\u201d I watched the water, knowing down to my core, exactly what she was describing. Because I live it. The Roc lives it. Everyday. She paused and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do this everyday Kim.\u201d \u201cI know. \u00a0Neither do I. \u00a0I was pretty shredded before we went away.\u201d I watched the sun shine off the lake and I exhaled slowly. She GOT it. \u00a0Really, really got it. She lived what I live everyday. She said it was hard. So often I doubt myself. \u00a0Doubt my ability to parent this child. \u00a0Am I doing this right? \u00a0Am I missing something? \u00a0Is it this hard because of me? \u00a0I struggle not to compare. \u00a0I feel that I come up short anyway, at least in my ability to be fine with the way things are. \u00a0I wish things were easier, for him, and for me. \u00a0Then I feel ungrateful and ashamed. \u00a0I know that raising typical children is hard, I\u2019ve never said it\u2019s not. \u00a0But it is different for families with not so typical children. \u00a0I know that some think I\u2019m making much out of nothing when I say that it is harder. \u00a0Some don\u2019t like those words, they don\u2019t believe them, they blow them away with the wind. \u00a0But I watch, and I know that other families do not live on the edge of complete meltdowns from their almost 8 year old. \u00a0I watch, and I know that the constant supervision, the constant attention, the constant entertainment is not\u00a0necessary in those households. \u00a0I watch, and I know that the\u00a0Geiger\u00a0counter is not spinning, spinning, always spinning at their house. \u00a0I watch, and I know there is an ease in those typical households that does not\u00a0exist\u00a0in mine. \u00a0I watch, and I know that the other mothers do not have this knot, this constant knot just under their ribs. \u00a0They do not prep, and prep, and prep for simple\u00a0activities, and then still scan the horizon for trouble. Unless they are families like mine. But I\u2019ve doubted myself. \u00a0Maybe I am weaker? \u00a0Maybe someone else would feel differently than I do? \u00a0Be stronger, handle it all better than me. Internally I\u2019ve fought with myself. \u201cThis is hard\u201d vs. \u201cNo, you just suck at this\u201d Until my mother uttered those words. I didn\u2019t know I had been waiting all along \u00a0for someone to say them. \u00a0To do what I do, with my child, everyday, and then tell me that it is hard. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do this everyday Kim.\u201d I filled my lungs with air as my eyes skipped across the water. \u00a0Inside I felt an overwhelming sense of\u2026. Validation. *** Thank you Mom. For being there for me. \u00a0For helping me in many more ways than the occasional short (and long) breaks from my everyday. \u00a0For loving the Roc and seeing the good, even when it\u2019s hard. I will be forever grateful. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/validation/", "title": "Validation"},
{"date": "June 4, 2012", "body": "Last October we had a wonderful experience  camping  with the Roc. \u00a0We knew we wanted to go again this year, and decided to try this weekend. \u00a0With only 5 days of school left we pulled the Roc out of school 2 hours early on Friday and drove up north. \u00a0We knew many of the state parks had first-come-first-serve sites and we were hoping to get up there early enough to get one. \u00a0We didn\u2019t have a back up plan in case all the sites were taken, other than turning around and driving all the way back home! \u00a0We lucked out and got to choose from 4 sites. \u00a0We choose this cart-in site, up on a hill (which was really fun for GC to lug all our gear up!) But it was worth it in the end. After setting up camp we went down the lake the throw some rocks and build a rock tower. On Saturday GC was up early preparing breakfast. \u00a0This is what he made (and that\u2019s his plate, not mine!) He was a very happy camper (and he finished all that food!) The Roc kept asking if we could go see waterfalls so we decided to drive up the shore a bit and go to Temperance River. \u00a0He was so happy. The water was really rushing from all the recent rain. Then we went to Cascade, to see more waterfalls. On our way back down to Split Rock we stopped at Tettegouche and hiked to the high falls. \u00a0GC had to carry the dog across this bridge. \u00a0I could hardly look down as we crossed. We stopped at the top of the waterfall (and GC kept a tight grip on the Roc) Then we hiked all the way down to the bottom, and I remembered the last time I was at that same spot, June 2008. \u00a0How different things were, in so many ways. \u00a0The river was a lot lower, and the Roc was much harder to photograph. We headed back to our campsite for dinner and some quality time around the campfire (s\u2019mores). \u00a0On Sunday we packed up all our stuff after breakfast and then set off on a hike to see the backpacking sites at the campground. \u00a0The Roc had to get down to this beach and throw some rocks. We hiked for awhile before doubling back towards the campground. \u00a0We were all tired and sore from Saturday, but decided that since we were there, we might as well hike to the top of Day Hill to the look out. \u00a0It was worth it. Look! \u00a0I\u00a0exist! \u00a0I need to give GC my camera more often. A rare photo of me and the Roc. This boy has the best smile of anyone I know. \u00a0He is my outdoor kid (as long as it\u2019s not raining) and I love being able to show him the places I went with my parents growing up. On the whole the Roc did awesome camping. \u00a0He had a few moments when we were really, really glad we chose that cart-in site deep in the woods with no one around. \u00a0He also needed to know exactly what.came.next at every moment of the day, and that was hard when you don\u2019t know exactly what comes next! \u00a0But when I look through the photos, the fun stands out and the couple incidents are already fading in my memory. \u00a0We will go again, for sure. We had a great weekend!

{"date": "November 5, 2012", "body": "The Roc had his first official hockey practice with his Special Hockey team on Sunday.\u00a0 He was excited to go and kept asking the same questions over and over and over again, definitely showing his anxiety. \u201cWill I have to skate?\u00a0 Will there be helpers like last time?\u00a0 Will there be lots of kids?\u00a0 Will I get to sit on a chair?\u00a0 Will someone help me?\u00a0 Do I have to use a stick?\u00a0 Will it be just like last time?\u00a0 Will my coach be there?\u00a0 Will you be there?\u00a0 Will you watch me?\u00a0 Do I have to stand up on my skates?\u00a0 Will I fall down?\u00a0 Will it hurt?\u00a0 Will I have to go to the hospital?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to be a real hockey player!\u201d When we got into the activity center he saw an older team on the ice skating fast and shooting, his eyes filled up with tears and he proclaimed, \u201cBut I can\u2019t do that!\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how to do that!\u00a0 I can\u2019t skate!\u00a0 This is too much for me!\u201d We tried to reassure him that he would be okay, that he wasn\u2019t skating with those older kids, and that he would have a good time.\u00a0 We reminded him of how scared he was when we went to opening day and how much he loved it and didn\u2019t want to get off the ice when it was over. I sat by as GC got the Roc into all his gear, watching the other parents help their children, young and old, into skates, helmets and pads.\u00a0 I listened to the chatter, the squeals and shouts from the older kids saying hello to their teammates, the whining from the younger kids as parents struggled to get skates and helmets on their children.\u00a0 I smiled at the Roc as he transformed into a hockey player.\u00a0 As the Roc hobbled out of the locker room his coach ran ahead to get someone who would help him on the ice.\u00a0 I breathed a sigh of relief, he would need help.\u00a0 We left him at the tunnel entrance to the ice with a cute young blonde and made our way to the stands.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t as nervous as I had been during opening day, and I think the Roc being able to walk on his skates and his lack of tears and screams at the thought of getting on the ice had a huge part in calming my butterflies.\u00a0 We sat down next to the team managers, parents of a 16 year old on the team, and I scanned the ice and found the Roc seated in a folding chair, being pushed by the blonde cutie. \u201cOh man, I\u2019m totally going to cry,\u201d I said as tears blurred my vision.\u00a0 \u201cI cried through the whole open skate down at the U a few weeks ago!\u201d\u00a0 I fanned my wet eyes with my mittens, trying to hold myself together. There was my little guy out on the ice, fully geared up, learning a new skill.\u00a0 This opportunity means so much to him and to us, his parents.\u00a0 My guy who cannot yet balance on a bike or scooter and feels so left out when he sees the neighborhood kids riding by.\u00a0 My guy who wants to belong, who wants to connect, who wants to be a part of the group, out there a part of something.\u00a0 I watched the kids, some skating, some pushing chairs, some being pushed on chairs.\u00a0 I watched so many kids fall down and get right back up, over and over, and over again.\u00a0 Sometimes they would pop back up, sometimes they would lay on the ice for awhile.\u00a0 I watched a young man lay down in the goal for a few minutes.\u00a0 I watched as the Roc\u2019s helper got him up on his skates behind the chair. I watched her coach him on how to use his stick.\u00a0 I watched as the coach gathered the team at the end of the ice and they did some sort of introduction, the kids all banging their sticks on the ice.\u00a0 Then the Roc was back down at our end of the ice.\u00a0 Smiling, not needing nearly as much help to move behind the chair. I listened to some of the stories.\u00a0 A young man who was injured in a work accident, who was a hockey player in his former life, and was now blind was out on the ice skating behind a short ladder with his friend.\u00a0 That friend was at every practice and game, and if he couldn\u2019t make it, another friend took his place.\u00a0 I learned that the team coach does not have a disabled child, in fact, most of the teams in the area are coached by people who do not have disabled children.\u00a0 I heard about the young women who give up a prime hour of their Sunday to volunteer with the players.\u00a0 How the team had tried some of the young men from the area high school hockey teams, but that they usually do not possess the compassion gene, and tend to skate around or hang out with their friends on the ice, not helping the players.\u00a0 The girls really help, they get into it, and they keep coming back year after year.\u00a0 They make a difference.\u00a0 The young lady who was working with the Roc was actually now in college, but she gave up her Sunday to drive up and volunteer.\u00a0 I listened as they told us about some of the players, how they have changed over time, a young autistic man now setting up goals for some of the younger, less skilled players.\u00a0 How his mother was incredulous last season, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d she had asked, her eyes wide and brimming with tears when he dropped the puck in front of the goal for someone else to shoot.\u00a0 He was changing before her very eyes, no longer concerned only with getting the puck and making a goal, he was really a team player. I listened and watched the players, watched my Roc, and my eyes filled up with tears yet again. \u201cGod, I\u2019m going to cry every week!\u201d I told them. \u201cJust start bringing a box of tissues with you on Sundays!\u201d \u201cWait until he makes his first goal,\u201d one of the managers said to GC and I, \u201cThe tears really start up then.\u00a0 They give the player the puck from their first goal and the pride on their face\u2026 oh man.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to lose it when he first starts skating on his own,\u201d GC said, his eyes on the Roc, a smile on his face.\u00a0 GC loves hockey, loves to watch it, loves to play it even more.\u00a0 He played when he was younger and he worked at an ice rink when he was a teenager.\u00a0 There was a time when hockey is what he did almost everyday.\u00a0 He would love to be out on the ice, helping, volunteering, coaching, but for now, his place is behind the glass.\u00a0 Watching.\u00a0 Watching the Roc grow, expand, learn, gain new skills and new confidence. When practice was over the Roc\u2019s helper said, \u201cHe was so cute!\u00a0 He told me he wanted to go down to your end of the rink so you guys could cheer for him!\u201d I thanked her for all her help and she accepted gracefully, \u201cI love doing this!\u00a0 No problem!\u00a0 You did awesome buddy!\u00a0 See you next time!\u201d Then we had to take a picture of our \u201creal hockey player.\u201d And I cried again.

{"date": "September 1, 2012", "body": "We left Colorado with two more people in the van than we arrived with. \u00a0My in-laws had flown from South Carolina to Colorado the week before we arrived, and then rode home with us to Minnesota. \u00a0We stopped in South Dakota to visit Mount Rushmore and spent the night at a nearby hotel. I tried to get the Roc to pose by this teepee, but he wasn\u2019t having any of it. He had to sit on every single bench we passed on the little trail though, and after many photos capturing his anger at my pointing the camera his direction, I got this shot. I love that smile and those bright eyes. After dinner we headed down to the hotel pool and the Roc was surprised to find a water slide there. \u00a0He was\u00a0hesitant\u00a0and GC and I pushed him too hard to go down. \u00a0As soon as he got to the top and saw the rushing water, he could not bring himself to get on. \u00a0No matter how many times I explained that the water wass only spraying out at the top of the slide to get it going, his fear was too overwhelming, and he walked back down the stairs in tears. \u00a0I shouldn\u2019t have pushed. \u00a0I still feel bad as he was very stuck on the fact that he didn\u2019t go down the slide, and I know without a doubt that my pushing made him feel worse. \u00a0Sometimes I have a hard time controlling my emotions, and I definitely learned a lesson that night. We had a very long, very boring drive across South Dakota and back home the next day. \u00a0Very long. \u00a0Very boring. \u00a0Some screaming for the last hour\u2026or so. We spent one day at home unpacking, doing laundry, and then repacking for a short(er) road trip to the north shore. \u00a0We stopped at Split Rock and hiked up to a look out, then back down to let the Roc throw rocks. We all enjoyed the view from the balcony at our condo when we arrived. The Roc enjoyed the pool after dinner. Guinness enjoyed being there\u2026I don\u2019t know about the hug\u2026 Especially because he looked like this 2 seconds after the above photo. And then this. \u00a0\u201cHelp me!\u201d his big eyes plead. The next day we drove north, stopping at Cascade to see the waterfalls. \u00a0Of course. Then we stopped in Grand Marais to walk out to the light house and around the little town. We ate lunch at the Angry Trout and were happy it was warm enough to sit on the deck\u2013because we had Guinness and he was allowed on the deck! \u00a0Our waitress didn\u2019t even know he was there! We continued north stopping at Grand Portage where we saw some wildlife, a very tall waterfall, and Canada (that\u2019s Canada across the river.) My in-laws really enjoyed seeing the North Shore and I\u2019m so glad we took them. \u00a0I have so many childhood memories of camping up north, I always like sharing that part my beautiful state. We were all so tired after our long trip from CO and then our northern MN trip, but we did make some time to go see my Mom\u2019s beautiful yard, and we convinced my father-in-law to make us calzones, as well as pizza! I\u2019m so glad that we were able to overlap our Colorado trip with my in-laws and that they were able to come to see our new home. \u00a0It is hard to be away from GC\u2019s family, seeing them during the school year is something we gave up when we moved away from the East Coast last year. \u00a0We definitely cherished the time we got to spend with them. And now that they know it doesn\u2019t snow in August, the will definitely come back!

{"date": "June 8, 2012", "body": "I was subbing as a para at a local elementary school this week and got to talking with another para during our lunch break. \u201cI\u2019m ready to be done, ready for summer,\u201d she told me. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going on vacation right after school gets out and I\u2019m really looking forward to relaxing. \u00a0We\u2019re going up to the lake and it\u2019s just wonderful. \u00a0My 3 kids will sit on the dock and fish for hours. \u00a0We get to sit back and relax. \u00a0The kids just love it up there, they will play for hours, building little rivers and dams in the sand. \u00a0They love catching minnows and putting them in little ponds they make on the beach. \u00a0Our oldest is old enough now to take the boat out on the lake and fish with the younger two. \u00a0They stay in sight, but they can go out on their own for a bit. \u00a0My husband and I will sit on the shore with a drink, chat, and watch them fish. \u00a0They totally entertain themselves.\u201d \u201cWow\u2026that sounds wonderful. \u00a0I have a different sort of reaction to summer barreling down on me,\u201d \u00a0I told her. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s more like this!\u201d \u00a0I threw up my hands as if trying to stop a bus from running me over. \u201cThat\u2019s right, your little boy is autistic?\u201d \u00a0She asked me. \u00a0\u201cI think about the parents of our kids at the end of the year, what summer is like for them as I know how intense some of these kids are. \u00a0I think almost all of the moms are stay at home moms, except for one family.\u201d \u201cYup, summers can be looooong, and I always joke that I\u2019m going to be hanging on by my nails at the end of it, but it\u2019s not really a joke! \u00a0I usually do feel that way at the end of August. \u00a0When the bus pulls away on that first day of school I feel a mixture of fear and anxiety for my child, but I also do a little jig and then lay on the floor in the foyer for 5-10 minutes.\u201d \u201cDo you have lots of stuff planned for him this summer?\u201d she asked me. \u201cI\u2019ve signed him up for a friendship club that meets once a week, he\u2019s going to do a 2 week swim camp and a 1 week basketball camp, and then there\u2019s summer school in July\u2026\u201d I trailed off. \u201cThat sounds like a lot, but there is still a lot of time in the day. \u00a0Basketball is for 1 hour in the mornings, swim lessons are only 30 minutes, and the friendship group meets for an hour. \u00a0He needs lots of activities to do, and he doesn\u2019t really go off and play or entertain himself. \u00a0My only time to get anything done is when he\u2019s watching a show, so that\u2019s when I take a shower.\u201d \u201cWow, so you\u2019ll be busy this summer huh?\u201d \u201cYup, my full time job starts on Friday morning!\u201d *** I remember the feeling of freedom when the bell rang on the last day of school. \u00a0Summer is some of the best times when you are a kid. \u00a0I want it to be that way for the Roc. \u00a0I don\u2019t want to dread summer, but I\u2019ll admit that I do. \u00a0I dread being the full time entertainer for 12 weeks. 12 weeks is a long time. As my dread grew in the last few weeks, I\u2019ve thought a lot about what the Roc and I could do to make this a fun summer. \u00a0Last summer was full of big transitions. \u00a0We moved across the country, lived with family for 5 weeks, then moved into our own home. \u00a0I didn\u2019t have a car for much of the summer and that really limited the Roc and I getting out and staying busy. \u00a0This summer has the potential to be much more fun, for both of us. I\u2019ve thought about how and when to conduct some homeschooling time, the Roc and I, so he doesn\u2019t lose the\u00a0academic\u00a0skills he\u2019s been building this year. \u00a0He participated in a portion of summer school after we arrived in MN, but it wasn\u2019t enough, and we were so busy with the move that I didn\u2019t do anything extra to help him retain what he knew. \u00a0He lost 3/4 of the sight words he knew at the end of kindergarten. \u00a0I have a big stack of stuff from his special ed teacher, and we are going to work at least 3 mornings a week, more if I can get him to particpate. \u00a0I still need to decide what he\u2019s going to be working for and how exactly he\u2019s going to earn his reward. \u00a0That\u2019s on my list for the weekend. \u00a0But the Roc is not going to think having \u201cschool time\u201d with mommy is fun. \u00a0I need to come up with fun stuff for us to do. So I\u2019ve decided to make a summer bucket list and we\u2019ll try to cross off as many things as we can before school starts again in September. \u00a0Some will be outings, some will be crafts, some will be simple activities. In no particular order. \u2013 Go bowling (The Roc has never been, this is the summer to change that.) \u2013 Swim at 2 new lakes (We went to one near our house last year, and I know there are 2 more pretty close by with swimming beaches.) \u2013 Go to the children\u2019s museum \u2013 Paint on the porch \u2013 Go to a Twin\u2019s game (I\u2019m cheating as I know we are going to go to the autism night at the Twins in July.) \u2013 Visit the MN zoo \u2013 Make a piece of outdoor art for the garden \u2013 Visit the como zoo \u2013 Go to the library (I\u2019m shooting for once a week, thinking of picking a day and having that be part of a routine.) \u2013 Plant some flowers \u2013 Try one of the free craft days at the park (This could be\u00a0disaster, and in the past the thought of strangers and their children kept me from taking the Roc, but he\u2019s come a long way. \u00a0I need to try again) \u2013 Play on the waterslide we bought last year \u2013 Tie die t-shirts \u2013 Find a new dam \u2013 Plan an outing with a new friend \u2013 Plan an outing with an old friend \u2013 Go on a dinner/movie date with GC (okay, this one doesn\u2019t include the Roc, but he\u2019ll still be happy to hang out with Grandma.) \u2013 Swim in 3 new pools \u2013 Pick blueberries \u2013 Try 3 of the experiments in the kiddie science books I bought at the neighborhood garage sale \u2013 Find a new (to the Roc) waterfall \u2013 Go to the movies \u2013 Go for a spontaneous canoe ride \u2013 Spend a whole day playing at home, really playing WITH the Roc \u2013 Say yes, even when I feel like saying no That last one is big. \u00a0Sometimes I want to say no when we are invited places. \u00a0It\u2019s a lot of work to prep for each event. \u00a0The Roc needs so much guidance that sometimes it\u2019s easier and less stressful to stay at home. \u00a0I know it\u2019s better for both of us to go out. I want this summer to be fun for the Roc, and me. Only 87 days until the first day of school. (I cannot be the only one who counted that out today.) \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/summer-bucket-list/", "title": "Summer Bucket List"},

{"date": "June 19, 2012", "body": "The Roc and I survived the first week of summer \u201cvacation.\u201d The Roc started sleeping in as soon as school ended. \u00a0No more 5:30 am baths for him. \u00a0I let him sleep. On Monday the Roc started a two-week swim camp at the swim school he\u2019s been attending since the fall. \u00a0He was excited and nervous to be in a new lane, with a new instructor, and 2 new kids, but the lure of the water is strong and he left my side easily to get started. \u00a0When it was over he was happy and told me it was because he got to do new stuff. \u00a0He is in a new \u201clevel\u201d for this camp and will be working on the front-crawl, the backstroke, and swimming underwater. He loves the water and allowed the instructor to move and guide him in ways he never lets me when we go to the pool together. \u00a0The last two lessons of the week I grin watching him try to\u00a0propel\u00a0himself downward to grab a ring off the bottom of the pool, four feet down. \u00a0He needed the instructor to help him get underwater, but he grabbed that ring and was all smiles when he broke the surface. During the first lesson, another mother struck up a conversation by asking me how old the he is. \u00a0When I asked the same she commented that her daughter is also seven, but very uncoordinated for her age and that swimming is very hard for her. \u00a0I mention that it is hard for the Roc too and she tells me that her daughter was a micro-preemie, born at 24 weeks, she spent over 100 days in the NICU, and her only real lasting \u201cissue\u201d is with gross motor. \u00a0She said she has never looked at children the same, and cannot believe how much most people take for granted in regards to their children. \u00a0That after all her daughter has overcome, she takes nothing for granted. \u00a0I tell her I understand on a cellular level, down to my toes, exactly what she is getting at as my son has autism. \u00a0We discussed that yes, he doesn\u2019t look like he is autistic, but he is. \u00a0She smiled as she watched him, \u00a0then commented on how happy he is in the water. We sat \u00a0together for the rest of the week. Also on Monday, The Roc started the first of his once-a-week \u201cfriendship club.\u201d \u00a0He was nervous to leave me in the lobby and after a few contorted facial expressions and five glances back over his shoulder, he went with the therapist. \u00a0I blew out a deep breath when he disappeared from view and made eye contact with the other mother who stayed behind in the waiting room. \u00a0She asked me if it was the Roc\u2019s first group of this kind and we soon exchanged that both of our boys were on the autism spectrum. \u00a0We quickly got past all formalities and threw small talk out the window as we unraveled our stories in that small cheerful lobby. \u00a0When the children came back the Roc thrust the puppet he made during craft time an inch from my nose and loudly proclaimed that they put on a play. \u00a0He said he had a great time and would come back again. Tuesday morning the Roc had a dental appointment to get the sealants applied to his molars and he surprised me while we waited in the lobby by building with legos in the kids corner. \u00a0I had long ago given up pushing him to put small legos together, as his frustration with his fingers would cause a meltdown. \u00a0I made a mental note to get some legos. \u00a0I watched the anxiety sweep over him when the\u00a0hygienist\u00a0called his name and I reminded him to listen and follow her directions. \u00a0Twenty minutes later he was back with two\u00a0hygienists, they worked together to get his sealants done in half the time. \u00a0They said he listened well and earned a prize from the box. We also started our \u201csummer school at home\u201d this week and the Roc did well working for stickers to add to his \u201cgo to Dairy Queen chart.\u201d \u00a0I wonder how long he will cooperate. After the Roc\u2019s swim lesson on Wednesday we went to my parents house. \u00a0We stayed there until Saturday, house and doggy-sitting while they went up north to celebrate their anniversary. \u00a0We stayed up late watching a movie that night. After swim camp on Thursday we had to make sure we got back to my parents house in time for a meat delivery. \u00a0Forty pounds of meat that my dad uses to make meals for his two dogs. \u00a0Looks yummy doesn\u2019t it? I had to divide it into four containers. \u00a0Then I let the dogs clean out the plastic tub. The older dog got into the tub and then couldn\u2019t get out. \u00a0He is no longer able to go into reverse. \u00a0I helped him. The Roc and I had been together non-stop and needed to get out of the house, so on Friday we went to the park and watched the water flow over the dam. Later we met up with two of my girlfriends from high school. \u00a0The Roc was nervous to go, but he played on their play set and sat with all the kids eating dinner before they all went swimming! When the kids were done swimming we all went inside. \u00a0I thought for sure we would be leaving, thinking the Roc wouldn\u2019t be able to handle playing inside. \u00a0He proved me wrong, following my friend\u2019s son K to his bedroom. \u00a0They played together. \u00a0I sat on the couch and talked to my two friends. \u00a0It was a completely new moment for me as I flashed back a few years on those play dates that never went well. \u00a0How the Roc used to cling to me and I would try in vain to get him interested in some toys or playing with the other kids while the other mothers sipped coffee and chatted. The Roc and I headed back to our house on Saturday when my parents got back from their trip. \u00a0On Sunday I told GC he had to bring the Roc with him to the airport when he went to drop off his friend as I needed a bit of space. \u00a0GC\u2019s friend had been in town for ten days and so I had been on \u201cRoc duty\u201d almost the whole time. \u00a0He took him and then stopped at Toys R Us on the way home and let the Roc use his money to buy a new toy. \u00a0He bought some Scooby-Doo characters and was happy to get them out of the package when they got home. We had my parents over for dinner on Sunday night to celebrate Father\u2019s Day. \u00a0I had the Roc go into the house to get the present I had wrapped for my dad. \u00a0\u201cIs it M&Ms?!?!\u201d he yelled as he left the porch. \u00a0Luckily my dad didn\u2019t hear him! \u00a0It was M&Ms!

{"date": "November 8, 2012", "body": "I\u2019ve been pushing down the words for months.\u00a0 Holding them in, sweating and pounding them out as I push myself on runs, sweeping them to the side, swallowing them with my dinner, and those words have clogged my brain and made me feel claustrophobic.\u00a0 Lately I have moments where I cannot breathe and I have to stop and stand still, quiet my racing heart and clear my mind.\u00a0 I stand in the bathroom and let the tears fall silently for a few moments before putting my face back together.\u00a0 I start to release the valve and then I walk away from the computer.\u00a0 I have posts in my draft folder titled, \u201cMore Than a Housewife,\u201d \u201cGrief,\u201d and \u201cUnexpected.\u201d\u00a0 I cannot finish them and push publish.\u00a0 Too raw.\u00a0 Too much. A week ago I had a string of days in which I awoke in the early morning hours because of nightmares.\u00a0 Five nights out of seven my eyes snapped open to register the darkness, my heart crashing against my ribs, the sheets and my tank top damp with sweat.\u00a0 Images and scenes, worries and fears brought forward so clearly tears pricked my eyes as I tried to get back to sleep.\u00a0 These awful dreams were never the same, but they all centered on the Roc, except for one.\u00a0 I\u2019d lost the Roc and couldn\u2019t find him, he was choking and I couldn\u2019t save him, he was a teenager and some boys lured him off the bus and beat him up and he couldn\u2019t tell me who they were, and one dream in which the police knocked on my door to tell me my husband was dead.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need a therapist to interpret those dreams. I have been struggling with that baby fence again.\u00a0 Feeling secure in my decision to close the door on another child.\u00a0 The years of trying and wishing and hoping and the crushing disappointment of loss too much for me.\u00a0 I want to move on from these feelings.\u00a0 I want to stop thinking about it.\u00a0 I have days when I say NO loud and clear to myself.\u00a0 This one is more than enough.\u00a0 We three are good and I have all that I can handle.\u00a0 I have a few days here and there where my heart aches for the 6 month old baby I would be taking care of today. I heard, \u201cWow, I don\u2019t know how you do it.\u00a0 He is a full time job, and I can tell you work hard,\u201d from the Roc\u2019s spec ed teacher during one of our recent phone conversations regarding his spiraling behavior at school.\u00a0 It\u2019s been hard to get these notes, these emails, these phone calls from school.\u00a0 Is he really acting up that much?\u00a0 Is it so different from last year?\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Is this spec ed teacher, who is new to the Roc, and new to this age group, putting more emphasis on the negative?\u00a0 How and why is it so different from last year?\u00a0 Where is the positive?\u00a0 There is positive about my child, they see it right?\u00a0 Are they making sure to focus on the positive?\u00a0 What message is he getting at school? School.\u00a0 Sh*t school is getting hard for my boy.\u00a0 He is struggling, but learning at his own pace.\u00a0 I struggled to hold onto the positive when we heard all that he cannot do and how far behind he is during our recent IEP meeting.\u00a0 I am dreading fall conference tonight.\u00a0 Dreading.\u00a0 Dreading.\u00a0 Dreading.\u00a0 The notes, emails and phone calls this past week haven\u2019t helped.\u00a0 Homework battles ensue every afternoon after school.\u00a0 It is so hard to watch him struggle.\u00a0 Not much comes easily at school and it\u2019s hard on my heart to imagine what he  feels  like when he\u2019s there.\u00a0 What his body feels like, and what his heart feels like.\u00a0 I worry. Recently, in a moment where I was so full of warring emotions I fired off a string of words to my friends, my autism mamas, my sounding board: I\u2019m feeling the panic well up inside.\u00a0 I\u2019m fighting it.\u00a0 It\u2019s winning.\u00a0 There is just SO MUCH to teach this child.\u00a0 How will I do it all?\u00a0 How can I prepare him for the world.\u00a0 The smallest interactions with people are so terribly hard for him.\u00a0 He\u2019s having a rough go at school.\u00a0 Learning to read is frustrating the sh*t out of him, math is so hard, everything is hard.\u00a0 Friends?\u00a0 What friends?\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen the looks, I notice the avoidance.\u00a0 Oh my heart. On a walk at the dog park this afternoon he told me he wished we had more kids at our house and then asked me, \u201cWhat were you going to name that baby who died?\u201d\u00a0 Oh my heart.\u00a0 I thought my chest would explode.\u00a0 Oh my heart.

{"date": "July 14, 2013", "body": "It\u2019s so calm in the changing area during the summer compared to the bustle of the school year.\u00a0 It is still loud at times, the tiled floor and walls echoing little girls squeals and the cyclonic swimsuit dryer.\u00a0 But the vibe is definitely summer and I see it on the other mom\u2019s faces as they shoo their children into changing stalls with smiles. I watch them while I sit on the wooden bench and wait. It\u2019s a different kind of waiting now. All those months of watching but not helping.\u00a0 The pressure I felt as I saw the door handle jiggle while the Roc screeched and pleaded for me to help him.\u00a0 I forced myself to be still, rooted to the floor, fingers pressed against my sides back in  March . Now I sit, heels crossed, toe tapping as I watch his feet under the door. I see his swimsuit flop onto the floor, watch the bottom of his towel move about, and I hear his voice. He is singing to himself.\u00a0 He has a beautiful voice. I sift my weight, rest my ankle on my knee, watch as a little boy exits another changing stall.\u00a0 He entered after the Roc.\u00a0 \u201cCome on Mom!\u201d he yells to his mother who is waiting across the little room from me. I listen to the Roc, still singing to himself. I smile and put both feet on the floor.\u00a0 Check the time on my phone. He is still singing.

{"date": "June 24, 2012", "body": "12/31/07 \u00a0 From Neurologist summary, based off parent responses: \u00a0 Roc has little interest in toys, and has no\u00a0imaginative\u00a0play. \u00a0Instead of driving cars and trucks around, he will flip them over and spin the wheels. \u00a0He is very interested in watching things fall, such as pouring water, sand, or dropping toys on the ground. \u00a0He will wiggle his fingers in front of a group of toys. \u00a0 He likes things that spin. \n The Roc has come a long way since that very first doctor appointment on the very last day of 2007. \u00a0I will always remember the sinking feeling I had when I read about the lack of play skills and realized that my son didn\u2019t know how to play. Didn\u2019t know how to play. What do I do? \u00a0How do I teach my son to play?\u00a0 We started with simple building blocks. \u00a0I literally taught him how to build with blocks and giant legos. \u00a0We worked on the simple puzzles with the little red tabs. \u00a0He screamed in frustration at his inability to control his fingers and the pieces. \u00a0I made animals out of play dough and had them walk across the table. \u00a0The Roc would grab them and smash them. \u00a0I drove the cars he lined up. \u00a0He screamed when I messed up his line. \u00a0I did it anyway. \u00a0I got in his space and didn\u2019t let up. \u00a0At night I sometimes cried, feeling that this was bigger than me, that I would never be able to teach him. \u00a0That too much time was slipping by, that the \u201cwindow\u201d I read about was closing. I got up and did it again the next day. Then I modeled imaginative play. \u00a0I set up the train track in his bedroom and made the train go. \u00a0I encouraged him to copy. \u00a0I cheered when he did. \u00a0He resisted any kind of change. \u00a0If I tried to get him to lead and let my train follow his, he screamed bloody murder. \u00a0I kept trying. \u00a0I cheered when he let my train follow his. \u00a0I made the tracks go around the room. \u00a0The closet became a spooky cave, the bed was a mountain, the pillows were a volcano, the carpet under the windows was the beach, a blanket ruffled up became waves. \u00a0The trains went on an adventure to these different locations. \u00a0Always in the same order. \u00a0I expanded out onto the landing, which I called Arizona. \u00a0The Roc screamed and thrashed at the changes in our play routine. \u00a0I cheered him on when he eventually joined in. Slowly, slowly the Roc expanded. \u00a0We had picnics with his stuffed animals. \u00a0We worked on playing with the little people farm and castle, then the little people would go on field trips (after my mom was out visiting in DE and she did this with him) and then the Roc started having parties for the little people. \u00a0Last spring, around the time we found out we would be moving to MN, the Roc started having  concerts for his stuffed animals . \u00a0Something he would set up all on his own. I cheered for every step of progress. \u00a0For each skill learned. The Roc\u2019s play has again evolved. \u00a0He still loves a good party, but this weekend he made up a Halloween carnival for his little people: The moon bounce. The \u201cghost coaster.\u201d \u00a0A scary, Halloween themed roller coaster where imaginary monsters jumped out and scared the riders. The \u201cregular roller coaster.\u201d \u00a0Lots of sound effects went along with this one. The cotton candy machine. \u00a0Where the little people \u201csmashed their faces in the cotton candy and then ate it.\u201d Bobbing for apples was next. Then the ferries wheel. \u00a0Note that scale is not an issue at this carnival. The lollipop stand. \u00a0Where the people each picked giant lollipops, but eventually ate them all. The game room where there was \u201cbasketball toss, soccer kick, and football throw.\u201d Finally, all the people got multiple prizes. \u00a0Giant stuffed animal prizes, because what else do you get at a carnival? He set it all up himself, and there is a fair amount of screaming when things don\u2019t line up, or stay upright, or bend too far. \u00a0I tried not to help out during the construction, but let him work it out for himself (after I told him multiple times to stop the screaming.) The next skill I would love to see develop is for him to play some of these things himself. \u00a0I still have to play with him, and it\u2019s not easy to play all day when you are an adult. \u00a0He cooperated with me yesterday in allowing me to stop and photograph each area of the carnival. \u00a0He has tried to play a few of these party/carnival creations with other children, but the other kids his age are pretty far past playing with little people. My time is now up as I am being called to the \u201cChristmas Carnival.\u201d Enjoy the weekend!

{"date": "August 29, 2013", "body": "I meant to keep better track of this summer.\u00a0 I wanted to make sure to document the Roc\u2019s activities, because this has been a full summer for him.\u00a0 Because it was full for him, it was full for me too, and I didn\u2019t find much time to write about what we were doing.\u00a0 So here I sit, at the end of summer, using my photos to spark my memory, because I want to record this summer with words as well as photos. June 2013 The Roc went to a special needs day camp the week after school got out in June and was able to go at the same time as a friend (a friend!.)\u00a0 A girlfriend of mine has a son on the spectrum the same age as the Roc.\u00a0 We\u2019ve gotten them together for play dates, and they get along really well.\u00a0 Last spring I told her about the day camp, and she mentioned that J had gone last year, and so we signed them up for the same week this summer.\u00a0 We carpooled and I did pick up in the afternoons.\u00a0 It was hysterical and deafening listening to them in the back chattering over each other at top volume those first couple days.\u00a0 And the bathroom humor\u2026oh my.\u00a0 They both want to go again next summer. *** The next week the Roc did half day social skills camp where they met at different places (bowling, an indoor play park, the aquarium at MOA, golf) and worked on the themes presented in the Superflex books.\u00a0 He enjoyed the activities more than the \u201ctalking part,\u201d especially this awesome indoor play ground. My mom and I took him to the Rainforest Cafe at the MOA after the camp met at the aquarium.\u00a0 He enjoyed the rain, not so much the thunder.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think it would bother him as he doesn\u2019t seem afraid of real thunderstorms.\u00a0 But he was anxious and right away said he was scared.\u00a0 The hostess took his que and sat us in away from some of the action, but where he could still see a huge fish tank and he had rain right behind him.\u00a0 He loved it. *** ESY started in June and continued through most of July.\u00a0 The Roc came home most days with a smile.\u00a0 He told me he wished third grade would be half day like summer school.\u00a0 I bet. *** The Roc has been writing more to express himself.\u00a0 He writes and draws cards for me, and sometimes for GC (but mostly for me.) He spent some time one morning in June working on a book he titled,  If You Take A Mouse Camping,  and came up with each page on his own.\u00a0 I would write out what he wanted to say on a white board and he would copy it down and then draw a picture. He was so very proud of himself when he finished it, and he said it was for GC. He has also used writing to express his displeasure with my discipline tactics.\u00a0 We have gone through a rough period of lots of screaming, yelling, screeching, and talking back this summer.\u00a0 The Roc is so very easily frustrated and his immediate reactions that so easily turn into full on meltdowns are hard on all of us.\u00a0 He is also being deliberately disrespectful, which has added an extra challenge, for all of us.\u00a0 One evening, out of sheer frustration, I sent him to his room each time he screamed/yelled/screeched.\u00a0 When he exploded over being sent to his room I put one of his (many) stuffed animals in my closet and told him he had to earn it back with good behavior.\u00a0 At first this caused a HUGE eruption.\u00a0 Later after more tears and screams he came to find me to show me what he thought of my new rule. \u201cNot good.\u201d About ten minutes later he came to show me this. He must have forgiven me because the next day he was busy making me signs and cards. I\u2019m glad he is learning to express himself.\u00a0 We just need to get the volatile emotions under control. At the end of June we went camping.\u00a0 We love to camp and the Roc is an outdoor kiddo.\u00a0 Unfortunately we encountered some RAIN and spent the first day inside the tent or walking around in the rain (the Roc and I.)\u00a0 It was a long day.\u00a0 But the rain let up in the afternoon and we were able to get out for a few hours before it started again.         The rest of the weekend was nice!         June flew by so fast.

{"date": "January 31, 2013", "body": "Basketball started a couple weeks ago and this year there were no tears shed on the way to the Roc\u2019s first practice.\u00a0 The nerves were still present, but the tears were absent, a little less anxious this year.\u00a0 It helps to have an idea of what is going to happen.\u00a0 The fear of the unknown is one of the Roc\u2019s worst enemies.\u00a0 It also helps that the Roc has the same two coaches from last year.\u00a0 At basketball opening night back in December only one of the coaches had signed up, and when the other dad arrived and realized that his son was on the Roc\u2019s team again, he asked the first coach if he would like some help again this year.\u00a0 His wife had signed his son up, and hadn\u2019t signed her husband up to coach.\u00a0 My eyes filled up with tears when I heard him ask the first coach if he\u2019d like some help, I knew he would be helping the Roc during games as he did last year.\u00a0 GC told me later that he asked the first coach how he came to be the Roc\u2019s coach again this year, and apparently at the coaches meeting, the first coach asked to have the Roc when he found out the Roc was playing again this year.\u00a0 Hearing that brought tears to my eyes, again.\u00a0 There are some good people in this world. It\u2019s been fun to see the Roc during practices this year.\u00a0 They separated the kids out this year so only two teams are in the gym where he practices.\u00a0 Therefore there is a lot less noise, movement, and general chaos.\u00a0 This year there is a bit more of an ease about the Roc during practices.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t look as lost, he listens to the coaches instead of looking to us, he concentrates, and he smiles!\u00a0 I often see him do his \u201chappy hop\u201d while he is waiting in line during a passing or shooting drill.\u00a0 He tries so hard! Last year the games were harder.\u00a0 He looked lost, kept his arms down by his sides, and was very rigid in his movements.\u00a0 He never knew which end of the court he was supposed to be at and he was always at the back of the pack when the boys ran from one end to the other.\u00a0 He never got in with this kids, preferring to stay on the outskirts, and he was never passed the ball. There is definite difference in the Roc\u2019s comfort level during the games this year.\u00a0 This year the second coach has been helping him during games, and we added a couple phrases the coach says while out on the court with him, \u201cDefense Roc!\u00a0 Guard your guy!\u201d and \u201cOffense Roc, Get open for the ball!\u201d to help him remember what he is supposed to be doing.\u00a0 He stays with the pack and is quicker to move with his team from each end of the court.\u00a0 The Roc requests to guard the same guy when it is his turn to play, a huge step in speaking up for himself, and he tries hard to stay with him.\u00a0 A few times the ball has come near the Roc, and he looks so surprised to see it.\u00a0 The shock when the ball bounces right in front of him or off his fingertips (because he always has his arms in the air) is apparent (and adorable.)\u00a0 He tries to get open while on offense, but so far he has been fairly easy for the opposing teammates to guard. Last Saturday, about halfway through the game the Roc was open and a teammate passed him the ball\u2026and he caught it!\u00a0 He looked surprised to have the ball in his hands and because he was near the hoop GC and a couple other people sitting near us shouted out, \u201cShoot it!\u00a0 Shoot it!!\u201d\u00a0 I felt the collective pull for the Roc as he raised the ball and released it\u2026and it went IN!!!\u00a0 I cheered, GC cheered, his coach cheered, and I heard the parents around me cheering.\u00a0 But his reaction to the ball going in was priceless.\u00a0 His face split open into a big grin and he was beaming pride.\u00a0 He stopped and looked at us sitting on the sidelines before he realized he was supposed to run down to the other end of the court. \u201cOh, that was adorable!\u201d one of the mom\u2019s who knows about the Roc leaned over and said to me. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry!\u201d I told her, waving my hands in front of my eyes as they filled up with tears. I am grateful that so far, at this age, it has been about learning the game, practicing the skills, trying hard, and having fun.\u00a0 The score is not kept during the games, and the parents I have sat near have been positive, clapping for good plays, giggling when the boys end up rolling on the floor grabbing for the ball, and groaning at missed baskets, no matter the team. This has been a wonderful sport for the Roc to try.\u00a0 He is learning so much and it is helping him in so many ways.\u00a0 I am so grateful to the coaches who are so positive and really encourage him. I\u2019m so proud of him for all that he has done and that he keeps trying.\u00a0 I know it isn\u2019t easy and he is nervous and anxious and the pace of the game is overwhelming for him.\u00a0 But he keeps trying.

{"date": "October 18, 2013", "body": "September saw the start of school and the continuation of all of the Roc\u2019s after school  stuff:  swimming lessons, music therapy, OT, skills training. First day of 3rd grade. Holy cow.\u00a0 Only one more year after this one and then he will be on to middle school.\u00a0 That fact boggles my mind and makes me want to dig in my heels and slow the earth down.\u00a0 I\u2019m not ready. The adjustment into 3rd grade has resulted in more pull outs for academics, a few notes about \u201ctricky\u201d and \u201chard\u201d mornings and/or afternoons, and once I got email letting me know that the day was \u201cup and down all day.\u201d\u00a0 These notes and emails make me worry and think that he\u2019s having multiple long and loud outbursts.\u00a0 I spend a lot of time worrying and trying to ask the Roc details about his day, of which I get few. While talking to a good friend who has a son with ADHD, who isn\u2019t  on anything , I realize that we are at a certain point when she says, \u201cI have to feel like we\u2019ve done everything.\u00a0 EVERYTHING else, and drugs would be a last resort.\u201d The Roc is understanding that things are harder for him than other children, that his volcano (his term for his big feelings) is bigger than most, and he has said things in the last few months that break my heart.\u00a0 So when she says her last resort comment my mind flashes through all that we have done and lands on the image of the Roc grabbing his head recently and shouting, \u201cWhy am I this way?\u00a0 Why does my brain do this? I don\u2019t want to be this way!\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t like the way I AM!!\u00a0 What is WRONG with me?!!\u201d I realize we may be at that point, that last resort.\u00a0 Because it\u2019s more than academics, his self worth is at stake. So in mid-September the Roc and I take a ride downtown to visit the developmental ped to talk about what big pharma can do to help him.\u00a0 A road we haven\u2019t taken.\u00a0 A place we have been avoiding.\u00a0 I spent a good chunk of time researching what I think the good doctor may recommend before our appointment and end up leaving without a prescription, but an offer to call it in if we want it.\u00a0 I do more research and spend time talking to the Roc about how he feels about his volcano and medicine to help control it.\u00a0 I call in the prescription and then go away for a weekend without picking it up. I come back from my weekend away to GC telling me how well his weekend with the Roc was.\u00a0 How they went bowling one morning and the Roc sat himself down and took a few deep breaths when he got upset about not knocking down enough pins.\u00a0 How he said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking cool thoughts, like J taught me.\u201d\u00a0 (J is his skills trainer, and they have been working on the Roc\u2019s explosions for months.) GC and I attend the Roc\u2019s IEP at the end of September and I walk into the building with a familiar sense of dread.\u00a0 I\u2019m not looking forward to hearing all the ways the Roc is behind and details about his outbursts. When did I become a pessimist? I am taken aback when the team tells me that although the Roc is still exploding, sometimes multiple times a day, the outbursts are shorter and he is calming himself down quicker.\u00a0 GC and I make eye contact.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t expect to hear this.\u00a0 I tell the team I am surprised, I had thought he was being more disruptive than he was the year before? Maybe all that we are doing is working?\u00a0 Maybe we do not need to fill the prescription?\u00a0 After the meeting is over GC and I talk about all the little things that have slowly been changing with the Roc and also all the outbursts that still wreck havoc on our day to day lives.\u00a0 GC tells me I cannot see the forest through the trees.\u00a0 That I am holding onto what is hard and not seeing the things that are changing.\u00a0 I wonder if he is right?\u00a0 Did I become a pessimist? I pick up the prescription, just in case. We go back and forth.\u00a0 Should we try the RX?\u00a0 Should we wait?\u00a0 What about the side effects?\u00a0 Oh man, the side effects\u2026 While riding in the car to OT one afternoon I start to ask the Roc questions about his volcano.\u00a0 He tells me that he has a hard time controlling it.\u00a0 I ask if he wants to try the medicine we talked to the doctor about.\u00a0 He pauses and says, \u201cMaybe I will be able to control it myself?\u2026and if I can\u2019t then I can try it?\u201d I swallow hard and blink back my tears.\u00a0 I watch him in the rear view mirror as he watches the farm fields slip by. *** The RX bottle sits unopened on my dresser. On the hard days I wonder what we are waiting for, and on the smooth(er\u2013because there is always something to scream about in this house,) I think he (and we) can do this. I guess we haven\u2019t made it to the last resort yet.

{"date": "September 2, 2013", "body": "I wrote  this  about the time we were in South Carolina in 2010.\u00a0 The Roc had such a hard time with his fear of the waves on that trip.\u00a0 There was one day when he did go in a tidal pool and then the tide came in and he had a blast in the incoming waves.\u00a0 When his cousins arrived a couple hours later he had more motivation to stay in the water and play.\u00a0 It was towards the end of the trip, and he didn\u2019t want to go in the ocean again, but I took it as progress in conquering his fear of the waves.\u00a0 If he did it once, he would be able to do it again, even if it took a few years, or longer. Well, moving across the country meant that it took a few years to get back to the beach. The Roc kept telling me that he was going to go in the ocean when we got to the beach this year.\u00a0 Over and over we read the book, \u201cLadybug Girl At The Beach\u201d in the months leading up to our trip.\u00a0 It was a book we had read only sporadically before, but repetitively in May and June.\u00a0 I was hopeful for him, but I wasn\u2019t going to push him and I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t be disappointed if the waves proved too much for him again this year.\u00a0 Based off his repeated declarations about playing in the waves, I thought that this just might be the year he would go in. The first day at the beach we walked down to a tidal pool, which I knew the Roc would love because he could still play in the water and build sand castles, which he started right away. Then he laid down in the tidal pool. Then he laid down in waves! Then he RAN into the water! And he ran back and forth, into the water and out, flopping onto his belly and swimming, popping up before a wave crashed over his head, all the while with a grin on his face. In fact, it seemed that he didn\u2019t stop smiling every day we went to the beach! Well\u2026it\u2019s not always true that he was smiling.\u00a0 He did get annoyed with my constant photography. But he got over it quickly.\u00a0 Usually. One of the days just him and I were at the beach he worked on building a wall around the tidal pool (I helped some and sat on a beach chair and watched some, a perfect balance.\u00a0 I was glad we practiced at the lake.) He got a lot of compliments on his creation. I was so happy to see him let go at the beach.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t anxious about the waves at all.\u00a0 He ran and splashed in them!\u00a0 He alternated between building sand castles and playing in the ocean.\u00a0 He had fun.\u00a0 He was  carefree . It was what I wanted for him three years ago when we were there. I didn\u2019t know I just had to wait. This child is forever teaching me patience.

He was anxious about being caught unaware when they started, so he stopped his movie when it got darker, and then repetitively asked us when the fireworks would start and if they would be loud.\u00a0 During the fireworks he wore his noise canceling headphones and sat on GC\u2019s lap, wrapped in a blanket to keep the mosquitoes from biting him.\u00a0 He LOVED the fireworks. Loved them.\u00a0 It was such a joy to see him so excited and hear him say, \u201cWow!\u201d over and over.\u00a0 We waited for the right time for him. *** GC\u2019s friend from New York, Jared, stopped by our house while he was on a skydiving road trip.\u00a0 It was wonderful to see him and he enjoyed our screened in porch so much that he slept in it! *** We surprised the Roc more than once and went to Dairy Queen! This kid loves his ice cream! *** The Roc had ESY for three weeks in July, and he continued with his hippotherapy, music therapy, occupational therapy, and his once a week skills trainer in the afternoons after summer school.\u00a0 His only free day during the week was on Fridays. *** The Roc and I went to a nearby lake to swim one Friday afternoon towards the end of July.\u00a0 I told him before we went that I would swim a little and play in the sand a little, but I would also sit on the blanket and read my book while he played in the sand by himself.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been really trying to get him to entertain himself a bit, there\u2019s only so much playing I can do.\u00a0 He agreed to my terms and he did fine while at the lake, actually more than fine. The beach was pretty empty and we stayed late into the afternoon.\u00a0 The Roc had lots of space to himself and I got to swim a little, play a little, and read a little. It was an afternoon that reminded me just how far we have come.\u00a0 A few years ago I couldn\u2019t have imagined that we would get to a place where I could sit back and watch the Roc play.\u00a0 There were a few factors that helped: the lack of people in our area, so there were no children screaming and splashing near him, and the water and sand, but I\u2019ll take it.\u00a0 Progress. *** At the end of July we headed out on a road trip to South Carolina to visit GC\u2019s side of the family.\u00a0 Months ago we had thought we would fly, but just couldn\u2019t stomach the price of airfare, and we never bought tickets.\u00a0 Then we bought a hybrid car in May and it was decided \u2013 we would drive to SC.\u00a0 You just cannot beat an average of 58 miles to the gallon, even if you are going to drive over 3,000 miles in two weeks!\u00a0 We were hoping for an easy drive and were concerned about having the Roc in the car for 21 hours of driving\u2026 He watched a LOT of movies in the iPad, but we made it!\u00a0 The Roc was so excited to go to South Carolina, he kept telling us that he was going to swim in the ocean this year.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t been to the ocean since 2010, and while he did go in one time during that trip, he was still wracked with anxiety about the waves.\u00a0 I was hopeful that he would overcome his fear this year and really let go at the beach\u2026 Next up, tales from South Carolina!\u00a0 (and lots of beach photos!) \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/imag0562.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/img_9706.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/imag0569.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/imag0581.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/imag05731.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/imag0576.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/imag0570.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/img_9788.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/summer-blur-july/", "title": "Summer blur: July"},

My cousin, who moved to Charleston last summer, was able to come up and help us celebrate.\u00a0 It was so fun to see him. We had a very nice meal and then the Roc was able to have some cake, which was what he was waiting for all afternoon. It was a nice little celebration. *** The real party came a few days later when we went down to my SIL\u2019s house.\u00a0 The Roc wanted an angry birds/pool party so we took all the kids over to the pool, before coming back for a meal and some pinata bashing.\u00a0 We let the Roc go first, but it was his cousin Aiden who busted the tiki head open! The kids were all very gracious and let the Roc go in and get some candy because he was really worried about all the kids rushing in.\u00a0 Uncle G helped the Roc pick out some candy. When he had picked up a few of each kind, he took a step back and the rest of the kids ran to fill up their bags. Then Uncle G had some fun with the tiki head. The Roc was so excited to come back inside for cupcakes, and presents! He was very happy to get angry birds toys and he and his cousin Bella got to playing right away.  It all proved too much for Uncle G and he just laid down on the floor and went to sleep\u2026 At this point the poor man had been awake for over 30 hours!\u00a0 Unlike Uncle G, it was hard getting the Roc to go to sleep that night.\u00a0 He was so wired up and overstimulated from the day, but he had such a great birthday party and lots of fun with his cousins (and his cousin\u2019s cousins who were visiting!) *** And this has nothing to do with the Roc\u2019s birthday celebration(s) but I stopped and stared at something I saw in my SIL\u2019s neighborhood:\u00a0 See that dark shape below the bench in the next photo?\u00a0 You know, a bench you are supposed to sit on and relax? \n Yup, you\u2019re right!\u00a0 That\u2019s an ALLIGATOR!\u00a0 o.m.g There is no sign like this one in my neighborhood in Minnesota!

I decided against the drink, and the Roc and I shared a dessert instead.\u00a0 I will always pick chocolate over alcohol.\u00a0 Even after spending 8 hours in the car. My grandmother lives in a small town and there isn\u2019t too much to do at her house.\u00a0 This can spell disaster for a guy like the Roc so we took him to a nearby lake to wear him out.\u00a0 He will only smile once, so you had better catch it if you want a happy picture.

Something just for me.\u00a0 A slice of time where I leave the house, alone, and focus on myself.\u00a0 Focus on my body, my breath, my muscles and tendons, my strength, my insides\u2026myself.\u00a0 A time to be quiet and not think the thoughts that are always swirling.\u00a0 As I drove I felt the weight behind my ribs, sitting low, taking up space and making it hard to breathe.\u00a0 The weight that I thought would go away when school started the day before, but had in fact grown larger.

I sent him off on the first day feeling happy to be getting back to routine and structure\u2026but also scared and worried about the year to come.\u00a0 Will he find success in his relationships with his peers?\u00a0 Will he feel good about himself?\u00a0 Will he feel confident in his own body or always uncomfortable?\u00a0 Will he act out as much as last year?\u00a0 Will reading and math always be so hard?\u00a0 Will he feel good about learning?\u00a0 Is he in the right sped placement?\u00a0 Will the regular ed teacher be a good fit for him?\u00a0\u00a0 Are his teachers pleased to have him? And on and on.\u00a0 I carry these thoughts and they announce themselves in the anxiety that flutters behind my ribs.\u00a0 The anxiety that catches me off guard sometimes and causes my hands to shake, my heart to race, and my lungs to constrict.\u00a0 There is so much to teach this child.\u00a0 I am so often overwhelmed at the width of it all. As I drove down the road, windows open, my off key voice trailing behind I noticed the weight, this balloon of anxiety.\u00a0 I carried it as I entered the room, scanned the array of people on their mats until I saw a space on the edge of the group, and claimed it with my mat.\u00a0 I sat still, my legs stretched out in front of me as I listened to a group of young moms come into the room, giggling and chatting.\u00a0 I felt the worries and fears stretching and shifting as I went through the opening exercises.\u00a0 I was conscious of the volume they were taking up, right there behind my ribs, rubbing elbows with my heart.\u00a0 Too much space.\u00a0 I filled my lungs, and imagined I was breathing out all that weight I carry, as I pushed the air from my nostrils.\u00a0 I fought that weight through the whole hour long class. Let go.\u00a0 Let go.\u00a0 Let go. At the end, as I laid in corpse pose, I found myself still fighting.\u00a0 My thoughts moved quickly behind my closed eyes when I knew they should be quiet. Let go.\u00a0 Let go.\u00a0 Let go. I focused on my toes, then my foot, my ankle, my knee, my hip, my stomach, my chest, my shoulder, and so on, all the way up to the top of my head. Relax and release. Let go. Let go.\u00a0 Let go. I didn\u2019t realize the rest of the class had sat back up when I cracked open my eyes. I sat up and filled my lungs, bowed my head, and slowly let all the air out of my chest. Let go. Let go. Let go. I realized that I felt lighter, some of the weight had evaporated.

But for over a year now, most of want I want to say never makes it to paper or my keyboard.\u00a0 I could say that life has gotten in the way, and that is true, but that\u2019s not the whole picture. One of the biggest reasons is that I feel blocked.\u00a0 In different ways I have been blocked.\u00a0 It shows in the time lapses between posts.\u00a0 In the posts full of pictures but few words. I do not know how much to tell anymore.\u00a0 I post the pictures, the fun, and the steps of progress\u2026but I no longer post as much about the hard stuff.\u00a0 I want to respect the Roc, his privacy and his feelings, should he read this in the future, and even if he doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 I worry that writing about the hard paints a negative image of the Roc and our lives.\u00a0 As he has gotten older, some of the hard involves other people, and I find it difficult to write about those situations, and so I don\u2019t. A couple weeks ago GC I were going backwards, jumping around in my blog commenting to each other over the photos and the things we were doing, the issues we dealt with and then forgot about, as new issues took their place.\u00a0 I realized that I still want to record our story.\u00a0 Where we have been and where we are going.\u00a0 I want to keep recording, the big things and the little things, the happy stuff and sometimes, when I can, the hard stuff.\u00a0 I want to connect, because so often I feel lonely on this journey, and I found connections by opening up and writing about our lives. So on the way out the door to meet my friend and her kids at the lake a few weeks ago I grabbed my notebook.\u00a0 I knew the Roc would want to stay at the beach much longer than my friend\u2019s kids and I figured I could release the valve onto paper while the Roc played in the sand. I wrote and wrote, scribbled the thoughts that I have been holding in for months. Most of them won\u2019t make it here.\u00a0 And that\u2019s okay. Because some of them will.

Last weekend was the annual meeting and open skate down at Mariucci arena on the University of Minnesota campus.\u00a0 The Roc was ready to go. There was none of the anxiety and fear of last year.\u00a0 The Roc asked if he would be able to skate, as he was worried he wouldn\u2019t remember, and he was worried that he would fall.\u00a0 But he happily suited up and got on the ice with GC (who is going to be volunteering as a coach this year!) He did fall down a few times, but he got right back up!\u00a0 (and he didn\u2019t want any help from Goldy!) The young Gopher player who helped the Roc last year was there again this year and she was delighted to see the Roc skating without any assistance. It was so fun to watch him!

{"date": "October 24, 2013", "body": "I took a deep breath and picked up the phone.\u00a0 I had been putting off making this phone call ever since I completed the online registration.\u00a0  Maybe I should have noted his autism diagnosis in the medical box?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t though, and tonight is the first practice, I need to let them know\u2026make sure he can still be on the team\u2026 *** For the last two winters the Roc has participated in the community ed basketball program, but I knew as time went on, and the gap widened, that basketball may not be the best fit for the Roc.\u00a0 Last year I heard of a local competitive swim team and wondered if the Roc could be on it in the future.\u00a0 He loves to swim and has been progressing in swim lessons, even starting to learn the breaststroke and  butterfly  this past summer.\u00a0 His boundless energy, love of the water, and willingness to follow directions in the pool, might make him a good fit for a swim team.\u00a0 I really liked what I read about this team on their website: \u201cWe pride ourselves on the sense of community we are creating. We strive to provide an environment where kids can learn to succeed as swimmers and as people. Our club combines fun and hard work in a team-building atmosphere.\u00a0 We do not focus on what place a swimmer may take; we focus on their individual times and reward improvement no matter how big or small. Our swimmers learn about commitment, good sportsmanship, and dedication; as these are tools not only necessary for swimming, but also for life.\u201d \u201cAll swimmers are welcome; swimmers wishing to compete as well as those who wish only to train. Our coaches believe in positive reinforcement with constructive and helpful critiques to motivate and improve their swimmers. Our coaches will not manage any swimmer\u2019s performance either in or out of the pool through humiliation, ridicule or coercive means.\u201d So I took him to the assessment night, which was packed, and we watched for almost an hour as other kids took their turns trying out.\u00a0 I was able to point out to him what he would need to do and reminded him to show the coaches all the stokes he knew.\u00a0 When it was his turn I pressed my palms together and willed him to do what they were asking.\u00a0 I watched him swim and was dismayed when he got out of the pool before showing them he could do the breast stroke and butterfly.\u00a0 He was so proud of himself for trying out and as we left the building I was able to get it out of him that he said \u201cno\u201d when they asked him if he could do the breast stroke and butterfly.\u00a0 I told him that because there were so many people there and lots of good swimmers, he may not make the team, but he could try out again next year, and that we were really proud of him for trying.\u00a0 Based on the amount of people there and the fact that he didn\u2019t show them all that he could do, I figured he wouldn\u2019t make the team. But he did! He got one of the ten open spots on the lower level group!\u00a0 I filled out the online registration and attended the parent meeting where I purchased the required attire and flippers. I wondered when and how I should tell them that he is autistic.\u00a0 I had to make sure he could still participate.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t a disability specific team and it wasn\u2019t a school team, it is a private swim club.\u00a0 I had been in knots about it for a week and the Roc was so excited to have made the team.\u00a0 I knew he would need a little extra direction and I hoped they would be willing to give that to him. *** When the head coach picked up I haltingly told her that the Roc made the team and he was so excited to swim, but he had some challenges.\u00a0 He loves the water, takes swimming lessons, and listens to his swim teacher, but he is autistic and gets distracted easily.\u00a0 He will need directions repeated to him and he gets overwhelmed sometimes\u2026I held my breath while I waited for her answer\u2026 \u201cOf course he is welcome!\u00a0 I\u2019m so glad you told us about him though, I\u2019ll make sure to tell his coach today and we will look out for him tonight.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry about him needing extra direction, lots of kids in his group will get distracted and need things repeated.\u00a0 He will not be the only one in his group who hasn\u2019t swam for a team.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had other kids with autism on the team and have had great success with them.\u00a0 Something about the water\u2026\u201d I tried really, really hard not to cry into the phone.\u00a0 I was so relieved to hear her say that he was welcome.\u00a0 I told her so and we talked for a few minutes.\u00a0 I waited until I hung up before laying my head on my desk and letting go.\u00a0 What a relief and a huge weight lifted off my chest.\u00a0 He made the team based on his skills in the water and they were willing to keep him even though he may need a little extra direction! That evening the Roc had his first practice.\u00a0 He was nervous and I was nervous for him.\u00a0 He was motivated to swim and he left the bleachers when his group was called though he was visibly uncomfortable.\u00a0 I watched the head coach find him and help him get to where he needed to go.\u00a0 I saw her point him out to his coach and then I tried really, really hard not to cry while I watched him get in the water and swim with his group.\u00a0 It was so loud, the pool was crowded with an older group from the team, and the school dive team was also practicing at the other end of the pool.\u00a0 The Roc wasn\u2019t always paying attention, but he followed along and did what the other kids in his lane were doing. (that\u2019s him in the far back, no swim cap) When we got in the car after practice he said, \u201cI really liked that!\u00a0 It was fun!\u201d *** A few weeks have passed and the Roc is still really enjoying being on the swim team.\u00a0 We remind him to pay attention and follow directions before each practice and he is trying really hard.\u00a0 He\u2019s a good little swimmer! (he\u2019s in the swim cap by the yellow noodle, smiling away with his hands above his head as he treads in the deep end!) This is just one more situation I never thought to hope for.\u00a0 I know I am repeating myself when I say that years ago I couldn\u2019t imagine what the Roc would be like at age nine, that I never imagined he would come so far.\u00a0 But it\u2019s true and it doesn\u2019t get old for me.\u00a0 That\u2019s the beauty of this life.\u00a0 I will always be grateful for these simple things, which are not simple at all.\u00a0 Because trying out for and making the swim team, being a part of the swim team, overcoming the noise level of the pool and the closeness of other kids in the same lane, trying new things \u2013 like diving!\u00a0 Well\u2026 It\u2019s pretty dang huge.

My heart lifted reading about Stephanie Nielson falling in love with her husband at a young age, and then ached to read of her journey back to herself after a plane crash which burned over 80 percent of her body in her book,  Heaven Is Here: An Incredible Story of Hope, Triumph, and Everyday Joy. \u00a0 Laughter bubbled up and then exploded as I read,  Let\u2019s Pretend This Never Happened  by Jenny Lawson.\u00a0 Both of these books I requested after reading Stephanie and Jenny\u2019s blogs.\u00a0 Somewhere online I saw the title for Claire Bidwell Smith\u2019s memoir,\u00a0  The Rules of Inheritance,  and it sat on my nightstand for two weeks while I attempted to read a novel.\u00a0 The urge to read about real life kept beckoning. * Tears slip down my cheeks and dry where they fell, leaving a tightness around my eyes and in my throat.\u00a0 The water cools and I add more hot, I am not ready to get out, to stop reading Bidwell Smith\u2019s words.\u00a0 Her loss is staggering and I feel cracked open reading her pain.\u00a0 This book is real, honest, and at some points so raw that I cannot see the words swimming in my tears.\u00a0 I will finish it less than 48 hours after starting it.\u00a0 Beautiful words to describe this book escape me, but I know this book will stay with me for a long time. * Now I find myself following links and spending time in front of my laptop again, no longer skimming my facebook feed, instead I am looking for more memoirs.\u00a0 More real life stories I can dive into.

{"date": "October 29, 2013", "body": "I don\u2019t know how to adequately describe this weekend.\u00a0 It was a blast, it was overstimulating, it was well organized, it was full of laughter, smiles, and lots and lots of gratitude.\u00a0 And it was all because the Roc\u2019s hockey coach and the  Denis Savard Foundation . We have encountered some very awesome and very generous people because of the Roc. The Roc\u2019s special hockey team got an opportunity to travel to Chicago, attend the morning skates of both the Wild and the Blackhawks at the United Center, participate in a game against a special hockey team from the Chicago area, and then attend the Wild vs. the Blackhawks on Saturday night!\u00a0 Our travel, lodging, meals, and tickets were paid for by the Denis Savard Foundation.\u00a0 An amazing opportunity! But first we had to get there!\u00a0 The Roc was excited to go and very happy to skip school on Friday.\u00a0 We met up with the team and boarded the bus. I was a bit worried about the ride as the Roc doesn\u2019t like crowds or loud noises and the bus was filled to capacity with the players, coaches/volunteers, and their families.\u00a0 I wrote to my friend  Stimey  about how to survive the bus ride and she gave me good advice.\u00a0 Bring the iPad.\u00a0 She also assured me that before her first trip she had been, \u201ckinda flipped out about it,\u201d but found that it was pretty mellow and fun.\u00a0 She was right.\u00a0 The Roc did well, there was a bit of complaining about the noise and amount of people, but he plopped on his noise canceling headphones and was much happier.\u00a0 I was happy that GC was also on the bus because we got to split our time and the second half of the trip I sat alone and read my kindle!\u00a0 They did fine without me. After our long ride, a pizza party, and an hour and a half in the pool, the Roc and GC got in a couple games of Uno before bed on Friday night. Saturday morning we had breakfast and then Denis Savard and John Carpenter (from the Denis Savard Foundation, who was instrumental in organizing our trip) came to the hotel to meet the kids on the Roc\u2019s team.\u00a0 Unlike many of the other kids, the Roc didn\u2019t want to take a picture with Denis, he just wanted to finish eating.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t bring my camera down to breakfast, but one of the dads took pictures of all the kids, so somewhere there is a picture of the Roc smiling a forced smile as he leans away from Denis Savard! We got back on the bus and headed down to the United Center to watch the morning skates. It was amazing to sit right at the glass and watch the players up close.\u00a0 The Roc was enthralled and there were many, many smiles as I looked around at the other kids on his team.\u00a0 Some of the Blackhawks threw pucks over to the kids and they were overjoyed and ran to get them signed by Denis Savard. The Roc was just as excited to see the zamboni as he was to see the players.\u00a0 I love that kid. We were able to see the whole morning skate for the Blackhawks and part of the Wild\u2019s morning skate.\u00a0 I was hoping to get a few clear picture of Zach Parise, who used to play for the NJ Devils, the team I started watching with GC when we lived out East.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always liked him, GC says it\u2019s because I think he\u2019s cute, but I maintain that my affection for Parise is because he is from Minnesota.\u00a0 I\u2019m sticking to my story. We left the Wild\u2019s morning skate to go to the Roc\u2019s game.\u00a0 He was nervous when he got there, telling us he didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t fully understand what to do when he\u2019s on the ice, but there were a few helpers who gave him some direction.\u00a0 I know he enjoyed skating. I loved seeing this on the score board. All the players had a great time. After the Roc\u2019s game we headed back to the hotel to eat and then we were back on the bus to go to the game.\u00a0 Originally I wasn\u2019t supposed to go to the game, but one of the volunteer coaches couldn\u2019t make it at the last minute so I got his ticket! We sat up high! So I got to test the zoom on my lens. It was a good game and the Wild won!\u00a0 Not long after the game started the Roc started to tell me he was tired.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t blame him, it had been a long day.\u00a0 He was very, very hard to wake up the next morning.\u00a0 But we had to be on the bus at 8 am to head back home. One of my favorite parts of the trip was getting to know more of the players and their families.\u00a0 I went to every practice and game last year, but I didn\u2019t talk to other families very much, and because GC helps the Roc with his equipment, I stay out of the locker room and don\u2019t get a chance to talk to the players.\u00a0 Three days of togetherness changed that for me.\u00a0 I got to talk with other parents and get to know some of the players.\u00a0 By the end of our weekend it really felt like a team to me and I know it helped the Roc feel part of the team. I am so thankful for all the different experiences we have had and all the wonderful people we have met. We are rich in a way that counts.

There is beauty, even now, when winter will not let go. * \u201cDo you see those bare patches under the pine tree?\u201d I asked him, wondering if he was picturing a brown bear hunkered down beneath the tree. \u201cThere is no snow under there.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u00a0 Why isn\u2019t there any snow under the tree?\u201d \u201cBecause it blocked it.\u201d \u201cWhat did?\u201d \u201cThe tree.\u201d \u201cYou are so smart Roc and you are right!\u00a0 The pine branches blocked the snow leaving it bare underneath.\u00a0 Now what do you think about these tree branches?\u201d I asked, pointing to the nearest tree. \u201cThey didn\u2019t block the snow.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t have leaves.\u201d \u201cWhat do you call that?\u201d \u201c\u2026Bare!\u201d \u201cRight again!\u201d Not long ago I explained bear vs. bare.\u00a0 I wondered if it stuck.\u00a0 It did.

I don\u2019t blame you.\u00a0 You just don\u2019t know what you are seeing.\u00a0 Based off your exaggerated eye roll, I\u2019m guessing you see a demanding child, a loud child, a child I should have control over.\u00a0 Maybe you think I\u2019m not a very good mother.\u00a0 Not as good as you, your children waiting, waiting, waiting so patiently for the tiny changing room door to open. Maybe you sighed so loudly to send me a message. You took too long.\u00a0 How selfish of you.\u00a0 Your kid is a brat.\u00a0 You are not a good mother.

It was a very hard adjustment for the Roc when we moved here.\u00a0 He would get upset when children he didn\u2019t know would come into the yard or ride their bikes up the driveway and want to talk to him.\u00a0 I watched, heart in my throat, as most children gave up and walked away.\u00a0 Not M, the boy who lives next door, he waited the Roc out.\u00a0 He kept trying.\u00a0 He would come over and join the Roc in the sand box, or coloring with chalk on the driveway.\u00a0 He would keep talking to him.\u00a0 He came over to play at our house a few times and last winter played in the snow with the Roc.\u00a0 It was another first for me.\u00a0 The Roc outside playing, me watching through the window.\u00a0 I stood at our upstairs window watching as M convinced the Roc to try a bigger hill, and then rode on the sled with the Roc because he was too scared to go by himself.\u00a0 Now a year later, they are still playing together, even though M is in middle school now, and has his own friends.\u00a0 He will still come over to see if the Roc wants to play.\u00a0 It has been so good for the Roc, in so many ways.\u00a0 The Roc wants to be included, he wants to have friends, he wants to have fun just like any other kid. Look at the smile on his face in those pictures. We both got really lucky. Our neighbors have turned into friends.\u00a0 It\u2019s so much more than I had hoped for.

Right now you want a black top hat for the snowman we will build when it snows.\u00a0 You ask me over and over when it is going to snow.\u00a0 You are hoping Santa brings you that hat and a remote control helicopter (the helicopter is an idea I\u2019m pretty sure you got from Daddy.\u00a0 Especially after he told me how cool the one at his work is.) Right now I cannot get enough of your enthusiasm.\u00a0 I adore the way you get excited to see the Christmas lights as the day gives way to night.\u00a0 An extra drive through the neighborhood is gleefully accepted.\u00a0 The gasps and, \u201clook at that!\u00a0 Wow!!!\u201d make me grin, my fingers flexing on the steering wheel.\u00a0 I drive extra slow just for you.\u00a0 Grandma got the biggest kick out of your excitement over the chicken dish she served you for dinner a couple weeks ago.\u00a0 You took one bite and exclaimed, \u201cTHIS IS DELICIOUS!\u00a0 THANK YOU!!\u201d\u00a0 Grandma and I have chatted about your enthusiasm a few times in the last couple weeks.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just me who notices and is impacted by your spirit.\u00a0 Your enthusiasm is making many people smile lately.\u00a0 I love that you express yourself so freely. Right now I am so proud of your politeness.\u00a0 When the van driver helped you with the seat belt you could not feel through your thick gloves you said, \u201cThank you\u201d so clearly and she said, \u201cYou are very welcome,\u201d smiling at your down turned face.\u00a0 These manners are yours now, for so long I prompted you to say thank you, to say please, now you just do. Right now, as always, the little things get to me.\u00a0 The progress I didn\u2019t even realize you had made.\u00a0 How hard it was to hold you up 2 years ago when we would wheelbarrow through our townhouse.\u00a0 Your muscles are so much stronger now.\u00a0 When did you get so tall? Right now I am remembering the way your eyes lit up wide, the blue flashing, a small smile on your lips as you read the word you just painstakingly sounded out.\u00a0 The word you said you couldn\u2019t figure out.\u00a0 Reading is hard work.\u00a0 You are working so hard. Right now I am loving that when I asked you if you wanted to visit the holiday shop at school to buy presents for me and your dad, you asked if you could buy one for your cousin too.\u00a0 Even though you ask me repeatedly lately if all the presents under the tree on Christmas will be yours, you are thinking about giving. Right now I am feeling extra grateful for all the people who have entered our lives because of you.\u00a0 Because of autism. Right now I am still struggling to talk to you about autism.\u00a0 I still worry that I haven\u2019t said enough or I haven\u2019t said things the \u201cright\u201d way.\u00a0 I have talked, but we haven\u2019t conversed about it yet.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know when that will happen.\u00a0 I hope I can give you the tools to be confident in who you are.\u00a0 You are perfectly you.

{"date": "December 12, 2012", "body": "I was just about to send this picture with the following caption to my autism mama friends on Monday night: \u201cBehind that wall of parents is a sea of 250 boys\u2026and the Roc.\u00a0 We are at basketball opening night, something we skipped last year because 250 boys\u2026But he\u2019s over there sitting with a kid from his class!\u00a0 HUGE!\u201d I was about to hit send when GC walked up and said, \u201cA group of kids is teasing the Roc.\u00a0 He\u2019s still sitting with T, but the kids behind him keep pushing him and touching him on the back.\u00a0 The Roc is jerking away and getting mad and they are laughing at him.\u201d A fire lit in my stomach and I clenched my fists.\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d \u201cNothing, I let it play out, I was going to step in but then T turned around more than once and I could read his lips, he was saying \u201cstop it\u201d to them. As I slipped my phone into my pocket the boys were splitting up by grade and I heard the head coach instruct the 2nd graders to another part of the gym.\u00a0 I started walking in that direction. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d GC asked me.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t confront the kids!\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t.\u00a0 I have to see the Roc.\u00a0 I just need to be able to see him,\u201d I told him.\u00a0 Truth is, I wanted to see if I recognized any of the kids around the Roc, and I wanted to see if the little shits were going to keep teasing him. I had just been at the top of the roller coaster.\u00a0 I was flying and so happy for the Roc.\u00a0 He had been paralyzed when we entered the gym.\u00a0 I had to remove his coat and sweatshirt for him, help him into his shoes, and steer him through the crowd.\u00a0 He stood with his arms wrapped around himself and could barely look up when T, a kid from his class, said hello to him.\u00a0 After a lot of prodding and a few waves from T, he had gone to sit with him and we watched, hoping he would be able to stay with T when they joined the other grades in the center of the gym.\u00a0 He was doing it.\u00a0 He was working hard to regulate, to manage his anxiety and sensory issues.\u00a0 He wanted to be there and he was.\u00a0 It was huge for him. And then the teasing started. My stomach burned as I searched the big group of 2nd graders for my Roc. \u201cDo you see him?\u201d GC asked me.\u00a0 He had followed me across the gym, probably wondering if I was going to make a scene. \u201cRight there, he\u2019s next to shoot, and T is right behind him.\u201d I watched as the Roc shot the ball, a clean swoop through the hoop.\u00a0 He turned and moved toward the back of the line, which was not so much a line as a big jumble of kids.\u00a0 I watched as T shot and then immediately found the Roc, showed him where to go, and then got in line behind him.\u00a0 In doing so, no one could touch the Roc\u2019s back.\u00a0 I wondered if he was consciously protecting the Roc.\u00a0 It seemed that he was. \u201cDo you see what\u2019s happening?\u201d I asked GC. \u201cI do.\u00a0 That is some kid out there\u2026Kim, there are always going to be assholes.\u00a0 There are always going to be kids who tease and who bully.\u00a0 Unfortunately, they usually have asshole parents.\u00a0 But there are good people out there, thoughtful people, and they are raising good kids.\u00a0 For a kid that young to say something, to stand up for the Roc, it shows his character.\u00a0 Focus on that kid.\u201d The kids shot a few more baskets and then they lined up to get their free bag tag and Gatorade.\u00a0 I stayed back and gathered our things while GC went over to the Roc who was waiting in line with T.\u00a0 I watched as he high five\u2019d the Roc and said a few words to T.\u00a0 The Roc was grinning and doing a happy hop as they walked over to me. \u201cI did it!\u00a0 I made it through the whole thing!\u00a0 I\u2019m so proud of myself!\u201d he crowed. I leaned down, \u201cYou did do it, and we are so very proud of you!\u201d He did it.\u00a0 He had a little help from T and that made all the difference.\u00a0 He did it. *** I went to bed that night wrestling with my emotions.\u00a0 It angered me to my core that the Roc was teased with all those parents standing by.\u00a0 I wondered about those boy\u2019s parents.\u00a0 Were they sitting on the sidelines staring into their phones?\u00a0 Did any of them see what happened?\u00a0 If they did, why didn\u2019t they intervene?\u00a0 It took so much for the Roc to be there!\u00a0 He was working so hard!\u00a0 What a difference it would make to him if more children were like T.\u00a0 Why aren\u2019t there more children like T? T.\u00a0 What a kid!\u00a0 I shifted my focus to T.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t do anything about the kids who picked on the Roc.\u00a0 But I could do something about T. In the morning I sent an email to the Roc\u2019s teachers.\u00a0 I wanted them to know what happened.\u00a0 That the Roc was bullied at a function outside of school and that a peer from his class had stood up for him.\u00a0 I asked if she would please reinforce T for standing up for the Roc.\u00a0 As soon as school was over she wrote back: Thanks for sharing Kim.\u00a0 How wonderful to know your son has such a good friend in T.\u00a0 T is a remarkable boy \u2013 great family, dad volunteers in our class Tuesday mornings but Roc doesn\u2019t see him as he is in Mrs. Ms room at that time. I think it would be quite impacting on my students for T to share what he observed (poking/pushing) and what it felt like to stand up to \u201cbullies\u201d and defend Roc.\u00a0 Also, may I communicate your thoughtful email to T\u2019s parents? I know they would be appreciative and proud of their son\u2019s actions. \u00a0Huge hooray for Roc in attending last night\u2019s event. What a crowd! I was running on the track above and was just amazed at the large number of adults and kids below! It was busy, busy!\u00a0 Good for Roc to try these new experiences J \u00a0Thanks again for taking the time to tell us about T\u2019s great character- I\u2019ll let T know his actions were noticed and appreciated by you. \n Her response was more than I had hoped for. There may always be kids who pick on the Roc.\u00a0 Hopefully, there will always be kids who will stand up for him too.

On Christmas Eve morning GC got to work in the kitchen. He had company. The Roc worked on a train cake while he waited for Grandma and Grandpa to come over. Around the house. GC spent the whole day in the kitchen. My mom brought over a little workbook for the Roc. Later she helped him write a note to Santa. \u201cDear Santa, I am a good boy most of the time.\u201d We let the Roc open a couple gifts from far away relatives.\u00a0 My little baker was very happy to get a cake pop maker! Santa came after everyone else was in bed! The Roc was very excited on Christmas morning to see all the presents under the tree. He was especially excited that Santa brought a few things off his list.\u00a0 A snowman kit, and a snowplow! GC and the dog watched. Later, my parents came back over for lasagna and we all had a lot of fun playing with the Roc\u2019s (GC\u2019s) new remote control helicopter.

{"date": "August 1, 2012", "body": "We left Colorado with two more people in the van than we arrived with. \u00a0My in-laws had flown from South Carolina to Colorado the week before we arrived, and then rode home with us to Minnesota. \u00a0We stopped in South Dakota to visit Mount Rushmore and spent the night at a nearby hotel. I tried to get the Roc to pose by this teepee, but he wasn\u2019t having any of it. He had to sit on every single bench we passed on the little trail though, and after many photos capturing his anger at my pointing the camera his direction, I got this shot. I just love that smile and those bright eyes. After dinner we headed down to the hotel pool and the Roc was surprised to find a water slide there. \u00a0He was\u00a0hesitant\u00a0and GC and I pushed him too hard to go down. \u00a0As soon as he got to the top and saw the rushing water, he could not bring himself to get on. \u00a0No matter how many times I explained that the water wass only spraying out at the top of the slide to get it going, his fear was too overwhelming, and he walked back down the stairs in tears. \u00a0I shouldn\u2019t have pushed. \u00a0I still feel bad as he was very stuck on the fact that he didn\u2019t go down the slide, and I know without a doubt that my pushing made him feel worse. \u00a0Sometimes I have a hard time controlling my emotions, and I definitely learned a lesson that night. We had a very long, very boring drive across South Dakota and back home the next day. \u00a0Very long. \u00a0Very boring. \u00a0Some screaming for the last hour\u2026or so. We spent one day at home unpacking, doing laundry, and then repacking for a short(er) road trip to the north shore. \u00a0We stopped at Split Rock and hiked up to a look out, then back down to let the Roc throw rocks. We all enjoyed the view from the balcony at our condo when we arrived. The Roc enjoyed the pool after dinner. Guinness enjoyed being there\u2026I don\u2019t know about the hug. Especially because he looked like this 2 seconds after the above photo. And then this. \u201cHelp me!\u201d his eyes seem to say. The next day we went to Cascade State Park to see the waterfalls. \u00a0Of course. Then we continued north to Grand Marais where we walked out to the light house and around the little town, then stopped to eat at The Angry Trout. \u00a0The weather was so warm we were able to eat out on the deck, which was wonderful because they allow dogs on the deck and we had Guinness with us. \u00a0He was perfectly behaved under the table, our waitress didn\u2019t even know he was there. We drove on to Grand Portage where we saw some wildlife, a really tall waterfall, and Canada (that\u2019s Canada across the river.) My in-laws really enjoyed seeing the North Shore and I\u2019m so glad we took them. \u00a0I have so many childhood memories of camping up north, I always like sharing that part my beautiful state. We were all so tired after our long trip from CO and then our northern MN trip, but we did make some time to go see my Mom\u2019s beautiful yard, and we convinced my father-in-law to make calzones for us, as well as pizza! It is hard being so far away from GC\u2019s family, seeing them during the school year is something we gave up when we moved from the East Coast to the middle of the country. \u00a0I\u2019m so glad we were able to overlap our trips and bring them to see our new home.

{"date": "February 1, 2013", "body": "I like to document the progress the Roc makes.\u00a0 It makes me happy to record the little leaps and the big.\u00a0 To tell the more of our story, I sometimes write down the harder stuff.\u00a0 Last Sunday night was one of those harder times.\u00a0 I revisited the angry phase of the grief cycle, a place I do not visit nearly as often as I used to. *** Winter is hard for the Roc.\u00a0 He needs activity and exercise, and it\u2019s hard to get what he needs stuck indoors, especially this winter with it\u2019s lack of snow and plummeting temperatures. The end of last week was hard.\u00a0 Lots of yelling.\u00a0 Lots of screaming.\u00a0 A few tantrums.\u00a0 Lots of battles over homework, and dinner, teeth brushing, and going to school, bedtime, and the dog.\u00a0 Did I mention lots of screaming?\u00a0 Lots of screaming.\u00a0 We had some bright moments, but they were mellowed somewhat by all the screaming. On Sunday night neither GC nor I wanted to be the parent.\u00a0 Neither one of us wanted to be \u201con.\u201d\u00a0 It was, or should have been the end of the Roc\u2019s day, as he had just been put to bed, complete with his extensive goodnight routine.\u00a0 But he was out on the landing overlooking our family room, screaming and fighting, fighting with us.\u00a0 We tried to remain calm, we told him to go to bed, we tried to reason with him, and then we told him to go to bed some more, with louder, angrier voices. \u201cI just feel like I have nothing to give anyone right now,\u201d I told GC as I stepped into the kitchen.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be  on  right now.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cDo you ever wish you could just hand this over to someone else for awhile?\u201d he asked me. \u201cYes,\u201d I answered immediately.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s this constant state that wears me out\u2026.and it isn\u2019t this way for so many people I know.\u00a0 I just wish for some ease.\u201d I started down that path. \u201cRight now other people, people we know, are having rational conversations with their children,\u201d I said over the Roc\u2019s guttural screaming coming from upstairs.\u00a0 \u201cThey are saying, \u2018Okay kids, time to go get ready for bed,\u2019 and their kids do that.\u00a0 They get ready for bed by themselves and then they GO TO BED.\u00a0 None of this awful screaming hysterical stuff.\u201d I slammed the refrigerator door shut. \u201cAnd they have no clue how lucky they are, how  hard  this is.\u00a0 I\u2019m so fucking tired.\u201d GC said as he stepped onto the pity path with me and matched my stride. Something big crashed upstairs and more angry screaming followed. \u201cI just feel so  angry  sometimes,\u201d I said as I sat down heavily on the couch.\u00a0 \u201cAngry that this is our life.\u00a0 That this is our family.\u00a0 That the dog is shaking in the corner and our child is out of control, screaming his brains out over\u2026what?\u00a0 This isn\u2019t what I dreamed about\u2026and it makes me angry.\u00a0 I don\u2019t often go to this place anymore, but sometimes it wells up and I cannot stop it\u2026and it burns.\u201d \u201cThis anger burns right here,\u201d I said pressing on my sternum.\u00a0 I sighed loudly, letting all the air whoosh out of my lungs, wincing at the screaming still going on upstairs. \u201cI get angry too,\u201d GC said as he looked up at the Roc, red-faced and angry, banging his toys.\u00a0 Suddenly he bellowed, \u201cJUST GO TO BED!\u201d at the Roc\u2026and the Roc screamed right back. \u201cYou know, we aren\u2019t helping anything right now,\u201d I said to GC. I knew what needed to be done.\u00a0 I knew what the Roc needed. I swallowed my anger and felt it dissolving as I climbed the stairs. \u201cMooooooommmmmmmmyyy!\u201d The Roc was in his room, throwing his stuffed animals.\u00a0 I motioned for him to get into bed. \u201cAre you mad at me Mommy?\u201d he asked me, his voice shrill. \u201cLet\u2019s talk Roc,\u201d I said as I sat down on his bed, taking in his red, tear stained face.\u00a0 He is a beautiful child.\u00a0 My heart hurt for him.\u00a0 To let your emotions get out of control is never a good feeling.\u00a0 I knew he didn\u2019t feel good, and he didn\u2019t mean the words he had said. I remind myself:\u00a0 If he could do better, he would. So we talked.\u00a0 Me quietly, him very loudly until he calmed down.\u00a0 We talked about our feelings, about what makes us angry, about choices, about all the things he does well, and all the ways I am proud of him.\u00a0 I told him I love him.\u00a0 I hugged him and told him I love him again.\u00a0 I kissed his cheeks and told him I love him. *** Five days later, while I remember my conversation with GC, my anger and grief at the surface, burning the words into my brain, I cannot remember the exact words the Roc and I shared.\u00a0 We talked for awhile.\u00a0 I remember snippets.\u00a0 I remember the anger and stress leaving his face and voice while we talked, to be replaced with tears and worry, until he finally relaxed and looked tired.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember what words we exchanged. Until the very end.\u00a0 We hugged and kissed, he told me he was ready to fall asleep, and we did our goodnight routine: \u201cGoodnight.\u201d \u201cGoodnight.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d \u201cGoodnight.\u201d \u201cGoodnight.\u201d \u201cGoodnight.\u201d \u201cGoodnight.\u201d As I stepped away from the door he said, \u201cMommy\u2026?\u201d \u201cYes baby, what is it?\u201d \u201cThank you for coming back.\u201d I steadied myself against the door frame. \u201cAlways Roc, I\u2019ll always come back.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/lack-of-ease/", "title": "Lack of Ease"},

{"date": "August 19, 2012", "body": "Last summer was full of big life changes for all of us. \u00a0It was exciting and hard. \u00a0I wanted this summer to be easier, less stressful, and more fun. \u00a0I worried about how the Roc and I would fare though, because 12 weeks is a long time to be together. \u00a0I kept us busy in June and made sure July was no different. There are so many stories from July. \u00a0Too many. So much progress, some heartache, a public meltdown like we haven\u2019t seen in over a year, parenting mistakes, short tempers, laughter, joy, an exploding imagination, talking, talking, talking, tears, frustration, screaming, a visit with my aunt, chances to talk with another adult while my boy played \u2013 really, and truly played with another child, a social skills group, a picnic with special needs hockey, new books, summer school at home that wasn\u2019t, and kindness of strangers who open their home and give their time. There will never be enough time for all of these stories. \u00a0I tried to write about them as they happened, my dashboard is full of half started posts, descriptions of our day(s) that fade to a blinking cursor. \u00a0I stressed at first, wanting to record it all\u2026and then I let it go. \u00a0I used my phone and my camera to record where we were and what we were doing. Here is our July in pictures. We visited a new lake, and different lake with a new friend. The Roc worked hard during swimming lessons. He even went under water to grab rings off the bottom of the pool! \u00a0(with a little help from his swim instructor.) We went on a couple picnics, toured a beautiful garden, and took the water obsessed Roc to the dam. The Roc had a blast at a splash pad near GC\u2019s work, and the one close to our house. I enjoyed many of these on our porch. We went to the zoo. My Aunt Donna came to town for a visit. \u00a0This lady is something truly special. \u00a0A one of a kind, they don\u2019t make em\u2019 like her anymore kind of person. The Roc got to meet a new family and they were kind enough to let him ride their pony. \u00a0He had a blast riding and then playing with their little boy A. I snapped one of my all time favorite pictures of the Roc after a trip to Target where he begged,  begged  me to get him this hat. We capped off July by introducing my parents to 5-guys, and autism awareness day at the Twins in the blazing sun. Only 2 weeks until school starts for the Roc! \u00a0I can hardly believe it!

{"date": "June 25, 2012", "body": "Monday  was a busy, busy day. \u00a0The Roc started a four day basketball skills camp. \u00a0I had emailed the coach to ask about how the camp was run and if he thought he would have enough help \u00a0in case the Roc was totally lost. \u00a0He emailed me back right away and told me to sign him up, that he had enough people, and that the Roc would have a good time. \u00a0Of course the Roc was nervous and told me so as we left early Monday morning. \u00a0I reminded him to pay attention and listen to the coaches when they talked so he didn\u2019t miss directions, and I was pleased to see him following along when the session started. \u00a0There were a few times I could see him staring off into space while the coach was giving directions to all forty kids, and then he looked like a deer in headlights when they all got up and starting running. \u00a0Much to the Roc\u2019s relief, they didn\u2019t play an actual game, it was all dribbling, passing, and shooting. \u00a0They did play dribble tag, and unlike winter basketball, the Roc understood that when the ball was knocked out of his hand, he had to go sit down. (Roc is in the back, blue shirt) After basketball the Roc completed a few worksheets and then it was time to go to swimming and later that afternoon he had his friendship group. \u00a0Monday was probably the Roc\u2019s most scheduled day of the entire summer! Tuesday  was the second day of basketball skills camp. \u00a0As we walked up the sidewalk into the school the Roc said, \u201cI\u2019m not nervous today! \u00a0I know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \u00a0Awesome dude. \u00a0We didn\u2019t have an awesome morning after basketball though, which prompted me to write, \u201cThe screaming! \u00a0The screaming! \u00a0Can autism take a vacation please?\u201d as my facebook status. \u00a0\u00a0A few hours later I updated my status with, \u201cRoc just completed his first Jillian Michaels video. He complained a little, \u201cmy belly button is hurting!\u201d and \u201cbones are sore!\u201d but when I told him to take a break he said, \u201cI have to do what she says!\u201d \u00a0Maybe she can come over next time he\u2019s screaming his head off and tell him to use his inside voice.\u201d That\u2019s just the kind of day Tuesday was. It was loud. I did get a little break when my mom came over after dinner to watch the Roc while GC and I went out shopping to pick up a few camping items we need for our upcoming trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA.) \u00a0We came home to hear her reading the Roc bedtime stories. \u00a0He loves his grandma and he can always get her to read a big stack of books to him. After basketball on  Wednesday  morning the Roc was willing to work for his stickers. \u00a0He understood that he hadn\u2019t earned any the day before and he was motivated to fill up his chart. \u00a0My mom came to see the Roc\u2019s swimming lesson and then we went out to lunch afterwards. \u00a0The Roc and I played pretend party and then baked some really tasty cookies, of which I totally meant to take a picture of\u2026.but they were gone within a few days. Thursday  was the last day of basketball skills camp and the last day of the Roc\u2019s 2 week swim camp. \u00a0The Roc learned that he could move up another level in swimming, so even though I had only planned on one swim camp, I signed him up for another 2-week camp in July. \u00a0He loves it and I love that he has an activity he loves. \u00a0When we got home from swim camp my mom came over and after picking up my sister and her kids, we all went strawberry picking. GC left for a fun/work trip to the East Coast on  Friday  morning, but not before going down to the park with the Roc to play basketball. \u00a0He relayed to me later that the Roc told him he didn\u2019t want him to go to Delaware, that he would miss him. \u00a0He said it felt good that the Roc would miss him. \u00a0He remembered how it felt when the Roc only wanted me and no one else. \u00a0After dropping GC off at the airport the Roc and I had the whole weekend stretching out before us. \u00a0He wanted to watch a movie we we got home, so I took the opportunity to make some freezer jam with the strawberries we had picked on Thursday. Then the Roc got busy building a  \u201cHalloween carnival\u201d  for us to play with and Guinness spent some time contemplating life. He also wondered what the heck the Roc was doing upstairs. \u201cHave you gone crazy yet?\u201d my mom asked me on  Saturday  morning. \u00a0\u201cPretty soon,\u201d I replied. \u00a0\u201cWell come over if you want to get out of the house,\u201d she told me. \u00a0We went over a couple hours later and my Mom and I took the Roc back to the dam. \n We had dinner at my parents and hung out on their porch well past the Roc\u2019s usual bedtime. The Roc slept and slept on  Sunday  morning. \u00a0I wanted to wake him, but with GC gone and me being on full-time duty, it was nice to have some quiet time in the house. \u00a0We hung around the house that\u00a0morning. \u00a0 The dog rested, and I wrote  this  while the Roc made a Christmas carnival for us to play with. \u00a0The afternoon slowly went downhill and I ran out of steam. \u00a0Out of steam to play, to build bridges, to cook, to clean, to do bedtime, to read stories, to fight about brushing teeth and being nice to the dog, to deal with the Roc\u2019s easy frustrations and super loud voice. \u00a0Oh the screaming! \u00a0Out of steam to do it all alone. \u00a0June has been a busy month for GC, having a friend at our house for 10 days and now he is gone on a fun/work trip. \u00a0I\u2019ve been on full time Roc duty and it\u2019s taking it\u2019s toll on my mental state. \u00a0I lost my patience and lost my cool. \u00a0He screamed and I screamed. \u00a0We managed to have a calm bedtime routine and then I stayed up too late, desperate to be alone, but feeling lonely at the same time, thinking over the ways I could have done the day differently. \u00a0Knowing at the same time that I cannot be \u201con\u201d for this long without cracking. I closed my eyes, let the day go, and woke up with a smiling Roc next to my bed. A new week is starting, GC will be back in town this week, and I will get a \u201cbreak\u201d from being responsible for everyone and everything. Onto week 3!

{"date": "August 20, 2012", "body": "The Roc loves parties. He loves to go to them, to make up pretend parties for his little people and stuffed animals at home, and lately everything we do is a party. \u00a0In the last week we\u2019ve had a few pasta parties, a pool party, a hiking party, a waterfall party, a slumber party, a calzone party, and a family dinner party. Last year we had a small party here at our house for the Roc\u2019s birthday. \u00a0I invited one of my high school girlfriends to bring her family and my sister came with her family. \u00a0It was the first party the Roc had where children he wasn\u2019t related to were invited. He loved it. This spring he went to a party at Pump It Up and soon after started asking when he could have a Pump It Up party of his own. Because we were leaving on a road trip to Colorado on his actual birthday we decided having a Pump It Up party a couple days before we left would be a perfect alternative to having people over to our house. My pen hung over the paper when I sat down to make a list of the Roc\u2019s friends to invite to the party. \u00a0He does not have friendships the way other children his age do. \u00a0He has his cousins, and I am lucky enough to have some great friends who have equally great kids. \u00a0Who would we invite? \u00a0I asked the Roc this question and he said his cousins. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t give me any other names. \u00a0I wrote to a few of my friends about this, the ache of sitting there, pen poised and ready. \u00a0Then I realized that the Roc was slowly making connections. \u00a0He really enjoyed one of the boys in his summer social skills group, and he had a great time with a little girl from swimming lessons, (whose mother is really awesome) and he does have a friend from school. \u00a0I sent out the invites and waited, and everyone responded yes! \u00a0The Roc could hardly contain himself on the day of his party. \u00a0Waiting until the evening was torture for him. I decided not to say anything about the Roc\u2019s autism diagnosis unless it became necessary. \u00a0He was so excited for the party and because he had been there a few months ago, he knew what to expect and we had talked at length about the order of the evening. \u00a0I figured the couple high school aged kids who were in the party rooms with us wouldn\u2019t really have a connection to autism and what that meant for the Roc. I was worried that I made a mistake when the Roc was called up and everyone was told to yell \u201cHAPPY BIRTHDAY!\u201d at him. \u00a0He stood frozen and I could tell he was shocked and not pleased. \u00a0I held my breath and willed him to hold himself together. His unease was put aside when they were led into the first room. \u00a0He jumped, and slid, and played air hockey. \u00a0He was happy, and sweaty, and on the go the whole time. Soon enough it was time to go into the party room for pizza, cupcakes, and presents. The Roc was equal parts excited and anxious to sit on the big chair and open presents. \n The party was a total success. \u00a0I loved watching the Roc\u2019s face light up with happiness. \u00a0He enjoyed everything about the party and that in itself was priceless. I also got to have a no accidents moment when I spoke with the young lady in the above picture. \u00a0I finally did mention the Roc being on the autism spectrum when I needed to make sure things would go as the Roc expected in the party room \u2013 first pizza, then cake, then presents. \u00a0She told me she had momentarily wondered about the Roc as she has an older brother on the spectrum. \u00a0We talked a bit about how her brother was when he was younger, similar, yet very different from the Roc. \u00a0We talked about what he is doing now, entering his sophomore year at college after attending a year of a transition program and community college. \u00a0He will be majoring in music. \u00a0I pressed my tongue against the roof of my mouth and held back my tears. She was wonderful with the Roc and she gave me an unexpected gift that evening. Hope.

{"date": "August 30, 2012", "body": "We\u2019ve been very busy this August, and hardly home. \u00a0We had the Roc\u2019s party on the first day of August. \u00a0Two days later we were in the van traveling south and west, Colorado bound. \u00a0The Roc was all smiles, as he always is at the beginning of a trip. \u00a0The boy loves to travel. \u00a0The built in DVD player and wireless headphones are a sanity saver, as are the ear plugs GC and I wore the last forty-five minutes of our 7 hour drive. It was HOT in Nebraska when we stopped to eat, swim, and sleep. The day after we arrived in CO we went to another birthday party for the Roc at his great-aunt and uncles house. The morning of the party GC and his brother were headed out to the grocery store. \u00a0I whispered for him to go to Toys R Us and get the Roc some sort of pirate ship. \u00a0They bought the first one they saw, grabbing it off an end cap, and it turned out to be his favorite toy. \u00a0He played with it for the rest of the day, pushing it around the floor, shooting the cannons. \u00a0It was amazing, he was  really \u00a0playing and entertaining himself! \u00a0Aunt Sandy asked if she could clean up the wrapping paper, remembering when we had a little birthday party for him three years ago and he had to rip all the paper into teeny, tiny pieces. \u00a0He was more interested in playing with his new pirate ship this year, we cleaned up the paper and he didn\u2019t flinch. \u00a0How far we have come. I went with my mother-in-law, Patty, and Aunt Sandy to the celestial seasonings facility. \u00a0We enjoyed some tea, took the tour, and spent some quality time in the gift shop. \u00a0Afterwards we found a nice little restaurant, had lunch, and a couple margarita\u2019s outside. \u00a0It was so nice to get away and have an all girls afternoon. We went to Estes park one day and did the same very long hike we did back in 2009, only this time the Roc came along. \u00a0I\u2019ll admit that I was worried he wouldn\u2019t be able to complete the hike without melting down. \u00a0GC assured me the Roc could do it. \u00a0We made sure someone was watching out for him at all times, I had visions of him tumbling down the mountain. When we were back, I checked the map near the parking lot and realized we hiked nine miles. \u00a0The Roc hiked NINE miles! Nine miles in the mountains! We saw some wildlife on the side of the road and stopped so I could jump out and take a picture. GC and I took the Roc to Breckenridge the next day, stopping at Loveland Pass on the way. We ate at the same Mexican restaurant we ate at in 2009. It was still good. \u00a0Just looking at this picture makes me hungry. \u00a0The Roc ate his meal and then helped me finish mine! \u00a0Yum! The Roc was excited to ride the gondola. \u00a0He begged to get back on as soon as we got off. \u00a0He quickly moved on when we mentioned finding some ice cream! We also visited the Denver aquarium one afternoon. \u00a0The Roc really enjoyed it. \u00a0My mother-in-law reminded me of our experience at the aquarium in Myrtle Beach a few years ago. \u00a0How the three of us had to surround the Roc, he didn\u2019t want any strangers near him. \u00a0I had to carry him through part of it, and he wasn\u2019t as engaged as he is now. It was another moment of realizing how far we\u2019ve come. \u00a0It is hard to be so far away from GC\u2019s family, but it gives us perspective we wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. \u00a0Living this life day to day, wrapped up in what we need to do for the Roc, it\u2019s easy to forget what the Roc struggled with a few years ago. One of my favorite moments came when the Roc saw this big tiger. \u00a0He put his hand up to his mouth and gasped. \u00a0 It was adorable. During this trip we spent a lot of family time together. \u00a0It was wonderful to have this time and the Roc loved all the family dinners. The trip went fast, and before we knew it, we were packing the van and getting ready to head to Mount Rushmoore!

{"date": "May 16, 2012", "body": "\u201cI need to run right now,\u201d I said to GC as I passed through the kitchen. \u00a0Not, \u201cDo you mind if I go for a run now?\u201d or \u201cIs it okay with you if I run now?\u201d \u00a0But, \u201cI  need  to run, right  now .\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d he replied. I am already gasping for air as my feet cross the road and hit the trail, my stride jarring my body on the downhill. \u00a0Music in my ears. \u00a0My breath caught in my throat, tears burning behind my sunglasses. \u00a0 Do not cry . \u00a0I will myself as the tears spilled out. Shit . My feet stop and I bend over at the waist, my\u00a0forearms\u00a0pressing into my hip bones. \u00a0I try in vain to contain the sob roaring up my windpipe. \u00a0My grief and anger swirl inside my chest, my ribs cannot contain the enormity. \u00a0I squeeze my eyes shut and wonder if there is anyone out on their deck to my right. \u00a0I must look like I am going to vomit bent over this way. \u00a0I want to vomit. \u00a0I want to purge myself of the grief, hurl my shame as far as possible, crush my anger to dust beneath my shoe. \u00a0The sob escapes, then another. \u201cHow dare you cry!\u201d a voice screams in my head. \u00a0\u201cWhat the f@!& do you have to complain about? \u00a0Stop crying!\u201d she hisses. \u201cMove your feet,\u201d I tell myself, ignoring my own worst enemy. I set my eyes on the tree line ahead, then the curve, then the hill, then the pond. \u00a0The tears stream from my eyes as I settle into my stride. \u00a0The ache fills my upper body, right beneath my ribs, the sobs are pulsing to escape. \u00a0I close my throat to contain them and let the tears flow, the only escape. \u00a0The grief feels too big. \u00a0I cannot hear the music slipping from my ear buds. \u00a0There is a\u00a0freight\u00a0train in my head. Why is it so hard for him? \u00a0Why doesn\u2019t he connect the dots? \u00a0He misses all the social ques. \u00a0The face expressing annoyance, the change in the tone of voice, the\u00a0blatant\u00a0requests for him to stop what he is doing. \u00a0He laughs when he should listen. \u00a0He laughs when they request he stop following so close, or stop repeating that phrase, stop ruining the game. \u00a0He laughs when he shouldn\u2019t. \u00a0I try to intervene, using words that do not sink in. \u00a0It never ends well. \u00a0They do not care when he leaves, escaping written all over their faces\u2026but only I see it. \u00a0He just laughs. \u00a0My mind replays the events, the missed cues, the missteps, the looks, everything, and I hurt all over. I keep going. \u00a0My insides hurt. \u00a0The tears slow. \u00a0I pull apart the afternoon in my mind. \u00a0My thoughts tumble all over themselves. \u00a0I worry for the future. \u00a0When he finally learns these skills, because I will never give up, will it be too late? \u00a0Will these children give him a chance? \u00a0Or will they be soured on a friendship with him? \u00a0Always remembering the way he was, the way I\u2019m sure he still will be to some extent. \u00a0He is not an easy friend to have at almost eight. \u00a0What will happen next year? \u00a0What will happen in middle school? \u00a0What will happen in adulthood? \u00a0Will he make real peer connections? \u00a0When? \u00a0What can I do to help? \u00a0This is too big for me. \u00a0Too big. \u00a0I am not enough. Then the anger comes. \u00a0The tears are gone. \u00a0My pace quickens. \u00a0The muscles in my back flex. \u00a0I feel the anger rolling through the muscles in my legs. \u00a0My feet slap the pavement. \u00a0The drums beat in my throat and the guitars scream in my ears. \u00a0The music matches my insides. \u00a0I cannot contain the anger. Why? Why me? Why him? I am so angry. \u00a0I let myself feel it. \u00a0I use it to push me on. \u00a0My legs scream at me up the hill. \u00a0The physical pain a way to release the pain in my heart. \u00a0The sweat slides down my spine. \u00a0I am so angry. \u00a0Angry at the misunderstandings. \u00a0Angry that so much is difficult for him. \u00a0Angry that I am angry. \u00a0Angry at the jealously I often feel. \u00a0Angry at the shame I feel about the jealously. \u00a0Angry at the pain. \u00a0Angry at the tears. \u00a0Angry at what is. \u00a0Angry at what isn\u2019t. \u00a0Angry. \u00a0The anger rolls off my body. \u201cWHY!?\u201d the voice screams. \u00a0\u201cNo  FAIR !\u201d she hisses. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not fair. No one\u00a0guaranteed me or him fair. I keep going. \u00a0The roar in my head slowly subsides, the ache in my chest\u00a0diffuses, my lungs are free to breath again. \u00a0My pace is even, my breath is calm, my fingers tap the drum beat, and I mouth the lyrics not caring who sees me. \u00a0I think over the miles I just ran. \u00a0The thoughts I pulled apart thread by thread. \u00a0The grief I cycled through over five miles of trail, road, and sidewalk. \u00a0Just as the pain poured out in tears, the anger slides down my body in beads of sweat. I am drenched in my emotions. I watch my feet as I walk up the driveway, I have no energy to chit-chat with my neighbors. \u00a0I sit in the shade of my garage to stretch my legs, watching the sun through the leaves, listening to the neighbor children laughing as they ride their rip sticks and bounce a basketball. \u00a0The grief and anger have subsided. I am spent and I am ready. I go inside and smile at the Roc. I will never give up. ed note: \u00a0This was 2 Thursdays ago and every time I\u2019ve run since then this post goes through my head. \u00a0I needed to get it out. \u00a0And in true Roc fashion, with tons and tons of reminders, many conversations about friendship, I saw a teeny, tiny step in the right direction yesterday. \u00a0He will get there. \u00a0I will never give up.

{"date": "April 23, 2012", "body": "It started with a phone message that made me stand still. \u201cHi there, this is Ms. G. \u00a0I just wanted to let you know that the Roc volunteered for both a speaking and a singing part in the upcoming 1st grade concert. \u00a0I was pretty surprised when Mrs. C confirmed it. \u00a0We agreed that focusing on the speaking part would be where we would start. \u00a0The singing might be too much for him, but we\u2019ll see. \u00a0I just wanted to let you know because his line should be coming home today or tomorrow if it hasn\u2019t already. \u00a0We\u2019ll be doing lots of prepping leading up to the concert.\u201d I stood with both hands on my desk, staring at the machine as the message played out and the play button stopped blinking red. \u00a0Then I played it again. I asked the Roc about it later and couldn\u2019t get much info out of him, which didn\u2019t surprise me. \u00a0I wondered if he understood that he was volunteering to speak at the concert\u2013not just that day in music class. \u00a0GC stared at me when I told him later, disbelief written on his face. \u201cDid he understand what he was trying out for?\u201d he asked me. \u00a0I shrugged my shoulders. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know. I started asking the Roc what his \u201cline\u201d was, and over the next few days he started to remember and tell me a close approximation to what was printed on the narrators page. \u201cWe won\u2019t even need to get a passport.\u201d Ms. G wrote a social story, \u201cWhat To Do When: \u00a0I Am At The Music Concert\u201d complete with pictures of the Roc\u2019s head photoshopped into the story. \u00a0We read it numerous time, and then again right before we piled into the van to go to the auditorium. \u201cI\u2019m nervous to say my line at the concert,\u201d the Roc repeated over and over as we drove. \u00a0He gripped my hand as we walked into the building and I felt his anxiety creep up my arm. \u00a0When all the kids started to go up behind the curtain onstage I motioned for the Roc to follow them. \u00a0He froze and I walked with him, encouraging him to give me a high-five before climbing the stairs. \u00a0When I got back to GC he told me that the Roc turned around just before slipping behind the curtain and made a face at me as I walked away, his anxiety bubbling out and boiling over. \u00a0I sat back and tried to settle my stomach. Then the curtains opened and the concert started. \u00a0I could see the Roc\u2019s nervousness in his stiffness and the way he would pull his lips right over his teeth. \u00a0During the very first song he moved down to the front of the stage with three of his classmates and my breath caught in my throat. He went down there! \u00a0Would he remember his line? \u00a0Would he say it out loud? \u00a0Into the microphone? \u00a0I froze in my seat, waiting, hoping to would hear his voice, holding my breath as I watched. Then he did it! \u00a0His classmate handed him the microphone and the Roc said his line. \u00a0He went to put the microphone back on the floor but remembered he had to hand it to the boy next to him! \u00a0Then he walked back to his spot on the top of the risers. He did it!!! \u00a0I was so proud of him. \u00a0He\u00a0conquered\u00a0his anxiety and said his line! \u00a0I watched him during the rest of the concert, smiling as he watched one of his classmates, copying their every move. \u00a0He did the hand motions, waved his little American flag, and barely moved his lips. \u00a0When it was over GC looked at me and said, \u201cI felt a little tear in my eye when he said his line. \u00a0I\u2019m so proud of him!\u201d He was one of the last kids off the stage and as I made my way to him I saw he was talking to Ms. G. \u201cYou did a great job Roc!\u201d she told him. \u201cYes! \u00a0You really did!\u201d I chimed in. \u201cI said my line Mommy!\u201d he boasted. \u00a0The pride on his face evident. He did, he said his line, and he did so much more than that. \u00a0He is participating in life. \u00a0He is trying new things. \u00a0He is pushing through his anxiety, his nerves, his fears. \u00a0I am so proud of him. \u00a0More importantly, he is proud of himself. \u00a0As he should be.

He did therapeutic horseback riding in Delaware and really liked it. \u00a0Every place I checked into around here was much more expensive than what we paid out of pocket in Delaware, so much more that we couldn\u2019t pay out of pocket, and so I shelved the idea for a long time. \u00a0Recently the Roc received a grant we could use to pay for the sessions, and the place I was interested in had an opening. \u00a0The owner is a wonderful occupational therapist who told me this weekend that when she screens people who want to work for her, they must believe it is a privilege to work with these kids. \u00a0If they don\u2019t, if they view it as just a job, she doesn\u2019t want them. \u00a0I got a little teary eyed as she spoke with such passion about the changes she has seen in the children she has worked with. \u00a0She is so upbeat, yet has a very calming quality, and the Roc tries really hard for her. \u00a0She has gotten the Roc to do things on the horse that he has never done before \u2013 he got up on his hands and knees on the back of the horse this weekend and he also trotted! \u00a0She pushes him and it\u2019s so good for him. \u00a0The Roc has an OT evaluation with her in two weeks and we hope to add some individual OT with her at the hospital to his after school schedule. 3) \u00a0I went to Key West with Christa for 5 nights! \u00a0A mommy get-a-way we will never forget!

{"date": "October 9, 2012", "body": "I can hardly even type it, it sounds so decadent, so frivolous, so over the top. \u00a0I had a hard time saying it out loud before I left. \u201cI\u2019m going to Key West with my best friend Christa for 5 nights and 6 days\u2026\u201d Who does that? We did. It was wonderful. Last year started our tradition, one we plan to keep, of getting together somewhere each fall. \u00a0In January we decided Key West would be our destination for 2012. When we met up at the Atlanta airport it felt like I had just seen Christa yesterday, we picked up right where our phone calls and emails left off, and talked during the whole flight down to Key West. There is so much I could say about this trip, but it boils down three things for us: the places, the conversation, and the food. Christa and I always laughed after our conversations with the locals. \u00a0They would first ask us if it was our first time to Key West, yes for me, no for Christa. \u00a0Then they would go on and tell us all the bars we should visit. \u00a0Sometimes we told them our truth: we came to see stuff, talk until we ran out of breath, and eat really good food\u2026loud bars hold no interest for us. 1) The places We went to the butterfly and nature conservatory. We sat for the longest time in a little gazebo watching the butterflies. \u00a0I tried and tried to get a picture of these huge blue butterflies but they never stopped moving! One of my favorite places was the Hemingway house. Christa, a writer, enjoyed seeing where Hemingway wrote many of his great works and thought she would definitely be able to produce a lot in this little writing space! I enjoyed the six-toed cats! We went up into the light house. We took a walk one morning so I could take some pictures of the ocean, and my legs to prove I was there. We walked through the Key West garden club. We went to Fort Zachary Taylor State Park and parked ourselves on a couple lounge chairs for a few hours. We walked and walked on this trip. \u00a0On our last full day we walked by the Little White House. and then down this beautiful quiet street where all the really rich people have houses! 2) The conversation Christa and I spent a lot of time here, laughing, talking, tearing up, giggling, snorting, hooting, and talking some more in our little cottage. \u00a0Some days we were lazy, staying in our room talking until lunch time. \u00a0There were so many times I told myself to remember something Christa said, I even jokingly told her to repeat herself so I could write it down. \u00a0I\u2019ve written and deleted about ten different sentences trying to describe what went down in this little cottage, how the words we spoke filled me up and fuel me now, weeks later, but I just haven\u2019t been able to do it justice. I\u2019ll just say nourishing, which leads well into the next section\u2026 3) The FOOD! Everyday we ATE. \u00a0Oh my, the food. \u00a0And the drinks. \u00a0I was especially excited the first night. Who wouldn\u2019t be excited to eat this: We went to a wonderful Cuban restaurant one night. Every morning while I slept in Christa popped over to Anna\u2019s Cuban Cafe to grab some coffee and a little breakfast. \u00a0Our cottage was right behind Anna\u2019s and we ate lunch there a few times. We went to a fabulous tapas restaurant one night and also after reading many positive reviews we tried Garbos Grill. \u00a0A little roadside stand. Delicious food. There wasn\u2019t a lot of seating, but there were chickens! We had breakfast at the six-toed cat one morning. It was the best french toast I\u2019ve ever eaten! On our final morning we took a peak at the sunrise, and then grabbed breakfast (I should have photographed Christa\u2019s breakfasts on more than one occasion because while I go for the sweets, she is a bit more well rounded in her food choices) We saw, we talked, and we ate very, very well on our adventure to Key West!

{"date": "October 7, 2012", "body": "I know. \u00a0It\u2019s October. \u00a0I know. I started this post weeks ago and almost finished it and hit \u201cpublish.\u201d \u00a0Then school started and my focus has been everywhere but on what we did this summer. \u00a0But I want to document this trip, and this post was almost done anyway. \u00a0So here goes. After our big road trip to CO and then our shorter road trip up north with my in-laws, the Roc and I were back in the car at the end of August, this time with my Mom. \u00a0We went to visit my Grandma in Indiana. \u00a0The last time I saw her the Roc was just shy of two-years old, about six years ago. The Roc and I had flown into town to attend a party celebrating her eighty fifth birthday. \u00a0I struggled with the Roc at her party, he didn\u2019t want to come inside, he pushed a little plastic lawn mower around the yard instead, he squirmed and whined when I tried to show him off to my Grandmother\u2019s friends. \u00a0I remember feeling mystified and sad, having calmed the Roc down in a back room of my Aunt and Uncle\u2019s house, a few relatives walking by, urging us to come sing to Grandma. \u00a0I knew in my gut that I couldn\u2019t take him into that crowded room, but I didn\u2019t know why. \u00a0With tears in my eyes and an out of sorts Roc on my hip, I told my Mom I needed to go next door, back to the quiet of my Grandma\u2019s house. \u00a0As soon as we got back to the empty house the Roc was fine and I felt both relieved and alone. \u00a0I do have pictures of the Roc having fun on that trip, but I also remember feeling the push and pull of what I thought I should be doing, against what I instinctively knew wasn\u2019t going to work for the Roc, and how I wondered what I was doing wrong. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know about autism then. The Roc has changed tremendously in the last six years, and so have I. \u00a0But one thing I\u2019m grateful hasn\u2019t changed is his willingness to travel. \u00a0I knew this trip to Indiana would be vastly different from the trip we took six years ago. The Roc did really well on our ride down to Indiana. \u00a0We stopped in Illinois for the night, and after having dinner nearby, the Roc got to swim and swim and swim. \u00a0The pool was empty except for us for over an hour, and the Roc loved having the pool to himself. \u00a0When a man and a few boys entered the pool I felt that familiar dread creep up. \u00a0A few years ago their entry would have caused the Roc distress and we would have left. \u00a0The extra boys were rambunctious, jumping and splashing. \u00a0The Roc watched and laughed, imitated a few moves, and kept jumping in from the side yelling for me to watch him. \u00a0I moved to the hot tub and struck up a conversation with the dad, asking if all the boys were his. \u00a0Quickly into our conversation he mentioned that his youngest son had autism. \u00a0My eyes got wide as I pointed to the Roc, \u201cmy son too,\u201d I told him. \u00a0Quickly, our conversation went below surface details into the real grit of life. \u00a0We spent a long time talking about our boys, life, schools, family, and how we view the world through a different lens because of autism. \u00a0When we saw them at the hotel breakfast next morning the dad gave me his card and told me to keep in touch, that we can never have too many people who \u201cget it\u201d in our lives. We drove on to Indiana and it was wonderful to see my Grandmother. \u00a0We were only in Indiana for a couple days, but we kept the Roc busy. \u00a0We drove over to see my Aunt Donna and Uncle Dave in Ohio for a few hours one afternoon, giving my Grandma some quiet time\u2026 \u00a0Have I mentioned the Roc is kinda loud? \u00a0The Roc remembered my Aunt Donna from her trip to visit my parents in July and he gave her a huge smile. He grinned even wider when she made him a huge ice cream\u00a0sundae\u00a0after lunch (at Skyline!) We also visited with my aunt and uncle, who live next door to my Grandma in Indiana, and the Roc had fun jumping on their trampoline, swinging, and trying out the tire swing. I enjoyed watching the dog Zora follow my 91 year old Grandmother around and totally obey her orders. As well as the sunsets from the front porch. While we were in Indiana we attended a ceremony for one of my cousins who became an eagle scout. \u00a0The Roc was excited to go to a \u201cparty\u201d and kept asking if there would be cake, a question he knew the answer to as we had picked up the cake the night before! \u00a0When we got to the hall, the Roc was nervous and after being introduced to a few people I asked if he wanted to walk down Main Street to see all the big painted chickens in town while we waited for the ceremony to start. \u00a0He did, and I now have a nice collection of pictures of the Roc standing by ten different chickens. I figured the Roc might not make it through the whole ceremony, and I was prepared to take him out and do a bit more walking around town, but he sat quiet and still the whole 30 minutes. \u00a0He amazed me, clapping when everyone else clapped, watching and listening to each speaker, only covering his ears during a prolonged period of clapping for every single eagle scout in the room. \u00a0We did go outside to walk around when the ceremony was over and everyone got up and started chatting. \u00a0Too much movement, too loud, and too many people the Roc didn\u2019t know made him so anxious he started digging his chin into my hand and arm. \u00a0We came back just in time to get some food from the buffet and for the Roc to have some cake. \u00a0My mom commented that she was impressed that the Roc said hello and shook hands with the few adults we did introduce him to. \u00a0He really worked hard and earned not only the cake, but the cookies and brownie my mom grabbed for him. \u00a0He ate a LOT of food on this trip\u2026 The night before we left for our long drive back home we took a four generations picture. \u00a0My Grandma, mom, me and the Roc. The Roc did well on our drove back the first day, mostly because we were holding the big ticket over his head\u2026the swimming pool at the hotel. \u00a0When we got to our hotel my mom was offered an upgraded room and man was the Roc excited to find that it meant our hotel room had 2 rooms! \u00a0One with the beds, a dresser and TV and another room with a couch, TV, desk, fridge and microwave. \u00a0He did his version of a happy dance, and ran back and forth between the two rooms shouting, \u201cThis is amazing! \u00a0I love this place!\u201d After dinner at a wonderful Irish pub we hit the pool. \u00a0The Roc was in heaven, again with the whole pool to himself. Eventually another family with a boy a few years older than the Roc entered the pool and I could tell the Roc wanted to interact with him, but he didn\u2019t know how to start or what to do. \u00a0When the boy said hello, the Roc ignored him and told me instead, \u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d \u00a0After a lot of coaxing, the Roc said hello, and after a lot of scaffolding, the Roc and this young boy started a conversation. \u00a0They graduated to jumping into the pool together and then started a game I couldn\u2019t quite understand but had something to do with the ladder, construction workers, and sharks. \u00a0I sat on the other side of the pool and struck up a conversation with the boys parents, who were in town from California, dropping their older daughter off for her freshman year of college. \u00a0They had no idea what they were witnessing and part of me didn\u2019t want to tell, and then another part of me wanted to stand up and shout just how amazing it was to be watching my boy PLAY! \u00a0With another child! \u00a0That he had never met before! \u00a0I pulled out my phone and snapped a very fuzzy picture, which I then texted to GC. When the conversation moved to our boys and the dad mentioned how shy the Roc was at first, I told him it wasn\u2019t just shyness, the Roc is autistic. \u00a0I told him it was HUGE to be relaxing on a chair, watching him play with a child he couldn\u2019t even look at, let alone say hello to, just 30 minutes ago. \u00a0HUGE. \u201cI would have never known,\u201d the dad said to me. I couldn\u2019t think of anything productive to say, and I didn\u2019t want to give a list of all the reasons he would know on any other day. \u00a0I just sat and smiled as I watched my boy who loves to travel, who is\u00a0genuinely\u00a0excited about a hotel room and going to new restaurants, who really rolled with everything new we did this summer. \u00a0My boy who really, really, really wants to make a friend and connect with another child\u2026 have fun. Fun. It\u2019s what I wanted our summer to be about. We had lots of fun.

{"date": "October 12, 2012", "body": "I first read about Special Hockey on my friend  Jean\u2019s  blog. \u00a0She  raved  about the effect Special Hockey had on her and her son. \u00a0I cheered along when they went to MA for a hockey tournament and I cried when I read about Jack  scoring his first goal . \u00a0When we decided to move to a \u201chockey state,\u201d (Where there are community ed programs that teach preschoolers how to ice skate!) Stimey forwarded me a link to MN Special Hockey. \u00a0I got excited, but after all of our selling our town home, moving across the country, and buying a new home expenses, we couldn\u2019t cover the registration fees and buy all the equipment the Roc would need, and you need a lot of equipment to play hockey. \u00a0I put Special Hockey on the back burner until the spring when I spent some time talking with a coach, a player, and her dad at an autism resource fair, then I got excited and started talking to GC about signing the Roc up to play. \u00a0Then my neighbor gave us first dibs on the hockey\u00a0equipment\u00a0her son had outgrown, which was just the Roc\u2019s size, that she was selling in our neighborhood garage sale. \u00a0We were able to get almost everything the Roc would need\u2026 Last weekend was the MN Special Hockey kick-off event down at the\u00a0University\u00a0of Minnesota Mariucci arena. \u00a0After a quick meeting there would be an open skate. \u00a0We bought the Roc a helmet, the only piece of equipment he was missing, and the morning of the event we had him try everything on to make sure it fit. \u00a0He was pretty happy, and upon seeing himself in the mirror, he stated, \u201cI look just like a real hockey player!\u201d When we got near the arena the Roc started to get agitated, telling us he was nervous over and over again. \u00a0He gripped my hand and I could feel the anxiety humming off his body as we walked to the arena. \u00a0I hurt for him when he is so anxious, and wish so badly that I could take that fear and anxiety away. \u00a0We wound our way around and found the gathering of special hockey people, and the Roc was introduced to some of the players on his team. \u00a0Everyone was very happy to meet him, and he mustered up the courage to say hello back. After a quick meeting it was time to suit up for the open skate. \u00a0The Roc immediately started to say that he was nervous, and as GC laced his hockey skates the Roc began to cry. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this!\u201d he wailed. \u00a0His coach came over and pointed out a few different people who could help him, and then a woman, Miss M, came over and started talking to the Roc. \u00a0She was saying all the right things, and the Roc was still crying, but she didn\u2019t give up. \u00a0I was just about to tell her that he wasn\u2019t going to do it, to give us more time, that there were too many people talking to him at once, but I bit my tongue. \u00a0GC got him up on his feet and the Roc grimaced and yelled that his feet hurt. \u00a0Tears filled his eyes and he was completely\u00a0rigid\u00a0 \u00a0We body walked him towards the ice, him yelling and carrying on the whole way. \u00a0I let Miss M who was still talking with him take over, she wasn\u2019t giving up, and I kind of wanted to. \u00a0He yelled louder the closer they go to the ice. \u00a0He was shaking, going slow, holding up the other players who were eager to get on the ice. \u00a0In any other location, around anyone else, I would have felt anxious, wanting to allow the others to pass. \u00a0But there is no judgement in this crowd, and everyone was so patient with the Roc. \u00a0The other players quietly stood behind him, waiting for their turn to get on the ice. \u00a0 Miss M convinced the Roc to sit on a folding chair and GC and I went to take a seat against the glass. \u00a0I thought he would want to get off the ice right away, and my stomach twisted with worry. \u00a0He looked so scared, gripping onto the chair, as Miss M began to slowly push him around. It didn\u2019t take long before that look of fear started to ease and his face started to relax. Oh my God, and then this. Every time they got to a line, Miss M would help the Roc stand up and then sit him back down. \u00a0He was grinning. \u00a0I was grinning. \u00a0He was so very proud of himself and I choked back tears behind my camera. GC and I kept exclaiming, \u201cLOOK! OH MY GOD! \u00a0LOOK AT HIM!\u201d to each other. \u00a0GC commented that his face hurt from smiling. \u00a0Mine did too. Pretty soon the Roc had one of the players from the women\u2019s gopher team helping him too and I wiped away tears over and over watching everyone encourage the Roc. \u00a0The little girl in red, a sibling of a player, stayed with the Roc the whole time, cheering him and helping him. It was awesome. \u00a0For the Roc to go from total terror, practically having a panic attack, to getting out there, trying, and smiling. \u00a0He was loving it. \u00a0As the ice cleared out, the volunteer from the gophers started pushing the Roc fast on the chair. Back and forth down the rink she pushed him, he didn\u2019t want to stop, he didn\u2019t want to get off the ice! When the open skate time was up, the Roc was so wound up and excited. \u00a0As we walked to the car he said, \u201cI did it! \u00a0I had fun!\u201d \u201cAre you proud of yourself Roc? \u00a0You were so scared at first, but you did it, and now it\u2019s not so scary anymore right?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not so scary anymore Mommy. \u00a0I did it! \u00a0I am proud of myself!\u201d he exclaimed. I am too. \u00a0So very proud of my guy. \u00a0We decided to celebrate and took the Roc out for pizza. \u00a0He deserved it. \u00a0As we were eating GC said to me, \u201cWhat a good day. \u00a0One of the best in a long time.\u201d Yup. \u00a0It was. Miss M and I have exchanged a few emails since Sunday afternoon. \u00a0From Miss M: I wanted to follow up, because I forgot to tell you this and it keeps putting a smile on my face whenever I think of it- I lost count of the number of times Roc exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m doing it!\u201d He said it the first time that I picked him up so he could stand on his skates, and just about every single time he \u201cskated\u201d from there on out. He was so stinkin\u2019 excited. I wrote her back and sent her a few of the pictures I took of them together on the ice. \u00a0Not enough can be said about people who volunteer their precious free time to organizations like Special Hockey. \u00a0I thanked her multiple times on Sunday for helping the Roc and again in an email. \u00a0Her response, It truly\u00a0truly\u00a0is my pleasure to help. This will be my fourth year volunteering with the organization and being a part of it has been, without question, the best thing that I\u2019ve done since moving to Minnesota. It helps me remember why I\u2019m here doing what I\u2019m doing.\u00a0(I am currently a doc student in School Psychology at the U.)\u00a0 Good luck with your season, and I look forward to seeing you when the Stingers and Wildcats play! Not enough can be said about people like Miss M. We look forward to seeing her and all of the players, coaches, and volunteers in November when the season officially starts. Go Wildcats! \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stimeyland.com/", "http://www.stimeyland.com/2012/03/your-baby-is-my-baby/", "http://www.stimeyland.com/2012/03/magic-of-special-hockey-social-media/", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_8614.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_86211.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_86301.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_86321.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_86431.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_86581.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_86741.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_8689.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_8706.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/img_87221.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/ice-ice-baby/", "title": "Ice, Ice Baby!"},

The Roc did a few craft projects from the art kit he got for Christmas, he colored in his coloring books, and as a grasp at straws I had him glue all those box tops onto some sheets to send into school. I still think that GC may have found it hard to concentrate when the Roc visited him at work\u2026 But he was nice enough to make pizza for us. He also took the dog outside so I wouldn\u2019t have to.\u00a0 (What a guy!)\u00a0 (The poor dog could hardly walk in these wind chills.) How did I stay sane? I spent some time in the basement with this guy on Monday, then I watched Jane Eyre while running on the treadmill yesterday, and I kept my eye on weather.com to make sure we were going to be approaching zero degrees on Wednesday, which would mean school\u2019s back in session!

{"date": "January 29, 2014", "body": "The Roc and I escaped the Minnesota deep freeze and went to Arizona to visit my parents last week.\u00a0 We were there for eight days.\u00a0 Eight days of no alarm clocks, lots of hiking, sun, geocaching, sun, eating, plants vs. zombies, sun, and (almost) daily margaritas. But first we had to get there.\u00a0 A midnight snow storm made for slow going at 3:30 am when we left for the airport.\u00a0 Luckily we got there with plenty of time.\u00a0 Enough for the Roc to get some quality time playing plants vs. zombies on his iPad (a new obsession.) Soon enough we were on our way. The Roc was so excited when we touched down in Arizona.\u00a0 \u201cYAY!!\u00a0 Now let\u2019s GO!\u00a0 NOW!\u201d was what the passengers surrounding us were subjected to after we landed.\u00a0 It was loud and we were in the very back of a very large plane. On the drive to Tucson we stopped at Casa Grande National Monument outside Phoenix. The Roc was not used to the sun and he was feeling the effects of getting up at 3 am. He actually fell asleep in the car for a bit. We spent the first couple days taking it easy, walking around the neighborhood, playing a little plants vs. zombies, going for a short hike, and to eat downtown\u2013where I had a yummy prickly pear margarita! The Roc got to climb in the empty fountains. Then we got busy! On MLK day we hiked to the Gordon Hirabayashi Recreation Area, which was once a prison camp and then an internment camp during WWII. (A geocache) (Another find!) We also went to Sabino canyon, a favorite of the Roc\u2019s, specifically for the water.\u00a0 We rode the tram in and then walked the 4 miles back out. (I told the Roc to see if he could run up this giant hill at the end\u2013he did!) He also found a geocache! Something new we did was a cave tour and a hike at Colossal Cave Mountain Park one day. (The boy can HIKE) After a picnic and another geocache, we spent one afternoon at the Desert Museum where the Roc asked me to take his picture, just like he did a few years ago. At the museum I finally get to see the coyote, catch a sweet shot of a hummingbird, and get a picture with my boy. We had one overcast day and we took the Roc to Coldstone Creamery and then for a short hike at Saguaro National Park.\u00a0 The Roc was super silly and I couldn\u2019t get him to stand still for a picture with my mom! His silliness went away a mile later when he got a very small splinter in his hand and he spent the rest of the hike agonizing over it\u2019s removal, which my mom was able to do when we got back to the car\u2013thank goodness for a Grandma who hikes with a first aide kit!\u00a0 (I have no photographic evidence of the splinter.) On our final day in Arizona we went for a long hike and I soaked up the sun, knowing that we would be heading back into sub zero temperatures the very next day. Gabe Zimmerman trail head. Lest you be fooled by all the smiling photos in this post, the Roc fell apart at the turn around spot on this hike.\u00a0 He had complained of hunger and so my mom and I sat down with him to eat while my dad went on to find a geocache.\u00a0 When my dad came back, after finding the cache, the Roc lost it.\u00a0 He wanted to see the \u201ctreasure\u201d and proceeded to sit down, scream, and throw his hat and some rocks.\u00a0 He was disappointed, sad, and frustrated that we wouldn\u2019t go on so he could see what my dad had found, and instead we were heading back to the car.\u00a0 We had a long way to go, over 3 miles, and we needed to start back to make sure we got there before the sun set.\u00a0 I felt for him and was frustrated with myself as I had a feeling he was going to be upset when my dad came back and he realized he had missed out.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t happy for a lot of that hike back, but eventually he followed close to my dad, and I didn\u2019t hear most of his tirade. We were bound for home the next day and the Roc and I were both sad to leave.\u00a0 He was happy to have a treat at Starbucks near our gate at the airport, and play plants vs. zombies while we waited to board the plane. Which is what he did the whole way home.\u00a0 I tried to get him to watch a movie, but he would have none of it and continued to play the game, while wearing headphones\u2013which caused him to very LOUDLY exclaim for me to, \u201cLOOK AT THIS!\u201d and \u201cWATCH THIS!\u201d jolting me and the poor couple seated in front of us.\u00a0 But I reminded myself how I had to entertain him by reading books, doling out snacks and crayons, and watching movies with him when he was younger and we flew across the country, and I felt a little better about the loud exclamations. We landed and were both shocked by the below zero windchill! Back to real life and our routine!

We spent the whole month of July in South Carolina, staying with GC\u2019s parents for most of the time, except for one week in which my parents flew out and the five of us stayed in a house right on the ocean. Being ocean front was marvelous.\u00a0 The view from the porch was gorgeous any time of day. The Roc was very excited again this year to go to the ocean.\u00a0 Last year was the first time he actually spent time in the water, running and playing in the waves, carefree in the sun.\u00a0 I was looking forward to watching him in the ocean, getting in the warm water myself, and playing in the sand.\u00a0 I was doubly excited that my parents were with us this year.\u00a0 I\u2019ve talked about the magic of South Carolina for years and it was so fun to share it with them.\u00a0 The big thing this year was boogie boarding!\u00a0 The Roc tried it for the first time and really enjoyed it, though he got pretty frustrated when he couldn\u2019t catch a wave just right. The Roc\u2019s cousins came up from Charleston and spent some time with us at the beach house.\u00a0 The kids all had a blast. GC\u2019s parents came over a few times and it was fun watching the guys play soccer on the sand. It went by fast, but we had a great week. GC spent some of our time in SC working, (since he works from home and can work anywhere!) so there were many days the Roc and I headed out to the beach just the two of us.\u00a0 We stayed for hours and constructed a lot of sand castles. One morning, after a bit of a meltdown, the Roc and I went walking at the state park beach.\u00a0 We were in calf deep water and all of the sudden the Roc said, \u201cLook Mommy!\u201d and to my left this was swimming by: The Roc did really well most of the time we were in South Carolina, but of course, he had a few moments, and there was more than one time I thought I may lose my mind.\u00a0 I never stayed mad for too long. Pomegranate margaritas also helped to take the edge off. While we did spend the bulk of our time at the beach, GC, his mom, and I took the Roc mini golfing for the very first time.\u00a0 He loved it! \n We also spent a lot of time at the pool!

{"date": "September 22, 2014", "body": "The Roc and I went on a walk a couple days ago, and as soon as we came back inside he settled in with his iPad and I came up to my computer and started to record our conversation.\u00a0 I\u2019ve come back to this page over the last few days and written the rest.\u00a0 He\u2019s come so far and I\u2019m so proud of the connections he is making and the emotional growth he is able to express.\u00a0 I wanted to capture this time. *** I have been pushing the Roc to converse with me instead of delivering monologues at me.\u00a0 It\u2019s really hard to talk about Halloween (since the beginning of August,) Plants vs. Zombies (since last Christmas!) and what we are going to bake next \u2013 over and over and over again.\u00a0 Every.single.day.\u00a0 It is extremely one-sided and the Roc has been expressing anger when I don\u2019t listen and answer him with a distracted, \u201cUmm-hmmm.\u201d\u00a0 I want the Roc to be able to converse with peers and adults (and me!)\u00a0 So I\u2019ve been pushing the boundaries of his language skills.\u00a0 I prod him to give me more details about school by asking if something fun happened that day, and he is no longer allowed to say recess and/or lunch.\u00a0 I tell him that I will only talk about Plants vs. Zombies for the first two minutes of our walks and then I try to steer him in a different direction.\u00a0 I prompt him to ask me a question, any question he can think of, about me or my day.\u00a0 He usually asks me if I had a good day and what I did.\u00a0 Even though it\u2019s forced and he told me he doesn\u2019t actually care what I did that day, it\u2019s a start, and a skill needed to get along in this world. We\u2019ve been going on a lot of walks lately, both to enjoy the weather, and also to get out of the house while GC is ripping out and installing new flooring.\u00a0 It is so loud and the Roc has a hard time with the noise, even while wearing his noise-canceling headphones.\u00a0 The grasshoppers are everywhere on the trails during our walks and the Roc tends to get frustrated when they jump right in front of him.\u00a0 One day last week he got so mad that he stomped on a grasshopper and when I turned to look we both saw the grasshopper half smooshed, pulling itself by centimeters across the blacktop.\u00a0 I gasped and said that looked like a horrible way to die and the Roc immediately crouched down and tears came to his eyes.\u00a0 He told me he wished he hadn\u2019t stomped on the bug, that it was living before he did that, and now it couldn\u2019t go on with it\u2019s life.\u00a0 He asked me if I could fix it and hung his head when I told him I couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 We watched the grasshopper eventually stop moving and the Roc asked if he could mark the grave by piling up some grass.\u00a0 After he did that he wanted to celebrate the grasshoppers life, which we did by saying a few words about the weather and how nice a life the little bug must have had in the park.\u00a0 After some time the Roc said he was ready to walk on, but he didn\u2019t think he would feel better for awhile. Seeing how open he was I tried to make the connection of how the Roc felt about the grasshopper and how much worse it would be if we were to see a pet get hurt.\u00a0 I mentioned how much harder it would be to see Guinness get injured and how devastated we would feel if we couldn\u2019t save him.\u00a0 Our conversation moved on to hunting (which he was talking about lately with GC ) and he made the connection that if it was hard for him to watch a grasshopper die, then it would be near impossible to watch a deer die.\u00a0 (I breathed a sigh of relief as I didn\u2019t really want him to want to hunt.)\u00a0 He wanted to know why people hunted instead of just letting the animals live and I tried to explain population control to him, but he got stuck on wanting people to leave animals alone. Talking about animals seemed to brighten the Roc up considerably and he launched into telling me about how more animals are made\u2026and then people\u2026I was fully enjoying the fact that we were not talking about one of his three main subjects of late. \u201cMommy, did you know that one animal makes another animal and then that animal makes two more and then those two animals make more and more and it just keeps going?\u00a0 Did you know that animals make animals?\u201d \u201cYes, Roc.\u00a0 I did know that.\u201d \u201cDid you know that people make people?\u201d he asked me.\u00a0 \u201cYup.\u201d \u201cDid you make me?\u201d \u201cYup.\u00a0 I did.\u201d\u00a0 I wondered whether this was going to lead to the question I don\u2019t want to answer:\u00a0 How did he get inside me?\u00a0 Luckily, he didn\u2019t ask that particular question.\u00a0 Instead he brought up the miscarriage I had a few years ago. \u201cMommy, remember that baby that was in your belly and it died?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI still feel sad about that and I wish we could have had another kid.\u00a0 I really wish I had someone to play with.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have anyone to play with and I really wish I did.\u201d \u201cWell, I know you wish that and sometimes Mommy feels sad about that baby too.\u00a0 But you know what?\u00a0 I am so happy that I got to have you.\u00a0 Did I ever tell you that when you were in my belly the doctors told me that there was a chance that I might lose you?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know for a long time while I was pregnant with you if you were going to live.\u00a0 It was hard and I am so thankful and grateful that I got to have you.\u00a0 And there are some benefits to being an only child you know?\u00a0 You get all my attention.\u00a0 I can take you places and travel with you, like when we go to Arizona in the winter.\u00a0 It\u2019s lucky in some ways, that you are an only.\u201d The Roc pondered that for a moment and then said, \u201cWell, I still wish there was someone in the house to play with, but you know what?\u00a0 I\u2019m really glad that I was born a boy.\u201d \u201cReally?\u00a0 Why?\u201d \u201cBecause then I don\u2019t have to grow a baby.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to have to do that and so I\u2019m glad that I don\u2019t have to.\u201d \u201cYup, you are right.\u00a0 You won\u2019t ever have to grow a baby in your belly.\u201d Then he asked if he could talk about Halloween and so I told him yes..and I tried to muster some enthusiasm and attention for this repetitive topic.\u00a0 My mind wandered back over what had just happened and the connections the Roc has been making lately while he chattered on about the desserts I already agreed to bake, the costume he was going to wear, the new decorations I already agreed to buy, the kinds of pumpkins he wanted to carve, and the decorations he was going to make. I smiled as I walked on, half listening, and thought about how grateful I am to have the chance to slow down and savor life.\u00a0 Everything is hard won with this boy and he works so hard every day. *** Yesterday the Roc was inside the house while I mowed the lawn and GC worked on the floor.\u00a0 I knew he wasn\u2019t happy as I could hear him through the open windows telling his father to be quiet.\u00a0 I loaded up the van with some stuff to bring to the town composting site and poked my head inside to ask the Roc if he wanted to come along for the ride.\u00a0 He did and he told me loudly how unhappy he was that it was so noisy in the house.\u00a0 He was agitated\u00a0 in the car and screamed loudly about a butterfly flying near him in the van as I drove out of the neighborhood.\u00a0 I could see his face screwed up in anger and his arms waving around in the rear view mirror and then I saw that it was moth. \u201cDon\u2019t kill it Roc!\u00a0 Remember how you felt when you squashed the grasshopper last week?!\u201d \u201cI already killed it,\u201d he told me. \u201cOh no, are you ok?\u201d \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t feel bad this time.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d I asked him. \u201cNo, it is different today.\u00a0 My emotions didn\u2019t come out.\u201d Huh.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t see that coming. I hid my smile and turned up the music. \u00a0 *** I love his word choices and how he is learning to express himself.\u00a0 The growth is inside as much as it is on the outside. I feel so lucky to be witnessing his transformation. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/grasshoppers-death-life/", "title": "Grasshoppers + Death +\u00a0Life"},
{"date": "September 2, 2014", "body": "The Roc and I skipped the chaos of the elementary school open house at the end of August, and opted instead to schedule a private time for him to see his new fourth grade classroom and to meet the new autism teacher.\u00a0 This private meeting is something we\u2019ve done since he started school, and I am always relieved that everyone is willing to accommodate him in this way.\u00a0 The morning of our meeting, while he played in my big bathtub, I sat on the floor and asked him questions about school, what he liked and disliked and if there was anything he wanted the new teachers to know before school started.\u00a0 I also tried to get him to tell me what things the teachers could do to help him if he was having a hard time, but he couldn\u2019t tell me.\u00a0 I took notes and used them to type up a letter.\u00a0 I read it to him and he approved (mostly to get me to stop talking about school I suspect.) Here are the Roc\u2019s words, (except the first two sentences which I added) his first foray into self advocacy: Dear Teachers, My name is the Roc and I am in your class this year.\u00a0 I want you to know a little about me.\u00a0 I have autism and sometimes it is hard for me to stay calm.\u00a0 I feel nervous about school when I don\u2019t know to expect.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know the kids in my class.\u00a0 I am also nervous about what will happen during the day (my schedule) and I like to know what comes next.\u00a0 I am worried about what to do at recess and who will play with me.\u00a0  I hope I have a teacher helper again this year.\u00a0 I need help and they help me in the classroom.\u00a0 Then I don\u2019t have to wait for the teacher who has to help everyone else. I am good at recess and running.\u00a0 I also like gym.\u00a0 Daily 5 isn\u2019t my favorite.\u00a0 Reading and math are hard for me and I always have to do work.\u00a0 Work is hard and I get frustrated. Roc *** Yesterday I followed that letter up with an email to the people who work with the Roc everyday at school: \n Hello Team Roc! \n With the new school year starting tomorrow I thought I would send you all a little note about how the Roc is doing since school let out in May and what we have been working on this summer.\u00a0 I thought this would be good for those of you who have never worked with the Roc before.\u00a0 \n We believe that the Roc\u2019s success is a team effort and we are always available to answer any questions and we hope to communicate with you all as the year goes on.\u00a0 We take our responsibility as part of this team very seriously and will gladly take any suggestions you have in regards to helping the Roc grow academically, socially and emotionally. \n The Roc has had a good summer and went to a few weeks of ESY before we headed to SC to visit family for the month of July, he also participated in a day camp through True Friends as well as a 4 day social skills camp at the end of August. \n As evidenced in the letter he gave to Mrs. fourth grade and Ms. autism teacher when we had our private \u201copen house,\u201d the Roc knows that he is autistic and he knows that he has a harder time staying calm than other kids.\u00a0 He has expressed this summer that he doesn\u2019t like that he is different and he wishes his brain worked like everyone else.\u00a0 We are working hard to build his self esteem and show him that he is so much more than autism.\u00a0 We want him to like himself and be happy with who he is. \n The Roc is still having a hard time with mimicking other children to get a reaction.\u00a0 He displayed this behavior with his cousins this summer and also during day camp.\u00a0 We have been talking a lot about other people\u2019s feelings and I recently bought a self-control & empathy workbook to do with Rocco.\u00a0 Just a heads up that this is still an issue. \n \n The Roc has been obsessing over spiderwebs for awhile and it has gotten so bad that he won\u2019t eat if he sees one (my house is very clean now.)\u00a0 I do not know if he will talk about this at school, but if you see him scanning the ceiling and all the nooks and crannies of a room\u2013he is probably searching for spiderwebs.\u00a0 I welcome any suggestions anyone may have in how we can help him overcome his spiderweb issue. \n \n The Roc has been twisting up the left side of his shirts for many months now.\u00a0 I bought a bunch of hand fidgets and while he does like to have something in his hands, he still twists up his shirt.\u00a0 We are not calling attention to it anymore as he was getting very upset when we talked about it too much. \n \n The Roc loves, loves, loves plants vs. zombies on his iPad.\u00a0 He probably won\u2019t talk about it at school because he said, \u201czombies aren\u2019t appropriate for school and I don\u2019t want to get an FYI.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has made up his own zombie game at home which he calls nerf gun vs. zombies.\u00a0 We use a behavior chart at home that is plants vs. zombies themed and he earns tokens for positive behaviors and we take tokens away for offenses. \n \n The Roc loves a good joke and is starting to be able to tell when people are joking with him. He loves to tell jokes, but needs a little work on coming up with them on his own.\u00a0 :)\u00a0 (C told him to think of a few things that would help him have a good week this week and jokes came up.)\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t quite understand when people laugh because he said something funny when he didn\u2019t mean to. \n \n The Roc has a hard time looking people in the eye and he has told me it is because he doesn\u2019t know what they are thinking.\u00a0 I have told him he can look at someone\u2019s forehead instead of their eyeballs if this makes him more comfortable. \n \n Please know that we are always available to answer any questions or concerns you may have and we love to hear when you notice progress in the Roc.  Feel free to pass this along to anyone else who works with the Roc. \n Good luck tomorrow! \n \n *** \n Last night the Roc freaked out a bit at bedtime (understatement) and even though he said he was mad because I let him play the iPad too long (I did) and I\u2019m not tough enough to make him stop (Yesterday I wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 Hello end of summer, hanging on by my fingernails, whatever works) I also knew it was because school is starting back up.\u00a0 I was proved right when he started to scream, \u201cI hate my life!\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to go to stupid school!\u00a0 It\u2019s boring!\u201d when I told him to get his pjs on and teeth brushed because he had to get some sleep before school.\u00a0 Bedtime turned into an hour long cool down session with the white board.\u00a0 I wrote what was making him angry: Plants vs. Zombies 2, the dog staring at him, and his clothes not going where he wanted them to when he tried to fling them from the second floor down into the family room.\u00a0 Then I wrote some solutions/options to what was making him angry:\u00a0 Stop playing the game forever, or for a few days, take a break, take a deep breath, call up the inventors of Plants vs. Zombies 2 and tell them they are greedy, stupid heads who made the game way too hard.\u00a0 I wrote more silly stuff for the dog staring and clothes flinging issues and was delighted when he burst out laughing.\u00a0 We eventually wrote out his morning schedule and I drew a map at the bottom of how to get to his classroom.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to talk about school, only asking if he would still ride the van instead of the bus. *** It wasn\u2019t as hard to get him up and out the door as I thought it would be this morning.\u00a0 He did what he usually does on school days and dragged his feet through the morning routine causing him to run out of time to read (I read to him, either books from the library or Harry Potter) before the BUS came.\u00a0 Oh my, it was a bus and not the van!\u00a0 It\u2019s been a van for three years!\u00a0 The only thing he asked me the night before school started was if the van was going to pick him up and I hurriedly said, \u201cYup, of course!\u00a0 You don\u2019t ride the big bus, you ride the van.\u201d\u00a0 The look he gave me when a big bus stopped at the end of our driveway was of pure and utter shock.\u00a0 He was speechless.\u00a0 Lucky for him the bus driver seems super, duper nice and he asked me a bunch of questions while the bus aide (an aide on the bus!\u00a0 Yay!) showed him to his seat. I got an email during the day from Mrs. fourth grade saying that he was doing great in her room and was \u201cdelightful,\u201d as well as thanking me for the earlier email with all the info on the Roc, that it helped her immensely.\u00a0 I also got an email from Ms. autism teacher this evening stating that the Roc had a wonderful day, was a lot of fun, was nice to a younger student in her room, and only had one hiccup which involved him not being able to take another student\u2019s perspective when they were upset.\u00a0 I was glad to get these emails as the Roc would only tell me that he had fun at recess and then all he wanted to talk about for the rest of the evening was Halloween, plants vs. zombies, and what we could bake next (we bake together every week.) We we made it!\u00a0 First day of fourth grade over and done!

{"date": "August 29, 2014", "body": "I haven\u2019t written much in 2014.\u00a0 Not that there hasn\u2019t been anything to say, there were so many situations, triumphs, heartaches, one step forwards and two steps back, fist-pumping moments, and on and on.\u00a0 Life happened.\u00a0 So many times I\u2019ve wanted to write, but I have found it harder to write about the Roc as he has gotten older.\u00a0 This is his life, his story, and it doesn\u2019t feel appropriate to write about the harder stuff, but it also feels dishonest to only write about the good.\u00a0 Because this life, as I know it, as he knows it, has both.\u00a0 But I want to continue telling our story because it is a way for me to keep track of where we have been.\u00a0 I have also been told that other people see their family in my own, they see their kiddo in my Roc, and whether they are looking forward or looking back when they read, I appreciate the connections.\u00a0 Also, more than one real life friend has told me that they they learn about autism and what our life is like when they read my words, and I appreciate that just as much as the connections. So, to get started again after many months off and because I like to focus on all the good stuff, here are some of the family highlights of spring/early summer 2014. After spending a weekend up on  scaffolding  in our town home in Delaware a few years ago GC swore that he was never going to have a house with a two story family room and/or foyer again.\u00a0 That statement didn\u2019t hold true as the house we bought when we moved here three years ago has a two story family room.\u00a0 So this spring we rented scaffolding and GC was again painting and installing a ceiling fan way up high, much to his delight. I even went up on the top level to wash the windows and gained a new appreciation for his bravery! *** I went to a Rocky Mountain School of Photography photo weekend in April and finally learned how to shoot in manual.\u00a0 I practiced a lot on our pets and at swim practice (which is very hard due to the lighting at the pool and all the movement, but I\u2019m working on it.)\u00a0 The Roc is a bit tired of me pointing my camera at him.\u00a0 Actually the dog is too, though I think he is afraid of the noise, and that\u2019s why he leaves the room every time I start snapping. *** Swimming was big in the spring with swim team starting back up and going through June.\u00a0 Team practice two nights a week and then a weekly individual swim lessons at a local swim school kept the Roc busy after school.\u00a0 His love affair with water continues and it was a joy to watch him on the team. My favorite swim memory from this year is from the Roc\u2019s very first swim meet at the end of May.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t expressed an interest in the meets during the fall/winter season and I didn\u2019t push him to compete.\u00a0 After getting my fall volunteer points complete by working meet concessions I was relieved that he wasn\u2019t interested.\u00a0 The meet I attended was long, crowded, and so noisy.\u00a0 I worried it would be completely overwhelming and that he wouldn\u2019t want to continue on the team if I pushed him to race before he was ready.\u00a0 So when he brought it up on his own, after seeing some of the kids get participation medals at practice this spring, I signed him up for one race, 25 freestyle.\u00a0 When I looked at the team website a few days later I saw that the coach signed him up for backstroke as well.\u00a0 In the days leading up to the meet we went over what to expect and decided that GC would take him to the meet and I would be the one volunteering (as a timer.)\u00a0 I was so nervous for him and so proud when he went to sit with his team.\u00a0 The coaches were awesome about getting the kids to where they needed to be and the Roc got in the water and raced the backstroke.\u00a0 He was so proud of himself when he got to the end of the pool and I was able to wave to him before GC took him home.\u00a0 There was a big chunk of time between his two races, and we live close to the pool, so GC thought it would be better to wait at home.\u00a0 They came back in time for the freestyle and I was psyched that he would be racing in the lane that I was timing! The Roc is in the lane closest to you as you watch\u2026 He crushed it! *** Right after school let out we were invited to spend a weekend up at cabin owned by the coach of the Roc\u2019s special hockey team.\u00a0 He knew that we love the outdoors and thought we might enjoy fishing and hanging out at his little place in the woods.\u00a0 We did!\u00a0 After one day of rain it was peaceful and beautiful. It was wonderful to spend the time with the Roc\u2019s coach as well.\u00a0 He is one of the most genuine people I have ever met.\u00a0 He helped the Roc fish off the dock, putting worm after worm on the hook as the Roc caught sunny after sunny, and he even got all the spiderwebs down off the ceiling. (This is an anxiety issue the Roc developed last summer, which we thought would go away like so many other things have in the past, but it hasn\u2019t gone away\u2026something to write about in the future.\u00a0 Spiderwebs can literally ruin his day.)\u00a0 The special needs world has introduced our family to so many wonderful people and we are very grateful. After our weekend at the cabin we were biding our time until we left for South Carolina (which deserves a post all it\u2019s own.) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_4057.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_4059.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_4068.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_3985.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_4296.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_4315.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_4350.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_4463.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_4448.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/catching-up-the-highlights/", "title": "Catching up: The\u00a0Highlights"},
{"date": "December 18, 2013", "body": "For my own personal need to document the big and the not-so-big, and for H, who said she missed my updates.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a recap on November, from my big camera, my phone, and my mind: Guinness waited patiently\u2026 and then this started\u2026 and now he spends his days like this. The snow means I\u2019m running inside on the treadmill.\u00a0 (So glad we bought a treadmill back in July when they were on sale!)\u00a0 I quickly blew through Orange Is The New Black on Netflix while running and was looking for another series to watch when I saw Parenthood on my list.\u00a0 I had heard good things about it, but for a long time didn\u2019t think I could handle a show where autism would be one of the topics.\u00a0 I was wrong, or I\u2019m watching it at the right time for me, but I am hooked.\u00a0 Love the show.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just the autism storyline that has captured my attention, all of it has, I enjoy all the characters.\u00a0 But I will admit to tearing up at more than one situation involving Max and his family.\u00a0 There are moments, like when Max shrugs off his mother\u2019s hands when she rubs his arm and the look on his mother\u2019s face.\u00a0 Or when the dad tries to take Max out of his routine for a fun day at the amusement park and it doesn\u2019t go as he\u2019d hoped\u2026.it just hits so close to home.\u00a0 I think it gives people without a child on the spectrum a glimpse of what our lives can be like.\u00a0 Some of the day to day battles, heartaches, and joys.\u00a0 I talked about the show a few times and my parents started to watch it too. *** OT Graduation!\u00a0 The Roc was released from Occupational Therapy in mid-November after fourteen months.\u00a0 I love his therapist, who is also his hippotherapist, so we still get to see her every Saturday.\u00a0 A week before he was released she warned me it was coming, that she knew he was going to score in the average range when she did her sixty day testing.\u00a0 On his last day she had me come back to the therapy room to show me his scores from his initial evaluation and then he demonstrated some of the things he couldn\u2019t do a year ago.\u00a0 She remarked that something really clicked in the last couple months and she saw some big gains in his physical ability as well as his confidence.\u00a0 I wondered aloud if his being in the pool multiple nights a week had something to do with it\u2026to which she agreed. *** The Roc still loves swimming on the swim team.\u00a0 He isn\u2019t always paying attention to the coaches when they are giving directions, and is then behind or confused as to what he is supposed to be doing, but he\u2019s getting better about looking at the other kids in his lane and following their lead.\u00a0 He will also call out questions to the coaches, something he wouldn\u2019t have done a couple years ago, now we need to work on teaching him how to get their attention first\u2013or better yet, paying attention when they give directions!\u00a0 He can definitely keep up with the other kids in the water though! *** After an early morning dental appointment I got to walk the Roc down to his classroom and just had to talk a picture of what was taped to his locker. I want that for you too kid. *** This. This bottle is still sitting on my dresser.\u00a0 Unopened.\u00a0 In front of a photograph of baby Roc.\u00a0 There are too many words to simply say\u2026 I\u2019m not ready to go down that road.\u00a0 We are not ready.\u00a0 So that bottle of pills will wait. *** While going through old binders of evaluations and progress reports to scan into my computer (and then shred\u2013too much paper!) I came across the Roc\u2019s first OT session with his preschool OT.\u00a0 I pulled it out to save, but not before snapping a pic.\u00a0 He\u2019s come so far. His Christmas list which he wrote RIGHT after Thanksgiving with a little idea and spelling help.\u00a0 Gotta love this kid who when you ask what he wants for Christmas says, \u201cI don\u2019t know, could you give me some ideas?\u201d *** As soon as Thanksgiving was over and the wish list was on the fridge, the Roc started in on all things Christmas.\u00a0 How far away it was, what he wanted, how many presents he would get, if we could put more lights outside (we leave colored lights in our pine tree year round) or a light up reindeer, and when we could decorate inside.\u00a0 He got started decorating before I got the boxes out of the basement.   He was satisfied with that for a short time and then went back to asking when we could get the rest of the stuff out. *** Not only has the Roc gotten into making his own decorations.\u00a0 He decided one day to make his own memory game. Which is totally cool.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t ask for any games on his Christmas list, but he\u2019s getting a bunch.\u00a0 We are working hard on playing games. He also drew and colored this house when he spent the night at my mom and dad\u2019s in early November.\u00a0 Grandma doesn\u2019t remember him making it, only that it was completed that Sunday when she woke up.\u00a0 He got up and made it while she was still in bed. *** The Roc\u2019s after school schedule has changed a bit with the addition of a behavioral aide.\u00a0 He was on the wait list for this program for months and when his name got to the top of the list and we were offered a premium spot of 3:30 \u2013 5:30 twice a week, I jumped on it.\u00a0 His skills trainer would be stopping anyway and we stopped music therapy for awhile to be able to fit everything in.\u00a0 His BA is young college graduate who works really well with the Roc.\u00a0 He wasted no time and was himself right from the start.\u00a0 Loud.\u00a0 No honeymoon period for her.\u00a0 He was very unhappy about being challenged.\u00a0 But she has not been phased by anything he\u2019s thrown her way and is very, very positive.\u00a0 It\u2019s nice to have someone so positive in the house and even though she\u2019s young and doesn\u2019t have kids of her own yet, I\u2019m learning just by listening to her interact with the Roc.\u00a0 She sees the small steps of progress and points them out to me, which is also so nice to hear.\u00a0 Right now they are working on coping skills, his big emotions, and how to play board games.\u00a0 Not getting his way and losing are huge triggers for the Roc and it\u2019s nice to work on this as it happens instead of talking about situations.\u00a0 Eventually we will add another child to some of the sessions so the Roc can work on these skills in real situations with other kids. *** My most favorite part of November was my trip with my best friend Christa.\u00a0 It deserves a post of it\u2019s own. \u00a0 Love this lady! Up next!\u00a0 Charleston with Christa!

My eyes scan the recipe as my heart remembers the feeling, the sights, the energy in that room last night.\u00a0 Images flicker in my consciousness.\u00a0 My son.\u00a0 Who opened up in a way I so rarely witness.\u00a0\u00a0 I slice and feel the not only everything in the present, but everything from the night before. I had been watching a dog rescue video from  Hope for Paws  as the Roc brushed his teeth in the bathroom five feet away.\u00a0 He walked in and wanted to see.\u00a0 I let him watch, and his face promptly crumbled as he took in the dirty, terrified dog.\u00a0 He asked me questions and I answered them honestly.\u00a0 Tears started to slide down his cheeks and he was overwhelmed. By big, deep feelings. \u201cWhat happened to that dog?\u00a0 Why does it look like that?\u00a0 Oh no\u2026.\u00a0 I think I feel bad.\u00a0 I think I\u2019m going to cry,\u201d he said as he moved to the floor by the door. His breath came in ragged gasps as he folded his arms across his chest, pulled his knees up, ducked his head.\u00a0 Hiding. Full of big emotions.\u00a0 He pulled the door against himself as he pressed back into the corner. He hid and I coaxed him out. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u00a0 I\u2019m here.\u00a0 I\u2019ll always be here.\u201d\u00a0 My own eyes filled with tears as I listened to his breath catch.\u00a0 He was showing a side I so rarely see.\u00a0 A side I know is there.\u00a0 Feelings I know are there.\u00a0 Sadness, despair, empathy.\u00a0 Yes, empathy.\u00a0 I lowered the volume on my laptop and slide onto the floor. \u201cPlease come out.\u00a0 I\u2019m right here.\u00a0 Come talk to me.\u201d He raised his tear stained face and I saw him.\u00a0 Really saw him.\u00a0 Red cheeks.\u00a0 Glistening blue eyes filled with sorrow.\u00a0 So often his true feelings are not seen on the outside.\u00a0 I have always known everything was there.\u00a0 Nothing missing.\u00a0 But he doesn\u2019t act the way people expect him too.\u00a0 Often his reactions to others emotions and his often his own seem completely inappropriate.\u00a0 But I know he feels everything.\u00a0 Even if his face doesn\u2019t match what\u2019s going on inside. My heart cracked open watching him process what he saw in the video and how it made him feel. He came out from behind the door and received my hug.\u00a0 We watched a couple more dog rescues.\u00a0 He cried some more.\u00a0 I held him in my lap, marveled at how long his body is getting.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t fit on my lap anymore.\u00a0 He sniffled and snuffled and had to leave the room when he was run over by his emotions.\u00a0 I worried that I went too far, that we watched for too long.\u00a0 That the pain and suffering he saw on the screen was too much for his heart. I got him into bed and in the darkness I tried to unravel what he was thinking.\u00a0 I asked questions and waited.\u00a0 Waited some more while he tried to find the words to explain his thoughts. About dogs and people.\u00a0 About cruelty and why some people are so mean.\u00a0 I could see in his face and feel in my bones that there was so much more he wanted to say.\u00a0 That he couldn\u2019t access the words to tell me how he really felt. Watching the wheels turn behind his eyes my mind was rusty, full of all the memories of those early diagnosis years when everything seemed insurmountable and I felt impotent.\u00a0 I used to ache to soothe him when he was a toddler.\u00a0 When the tears on his cheeks made him slap his eyes.\u00a0 When my arms and my words were not enough, when I didn\u2019t know what to do. Laying on the bed I held myself back and waited.\u00a0 Waited with eyes and knowledge only time could give me.

{"date": "December 20, 2013", "body": "Last year Christa and I went to  Key West  and had a wonderfully, relaxing time.\u00a0 This year we decided on Charleston, South Carolina.\u00a0 We had driven through Charleston back in 2010 when we took our very first trip together, which was a road trip!\u00a0 We didn\u2019t get to see anything downtown though, and so this was a perfect destination for us.\u00a0 Beautiful scenery, lots of history, tours, and of course, awesome southern food. I took the first photo of the trip while I had a layover at the Atlanta airport. Christa picked me up in Raleigh, North Carolina and we drove down to Charleston.\u00a0 We started our historical tours the next day with the Aiken-Rhett house.\u00a0 A very informative self-guided tour. and then the Nathaniel Russell House. Both tours were worth the time.\u00a0 I just wish I could have taken pictures  inside  the houses!\u00a0 While we were in town we toured two other houses, the Edmondston-Alston house, and the Calhoun Mansion, which we regretted as it wasn\u2019t so much a historical tour as it was a house jammed with stuff a really rich person collected.\u00a0 The house was huge and gorgeous, and the grounds were really beautiful too. There was also a cat, which made my day. I had one of my best meals at Dixie Supply Bakery & Cafe.\u00a0 (A restaurant that was on Dinners, Drive-ins, and Dives!) Shrimp and Grits \u2013 YUM! The best dessert from Toast! We actually had dinner at Toast one night, went back the next night to grab dessert to take back to our hotel, and then got up early on our last day to have breakfast there. We spent some time walking around downtown peeking into gardens and I took lots of pictures of the beautiful houses. I didn\u2019t take a picture of this awesome red door the first time I saw it and Christa was nice enough to walk around and try to find it another night.\u00a0 She spotted it and the owners were actually standing in it!\u00a0 We waited around, I took pictures of the gate next door until they went inside, then I was able to get a pic. We went down to Kiawah island one day and even though it was cloudy and we got rained on, it was still a beautiful day. Our very favorite tour happened on our last day.\u00a0 We toured Magnolia Plantation and Gardens.\u00a0 We started with the \u201cSlavery to Freedom\u201d tour.\u00a0 Our tour guide was wonderful and very informative.\u00a0 There are four of the original 1850s slave quarters still onsite at Magnolia. We also went on a tram tour to see the grounds and wildlife. We took a tour of the house, and also walked the gardens. At the end of our afternoon I found another cat.\u00a0 Sylvester. Neither one of us was ready to leave Charleston.\u00a0 There was so much we didn\u2019t see and do while we were there.\u00a0 It\u2019s a place we think we would like to go back to one day, and we joked about retiring to the area.\u00a0 It was 80 degrees while we toured the plantation!\u00a0 A far cry from the cold that awaited me back in Minnesota. It was a wonderful trip full of fun, laughter, history, beautiful weather, and good food.\u00a0 I am so grateful for this friendship, for my friend.\u00a0 There are not enough words to explain my respect and admiration for Christa.\u00a0 She has been the best friend to me in the few years I\u2019ve known her.\u00a0 I am lucky, so lucky. I can\u2019t wait to see where we end up in 2014!

He worked on the puzzle with my mom. GC got to cooking, and drinking, while the Roc and Grandma continued on the puzzle.\u00a0 I had worried it might be to hard, but he was getting it, fitting many pieces together by himself. At some point in the evening they finished it!\u00a0 The Roc was super proud. My dad was content to sit and eat a little appetizer, with an audience. I put my camera down during dinner, but the food was amazing.\u00a0 I am lucky to be married to an Italian.\u00a0 He makes a huge seafood feast and I get to enjoy it! As soon as dinner was over the Roc was ready to open some presents from his family back East and those lucky enough to live near the mountains. My parents were happy to relax, and GC continued to drink! After watching the Grinch, a Christmas Eve tradition, and setting out milk, cookies, and a carrot (with a cover on the milk!) the Roc went to bed, and just like last year, GC passed out early from exhaustion\u2026and wine. I had the house to myself.\u00a0 I enjoyed all of our trees, and the cats were happy to come back up from the basement. I went to bed and Santa came. It was a wonderful day.\u00a0 I love how my parents embrace the Roc and take him as he is.\u00a0 There is no greater gift for me than seeing them together. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2629.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2643.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2633.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2642.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2641.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2732.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2640.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2652.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2653.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2655.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2663.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2675.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2681.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2679.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2687.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2698.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2702.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2013/12/28/happy-happy-eve/", "title": "Happy, Happy Eve"},

{"date": "December 28, 2013", "body": "The Roc was watching a movie this afternoon and I decided to lay down on my bed and read a book.\u00a0 The dog joined me and then GC did too.\u00a0 I had a persistent throat itch that was causing me to cough and I took the opportunity to relax and close my eyes after reading for awhile.\u00a0 I never nap and I never have time to lay down and read on the weekends.\u00a0 Because on the weekends the Roc is home and he either needs to be shuttled to social skills, horseback riding therapy, or special hockey, and if he isn\u2019t doing one of those things, then he needs to be set up with something to occupy his time.\u00a0 We either need to play a game with him, play a toy scenario he has constructed in his mind, read with him, set him up with a craft, or put him in front of a movie.\u00a0 We try to pull out the movie card only once or twice on the weekends.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier when the weather is nicer, because there are so many more choices.\u00a0 He rarely entertains himself without support from one of us, even on the iPad, he wants one of us to help him. When the movie was over GC and I both knew it, not only because of the song during the closing credits, but because the Roc appeared with his usual question of, \u201cWhat can I do now?\u201d\u00a0 We gave him some choices, none of them involving either of us getting off the bed, and he wasn\u2019t happy.\u00a0 He wanted me to get up and do something with him.\u00a0 (Which I have done a LOT of since winter \u201cbreak\u201d started.)\u00a0 He even yelled that it was my job to entertain him.\u00a0 Most certainly getting that from hearing me mutter that I am not an entertainer.\u00a0 We stayed put and ignored him as he yelled and came in our room to bang on the walls. For a few minutes at a time we could hear him humming and moving things around in the play area outside our room before he would come back into the bedroom.\u00a0 During these brief times GC and I talked about our frustrations and the exhaustion that comes with this kind of parenting.\u00a0 How even fun things, like going ice skating, often don\u2019t end well.\u00a0 We talked about the Roc\u2019s happiness, is he happy?\u00a0 It seems that he is only happy when he can do exactly what he wants, when other people react exactly as he wants them to, and when he gets exactly what he wants\u2013basically when everything is how he expects it to be\u2026which isn\u2019t how life works. I talked about the one thing I wished I could change, the screaming and the rude talking.\u00a0 Two things really, but the rude words are usually delivered while screaming so they are intricately connected\u2026anyway, I loath the screaming.\u00a0 We kicked around some ideas the Roc\u2019s behavioral aide suggested, a jar that we could fill when he is being respectful, ignoring and redirecting, a chart, etc.\u00a0 I told GC we should make up a choice board with three or four things the Roc can do on his own, then teach him to do those things for a set amount of time, eventually lengthening those times to try to get him to entertain himself.\u00a0 GC sighed with exhaustion.\u00a0 Then I started to wonder aloud about food.\u00a0 Is there something he is eating that he is intolerant to?\u00a0 Because we see a change with strawberries.\u00a0 He will go months without eating them and then we think,  maybe it was in our heads? , and we let him eat strawberries, with disastrous behavioral results. So an elimination diet is in our future.\u00a0 As well as some reading about homeopathy and a visit to a homeopathic clinic I\u2019ve been reading about.\u00a0 I have a need to explore some other options before I start to think about opening up that pill bottle on my dresser.\u00a0 Because after a few days like these, cooped up in the house, with lots of screaming, that bottle starts to look very inviting. *** Later this afternoon the Roc sat outside the office door as I emailed with an autism mama friend about the clinic/drugs/autism, and we had the following conversation that shows just how hard these unstructured/unexpected days are for the Roc: \u201cMoooommmyyy, I feel kind of different today.\u00a0 I don\u2019t feel like I usually do.\u00a0 I feel kind of weird and I don\u2019t know why.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t know why, but I feel kind of different today.\u00a0 I think my brain is all messed up.\u201d \u201cYou know what is different about today?\u00a0 This is the first day in a very, very long time that we didn\u2019t have something scheduled.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t have school or any \u201cspecials.\u201d (he calls anything scheduled that isn\u2019t school a \u201cspecial.\u201d)\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have to go anywhere, and you did leave the house to go skating, but I didn\u2019t even leave the house today.\u00a0 Today was just a do whatever kind of day.\u201d \u201cMommy\u2026ugh, it just doesn\u2019t feel right today.\u00a0 Guess what? my brain\u2019s all messed up.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think your brain is all messed up Roc.\u00a0 Not at all.\u201d \u201cUgh, well you\u2019ve been sitting on your bed for a long time and that\u2019s not what you usually do\u2026.Ugh!\u00a0 Today is\u2026today is just NOT fun!\u201d \u201cI think today was fun, it just wasn\u2019t scheduled out and we were not busy\u2026but it\u2019s been hard for you huh?\u201d \u201cYes!\u00a0 Today was NOT FUN!\u201d *** A little slice of our weekend.\u00a0 These breaks from routine are not easy on the Roc, on any of us!\u00a0 His conversation with me this afternoon was a reminder of how much the Roc struggles with the every day.\u00a0 It shows me how far he\u2019s come, (he can tell me what he\u2019s feeling! HUGE!) and it shows me what we need to work on to try to make him comfortable in his own skin.

{"date": "December 30, 2013", "body": "The word balance was something I pondered all year long in 2013.\u00a0 It was my word.\u00a0 I kept reading it, seeing it, hearing it, thinking it, practicing it.\u00a0 I thought about it in regards to most aspects of my life.\u00a0 My time, how I spent it, what I focused on, what I gave priority to.\u00a0 Time for me, the Roc, and GC.\u00a0 Time for friends.\u00a0 I paused many times this year to try to find the balance in my relationships, as well as my own emotions regarding those relationships.\u00a0 My anger, my sadness, my grief, my frustration.\u00a0 I let myself feel them all this year, and I tried hard not to get stuck in the rabbit hole for too long.\u00a0 I thought about balance in terms of money, how I managed our family budget and also the Roc\u2019s budget and services.\u00a0\u00a0 I thought about balance everyday with the Roc.\u00a0 Being the mom and being the therapist.\u00a0 Being a caretaker and being Kim.\u00a0 How much to push, how much to play, how much to teach.\u00a0 How much therapy is too much?\u00a0 I thought about balancing my diet and how much I exercise, and how running keeps my mind more balanced.\u00a0 I did a bit of yoga and found myself thinking a lot about balance as I literally balanced on one leg. The word revealed itself to me over and over again, and I found myself whispering it over and over again throughout the year. Balance is something I am going to keep being mindful of in 2014 because there are things in my life that are still unbalanced. We are a work in progress. When I think ahead to 2014 the words  peace  and  let go  keep showing themselves.\u00a0 Keeping the peace, finding time to be still and content, finding some peace within myself for mistakes I\u2019ve made, and especially being at peace with things I cannot change.\u00a0 The last one is huge for me.\u00a0 There is so much I cannot change.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s the holidays, the images I see online of my friends and how happy they all seem to be, and how our Christmas day was not picture perfect.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s the weather, being stuck inside that clogs my brain, stirs up the longings of my soul.\u00a0 But lately I feel the differences of my little family are amplified in my mind.\u00a0 Our differences have affected every aspect of my life, whether I work and contribute financially to this family, how I parent, who I know, how we spend our time and celebrate holidays, my friendships, and my relationships with family.\u00a0 So much good has come from our differences.\u00a0 I feel a strength and a depth I had never known, and I am richly blessed by the people in my life. But I still need to let go. Accept. Find peace with the situations that are not as I had hoped or dreamed.\u00a0 It is my biggest personal challenge right now.\u00a0 The lesson I am working through. So as I continue to balance, both arms stretched out, my hands in two worlds, I am going to work to find peace for myself in 2014. And let go.

{"date": "November 7, 2014", "body": "We went camping up north the first weekend of October.\u00a0 The weather was\u00a0 pleasant enough on our first day, but it turned ugly that night.\u00a0 Rain on and off, the temperature kept dropping, and the wind picked up as the weekend wore on.\u00a0 We still had fun and (most) of us (the Roc and I) were prepared with cold weather gear\u2026.ahem GC is wearing shorts in this pic, though you obviously cannot tell\u2026 I was glad I bought the dog a fleece sweatshirt, even though I felt ridiculous buying it.\u00a0 He appreciated it. The Roc was happy to get out of school for two days and go to some of his favorite places.\u00a0 Waterfalls! The windchill was definitely well below freezing on our second to last morning and the Roc looked like this in his sleeping bag while GC and I were getting breakfast together so we decided to head home a day early.\u00a0 It was COLD.\u00a0 We stopped by some waterfalls on the way home, which made the Roc happy. Coming home a day early meant we were back in time for the Roc to skate in the Special Hockey open skate down at the University of Minnesota. He thought everything Goldy the Gopher did was funny, but he still didn\u2019t want to talk to him. *** The location of the Roc\u2019s hippotherapy changed when the therapist got a new job at a gorgeous camp.\u00a0 The indoor ring is awesome with lots of seating so I can watch him ride, there is a little black kitten who always comes and sleeps on my lap, and the trails are beautiful.\u00a0 The Roc loves the trail ride portion of his lesson (which will be ending now that winter is almost here.) *** My mom had a birthday and the Roc LOVES to celebrate birthdays so he picked out a cake at the grocery store and insisted we bring it to Grandma.\u00a0 I need more pictures of the Roc and my mom, they have a special connection.\u00a0 Both my parents are wonderful to the Roc. *** My parents and I took the Roc hiking one day.\u00a0 The fall colors were gorgeous. The Roc likes to geocache with his Grandpa.\u00a0 When I asked him if he wanted me to buy a gps so we could go geocaching he said, \u201cBut we do that with Grandpa.\u201d\u00a0 Yup, we do. We went a little farther off the trail than we should have on this afternoon and didn\u2019t end up finding the \u201ctreasure\u201d as the Roc calls it because my dad and I were a little worried we might fall of the earth. Even though we didn\u2019t find what we were looking for, and the Roc complained bitterly, the scenery made up for it. A whole forest of yellow maples in the late afternoon sun.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t get over the golden color. *** Towards the end of October I met up with my best friend Christa for our annual get-a-way!\u00a0 We spent the first two days walking around colonial Williamsburg, taking house tours and learning a lot about the revolutionary period. We also walked around Jamestown which was fascinating. We had a really great time chatting, eating, laughing, catching up, and learning all about colonial times. Before dropping me off at the airport we stopped by a plantation and took the tour. After all our touring, listening, and reading museum placards on our trip I suggested that next year we spend a few days laying on a beach somewhere reading trashy novels.\u00a0 No learning allowed.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see what happens next fall\u2026 *** Something I didn\u2019t take many pictures, and I really should have, was all the decorating the Roc did for Halloween.\u00a0 As soon as it was October 1st he was allowed to talk about the October holiday (not that he refrained from talking about it since his birthday was over in early August, but I had good reason to tell him that I wouldn\u2019t talk about it until October 1st-my sanity)\u00a0 The Roc loves Halloween and proclaims it to be his favorite holiday.\u00a0 He wanted to decorate with the few decorations we have, buy more decorations, and then when I wouldn\u2019t buy as many as he wanted, we made one, and then over the month he made many, many more.\u00a0 He also really wanted a Halloween pinata, I think so he could get more candy. Like most parents we ended the month of October with pumpkins, trick-or-treating, and lots of candy. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2025.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2037.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2077.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2126.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2148.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2195.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2220.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2249.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_22601.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/2014-10-11-16-43-22.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/2014-10-11-16-47-53.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/2014-10-12-18-10-33.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2302.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2288.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2278.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2353.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2339.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2346.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2372.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2428.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2395.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2385.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2390.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2438.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2449.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2468.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2479.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2484.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2560.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2540.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/2014-10-31-16-26-24.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2503.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2555.jpg", "https://therocchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_2559.jpg"], "link": "https://therocchronicles.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/october-in-pictures/", "title": "October in Pictures"}
