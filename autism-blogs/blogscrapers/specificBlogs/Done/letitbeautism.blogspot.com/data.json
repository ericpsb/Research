{"date": "Thursday, March 6, 2014", "body": "\nAs these frustrating, challenging, and often rewarding teen years pass with Casey, I try to reflect on the \"rewarding\" part more than anything.  You know the ol' saying, \"You gotta laugh for cryin'.\" ?  Well, I do that a lot, and along with laughing, I also try to be a glass half full kind of gal. \n \nCall me delusional, call me unrealistic, but don't call me late for dinner!  There are definite advantages and rewards to having a teen with Autism, and as hard as that is for many to believe, I think by the time you read this post, you will want to adopt one!\u2026 Ok, now I am being delusional, but hear me out.  Let me just share these advantages with you! \n \nFirst off \n-  Clothing! This is a biggie. Clothes are exceptionally important to teens, boys and girls a like.  Sometimes, I see teenage guys verging on being mini metrosexuals, and it's charming and creepy at the same time!  From what I hear, a certain brand of t-shirt can cost upwards of 30.00 bucks, and that's all a kid will wear!  Skinny jeans only please, and of course footwear is outrageous, and must be a specific brand, or your frieds WILL disown you.  \nBut not with Casey! I can go to Walmart and grab a stack of $7 t-shirts, and as long as there is NO TAG, he's good with them.  Jeans?  Who needs jeans?  Well, Casey would look dashing in some, but having trouble with the button and fly kinda forces me to seek out the coolest sweats I can find.  \"Cool\" and \"sweats\" dont' really go together, but I try, and you can get 'em real cheap, and Casey doesn't care!  He also doesn't want his pants to hang on purpose, thats a huge bonus! My only clothing challenge is finding things appropriate for his 6'4, 240 lb frame.  That's enough, fashion and trendiness be damned. \n \n-  Taking and Picking up!  Not a lot of that going on at all, thank GOD!  Casey has a small group of people he calls \"friends\".  There are kids in his school I believe he considers friends, one or two imparticular he's known his whole scholastic career.  One his oldest and dearest comes over after school once a week and they hang in his room playing their various devices.  I hear conversation but not much, but they are happy.  He doesn't ask me to take him and a group to the mall, no one is calling to have Casey over to their house so I'm not running him over to anyones and picking up.  This may sound sad to you the reader, but, it is what it is, and because of it, I'm not tearing my hair out planning with other parents who's taking and whose picking up. From all accounts, this sort of activity can be a bit much, and I'm glad I don't have to deal. \n \n-  Friends in general.  Would I give my left arm if Casey had some good friends to do things with?  Yes!  I'm not fooling myself, a normal social life is something that I quietly long for for him.  But, I don't think he longs for it himself, in fact I'm sure of it.  Casey is happy with he, himself, and his.  DOn't get me wrong, he gets a kick out of seeing kids he knows at various events, and as mentioned, at school, but his homelife is his, and he's much more of a loner, like a lot of \"typical\" people I know.  He doesn't get hung up on not getting invited to events, he doesn't get sad because someone didn't call him, or a friend talked to another friend about him.  He doesn't care if so and so is getting together without him.  He is a happy kid, and the interactions he has seem to satisfy him.  I hope to promote more in the future, if he's down with it. \n \n-Boyfriend/girlfriend stuff  Aaaccckkkk  So glad I don't have this to deal with, currently anyway.  Although Casey does ask questions about things of a sexual nature here and there and has asked me if  I  was his girlfriend, thats about it.  He isn't texting girls, no one is \"sexting\" him.  No little snotty chick is cursing him for not acting a certain way to her, no one is breaking his heart, at least not right now.  He just doesn't get the whole thing, and seemingly, doesn't care.   \n \n-Cell phones!  Casey doesn't want a cell phone.  Ok, let me take that back.  He wants MY cell phone in the car to watch youtube videos.  Casey doesn't want to text, and he definitley doesn't want to talk on the phone, at least not for very long, try giving him a call (but call mine, because, as mentioned, he doens't have one).  I don't have to worry about lost phones, huge bills, and all that come with teen cell phone use.  Nice! \n \n-Maturity level and innocence.  Now, this may come off as the most pathetic or sad part of this post, but hear me out.  How many times have parents of teens bemoaned the fact that their kids have grown up, how they miss that little kid they once had?  Well, in some ways, I still can enjoy the childish innocence that seems to vaporize the moment they hit thirteen.  Casey is still very immature, he still watches \"Sprout\", he's comfortable not being cool, he wants to sit on my lap (which ain't happening), he still needs me at night to lay with him so he can go to sleep.  I still get those lovely kiddie moments, even into his teens.  I know they will go away eventually, but, I get to enjoy them longer.  He still calls \"mommy\" at fifteen.  Sniff sniff\u2026 I love that! \n \n-Hanging out.  Now what I mean by \"hanging out\" is being with friends in situations that aren't supervised by ME!  And not to say that kids are always up to no good, but they do things and they try things when you aren't around.  I never have to worry about Casey calling me up from a friend's guaranteeing me their parents are home when they aren't.  He isn't going to lie to me and tell me that he's going over to Fred's when he's really going over to Betty's.  He won't be in that pack of kids I see at the rec center every Friday night, picking fights and doing stuff with eachother that would make their parents hair stand on end if they had hidden cameras on the walls.  I always know where he is, and who he is with.  Yeah, it may be sad to you, he has no \"life\" so to speak if this isn't happening.  I tend to disagree.  This is luxurious to me! \n \nSo, have I sold ya?  Do you believe me when I say there are rewards and advantages to having these rascals in your home?  Well, even if you aren't ready to run out and grab your own Autistic teen, at least I have mine, and I wouldn't give him up for the world! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LjKYIJZiQ3Y/UxiMX45fXtI/AAAAAAAAAk8/zpwFG5Wj8Fg/s1600/1011823_10201241124328219_999005941_n.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2014/03/really-its-great-to-have-teen-with.html", "title": "\nReally, it's Great to have a Teen with Autism!\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 20, 2012", "body": "\nDespite our sadness, shock, and anger over the horrendous massacre that occurred in Newtown, CT. this past week, Bill and I find ourselves watching the unending news coverage, usually later at night after Casey has gone to bed, when there's not much else on to distract us.  CNN seems to be the channel of choice for our viewing, with Piers Morgan berating gun supporters and Anderson Cooper shedding a genuine tear after reflecting on one of the twenty little kids that lost their life.  So depressing.  We ask why we watch, but we do.   \n \nAnderson Cooper has made a big point of not discussing the shooter, Adam Lanza, out of respect for those whose lives he stole, and so that the desperate people who might be in his same mental zone won't feel any sort of admiration for what he did. Any over discussion of this guy could backfire. \n \nIn light of reports that this kid was Aspergers, he's been getting a lot of thought and attention in my brain, and in the Autism community.  Letters have been published from various Autism groups explaining that people with Autism are more likely to be victims of violence rather than be the creators of violence. I have to believe his issues didn't stop at the supposed Aspergers speculation.  Bipolar?  ODD?  Who knows.  The Aspergers has made the news. \n \nWe are told he was a loner, played a lot of violent video games, and was homeschooled later in his life.  His family was split, parents divorced, as a result of his issues, I don't know.  His mom didn't like leaving him alone yet she did, in a house with guns easily accessible.  All these elements, the alleged Aspergers, the love of violence, family unrest... how did they affect this kid?  What did it all do to him to cause him to crack as he did, in such a horrific and tragic way? \n \nI kinda hate when people personalize such events, make it all about themselves.  I'm not trying to do this here.  But, the Autism aspect of this situation causes me to speculate and worry. \n \nWhat about our Casey?  He's not \"Aspergers\", whatever that really means nowadays, if it means anything anymore as some reports have sited.  But, his Autism sparks thoughts and concerns that I didn't have before all these people were killed. \n \nHe's fourteen now, and he's hormonal.  He has outbursts of anger sometimes that are a little scary.  He can  get a little physical, which can be scary too, considering his height and girth.  His frustrations lie in, I believe, his inability to find the words sometimes to express how he is feeling in the moment.  I hate to see it, especially since he's always been a mild mannered kid.  Lanza was only twenty years old.  Had he been violent as a teen as well? \n \nCasey's social life is less than wonderful at school.  He tells me that kids tell him to \"back off\"  and \"personal space, Casey!\".  When I asked him what one of his lunch mates and he talk about, he said the boy just bosses him around and tells him to eat his sandwich.  FUN, huh?  Casey's social skills are lacking to be sure, but he wants to have friends.  Walking up and smelling peoples hair, getting in their faces, as he tends to do, but not in a forceful way, and trying to touch their ears don't really go over well.  We work on these things constantly at home and at school, but in the moment, abstaining from such actions don't occur to him. The one boy he has taken a liking to has reportedly decided not to be friendly anymore, even though Casey, in his sweet way, won't accept it.  I'm betting Adam Lanza was the same. His loner status confirmed by many can almost guarantee that. How did Adam's lack of friends and social life affect his brain, how did it play a role in his breakdown?  How will it affect Casey someday? \n \nWhen horrific things happen, your life can't stop.  I can't stop sending Casey to school because I'm afraid of copycat events.  In the same vein, I must not over analyze Adam Lanza and freak myself out about Casey's future.   \n \nI must take solace in the fact that Bill and I aren't divorced, like Adam's parents, nor are we planning on being so.  We are a strong and supportive force in Casey's life, usually on the same wave length, and helping the other get their heads straight when one of us is out of sorts on things (this is usually Bill helping me get my head straight).  We have never let Casey play with guns or play video games with shooting.  He doesn't have any interest anyway, thank God. His violent tendencies, if you want to call them that, only come about during moments of frustration, usually with me trying to get him to do something he doesn't want to do.  He's even started to tell me he needs to ride his exercise bike during such times, taking it up on himself to regulate his feelings the best way he knows how, and it almost always helps. We involve him in many activities that lend themselves to social interaction outside of the school setting. We try to do as much as we can to help in this area.  We do the best we can, and that's all we can do. \n \nI hope that we are doing everything and more that Adam Lanza's parents didn't. \n \n \n \n \n, \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cqx-lUjlDSA/UNMR5Oe_UFI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/yY5zt22u8rc/s1600/IMG_0580.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2012/12/despite-our-sadness-shock-and-anger.html", "title": "\nLike Comparing Apples and Oranges....\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 31, 2012", "body": "\nI believe I have said \"I'm done, I'm done, I'm done!\" at least four times a day for the last two weeks, to whoever is listening.  It's usually Casey, or one of three felines in earshot.  None of them seem to understand, or care. \n \nWhat brings me to repeat my mantra of negativity, either under my breath, or occasionally at the top of my lungs (purely for effect of course)?  I can say with confidence, it is this two week lull between camp and school's start!   \n \nI am quite aware of the overall angst and irritation many parents of both children lacking in Autism and those who are heartily full of it, are feeling at this point in time.  It's a long summer.  \n \nI have had to totally rearrange my work, which really translates into, working odd hours and weekends, and taking the rest of my vacation time.  I don't mind this, especially the time off, but... but, well, it's hard sometimes.   \n \nI've always been down on whiney Autism parents, which is nasty and mean on my part.    I know people have struggles with their Autie kids, a lot worse than mine, but in the minds of the majority, even my problems seem gargantuan, and as such, I never liked to give into the potential for pity.  So, I never make a big stink about Casey's issues on a regular basis with regular friends and acquaintences. \n \nHowever, indulge me for a moment, while I wallow, and I'll say it again!  It's hard sometimes, time off I mean, and I have to say that Autism makes time off twenty times harder! \n \nI know at this point anyone with an Autie kid is saying \"Amen, sista!\".  They can relate.  Anyone reading this with \"normal\" children are saying \"Oh come on, we have our troubles too!\" I'm not trying to be elitist in my Autism specific angst, but it's harder.  Take my word for it! \n \nWhat makes summer lulls and general time off harder for Casey, and me?  Friends, or should I say, lack of, friends for him.  I don't think I'm the only one here that can say this.  Sure, at school and camp, Case has \"friends\" that he interacts with, and talks about at home.  But, he doesn't get calls from these friends, he doesn't get invited to overnights by these friends, or invited to join them on family vacations.  He doesn't have a couple of buds to go out and cruise the neighborhood on foot with, or ride their bikes together to the rec center for basketball or a swim.  Geeze, I don't even let him scooter around the block by himself yet. I am his friend, and my husband when not at work is his friend.  Yeah, I could set up social situations, but damn, it would nice to have something happen organically, not orchestrated and monitored.  Having friends makes all the difference.  Hell, I would love if he could have friend over without me having to facilitate interaction.  But, that's not happenin' right now.  \n \nWhat else is making this summer lull so tough?  Casey in general.  I love him with all my heart, he is the light of our lives.  But he is almost fourteen.  He is hormonal, he is tall, he is strong, he is overly touchy and wants to smell me, ALL THE TIME (yes, I said smell me).  He is stubborn, he is demanding, he is picky, he is moody.  He is addicted to computer, something we battle with him about a lot.  He is naughty, but in a way he would be if he had guy friends to sit in someones basement with and joke about things with, parent free.  But I am hearing these naughty things, and I'm not enjoying them at all, coming from the mouth of my once little, sweet boy.  Case has a lot of strong points too, but I'm wallowing, so I don't feel like extolling his virtues right now. \n \nAnd so, four more days linger between my buddy and I hanging out and the beginning of his journey into high school, not that I'm counting. Despite all I've written here,  it's really bittersweet for me right now.  I'm trying my best to keep him entertained, without killing him, or a cat, and yet as the minutes tick by, the thought of putting him on a bus full of high school students for the first time sickens me with worry.  I'm in a soup of emotion, and that doesn't help matters one bit.   \n \nAnd with new lulls, and worries, and joys forever in our futures, I will end this self indulgent rant with my positive mantra.  \"This too shall pass.\"   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U2lH0Q5mHn4/UEDGDEFRRTI/AAAAAAAAAi4/z1HkJHXQUt8/s1600/465664_4413440692218_163333683_o.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2012/08/im-done-im-done-im-done.html", "title": "\nI'm Done, I'm Done, I'm Done\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 1, 2012", "body": "\n \nWe're having our transitional IEP today.  This means, I'm coming together with Casey's present school staff, and his future  high school  staff, and blindly making plans for his next scholastic year. \n \nIt seems like just yesterday, I was nervously planning for him to go to his middle school, in a cross categorical setting for the first time, changing classes.  And now, he's moving on after what we feel were two rocky but clearly beneficial years there.  Casey has come a long way in certain ways, gone back in others, stayed stubbornly the same in some, and has many skills yet to emerge. \n \nI feel a little ashamed that I don't have a legal pad page full of ideas, demands, and thoughts to bring up with me today.  But then I've always been a play it by ear sort of mom.  I do have the tremendous crutch of my dear friend being there with me today; she is a very experienced advocate who knows the laws and rules up and down, and how to play the game.  Maybe that's why I haven't gotten too nervous about this one.  And if I think from the perspective that my main goal is setting him up for success, it makes things a lot easier. \n \nI know for sure I'm going to  demand  physical activity beyond gym class be part of his IEP.  It's a must for this boy, who only sits still if he has a computer or some other electronic device of interest in front of him.  Casey needs walks, jumps, whatever kind of good propreoceptive input he can get, and it seems this need gets stronger the older he gets.  Sitting in a classroom for 45 minutes at time just isn't in his makeup.  Sometimes I have to wonder if it's in any kids, and those that seems to be able, how much are they really taking in? \n \nI also feel he still needs a one on one para. Someone not there to hover, but to make sure he doesn't disrupt class because he's not getting the aforementioned movement breaks. Someone to steer him in the right direction. Someone to make sure he comes out of the bathroom and doesn't walk down to the cafeteria when it's not time for lunch. Little things like that, someone to work on an individual basis with him.  This is another necessity. \n \nI might throw out too the need for an Alpha Smart, although they seem to poo poo this every year, but I think I'm going to take a stand on this one this year, siting his ability to get his thoughts out much better via keyboard then struggling to write them.  Yes, for sure the Alpha Smart. \n \nI'd also like to bring up that I want him to be happy, anxiety free, not bullied, have all the kids act nice to him and include him in everything they do, get really good grades, take in all that is presented to him, behave at all times, participate readily in class, and get straight \"A\"s....  \n \nYes, I know, dream on.  But if I'm lucky, and if we do things right, I don't know why some of that can't come true! \n \nPS Now that he's 5'10, and he's only thirteen, perhaps the bullying isn't even a consideration! \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j2Em2uP9vsk/T5_lT91q1bI/AAAAAAAAAiU/GnVnLE63_vg/s1600/381153_2907286799312_1174800152_33150502_660177469_n.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2012/05/another-year-come-and-gone.html", "title": "\nAnother Year, Come and Gone\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 3, 2012", "body": "\nCasey came home from school today just full of conversation, which is always a joy!  However, today's conversation was troubling to be sure, and his sudden disconnects after telling me a few tid bits and stating a few thoughts doesn't help matters. \n \nFirst came the revelation that the kids on the bus told Casey they were going to church after he got off the bus, at least according to Casey.  Also, he said they then told him that him they were all going back to school after that.  He wasn't sure why, and he seemed confused.  I'm pretty sure these kids were screwing with him, or, they were talking amongst themselves being silly, and Casey overheard their conversation. \n \nHoping the latter, I couldn't help but think back on the stories my wonderful friend and neighbor told me about her oldest son with Aspergers, and how the kids at school would mess with him, him getting into trouble because they coercsed him into doing things he didn't know were wrong, all for the sake of being part of a group of friends.   \n \nIt made me think, that, if in fact the kids on the bus were messing with Casey, telling him tales out of school, how easily lead he was, and how scary that is.  It made me angry too, especially when he continued on. \n \n\"I don't want parents to die!  I like it when my parents aren't dead!\".  That line hit me like a punch in the stomach.  \"Who said that to you Casey, the kids on the bus?  Did they say that your parents would die?\"  I inquired immediately, feeling foolish after the words came out, knowing sometimes you can totally sway his answers with your questions.  \"No.  I don't remember!\" he replied, hugging me tight as he said it. \n \nMy conspiracy theory mind envisioned the little brats on the bus telling a sweet and guilable Casey that his parents were going to DIE!  Little BASTARDS!  I then took a deep breath, hugged him back and told him had nothing to worry about, ending my inquisition about the bus brats.  I knew I had reached our conversation threshold, and he was ready for some computer time and a snack. \n \nThis experience probably isn't the first for Casey, but it is the first time he's relayed so much info about it to me.  I'm glad he did.  I find it hard to believe the bus driver didn't try to stop such shinanigans or at least let me know it was going on when I got him off the bus.  Then again, it's kid stuff, kids do this kind of stuff, especially Middle School kids. Plus the kids on Casey's bus also have impairments, disabilities, learning disabilities, whatever you want to call them. The average maturity level is even a bit lower than that of typical immature Middle Schoolers. \n \nSo how does one stop this sort of thing or make sure it doesn't get out of hand, short of taking him off the bus, whihc he seems to enjoy?  Well, tell me!  I don't know!!!... \n \n \nHa, you thought I would have an answer didn't you!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2012/02/casey-came-home-from-school-today-just.html", "title": "\nBus Brewhaha\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 15, 2012", "body": "\nAnother school year has come and gone.  It seems looking back on my blog that the last days of school seem to be a popular time for me to write an installment, probably due to the emotional nature of what the end of the school year represents.    \n \nSadness, for me, that my once little boy has now made it through yet another year, this being his eighth grade year.  Pride at the thought of him being on the honor roll his last 2 years of middle school in some capacity, almost every semester. Happiness because of his burgeoning social skills, that I feel have been a product of his being in a cross categorical classroom as opposed to an Autistically Impaired room. Relief that I don't have to hear him gripe in the morning about not wanting to go to school for at least 3 months.  Anticipation of the fun he'll have this summer at camp.  It's just emotion city around here, for me, and him. \n \nCasey will be going to high school next year.  He's not happy about it, not at all. And despite our attempts at making him familiar with the school he'll attend, and making him aware of the fact that he knows so many of the kids he'll be with, he tells me almost daily that he doesn't want to go to high school.  His anxiety has never been higher. \n \nIt doesn't help that he had a wonderful parapro, again, this year, who he loved.  He came off the bus after his last day, teary eyed and I knew it was because he had to say goodbye to his beloved Mrs. D..  He grew attached to many of the kids in his class, who, unfortunately, are 7th graders, who won't be moving on with him (and trying to tell him or show him that they'll be there in 2013 doesn't help now in the moment).  And on top of everything else, it's another transition.  I can tell you, that he was probably just getting comfortable with his middle school mid year of 8th grade.  I'm sure it takes him that long, and now, it's done, and everything will change for him again.  Although he's pretty resilient for having Autism, I think changes in the big picture are the hardest for Casey to deal with, and a big change this will be.  \n \nIn situations like this, I always recall Kirstin, his teacher from preschool, saying to me, \"Casey will always rise to the occasion.\"  That line has popped into my brain so many times. She'd be a rich woman if I had to give her a buck every time it did!  But it's somehow become a mantra for me, and it has held true in so many situations, be it starting at a a new school, participating in a circus class, or taking a trip to the dentist or the barber. \n \nAnd now, I have to repeat that mantra, each time my tummy ties in knots at the thought of him getting off that bus in front of a giant high school in September for the first time, or thinking of him walking the halls amongst bigger, older, typical kids.  I have to say it to myself even when he gets upset about his friends not coming with him, and how he hopes Mrs. D. will be there (even though I'm pretty sure she won't be, although there always a minute chance such a thing could happen). \n \nYes, I'll have to repeat this mantra over and over this summer.  I have to make myself realize that he'll find new people to become interested in, reunite with old ones, hopefully charm the teachers the way he always has, and be the best he can be, with my help and that of others, that I have to trust will be there for him. He'll rise to the occasion as he always does. \n \nBut for now, I'm just gonna let him enjoy his first free day from school and only think about what we'll do later and over the weekend.  High school is in the distant future, and his last day of middle school is in the past.  Now is now, and we're going to rise to the occasion and enjoy it!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-w5G9d042ko0/T9uZJF_t3vI/AAAAAAAAAik/ORTiruh4KH0/s1600/d36857e2b72611e1a8761231381b4856_5.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2012/06/rising-to-occasion.html", "title": "\nRising to the Occasion\n"},
{"date": "Monday, December 5, 2011", "body": "\nI've never, ever liked the bumper stickers people have on their, of course, bumpers that read \"My Child is an Honor Roll Student at Whatever School\".  They didn't have those back in my school days, and my mom would never have put it on her car's bumper to begin with (\"Bumper stickers are trashy!\" she would say.)  I always felt they were a bit braggish, and extremely corny.  I have to admit when some smart ass came up with the \"My kid can kick your Honor Student's ass\" bumper stickers in rebellion, I enjoyed those a little more, but they were even trashier! \n \nHaving said that, I just put a \"window cling\" (a much classier option than a bumper sticker someone has decided) that reads \"My Child is an Honor Roll Student at F---- Middle School\" in the rear window of my company car (hope the boss never notices).  Casey brought the \"cling\" home along with a nifty black ribbon that said the same and a letter from the principal extolling the virtues of our magnificent student who maintained a B+ average this first marking period.  I am beaming with pride, and thus felt so inclined to apply the \"cling\" to the let world know he is in fact, on the Honor Roll! \n \nMy whole mindset it seems, has changed, I'm realizing more and more over the past several months.  The \"cling\" represents the different outlook I have on Casey.  Gone are the days of Autism Awareness ribbons slapped on the back of my car for all the world so to see.  I want the world to see we have an Honor Roll Student in my car, and not someone they should pity, or be curious of or worse, be frightened of. \n \nI want people to know we have a boy who has been on a soccer league, a baseball league, taken dance and briefly, piano lessons.  I want people people to know that our boy can skate with full hockey gear on, that he swims on a swim team and has won ribbons for doing so. It doesn't matter what kind of league, or team, it just matters that he's done them.  I want people to know he creates brilliant animated shorts on the computer and can write stories, and can comprehend what he reads, and understands what is said to him.  I want people to know he's hilarious.   \n \nYes, the colorful Autism Awareness ribbons are gone.  I don't want his Autism to define him at all, and in fact, I don't want to define Autism anymore to people when they learn somehow he has it. Frankly, I don't even care to use the word \"Autism\" unless it's absolutely necessary.  I'm not ashamed to use it, but  I have never known a word that can suck the life out of a situation or conversation like Autism often does. You may or may not understand that but trust me.  I might get some flack for that one, but it's my blog. \n \nAnd so, my joy and pride in applying my cling, despite my former feelings on honor roll student advertisements, may be more acceptable and better understood now. He is a person on the honor roll and so,so much more! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2011/12/say-it-loud-and-say-it-proud.html", "title": "\nSay it Loud and Say it Proud!\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 29, 2013", "body": "\nI'm not going to wax poetic about how long it's been since my last post!  In my head, my last post was yesterday, but I just didn't type it out.  I always have fodder for this blog, I compose it in my brain, and then it drifts off like a gentle fog into the dark crevices of my psyche.  This morning I have a few extra moments to actually take the time to type and I'm gonna! \n \nCasey is fifteen now.  FIFTEEN!  He is 6'3 or 4 (he's probably grown an inch since I dropped him off at school), he weights 226 lbs too much... I'll allow you to finish your gasp...and he is every bit a teenager now. \n \nWhere shall I begin my litany of how much a teenager is he?  Shall we start with school?  Yes, lets. \n \nHe's a Sophomore now and his Sophomore year started out bumpy, despite my attempts at making his day as pleasurable and easy breezy as I had the power to make it.  First issue, he HAS to have some academics in his schedule!  So unfair! (I am saying this all fasciously, in case you the reader aren't used to my dry wit)  My goal was to bring back the days of preschool la la land for him in some way, just so he would want to go to school! But just as I can't keep him from growing an inch a week, I also cannot make every part of his school day happy dappy do!  He can do academics on some level, but to me most academics serve him no purpose, so why put him through the strains of having to sit through academic classes? But, since he can't take gym twice a day, academics were added to his schedule.  Whatever! \n \nSo, he has three \"academic\" classes.  Math, which is extremely remedial and more life skills oriented, the class that he seems to act out the most in, but it's the first class of the day.  Science, which is taught by the bubbly girls track team coach.  And Basic Computers, which he excels in, but finds himself in a bit of trouble occasionally due to his social endeavors with the other students.  In addition to those classes, he has music, gym, and a course called Peer Connections where they do video modeling and soical group activities. Oh, and did I mention he has a one on one parapro all day?  His own little grandma away from home no less? Easy breezy indeed! \n \nDespite all of this cush, there are  always issues, there's always arguing about going to school in the morning, there are always fights at night about going to bed, there is always backlash at doing the little bits of homework they send home because he didn't finish it at school.  There are always at least 4 battles a day, despite his seemingly smooth schedule. \n \nHe is a TEENAGER. \n \nAnd these battles are just the school oriented ones!  Don't get me started on the battles over computer time, getting him to work out, getting him to bath, getting him to wash his hands after peeing, getting him to.... sigh, the list goes on. \n \nCasey is in the deep murky mire of teenagerdom.  \n \nAnd do get me started actually, that way, I will continue to type thoughts instead of brain farting them away!  I have so many, and they're pretty entertaining! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IBmUXxvxf14/Um-x8nHlHmI/AAAAAAAAAkc/GuaF9oT16HA/s1600/IMG_0001.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2013/10/hes-such-teenager.html", "title": "\nHe's Such a Teenager\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 9, 2011", "body": "\nI'm just going to pretend that 3 months and lots of stuff didn't pass by, and that my blog is completely current and up to date!  I ask that you do the same! This was just one of those weekends.  Bill started out coming down with the flu on Friday, and this is the real flu, not a stomach virus.  He's had the chills, aches, pains, coughing, you name it.  He swiftly retired to the boudoir after getting home from work and has pretty much been there since.  Casey and I kept a respectful distance, and I washed hands profusely!  Loading up on Vitamin C, I was confident I wouldn't be affected. The weekends are sorta hard enough, trying to keep Casey off the computer and busy.  The extreme cold doesn't help and the cancellation of plans due to Bill's illness doesn't help either!  So, I took the \"glass half full' attitude and decided I would entertain Casey on my own and make his weekend fun.  No worries. But, when I woke up Saturday morning, that familiar tickle in my throat began to irritate, alerting me to an oncoming sickness.  I plowed through the day in denial, taking Case for a workout, to lunch, to the library.  However, as I stood watching him making his selections in the video section, I knew Bill had breathed on me too much!  Damn Bill!  How dare he breathe! My body started to ache and an itchy, irritating cough erupted from my sore throat.  Rushing Casey along, I told myself, it's just a cold, I'm fine.  Yeah.  I'm fine. Later that evening, Bill and I both sounded like we were hacking up a lung, and Bill was shivering with his robe, a hoodie, and sweat pants on under blankets.  The outlook for much more fun this weekend was grim. The night was sleepless, due to that lousy feeling, the cats making noise, and having drank diet Pepsi at lunch time!  (Yes, I'm old, caffeine effects me badly sometimes!)  Despite feeling like total crap today, I was still telling myself, I was okay.  I could get him out and do some things.  So what if I was shivering and I sounded like a lifetime smoker when I coughed!  I was cooool.   We ventured out again, to the pet shop, to Quiznos, and as I considered swimming, I told myself I really need to give up.  I felt like crap. I've been laying around ever since, shivering, coughing, feeling horrible.  Casey has been trying his hardest to be comforting, but couldn't fight the urge to come into the living room where I lay, griping about how this was not a fun weekend at all!  I apologized limply, feeling guilty that it wasn't, and slightly irritated at his lack of sympathy.  Why was I irritated by this, or surprised?  Tough emotion for kids, and especially those on the spectrum! Bill and I made a pact, as we lay side by side coughing, that we would make it up to him next weekend!....  Fingers crossed the 3,000 mg of Vitamin C a day I've been giving Case keeps this bug out of him!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2011/01/sickness-befalls-us.html", "title": "\nSickness Befalls Us....\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 8, 2010", "body": "\nWowzer!  I cannot believe we are 5 weeks into school and I have yet to post a single entry on my beloved  BLOG . The summer flew by pretty much without a hitch.  Camp was great, Casey loved it and really had a wonderful time.  We struggled with the last couple of weeks of no camp/no school to keep him tended to and busy.  But other than that, a really, really lovely summer was had by all! Having said that, I spent much time this summer, despite all the pleasantness, being a bit anxiety ridden over the approaching school year and what it had in store for our boy.  Going back through my previous posts, I noticed a huge lack of info regarding his 7th grade year.  I'm wondering if I was just avoiding the issue, or was being lazy, or both. If it was because I was avoiding the issue, that would be due to our big decision to put him in a new setting for his 7th grade year at a whole new school.  For years now, he's been in what is referred to in our district as an \"AI' program, or for all of you who have trouble with acronyms as I do, an \"Autistically Impaired\" program.  In short, usually a small group, 4 to 5 students with 2 paraprofessionals and a teacher.  This has been his life at school since he was about 1 and 1/2 years old.  It's very controlled, good in some ways, not good in others.  We have been lucky to have great teachers and paras.  The concept of the AI class for Casey was probably a bit of a mistake after about 4th grade.   But, and that's a big \"but\", he was safe, and worse yet, he was always the star of the show!  He was always the highest functioning in his group.  If I had had a \"Casey\" in his room with him, I would have been thrilled as a parent.   A dear friend of mine who is also my advocate, and in a way, a mentor in all things educationally related with our kids, was constantly pushing for her son to be in regular ed. based on all her vast knowledge on Inclusion she had gained from numerous conferences she's attended and books she has read.  I kept Casey in the AI, because I didn't go to a lot of conferences, I didn't read a lot of books.  He was safe in the AI rooms.  Was she nuts to send her guy out into the real world?  I think in hindsight, my friends belief that inclusion was the best thing for many of our kids was rubbing off on me, but not to the point that she was at. So, 5th and 6th grade came and went.  I got a bee in my bonnet, and forced some issues with him being in what is called the Cross Categorical classrooms  part of the day  then. This Cross Cat., for short, is a program for children who have varying \"disablitiies\" and not necessarily Autism.  They run the program pretty much like a regular ed. program, but with many modifications to help the kids get through the day on their terms.  I felt safe still, knowing that there were paras in that program as well.  And those kids weren't \"typical\" either.   But, it never really worked for him, especially in 5th grade, when there were just too many transitions, and a special ed. teacher, who believe it or not, admitted she had little knowledge on teaching children with Autism!  Going back and forth between AI and Cross Cat. with different rules and paces and kids was a lot for him to handle.  Not until they actually scheduled time with the Cross Cat. for all the AI kids did it ever really work for him.  Structure.  That's all it takes usually. And so, once I saw how well he was doing with being in Cross Cat. part of the day in the 6th grade, it hit me that perhaps it would work all the time, and that he needed the chance to experience this full time.  This decision became cemented in my brain after going to the Open House for the school he would be attending in 7th grade. Long story sorta short, I went, saw the same almost preschool like setting there, for 7th graders, that he had always been exposed to.  The kindly speech therapist showed me the reading curriculum they used, which was something he had done years and years ago.  He would go from one room, to another room all day with the same, mostly non verbal kids he was in class with now, while the other 7th graders traversed the faciltiy, going room to room, new experiences, new classes, new kids.  There were televisions in the corners of each of the rooms I saw, reminding me of all the notes that would come home during the years saying \"They got to watch a video today!\" way too much.  Was that going to happen there too?  One of the teachers from that program pointed out her \"time out\" area proudly.  Most classrooms don't have a \"time out\" area.  And when another family whose child was clearly typical, accidentally made their way into this classroom, they seemed almost mortified to find out from this teacher that it was \"a classroom for children with Autism, but you might get to  volunteer   to come down and be with them and read to them when school starts!\".  The family quickly made their way out.  My heart sank, and promises to myself were quickly made. With tears in my eyes, I told myself, and later that night, my dear and supportive hubby, that Casey was not going into another AI program.  He needed more. Casey would be in the Cross Categorical program at this new school, and he would start from the beginning of the year, and he would not transition from AI to Cross Cat. for part of the day, it would be  all  day!  I told Bill he was not to let me change my mind on this sudden and hard and scary decision.  He was all for it, and felt it was right too.   I quickly got in touch with my friend/advocate and told her of my plan.  She was in full support and guaranteed  me that we were going to make it happen, and that better yet, it would work, and that we would see that it did!   I was exhilerated with my new found courage and wherewithall, and scared out of my mind at the same time!  What was I doing to this boy who was about to go to a giant, new middle school?!  Second guessing myself became the norm........ to be continued...... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2010/10/time-flys-when-things-are-up-in-air.html", "title": "\nTime Flys When Things are Up in the Air!\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 18, 2010", "body": "\nThat's probably what a nurse or someone with considerable medical knowledge would ask me if they had to chance to see how I've handled Casey's being sick this weekend!  I'm such a loser sometimes when it comes to this stuff. The weekend started off with his acting tired when  we went to a festival with our dear friends and their dear children Friday night.  As we met and greeted them, we sat a at a table under a tent, discussing the eating and drinking situation, when I noticed Casey looking more than tired.  Being accused of over analyzing, I made a slight mention of this, but everyone agreed, and this was the first sign of impending sickness coming our way.  But (and this all goes back to the title of this post) we pushed on, and I got him a drink and a corn dog and we sat and socialized while he sat, slumped, sipping his drink and not eating his corn dog (don't worry, Mom ate it, couldn't let it go to waste!). Then we strolled looking at the crap, I mean craft booths (sorry RK), and he followed along, slowly but surely.  I've learned from past experience that the power of suggestion is very strong for Casey, so I kept quietly asking Bill if he looked okay to him.   If I made mention to the boy himself if he was feeling well, he would try in this strongest voice to say something to the effect of \"I'm not sick!  I like the festival!\".  When we'd seen all we could  he said he wanted to sit down.  I asked him if he wanted to sit down in our car and go home.  He quickly said \"Yes!\". The night, all night, he had a fever.  I laid with him most of the night, thinking puke might be in the future, trash can close at hand.  He tossed and turned and moaned and was just completely uncomfortable.  In the morning I had to run to Weight Watchers but promised him a bagel from Panera, 'cause that's what I would want after being sick with a fever all night.  Somewhere around that time, I thought that maybe I should be giving him some Motrin, but then, I've heard people temper children's fevers too quick and they don't have time to work and kill whatever infection might be causing the fever.  I heard that.  So, I shunned the Motrin.  You stay hot and miserable Casey, I'll be home with your delicious bagel later! I went to WW with another dear friend who is a wealth of information a) because she has 3 boys of varying ages and b)she actually reads.  Plus, she tends to errors on the side of caution.  She began quizzing me on his symptoms, asking if I had looked at his throat.  \"What was his temp?\" she asked.  \"I don't have a thermometer.\"  I answered, embarrassed that a thermometer hadn't been in our house since we had one of those nifty ear ones when he was a baby, and which had broken several years ago.  \"I'll let you borrow mine.\" she offered sweetly, probably thinking \"She has no thermometer?  Geeze.\" As the day progressed, and after giving Casey Motrin finally, he seemed much better.  He had been looking forward to a Ronald McDonald Magic Show going on at a local McDonald's (of all places).  I debated on whether I should take him.  The smarter half of my brain said \"don't\" while the \"oh, he's fine, and he needs to get out\" side of my head said \"do\".  My sister called in the midst of my decision making and she encouraged me to take him, because, he's spoiled and she didn't know the extent of his sickness.  And so, we did..... I know, idiot.  Oh, but it gets better. He was actually fine at McDonald's, and he thoroughly enjoyed the show, and even participated with ol' Ronald.  I then noticed that his hair was sweaty and his back clammy through his shirt.   Wow, shouldn't that have been a sign that he shouldn't be out? The Motrin was stopping it's magic.  We ate and ran after all was said and done.  We got home, and he still seemed okay.   It was a lovely day out and he wanted to go swimming.  Should I, I wondered again?  Maybe the pool would help with his fever..... out in the 90 degree sun you big idiot!  Well, so, my dumber side won again and off we went to the pool.  Stopping at 7-11 for a Slurpee was the clincher.   As I was paying, the cashier looked behind me and said \"Gosh buddy, I didn't know it was so cold in here!\" to which I turned to see an uncontrollably shivering Casey.  Was it the air conditioner in the store, or the Slurpee?  Or the fact that he was sick???????? We got in the car, and he's still shivering despite the rise in temperature coming out the door.  Get this one folks!  I continued to drive on to the pool!  Yes I did!  So we got there, and by then, his hand is shaking  with the Slurpee in it,he's shivering so hard.  But he's still imploring me to go swimming!   Finally, yes, finally, that common sense that seemed to be eluding me ALL day, popped in (especially after I called my smart friend and told her how stupid I had been and she sort of agreed kindly) and we went home. Well, he fell asleep under two comforters after I gave him more Motrin.  Guess he wasn't feeling well!  Duh...... He had a great rest of the evening, and we did too, even though we canceled plans to go out to a concert.  We  were  good parents that way! This morning, he woke feverish again, and threw up.  And now, he seems fine again.  But guess what, I'm not taking him  anywhere .   Not one place!  He's staying in the house the rest of the day, even if he's doing somersaults and reciting Shakespeare!  Pretty smart huh? Good parenting huh?  'Bout time! But in all fairness to me, although the boy is very verbal, he still has problems telling me how he feels, and that is further perpetuated by the fact that he is in denial when he is sick.  He will fight till the end, he hates being sick.  He could have his finger cut off  (God forbid ) and he wouldn't let me take him to the hospital.  I was trying to follow his cues instead of his symptoms, which was dumb, but, it's not the first time.  Hopefully, it  will   be the last\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/TEMh4J5S6FI/AAAAAAAAAf4/p8SexhMp-3k/s1600/5eb74b8ca6e9eba2.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2010/07/im-sorry-do-you-ever-use-your-brain.html", "title": "\nI'm Sorry, Do You Ever Use Your Brain?\"\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, December 20, 2009", "body": "\nWell, Casey's Christmas vacation started off early and with a bang!  But not a good bang. Friday was his last day of school, and as anyone can recall, the Friday before Christmas is usually fun and not overly productive.  Casey was looking forward to watching a Christmas video at the end of school with several classes.  I'm sure snacks were to be involved.  I was looking forward to shopping and spending as little time working as I possibly get by with, which is what I was doing when my phone rang. It was school.  I was hoping it was just his teacher calling to thank me for the gift I sent in.  But the tone of her voice while greeting me made me ask \"What happened?\". She proceeded to tell me how when he came into  class that morning, one of the parapros told him to do something and he said something that  sounds  like \"Pluck my Venus!\".  Yeah, it's what you're thinking!  Yeah, that's bad.  I gasped, feigned shock, and just went back quickly in mind, trying to recall where the hell he had heard that line!  Dad doesn't walk around saying it, out loud, and we are pretty cautious about what we watch on TV in front of him, and most things we watch wouldn't have that line in it!  Only once place.... Internet. His teacher then asks me what other things I think would be a good punishment.  I told her I often tell him that he better watch his mouth at school because if he doesn't he'll have to go to the principle's office (a lot of good that did).  I told her maybe a visit there might help.  She agreed, but went on to say that she felt this sort of behavior should be punished at home as well.  I agreed.   I  went on to say, not taking any of the blame from him, I would also like them to find out what is causing him to act this way when he comes in.  He has had a few incidences in the morning but nothing this bad.  But there is something causing him to be, well, belligerent in the morning, and you would have thought they might have tried to figure this out themselves.  She said they would research it after the holidays. In the meantime, she let me know that I should do something at home to punish him as well.  Thanks for the suggestion... pfffff.  Usually, I sorta feel like what happens in school should be punished at school.  I guess she was right, but boy, getting all your fun taken away on the last day before vacation sure seems punishment enough to me, considering they hadn't really tried to help the initial problem with mornings to begin with. So, I said something about taking computer away for the day when he got home.  I could feel her waiting on the end of the line, and I felt pressured to say \"or the weekend!?\".  She felt that was sufficient.  Okay. About 20 minutes later, she called again.  She told me they had taken him to the office, much to his chagrin, and that when the principle found out about all that happened decided he would have a half day in-school suspension, and then was to be picked up and taken home!  Wait a minute!  Wait one darn minute!  I meant for the whole Principal dealie to be sort of a \"scared straight\" scenario!!!!!  I didn't mean for it to be a life altering experience that would leave a stain on his record!  Geeze o' peete!  She said I needed to come get him after his suspension. A bit exasperated at this point and not feeling like getting into a big \"thing\" on this day, I asked \"What time?\". His Dad and I decided we would take computer away, at least Friday and Saturday and keep things low key, not a lot of outings, but a lot of talk about why he lost his favorite privilege in the whole world. This story could go on and on, but to shorten an already long post, I'll finish up by saying, I got him, he seemed ashamed.  He cried when he found out he lost his computer.  Friday was rough, Saturday was better after some visuals were provided explaining why and what for.  And quite honestly, it was pleasant to have his full attention and watch him do some things that he doesn't usually pursue, ie Wii and a few toys.   I know his saying such an offensive and sexual line was bad.  I know that.  Coming from the perspective that I don't want him to get suspended again, fired from a job, or worse yet, arrested someday, for saying such offensive stuff, I realize this is something that we need to get him to know he just can't do.  But at the same time, I kinda feel like this could have been better handled in school.  I think that if he had stayed, and had to sit in the \"team\" room during the festivities, knowing he was missing them,  he would have realized that what he had done was so wrong!  I think that would have worked much better than coming home and laying around all afternoon in his comfy room.   So in the grand scheme of things, such occurrences may take a village to resolve, but somehow, this side of the village seemed to get the brunt of that job!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/12/ugh.html", "title": "\nUgh......\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 11, 2010", "body": "\n well, for Casey anyway.  He's begun his third year at Camp Able, a camp for kids with \"disabilities\"  (hate that term).  So far, the three weeks have been quite good, with just a small setback the first week that I attribute to not quite being acclimated yet. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, they go on field trips, based on the theme of the week (this upcoming week's being \"Party Palooza\").  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, they stay at the camp home base, go to a local park for activiites, and the local indoor pool.  The home base for camp is a charming old school house, nestled in the center of a small town area.  The counselors are all college students, mostly girls (which Casey loves), and most are majoring in Special ed, or something along those lines.  It's a great set-up.  Case has been really \"into it\" this year, checking the schedule the camp provided, and discussing the next days events.  He particularly likes to talk about who is going to be with each counselor at the various activities, information that is provided on the chalk board each morning, so the kids know who they will stay with on the field trips or at the pool.  It changes from day to day, and Casey runs up to the board right away when we get there and announces the line up.  I have to appreciate that on days they might be going to  a busier than usual venue, he usually has a one on one.   I love that they are so aware of his propencity for walking away if something catches his eye, and how one on one attention is quite necessary sometimes.  I love camp because I can drop him off each  day and know that a) he will be away from the computer for hours b)he's around a lot other kids, whose names he mentions at home, a good sign of a little bonding and c) he's having fun being part of a group.  Plus, he's going to so many places that I would probably either not take him to, or have the chance to do so!    I have to draw the line at the Trout Farm field trip though, didn't sign him up for that one.  Although he went last year, and he brought home a trout that I apparantly was supposed to cook, I can't see him doing it again.  But who knows, the summer is going so well, he might force me to sign him up... then I guess it wouldn't be so bad!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/TDnjaU_nMLI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/0_8PQAqOIF4/s1600/0708100841-00.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2010/07/summertime-and-livin-is-easy.html", "title": "\nSummertime and the Livin' is Easy...\n"},
{"date": "Friday, January 22, 2010", "body": "\nI awoke at 5am, the sound of a locked out cat scratching furiously at the door and had that satisfying and yet, not feeling that I was done sleeping, at 5 am.   Casey didn't wake me up in the middle of the night last night and sleeping in  my and Bill's bed  all night without a sharp 11 year old elbow pushing into my head must have given me the rest I needed.  I actually blocked his door as well so that afore mentioned feline couldn't get in his room either. I suspected this was the case, and maybe why he was waking up every night and coming to get me, half feigning fear of some unknown goolies in his room.   I think it was actually a small, furry goolie named Ricky coming in licking Casey's head, perhaps nibbling on any bare flesh he could sink his sharp little teeth into, and knocking over various stacks of VHS tapes available to knock over, that was the actual fear. So, what else is there to do at 5am than to hop on the computer?  I of course checked email, only to find way too many emails from a nice enough lady that got me involved in the health and household cleaners company I buy from, touting the products themselves and trying to lure me into the pyramid like selling system they have.  I keep telling her I am one of her best customers but will never \"sell\" the products for them, I do enough of that crap with my real job.  And anyway, anytime anyone wants one of their products, I just order it for them under my \"Preferred Customer\" status and get the money later.   Then I check Facebook of course, and lo and behold, there is nothing on there different from last night at 10:30 pm when I had last checked it.  I fed my virtual fish in Fishville and got some more, cleaned some friends tanks, visited some pages of other people, looked at their photos, realized I was completely bored, and then noted one of my FB friends had a new blog entry. This of course reminded me how long it's been since I've added to this body of work.  I think my last entry was about Casey getting \"suspended\" for using lewd language.  That seems an eternity ago, December 18th.   The holidays came and went, Casey spending a week of his break with the Aunties in Indy, having a break from us, we from him.  He even was there over New Years.  I believe that might have been the first New Years Eve we didn't celebrate with him since he was born.  It was weird, but it was fun to have that little bit of freedom to party like adults to some extent.  We really didn't take advantage of the situation as much as we could have but had a nice evening non the less, all the while, I missed having Case here. And so, the new year has indeed started, and so has school with no big suspensions or arrests to report.  It's such a strange time of year.  Although it's all fresh so to speak, and I guess \"new\", life feels a bit stale.   I suppose it's the weather that mostly makes me feel this way.  We try to get Casey active just about everyday, whether it's working out with Dad, or swimming with me.  But even that gets stale.  Yes, I'm using that word again. The routine of having to bundle up, walking through the cold, overcrowded parking lot and walking into a gym filled with \"fair weather\" fitness enthusiasts who crowd our beloved Rec Center simply because they made a New Year's resolution to get in shape troubles me to no end.  Sometimes taking the easy road and staying in the warm house watching TV sounds much better, but then, Case, and we, need our excercise. Just bundling up all together everytime you go out here in Michigan gets me down.  I could literally stay in from mid November to around April, and even then, not so much.   I find that the older I get the worse the cold weather brings me down, and not even the beauty of a newly fallen snow gives that little twinge of excitement any more, unless it means a snow day and an excuse for me to take personal time to stay home with Case. Thankfully, Casey has awoken and so I must end this uneventful and dare I say whiney first entry of 2010.  I swear my entries will bet better.  I'd call that a resolution, but then I'd jinx myself and not write till June.  Probably not even then, because I would be outside, in the warmth and beauty of summer, not caring about being on the computer..... Geeze, I gotta go make my morning coffee.......\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/S1mGbPMLtGI/AAAAAAAAAe8/wCmdYCin6Eo/s1600-h/s1174800152_30382520_6161016.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2010/01/first-official-post-of-2010.html", "title": "\nThe First Official Post of 2010\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 15, 2009", "body": "\n A marvelous thing has occurred at our house on school mornings!  It has become  pleasant !  Yes, pleasant!  No more screaming, no more having to tell him 45 times to come and eat.  No more boy sitting and kicking the wall under the breakfast bar singing not so sweetly \"Little little assholes!\"....ahhhh, yes, more pleasant. It all started one morning after being completely exhausted the night before, and not having the drive to mess with a whole shower thing.  I decided a shower for Casey in the morning wouldn't be the end of the world (although the thought of the days bodily grossness on his sheets was on my mind).  And so, that morning, I told him to get in the shower after a nights rest and strength had been restored.  He asked if he could take a bath and since I was still fiddling around with my morning primping, I said okay.  He burst into the bathroom, took off his jammies and hopped in before the tub was full.  The rest of the morning went smoothly.  And I didn't connect anything, thinking it was just one of those rare and lucky days that everything wasn't a big clusterf^&*. So, the next morning, despite a shower the night before (still thinking about the days grime, despite that mornings bathing), he actually requested another bath.  Finding it odd, I allowed for it, and again, a  pleasant  morning ensued. This pleasantness isn't just quiet, this is beyond that.  I can actually get the boy out of bed with the sound of the bath water running and a silly song about Prince Casey's bath being drawn.  He leaps out of bed, strips and sits calmly in the tub for a good 20 minutes.  This is awesome, because before, getting him up was quite a challenge, with a lot of threats and cussing on both our parts.   Oddly, this bath routine has now blossomed into a whole routine, and one that needs no prompting.  He gets out, dresses himself (something I was helping him way too much with pre morning bath because we were usually running late), and then  he makes his way to the kitchen to nibble on some breakfast.  Again,  NO PROMPTING !  This is huge!  On top of all that, his teacher has mentioned he has had excellent days, and getting him to get ready for the bus and transitioning is no big deal anymore. Why and how does a simple bath realign the planets and make pigs fly?  Why did it take so frickin long for this to happen?  Why, when I take showers every morning, had it not occurred to me that this might be good for Casey as well?  Who the hell knows... trial and error, trial and error. Whatever, it's workin' now, clean sheets be damned!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SyeOfNXaYtI/AAAAAAAAAek/uONkdTHUKxE/s1600-h/777103a56531caf6.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/12/splish-splash-caseys-takin-bath-in-morn.html", "title": "\nSplish Splash Casey's Takin' a Bath.... in the Morn, and it's Good!\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 10, 2009", "body": "\n I know, Dora the Explorer?  Am I really going to blog about Dora the Explorer, that annoying little Nick Jr. gal with the nasal voice, who asks way too many questions, has a much bigger head than all the other characters, and has a best friend as a monkey?  As a matter of fact, I am. Lately, Casey has taken a real shine to Nick Jr., formerly the Noggin channel (don't even get him started on the name change, that's a whole other entry).  He actually sits and  watches and pays attention to the shows  they have on, despite the fact that they are made for preschoolers. Dora, being one of those shows, was one that he has watched on and off over the years.  But lately, I've noted a whole new awareness on his part as to what Dora is really all about.  It's a very participatory children's program, with Dora and the other characters stating facts and then asking about them later, requiring the viewer to, in each episode, remember what landmarks Dora has to go to in her adventures, where items are on the screen, etc.   I have caught him several times answering Dora's questions, and doing so correctly, or I'll here him go \"There it is!\". Casey's participating!  He's making conversation, albeit seemingly one sided (not in his head I'm guessin').  He's thinking, he using his rationalization skills, comprehension skills.... all the cool stuff!  Heck, he's even pointing at things on the screen from time to time.  I would have given my left arm to see that oh so many years ago when he was  supposed  to be pointing! Would I've liked to have seen such participation eight years ago, when he was just a little tot, and it was more socially appropriate for him to be watching and reacting to Dora?  Of course!  But, as anyone who has a kid in their life with Autism knows,  milestones form a completely uneven path in our world, but they come, scattered here and there.  And personally, I am proud to be there whenever he gets to one of those milestones, no matter how long they take or however far apart they are!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SyD56VkyuJI/AAAAAAAAAec/yz4F9JMa58Y/s1600-h/31a39a6c0f6edb2e.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/12/viva-la-dora.html", "title": "\nViva La Dora!\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 12, 2010", "body": "\nThe span of time that has passed since my last post makes me think maybe I'm just not a blogger!  Geeze Louise! I was speaking to my dear friend's hubby yesterday, when, rather sarcastically I think, he asked how \"Let it be Autism\" was going.  I just laughed it off, as I usually am laughing the whole time I talk to this guy anyway and said I just didn't have anything significant to write about.  That's a great attitude to have when one has a blog! Now, that's not to say Casey's day to day life as an individual with Autism doesn't contain significant happenings to blog about.  I could write just about everyday something he said that was cute, the issues at school, something cool he hasn't done before, etc. But, my sink over flows with dishes, I need to work out, I need to get him off the computer, I need to have a half hour with my husband here and there, and then we all go to sleep.  And all the thoughts and reflections I have for the door go down the proverbial toilet, another blog entry and day swept away. I read so many good blogs, and they are so up to date and recent, and well written, with little blue highlighted references to other up to date blog entries and other places of interest.  How do people do it?  I know some people who are at a desk anyway working have the distinct advantage of being in front of a computer most of their work day, and blogging I'm certain is a nice break for them.  Heck, some people make their living blogging!  I can't imagine the dynamics of doing this.  It seems like a luxury in some ways, and a giant headache in others. Blogging for me has been theraputic, and an outlet for my inner writer (at least in my head, I'm a writer).  But, it can also be a bit of a challenge for me as well.  I wanna write about Casey, but I don't want to be of only interest to my family and friends.  I don't want to be preachy, but then, I'm pretty well known for getting on my soap box about 5 times a day.  I don't want to be opinionated,  here , at least, because honestly, I don't have the energy or attention span to pay enough attention to the issues to feel comfortable enough to pontificate on how I feel about them here.  So, what's my hook?   Which leads me back to my conversation with my friend's husband, let's call him \"Don\".  When I remarked that I didn't have much to blog about, he brought up the whole controversy on Aspergers now being put into the Autism Spectrum, and what I thought about it.  At the time, we were talking, I was doing the dishes so there's two things I was doing, talking and dishwashing, and no big thoughts came to my head on the subject, so I acted like a rebel and said \"I don't know, I don't really care!\".  He laughed me off as he is so wont to do, not because I'm funny I'm sure, but just silly.  But how stupid that I didn't have an opinion!  It all goes back to the fact that I thoroughly haven't researched the story, haven't taken the time.  Maybe if I had, I could have blogged about it. So, having said all this, I have to wonder, what is the point of this particular blog entry, but to bitch about how I don't blog, to confirm I have a self induced lack of knowledge, and to pretty much have decided \"Don\" probably thinks I'm dumb. What the hell can I do to get 80,000 readers, sponsors, money?  I guess blogging more than once a month might be a start. And oh, you professional writers out there, any suggestions would be appreciated, or you could just tell me to throw in the hat!  But then, where would you come to fulfill your need to find errors and bad grammar?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2010/02/gotta-blog.html", "title": "\nGotta BLOG!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, December 16, 2009", "body": "\nSo, I'm talking to my sister today about how Casey wants a subscription to an online gaming site.  It's 25.95 for 3 months.  A perfect gift I decided, from his grandparents, who give us money each year to get him something because he is so very hard to buy for. More discussion ensues, when suddenly Casey comes up behind me and says \"It's confirmed!\" \"What's confirmed Bud?\" I ask innocently. \"My subscription has been confirmed.\" he replies innocently. \"Hold on Cheryl!\" I say laying the phone down, a feeling of panic taking over. I run into the kitchen to look at the laptop, Casey padding behind me.   On the screen I read \"Your Nick Jr. Boost Subscription has been confirmed.\" Quickly, I try to page back, only to find that he filled out all the info needed to send the subscription as a gift perfectly, making the recipient and the sender himself, but otherwise, perfectly.  Still panicking, I couldn't see anywhere that he put in credit card info. \"Casey,\" I called calmly, \"what number did you use to  confirm your subscription ?\". \"From the card.\" \"What card?\" \"Dat one.\" he replies, not pointing, not helpful. \"Which one?\" \"The Mastercard.\" \"Did you have the number memorized Case?\" I ask, still not seeing a card. \"No, the Citibank Card.\" his cadence taking on that of Dustin Hoffman's Rainman. Suddenly, I notice my credit card laying off to the side of the computer, as if lightly flung after it's use was rendered.  My eyes shoot over to my wallet laying open, the spot where that card calls home glaringly empty.  The perfect crime scene. I grab the phone, almost forgetting that Cheryl was waiting there, listening to the whole thing. \"Did you hear that?\" I ask her. \"I believe a social story is in order!\" she says with official Occupational Therapist confidence (because she is). \"Yeah...\" I answer, still amazed that he was able to put in enough information from my card to  confirm his subscription . Yeah, a social story is in order, and a lock box for our credit cards!

{"date": "Wednesday, December 9, 2009", "body": "\n So many things have occurred since my entry of October 28Th.  The very thought of trying to share so much stuff makes my brain hurt, seriously.  In the interest of keeping my mind in tact for my upcoming meeting with my boss today, I think I'll focus simply on one new phenomenon that reared it's ugly head in the past couple of months. I've been inspired by Kristina Chew's account of her son's encounters with  dogs  and his wonderful way of dealing with creatures who have struck fear in his heart for sometime.  In our case, Casey's \"dog\" is a camera flash.  Camera flashes now cause a total freak out reaction for Case. I theorize that it all started during a recent photo session at school for class pictures.  Apparently, instead of his little class having their time with the photographer alone, they were grouped with a hoard of other students getting their photos taken in a assembly line fashion, flashes going off every few seconds.  The noise, the chaos, and the flashes really made it's impression on Casey.  I guess when he couldn't take it any longer, he shouted \"This is crap on a plate!\" and ran out of the room and down the hall.  Later on that day, he actually told his teacher he was ready to get his picture taken, and he did well.  But since then, flashes have been a major ish for Casey. And oddly, it seems with this new issue, comes more people taking pictures wherever we seem to be.  Or maybe, we are now more aware of people taking pictures, especially whenever a flash goes off and he screeches and if able, tries to take the camera from the photographer at hand!  He even reacted to the camera flashes in the stadium at the World Series on television!  Much screaming of \"Turn off the TV!\" commenced during the games.  Recently we were at a restaurant where the seating was close, the area small, and everyone around us seemed to be taking photos of each other.  And with the bad lighting, the flashes more extreme.  Each time, Casey would screech \"oh no!\" each time, and his voice is no longer soft let's say.  It was getting ridiculous really (along with the irritation of trying to find a damn outlet to plug in his stupid DVD player whose battery wasn't charged like I thought), so, I got into my WWCD mode (What would Cheryl do, my Occupational Therapist sister, who always seems to have a good idea on how to deal with situations) and dug through our goody bag.  I found a pair of 3-D glasses used earlier at the movie theater and told him to put them on and it would protect his eyes. Along with this I also told him, not in no many words, to be proactive and watch the people who have been taking photos, and when you see them raise their camera, look away.  Do what he had to do, pretty cut and dry.  And it worked, he was really watching out for himself, burying his head in my arm before a flash went off, and was quiet and it was nice.  He was self empowered, and it made me think how this issue of self empowerment will be so, well, powerful, as he grows up and more of these eccentric, if you will, behaviors  come up. Having said all this, Dad on the other hand, really knew nothing of his new empowerment.  It didn't really come up as he wasn't with us that night.  And so, who knew that some irritating parent would be snapping photos at a recent Dad and son event at school last Friday night.  Casey's new skills didn't carry over and he was very upset.  Bill tried to explain to the parent about Casey's aversion, but she was still around taking photos of other kids and it still bothered him.   Lesson learned, assume there is going to be cameras where ever we go, carry the magic 3D glasses, and Mom and Dad need to get in sync on how to help Casey empower himself, and never assume he can necessarily do it on his own....yet!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sx-q9FeuKHI/AAAAAAAAAeU/k25q0idpa0M/s1600-h/136004436_33ca55e88e.jpg", "http://autism.typepad.com/autism/2009/12/encounter-with-a-big-red-dog.html"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/12/flash-of-self-control.html", "title": "\nA \"Flash\" of Self Control\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, October 17, 2009", "body": "\nFor the last several months, my dear hubby Bill has been taking Casey to work out at our local rec center.  As you know, we've had  concerns  about Casey's weight, so it's only fitting that he does this. They have quite a routine worked out, consisting of several walking laps around the indoor track, 22 minutes (to be exact) on the Eliptical machine (by far, Casey's least favorite part of the work out), and 4 running (jogging) laps to finish thing off.  It's quite a regimen!   At the beginning, I always let them go alone, allowing me some alone time which is always welcomed, but better yet, some bonding time for them.  I fear sometimes that they are so similar in so many ways seen and unseen, that they tend to clash occasionally, so it's always good for them to be together without me prodding in.  But after my crazy thought of accompanying them on an occasion, it's almost always expected.  Bill likes for me to go just for the \"company\" aspect since Casey isn't very chatty, and Casey likes for me to go because I think he believes I'll get him out of activities he doesn't like, but I don't.  So, my alone time, has been cut.... Today we went, despite a rough morning for me after having several glasses of wine last night with friends.  It was a good idea at the time.  The rec center wasn't very crowded and we pretty much had the track to ourselves.   Bill and I conversed while following Casey, whose pace tends to speed up as we go.  He was chatting away to the wind about a new video coming out, \"A Daddy  Christmas\" on Oct. 24th, starring his Daddy and Casey.   We quietly joked about some of our fellow worker outers on the machines below the track, reminised about the gathering last night where I drank too much wine and how nice it was to see our friends who we hadn't seen for a while.  Bill and Casey did their running laps while I read a magazine on the stationary bike, and then together we did the eliptical, counting down the minutes till we were done. Casey always chooses the elevator to get down to the first floor of the facility to leave, rather than the grand staircase we use at first to get up to the second floor, enough working out for sure!  He doesn't grab my arm anymore like he used to on elevators, but rather, stands like he's been riding them for years without a problem. Casey informs me that he and I both get 116 \"smiley faces\" for our efforts today, and Daddy only gets 1.  We're not sure why but have a laugh about it.  And back home we go for lunch and some luxuriating in the freedom of Saturday. I'm starting to think not having that alone time isn't so bad.....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/10/work-outs-and-togetherness.html", "title": "\nWork Outs and Togetherness\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 23, 2009", "body": "\n Sure, he looks friendly enough, but I made an amazing discovery about my little boy last night that really should have been apparent all along but never really occured to me until the situation arose! Here it is:  Casey does not know how to talk on the phone to a peer and also has no desire to do so, despite the particular peer being someone he really likes! So there it is.  I don't know why I was surprised by this.... A little background and I am not going to stream through my blog to see if I had ever blogged about this 'cause you probably wouldn't remember reading it anyway, but in 4th grade Casey made a friend.  His name was Jason, and they really bonded.  Jason was in regular ed, but they hung out on the playground together from all accounts.  He caught Casey's fancy by indulging him in commercial talk, and particularly, Geico Insurance commerical talk which was of hight interest to Case at the time.  This boy was like a ghost to me, I never met him, I couldn't find his name in the student directory. He, aluded me.  Then the last day of school, while talking to another mom, I noted Casey standing and talking to this dude, and Casey literally followed the kids mom's car (not after I caught him of course) out of the parking lot.  I saw the back of the kids head and that was it!  So weird. Jason goes to the same school now as Case, but it's large with many 5th and 6th grade classrooms.  Casey still spoke of Jason, and I heard about him being on the playground once again with him last year.  This year, not so much Jason talk although every once in awhile a commercial for the Jason G. doll is spewed out by Casey.  Don't ask me where to get one, I can't find one myself! I check my phone for messages last night after being in a store, and lo and behold, there is one.  When I take a listen, it's a little boys voice asking if he could talk to Casey and how he wants to ask him about 4th grade for his homework, and maybe they could talk about Geico a little.  It was Jason!!!!!  Cute message, very exciting, no number was left to return his call, and no number was in my phone that he called from!  Again, so weird.   I told Casey he called and let him hear his message.  Casey let out one of his patronizing \"Yays\" that he does when he knows I'm excited and that he should be but isn't really.   Jason finally called back and wanted to ask Casey a question about what they used to talk about on the playground because he was doing a report on Casey!  How sweet is that? By this time, Casey was shoveling KFC chicken strips in his mouth and watching a Youtube video (I am such a good mom) and had absolutely no interest in speaking to Jason, so I asked him to call back in a little while. He did.  Again Casey showed no interest in speaking with him.  I forced him to answer his questions a little but when it seemed  some expletives were beginning to ooze from this frustrated boy, I quickly ended the conversation.   I was bummed.  Casey doesn't have anyone call him, let alone someone he really likes friendwise.  I was surprised at his lack of interest and irritation at talking.  My sister, the OT, the treasure trove of knowledge, sweetly reminded me, as I recalled the evening to her, of his lack of social reciprocity, social awareness, blah blah blah and stuff and how   not  unusual   it was that he wouldn't want to talk on the phone, let alone in person.

{"date": "Saturday, September 12, 2009", "body": "\nI was listening to an interview yesterday on National Public Radio's \"Fresh Air\" with Terry Gross.  She was speaking with the creator of a new show on TV called \"Glee\".  I guess it's about a teacher who is trying to help out a rag tag group of students who want to start a show choir.  It's a comedy.  They played a short soundbite from the show, and it hit me hard.  I found the transcript of the interview and particularly the soundbite transcript.  It's a discussion between the teacher trying to form the show choir and apparently his arch nemesis. (Soundbite of television program, \"Glee\") Ms. JANE LYNCH (Actor): (As Sue Sylvester) So I had a little chat with Principal Figgins, and he said that if your group doesn't place at regional, he's cutting the program. Ouch. Mr. MATTHEW MORRISON (Actor): (As Will Schuester): You know, you don't have to worry about glee club. We're going to be fine. Ms. LYNCH: (As Sylvester) Really? Because I was at the local library, where I read Cheerleading Today aloud to blind geriatrics, and I came across this little page-turner: \"Show Choir Rule Book.\" And it turns out you need 12 kids to qualify for regionals. Last time I looked, you only had five and a half. Here - cripple in a wheelchair. I also took the liberty of highlighting some special ed. classes for you. Maybe you could find some recruits because I'm not sure there's anybody else who's going to want to swim over to your island of misfit toys. Mr. MORRISON: (As Schuester) Are you threatening me, Sue? Ms. LYNCH: (As Sylvester) Threatening you? Oh no, no, no, presenting you with an opportunity to comprise yourself? You betcha. Oddly, I just had the part about the special ed classes on my brain but wow, that's overly offensive on so many levels now that I read it instead of hear it.   Hey, I have a great sense of humor, and I laugh at a lot of offensive stuff.  Clearly they are trying to portray this character as an insensitive bitch, but they are also trying to be funny.  I don't think this is funny.  I don't think the fact that I personally have to have our son in a grouping of \"Special Ed.\" funny in the first place, or that he has to be segregated by it or that the buses for the \"Special Ed.\" are always short and are the brunt of many jokes.  Don't people in \"Special Ed. classes\" have enough to contend without being put down on television where millions more can laugh and get humor out of their situation?   Am I overreacting to this?  I hope to hear from a lot of you on this one.  In all fairness, here is the whole transcript to be fair, but reading the rest doesn't really change my feelings....  And if you feel the same way I do, what can we do about this? http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=112721367\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/09/does-anyone-else-find-this-offensive.html", "title": "\nDoes Anyone Else Find This Offensive?\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 15, 2009", "body": "\nHormones are a' ragin' here at our house as of late, and other places too.  At least, that is what I'd like to think. Case in point, got a call from Casey's lovely teacher yesterday morning.  When I see the school number on caller ID I'm  always ready to hear that either he puked, hit someone, or cussed enough to get him thrown out of school.  Happy news comes in the form of emails, never calls to the cell. So, with a much regret I answered.  She had that tone to her voice straight away that really just made me want to hang up and run. As we got through the standard greetings, she asked \"Did Casey have a rough morning?\".  I had to think back an hour or so, and recalled that, no, he had actually had a pretty smooth morning, with laughter and good vibes all around! \"Well,\" she continued, \"reports came from the other students on the bus that he swore, and when he arrived at school he said several curse words and laid down in the hall!\". Scratching my head, I thought to myself \"Damn, the kid gets on the bus and is at school in a matter of 5 minutes if that.  What the hell?\". We continued to discuss this issue, both of us as usual assuming it was someone or something giving rise to such a tantrum and not a random act of belligerence.  He usually isn't random about such behaviors, and in fact, I contend many kids on the spectrum verbal or non, have reasons for such episodes. Anyway, I requested what she had already considered, that they do some investigative work to find out what happened, what triggered him. After interrogating some children, info surfaced that the bus driver had pulled away that morning before Casey could properly fasten his seatbelt, frustrating him to the point of cursing, and even having the kids help him get it on didn't make things better.  This carried over into his arrival there, it's hard for him to let things go quickly.  So, there it was, the reason.  It may seem like a silly reason, or not serious enough  to justify an out burst like that, but it mattered to him. It mattered to him, and it bothered him, and I contend that his current biological state is not helping him handle things well sometimes.  HORMONES!  That has to be it.  I swear, when the kid wakes up and seems an inch taller every week how can anyone argue?   Is there a pill for hormone control?  I know they give therapies to us gals going into our middle age years, why not for kids on the spectrum who don't have the wherewithall to handle the feelings that engulf and enrage them?  I need to call Dr. Oz or somebody.... Anyway, prepared today to get on the bus behind him and insure his belt was fastened before he took off  to avoid yet another episode, I was pleasantly surprised.  As he stepped on, I heard several children say his name in a happy manner, and one girl imparticular spoke to him as he passed her saying \"Casey, sit by me!\".  He plopped down and she immediately helped him with his seatbelt, and he was all smiles.  I stepped off the bus, smiling myself. Hhhhmmm, just like a baby who cries to get attention because he needs something, Casey's outburst could certainly fall in the same vein.  He got what he needed apparently, some direction and help.  We just need to teach him he can get that without using the \"f\" word!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/10/hormones-are-ragin-here-at-our-house-as.html", "title": "\n\"Bus\"tration\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 7, 2009", "body": "\n Quite a while back I went on a rant about how much I  hated  Youtube because we felt it was probably the leading expletive inducer for Casey next to our own potty mouths.  Plus, it's just disturbing how a child can put in a search for \"Blue Clues\" video snippits and they could suddenly be seeing \"Blue Balls\" video snippits.....  Just really inapropriate. Anyhoot, he still plays Youtube sometimes, but never without my ever listening ears and watchful gaze in the vicinity.  He does pretty well censoring what he sees, with only the occasional cuss word blasting over the airways, quickly cut off by a giggling boy. He has his own account that I allow him to put videos on, mostly for his own entertainment but to share with family and friends as well so it's public. If you are unfamiliar with Youtube, let me explain that there is a forum after each video posted that allows viewers to comment on the video they have just watched.  We have recieved, of course, snotty, obnoxious, and rude comments as you can well imagine because it seems there are a group of people out there who watch boring little videos made by children and then rake them over the coals.  An admirable way to spend your time right!?  But, we just delete the nasty comments and move on. I have read comments of some of the videos Casey watches, not his own, and people write horrible things sometimes, just about say, a Wiggles Video.  I beg him not to read the comments, afraid of what he'll pick up even there. So, this morning, while checking email, I noted that we recieved 2 emails from Youtube, and I almost didn't read them.  I don't know if it's how we have our account set up or what but when someone comments on one of Casey's videos, they get sent to our email. Thinking that they might be nice comments I could show Casey, I opened the first and it read.... SBloxLines has replied to your comment on Oobi DVR challenge: They still play it, If you have DISH It's on 169 at 12:00 and 12:30 (PM) Sometimes 5:00 AM Also. You can reply back by visiting the comments page. \"Replied back?\" I almost said out loud.  That would mean that someone in our house had commented on someone else's video.  Bill would never comment on an Oobi video, it's a kid thing, no interest, and well, I just don't care.  So I clicked on this video of SBloxLines and skimmed down the commments section, suddenly eyeing one from our account, named Billboncasey, that read: what happen to noggin? Casey had taken it upon himself to comment.  A little background, this Oobi was a show on a network for kids named \"Noggin\" and they dropped \"Noggin\" and call it Nick Jr. now, much, much, much to Casey's dismay.  He has been asking me about this for a couple of days, why it changed, why it isn't Noggin anymore, and now, he was seeking out info on Youtube!  So cute.  And this fellow nerd, SBloxLines, replied to tell him where he could still find Noggin being broadcast!  Too funny! The next email was from the same person and again was a reply to a comment, made by Casey himself... SSBloxLines has replied to your comment on Oobi Short Program Promo (Commercial) for Babies and Toddlers: And PBS Kids. (Noggin = 169 DISH | PBS Kids = 13 DISH You can reply back by visiting the comments page. Yet another reference to where he could find this Noggin channel still.  Being nosey once again, I went  back to this person's other video Casey clearly watched and skimmed the comments only to find.... 1999-2000 the good old days of noggin huh? Casey wrote that comment!  Casey referenced the year it was from and typed out a nostalgic thought he had on it!  I was floored.  I know this was a long post to get to this but really, finding out he commented in this fashion, and that he commented at all made me almost cry, it really did. I hope this post made sense, and I hope you understand why I posted about it,  Yet another one of those instances where even the smallest cool thing seems huge in your head, especially when you are dealing with challenges day in and day out.  That just made my day.......\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SsxlKNTZAiI/AAAAAAAAAeE/ut4h3j7FSYY/s1600-h/c6c4ba3717f35b02.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/10/i-take-it-back-little.html", "title": "\nI Take it Back...

{"date": "Monday, September 14, 2009", "body": "\n Well, in our case, boy boobs!  Yes, Casey is currently dealing with a phenomenon some pubescent boys experience, boy boobs.  It's odd, my little boy, who was always skinny, skinny, skinny, has in the last year and half developed quite a belly, and well, boy boobs.  We're all a little concerned, but I've read up online of course, the ultimate source of knowledge, and found that it is quite typical among preteen boys.  I also came upon some info on tea tree oil and lavendar oil and it's use in various products and how those can also cause this breast growth in young boys.  I've been using such items regularly since November on Casey, but I found photos of him from last summer, and the boobs were there then, just less severe, so that theory sorta went up in smoke! So, now, while waiting to see if this irradication of all things tea tree oil and lavenderish will qualm the boobage, we still have to endure the stares and glares from those at the pool who are just too ignorant not to stare and glare.  It's not enough that this awkwardly tall boy who starts stimming the minute he steps into the pool area can't help his stims, but add on those 34 B's, and well, he's quite a sight! I know what people are thinking...  \"How did she let that happen to that boy?\" and \"She should reallly cover him up!\" etc.  I don't know how it happened, I still contend it's puberty and the accordion theory will go into effect soon and he'll grow 5 inches and everything will stretch.  I truly didn't plan on my kid having boobs, it's not my fault!  Wahhhhhh!  We were going around the lazy river and two little kids literally swam in front of us to get a better look at him and the one said to the other \"He's got BOOBS!\"....  Being the mother Tiger that I am, I quickly rushed to his defense, he being oblivious.   \"What did you say?\"  I growled.   \"She said it!\" the one kid said. \"He can't help it!\"  I snapped \"and you're rude!\". The kids paddled against the tide of the lazy river as fast as they could, and I'm pretty sure they were, well, frightened of me, and I really couldn't care less, little shits.  I was hoping they would go \"tell on me\" to their mommy and she would come over to \"talk\" but no one ever showed up.  Perhaps I scared them a little too much.  Perhaps they knew they did something wrong, and didn't want to tell their mom.  Perhaps. Anyhoot, acting as a human shield and urging Casey to swim so his bod was mostly underwater the rest of our outing, I thought to myself \"Well, this is great, his stimming is bad enough, but now, should I even put him through being scrutinized about his boy boobs?  Should we not come swim anymore until they disappear?  That could be years!  Should I buy him a  a man bra of some sort?  What to do?\". I finally did an internal calm down and came to my senses and decided SCREW IT!  Boy boobs are not going to stop us from coming and doing something that Casey loves to do.  Boy boobs will not run our lives!  Boy boobs are no match for our seeking out fun activities and getting excercise (to get rid of the boy boobs)!  Nope, these boy boobs won't bring us down!  Let 'em stare, let 'em whisper, let 'em speculate, let'em, who cares? Having said that, anyone who might come up and say something to us point blank will feel the pain of my mother tiger teeth!!!! Perhaps a t-shirt for Casey may not be a bad idea.......

{"date": "Friday, September 11, 2009", "body": "\n I recieved an email from Casey's lovely teacher this morning concerning his week, so I thought instead of going into extreme and no doubt boring detail from my perspective, I would just allow her email to tell the tale of his first week back.  Not one for sitting back and saying nothing, I shall add in my remarks where I feel they are appropriate/add to her thoughts.  So remember, the italicized words are me, Bonnie, who writes this blog, the regular words, Casey's teacher.... Hi Bonnie, I must apologize for not getting back to you sooner...I am so sorry. I have been swamped - 11 hour days at school and I am remodeling my kitchen at home, plus putting up a fence in my boyfriend's yard, so my life has been a bit too busy. No problem at all Teach, I feel lucky to hear anything let alone a multi paragraph email from you when so many other parents have told me they receive nothing!  So you have a boyfriend?  Merowwwwr! Let me just say that Casey has been having awesome days, and is doing fantastic. He is getting his work done, is excited to be at school, and talks about being happy. Can you send in some bite size butterfingers again? He still asks for them and likes to work for one when things are a bit rough for him. On Tuesday he had trouble turning off the commercials, and yesterday he wanted the headphones, but was able to pull it all together both days. \"Awesome\" and \"Fantastic\" in one sentence!?  This is where I stop reading right!!?  I love that he is excited about school, I hope that he stays excited.  I should have remembered to send in the Butterfinger incentives the first day, but I'm glad she reminded me!  I'm not surprised he couldn't turn off the commercials since he DVRs them!  Pulled it  all together?  Now that is awesome and fantastic! I know things were a little bumpy for him in the morning yesterday coming in (he stomped some of the flowers in the courtyard on the way in from the bus), and said he didn't want to come in to school.  Just an FYI - his bus has been arriving late in the morning and in the afternoon as well. It's getting better, but it has been late. Well, flowers are overrated and I wouldn't want to come to school after a 20 minute bus ride either when I only live 5 minutes from school!  I've been struggling with this whole bus thing because timewise, it would just make more sense for me to take him since we really are barely 5 minutes away.  BUT, he wanted to ride the bus, and I thought it would get him into a routine better.  We'll see how it goes.... We have the same students this year plus one more - his name is Marvin, so you may hear Casey talk about him. Mrs. Moxham is the other teacher this year and we have been doing things with her room as well, so if you hear him mention her, that is why. Mrs. Walsh is also in that room, as well as some of Casey's friends from Coolidge, so he is surrounded by familiar, friendly faces. She's eluding to all the people who were invovled with him in 4th grade, who he loved.  So how nice is it to think he is in with a teacher he loves and has the one he loved in 4th grade so close by along with old friends from that class?  I can't ask for much more right now! We will be asking for money for CBI trips again, but we are not sure how much we will need this year, so we will let you know. I am so excited to have Casey back, and think this will be a wonderful year in many ways. Casey asked me about my trip to Europe which was so nice. He will be joining Mr. Ziegler's room this year for World Language which will begin next week. \"CBIs\" are \"Community Based Instruction\" where they go out into everyday situations IE grocery stores, fast food restaurants, etc. and learn how to do things.  I love them, not only do they get instruction, but if it's nice they walk and get out of school.  It's a long day.  I hope it will be a wonderful year too, I love her attitude!  I love that he asked her about her trip.  He asked me several times over the summer about her being in Germany (I think he was thinking he would get a souvenier!!  The World Language Class is with regular ed I believe and it should be awesome since he is really into Spanish and other languages. I need to run so I can get ready for work. I hope all is well with all of you at home. Talk to you soon, J. She wrote this at 5:12 am.  She is awesome.  We're very lucky, she totally understands him and I pray that this letter is a precursor to a great year and that I won't be using parts of it to write a nasty blog about her at some point!

{"date": "Thursday, August 27, 2009", "body": "\nClearly, I've confused and baffled  all  my readers with my thoughts.  I suppose it's because some of my thoughts weren't clarified enough, like who they were specifically about.  That can be a problem when one's blog is about one's son who has Autism, and you mention a change in underwear for instance.  That is  confusing  to be sure.  I have to say I got a certain guilty pleasure out of  the comments I recieved here and on Facebook, considering their humorous nature, which sometimes was intentional, but often not.  So, I feel it is my duty to clarify my thoughts, plus, it makes for yet another easy blog entry!  That's two in a row, baby!   (I've been following up a lot of my sentences with \"baby\", I don't know why, it just feels right) (just to clarify further, because clarification is what I'm all about, baby, my original thoughts are marked with an asterisk, and my thought on my thought, or clarification, if you will, is italicized!  Clear, baby?) *underarm hair suddenly appearing...a real shocker Yes, this was about Casey, I have had my own for quite sometime, although I do discover it occasionally which brings about feelings of surprise when I've forgotten to shave for awhile *how can one get their boy to stop, well, touching themselves, unconsciously, or conciously out in public? I know this is a \"guy\" thing, but most guys don't walk down the street with their hand clearly exploring their nether region.  This is the point I'm trying to make.  If they did, everything would be okey dokey. *why haven't I ever attempted to teach Casey to cook so he doesn't have to grab a chip or cookie whenever he is in need of something? Seriously, because one time he took cold pizza out of the frig, on his own, placed it on a plate and put it in the microwave! He's got the potential to learn! What's wrong with me? this is more than clear, I suck..... *What's wrong with me in general? I was hoping I'd get more comments addressing this one, but you all failed me, as I fail Casey daily... *I promised his teacher we would go over specific lessons this summer. Did I? Barely..... sigh, again, I suck.... *To stay on the pill or get off it, one girl's story......(that one would be all about me, probably not the proper forum here in this blog, but it's a thought I've been having).... ya know, sometimes my male relatives read this, so, what was I thinking?  Well, I'm not takin' it back now, it's out there for all to see, enjoy, and reflect on.  Hopefully my 84 year old father-in-law will comment soon! *we went to Chicago for the weekend and it was great and he was great.... I want share the photos but I don't want to bore you...I guess that's the chance you take every time you read my BLOG! *working full-time sucks when there's a 3 week window between camp and school starting... what more can I say, I think you can all tell how I feel about this thought.... *can I lose 20lbs by Oct. 10th? NO! *will any of his school clothes from last year fit and do they make elastic shorts and pants in men's sizes? thanks to so many of you for telling me that there are indeed men's spandex pants and shorts, but could you tell me where to get them for God's Sake?  Egads.... *a change in underwear style... no, I have not joined the \"thong nation\" nor plan on it (sorry R.)  Casey changed his underwear style thank you, and not to thongs. *sudden and much welcomed return to watching the Pee Wee Herman show after a couple of months of watching Blue Clues and having to discuss several times why Steve had to go to college..... this might show up later as a blog entry.... *his disdain for his daddy's well intended every other day work outs and how I suddenly have had to accompany them....that was my time dammit! I didn't have to go last night after Bill read this, and that was my main goal in sharing this thought!

When did it become fun to lay in bed without one's pants on doing who knows what under the blankies?

I also know that these are things \"Neuro-typical\" boys do or want to do too, I think, but just have a conscience or a little voice in their head or something that tells them to not!

If I sound less than enthusiastic, it's because every year at this time, my guilts hit me like a brick wall when I realize time has run out, and I have to wonder what the hell I've been doing all this time he was free, and now he won't be...  OH, I was working!  Yeah, it sorta stinks that I had to put so much energy into figuring out who got to spend time with my child on his summer break, but such is life. Now, he's gonna be at school all day, I'm gonna be workin' all day, and, well whatever.  I'll quit complaining.  I just think about all the things that could have been...zoo, Cedar Point, trips to the local lake/beach, trips to the museum that I planned but never took him to.  Oh well, maybe next summer. On an upbeat note, he seems very excited about going back, and keeps repeating his commercial pertaining to the subject.  \"\"Blank\" Elementary School is back, and bigger and better than ever!  Coming September 8th!\". It's also so nice to think he's going to be with his teacher from last year.  I know some say that kids should switch up teachers every year, but familiarity is good for Casey in every way.  He loves her and trusts her and she really pulled a lot out of him last year.  I think she's going to be pleasantly surprised to see how much more talkative and conversational he is this year.  Hopefully, the gross stuff from my previous post won't rear it's ugly head in the classroom, but, she can handle that too.  She probably won't believe how huge he's gotten over the summer either.  I'm guessing at least 2 inches have been added to his already above average frame, as well as a few more pounds! He's taking the bus, this year to school so can get into a better routine in the morn, and it gives me something to remind him to get ready for in the morning.  We drove by school today and I showed him the route the bus would take to get him there.  I showed him the door again where he went into last year.  We've always done this little routine over the years, it seems to help. And so, with his new cool red and black backpack (I picked it out, so I hope it's cool, 'cause he could care less), a snappy new outfit, and a good attitude, his first day of school should be great, especially since it's a half day, which I don't get.

I think of things all the time and go \"Oh, I should blog about that.\" but clearly I don't.  So, I am going to jot down some of the thoughts I have that I think I should blog about.  I'm not going to go into detail about them, just jot them down, then perhaps, refer to them later as fodder for future entries.  Please leave your thoughts, on my thoughts! *underarm hair suddenly appearing...a real shocker *how can one get their boy to stop, well, touching themselves, unconsciously, or conciously out in public? *why haven't I ever attempted to teach Casey to cook so he doesn't have to grab a chip or cookie whenever he is in need of something?  Seriously, because one time he took cold pizza out of the frig, on his own, placed it on a plate and put it in the microwave!  He's got the potential to learn!  What's wrong with me? *What's wrong with me in general? *I promised his teacher we would go over specific lessons this summer.  Did I?  Barely..... *To stay on the pill or get off it, one girl's story......(that one would be all about me, probably not the proper forum here in this blog, but it's a thought I've been having).... *we went to Chicago for the weekend and it was great and he was great.... *working full-time sucks when there's a 3 week window between camp and school starting... *can I lose 20lbs by Oct. 10th? *will any of his school clothes from last year fit and do they make elastic shorts and pants in men's sizes? *a change in underwear style... *sudden and much welcomed return to watching the Pee Wee Herman show after a couple of months of watching Blue Clues and having to discuss several times why Steve had to go to college..... *his disdain for his daddy's well intended every other day work outs and how I suddenly have had to accompany them....that was my time dammit! ...and so on.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2009", "body": "\n ....or so I'd like to think as much.  My friend teased me in my own comments section no less, that the woman who wrote the \"Julie & Julia\" blog, now made even more famous by the wonderful movie by the same name that is out now, never missed a day of blogging.  And I have missed, well, several.  No way to get one's blog made into a movie she reminded me!  Well, that whole thought is a bit moot, even if I wrote 4 entries a day!  But, it does remind me how much I love my blog, and how neglectful of it I've been, if not in relation to the movie companies, but more in relation to my own sanity! Many factors have contributed to this neglect.  Summer in general has proven overly busy for me, us.  I can't even remember if I ever mentioned this, recalling only my crappy attempt at poetry as the last thing I posted, but Casey has been going to a summer day camp for the second year.  The camp is for kids 9 to 14 and 11 months (weird), who have any variety of disabilities, be they physical and/or mental.   Last year he was the youngest there, and seemed most of the kids were boys who were in there teens, likely at the 14 and 11 month mark, and Casey seemed really little next to a lot them.  This year, they were all gone, replaced by more, but not so intimidating big boys, considering Casey seems to have grown about 4 inches since last summer and put on about 20lbs (gulp).  There are also several young ladies of various ages, who Casey seems to reference more than any of his fellow male campers. The counseling staff is made up of a group of college age kids, most going to school for education and special education degrees.  One woman was a parapro for years which adds to that secure feeling I have when leaving him with the camp. He really seems to have clicked with them this year, giving them all \"Toy Story\" related nicknames. They have done so much stuff, from water parks, to a trout farm of all things, to ceramics painting, to Chuck E. Cheeses.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, they stay around the area and swim in the indoor rec center and have theme activities.  Yesterday was \"Hawaii Day\" for instance.  Casey came home with a grass skirt he had made out of yarn and strips of paper and a lay with his name in Hawaiin on it.   It's funny when I pick him up, he's very ready to go, as is apparant when I'm signing him out, chatting with the counselors, and he's already gotten his back pack and is getting into the car. The conversation in the car on our way home is well, very limited.  Not many details of the day are offered on his part, and at first I would dig, dig, dig, but it would only serve to agitate him.  I finally wised up towards mid camp and just let him tell me what he wanted, considering it was a long day of activities and he just always seems burned out, but in a good way. This could be taken as a sign that he's not enjoying it at all, which occured to me at one point early on, but, when he comes home and wants to see his schedule the camp so kindly supplied for each week, so he can see what's going on the next day, I have to think, things are going pretty well.  I never get a fight in the morning, and last week, he was actually sad that it was Friday (unimaginable to me) because he didn't have camp all weekend!  Guess Bill and I just aren't that fun! So, as you can gather, the whole camp experience has been a success!  Friday is our last day, and then we have 3 whole weeks to fill before going back to school, which poses many challenges.  Namely, work for both Bill and I! My mom is coming in to help out for several days next week, and then that Friday we're going on a family trip to Chicago which hopefully will be fun!  But then 2 more weeks to follow!  Oh well, I'll stress out when it comes I suppose, finding taking things day by day sometimes is best for my psyche! I also haven't been posting due to my irrational and well, embarressing addiction to Farm Town, a stupid game on Facebook, where you maintain a virtual farm, while having friends be your \"neighbors\" who come over and \"harvest\" for you, and you for them.  Your goal is to get to certain levels so you can buy new things for your farm ie houses, fences, ponds, rivers, etc..  I'm up to 27 and can buy rivers now.....boy, I've accomplished a lot this summer huh?  My addiction is wearing down, although I still have in head that I want to reach level 34, the highest level.  I don't know why, just do. And, along with nightly bike rides, and weekend trips to Indy and trip to Kings Island, and blissful nothingness, the summer is slowly creeping by, and I'm loving it.  The thought of school starting, although it will alleviate child care issues, is daunting and sad when I consider he is going to be a 6th grader.   Oh well, I'll just take that day by day too.......\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SoKg4AAxCHI/AAAAAAAAAcs/RenVG6rBo3A/s1600-h/100_1109.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SoKhMdlWX_I/AAAAAAAAAc0/x8KuJ-0AY8M/s1600-h/100_1445.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-by-popular-demand-and-this-summer.html", "title": "\nBack By Popular Demand and This Summer in a Nutshell\n"},

Yes, one should always be prepared.... So, allow me if you will, to beat myself up, and in turn, I will allow you to beat me up in a likewise fashion!  How many people do that?  Usually folks write blogs to receive helpful and supportive comments from the readers but not today my friends!  Oh no, please, not one supportive comment please, just rail on me, agree with me, let me have it. I will now get down to the reasons you will all give me grief (and I want it, I really want it).  I will do it in bullet point fashion as a story would be as montonous and long winded as this opening.... -I announce to Casey, at lunch, right before I plan to take him that he is getting his hair cut today.   -this is bad.     -this is bad because he:      a)  hates haircuts      b)  does much better if I can talk to him about things that he doesn't like to do but has to do for a few days ahead, maybe include a social story. -As we're driving to the cheap hair cut joint, he tells me quite clearly \"I'm very nervous about this haircut!\" while breathing heavily and holding his tummy.   -I react not at all to this and say \"Oh come on, you've done great the last couple of times we went to this one!\"       -this is total disregard for his feelings, total...on top of the fact that he just found out it was happening! -We walk in, and it's crowded, and it's hot and the chairs of full of potential starers, that's all I can think about are the stares we will recieve, not about how he's feeling.  YOU SUCK! -The girl that always has done well with him waves us in, telling us everyone there is waiting for someone getting their haircut.  It won't be long....good, this girl leads us to believe she will be cutting his hair. -He sits and looks at magazines, saying commercials about the ads loudly, I threaten him with the loss of a trip to Salvation Army, which begins a long line of threats.   -He looks nervous and he's sitting  and I should have gotten him up and outside walking until it was time, walking is good, it's calming, not sitting amongst 5 people who have nothing to do but stare (and not one of them were reading or feigning interest in something else.  THEY SUCK!  I SUCK!) -He passes gas loudly, probably nervous stomach since his mom threw him into this situation.  I'm hoping they think it's a leather chair fart...why do I care what they think?  More threats.  Can a 10 year old boy hold in gas?  Threats! -When our turn comes up, the girl we like says she'll sign us in, but she's leaving and that ANN will do his cut.  Ann looks nervous already and I should have said no then, I should have just picked up on her Aura if you will of stress and nerves, 'cause it was comin' his way.  It was comin' his way like a match to a briquet heavily doused in lighter fluid. -I didn't say no, we had waited and he needed a cut.... -He sat, he fussed, he squirmed, he called out he wished he was a girl (makes sense, girls don't necessarily have to have tickly over stimulating clippers used on their sensitive neck, 'course neither do boys really). -My tension level rose with theirs and I began more threats, as I tried to hold his head where she needed it to be, getting more and more irritated with him.....  if I had only done things differently...... -Ann worked efficiently, too efficiently, but faster the better I suppose....  he calls out \"You're ga....\" I was able to cut off the \"y\" at the end of \"gay\"....Ann was non the wiser. -I've never seen someone so relieved although not visibly glad to have finished a haircut in their lives, and I'm talking ANN!   -Casey stands up, looking gorgeous, hair covered, flustered, and red cheeked.  \"Sorry\" he says on his own to ANN.  My heart breaks.... No Casey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I set you up for failure despite 10 years of knowing better.... I can't promise, but I will try never to let it happen again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sp2QuTPNZSI/AAAAAAAAAc8/R6nBm8yOTLQ/s1600-h/100_1567.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/09/here-allow-me-to-set-you-up-for-failure.html", "title": "\nHere, Allow me to Set You Up for Failure......\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, July 1, 2009", "body": "\nAs mentioned in a previous  post , Casey's tastes don't often reflect those of a \"typical\" 10 year old.  At the time I wrote that  one , he was really into Barney of all things again, and the Wiggles.  Currently, he is really gotten back into Blue's Clues, which I have to confess is fine with me, I always thought Steve was kinda cute.  Watching them now, I have to say that honestly, although the show was clearly produced with young children in mind, it's really not all that \"babyish\".  Steve actually talks straight to the camera, and he talks normally, not in a weird sing songy way (ie Barney), and they teach pretty good, if not basic lessons in English, math, science, and even history sometimes. I bring this up because most 10 year olds wouldn't be caught dead watching Blue's Clues.  No way!  I would fathom to guess some 7 or 8 years olds wouldn't even put in such a video.  So, was I wrong when I assumed Casey would enjoy a show put on at our local library by a woman called \"The Music Lady\", which is geared for toddlers and young children? He likes Blue's Clues, he probably would still like \"The Music Lady\". We'd seen her about 2 years ago, and Casey LOVED her then.  He got up and danced, sang, and even joined into a follow the leader sort of song around the auditorium, even then towering over the children that were at the time a year or two younger than him.  He blended in, a bit.  When I told him \"The Music Lady\" would be performing, and asked if he would want to go see her, he answered yes, less than enthusiastically.  That should have been my first clue.... When we arrived, we found the performance starting in a small meeting room (well, it seemed small considering the 25 or so little ones sitting on the floor with all their parents sitting in chairs behind.  The first time we saw her, it was in an auditorium, roomy, airy, good acoustics, less crowded. As mentioned, the kids, all ranging from ages of 1 to 6, were sitting in front of her on the floor.  I asked Case if he wanted to sit with them and he said no quickly, and I sensed embarrasment when I asked him.  I wasn't used to this, and the light started to flicker in my brain, \"What was I doing to this boy?\". So, we sat in the back row of chairs, behind the kids, behind the parents.  The Music Lady began her performance, and I'm sitting there with a shit-eatin' grin, enjoying her goofy yet lovable deameanor with the kids.  She started singing and I immediately started clapping along, not really thinking and looked over at Casey.  He was sitting, rubbing his face and his eyes.  He quickly looked at me and, I believe now, feigned interest for my sack and sort of started clapping.   This continued, and when she told everyone to stand up so we could do \"Ring Around the Rosey\" and \"Motor Boat\", the truth hit me like a wet dishrag!  He was too old for this, physically, and mentally!  I tried him out, grabbing his hands to see if just maybe he wanted to participate, and he quickly pulled his hands away, and asked if we could go look at the videos in the library.  I gave in, respectful of his boredom, and lead him out. I stood behind him as he pulled out each video, thinking about my faux pas.  Why would I bring a 5'4, ten year old to a show clearly for little ones? Well, he likes Blue's Clues, and that's on the same level, I thought.   Maybe I should have picked up on his sudden awareness of, I don't know, wanting to look his age(?) when that same morning he didn't want to bring his Blue's Clues sleeping bag to camp for \"Camping Out\" Day.  He chose a more mature sleeping bag with a non descript rocket ship on it. So, this new phenomena of almost hiding his immature likings is throwing me for a loop, in good and bad ways.  In terms of bad, it just makes me sad that the days of going to such shows are over.  I loved taking him to perfomances like this, but if he's bored or uncomfortable, then I guess I just need to go rent a baby.  As for good, well, it is good that he is aware of how he looks to some extent, maybe wanting to blend in with his peers, not wanting to be associated with little kids despite his secret video choices. Yet another sign of his growing up, and in way, a typical growing up thing to go through.  I mean,  did I tell people I secretly brushed my Barbie's hair till I was thirteen?.....Wait, I didn't write that did I?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SkvfBuqbqGI/AAAAAAAAAcU/imtWJxuiYWo/s1600-h/100_0954.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/07/hes-growing-upsniff-sniff.html", "title": "\nHe's Growing Up...sniff sniff......\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 26, 2009", "body": "\n Casey and I popped over to the local carnival last night, a bit spur of the moment.   We had planned to go swimming indoors, despite his doing so at camp yesterday and the rain that had sorta stirred me away from going to the carnival had actually disappeared.  The sky was clear and the air was noticeably dryer and cooler.  Who could resist... We had a nice time.  He suddenly wanted to go on more rides than he did last year, and he wanted to play the hokey games!  I brought a 20 dollar bill, assuming we would buy a treat and listen to music after walking around, as we always have in years past.  This sudden interest in all the things carnival was new, interesting, and frustrating since I was an idiot and didn't pull more out of the ATM. I managed to have enough for us to get a funnel cake, go on the old fashioned cars, and play one game which he lost of course 'CAUSE THEY' RE RIGGED I TELL YA!!! Sorry... Anyway, as we walked I couldn't help but get that sad, regretful feeling about all the kids that looked around Casey's age strolling the grounds in packs, laughing, teasing the opposite sex, going on the big rides, having the times of their lives.  And here's Casey, walking around with his boring mother. I began to resent these kids, resent their normalcy.  I began to wonder if Casey would ever have friends to walk around a carnival with sans supervision.   Could  he ever walk around a carnival sans supervision?  Will he ever experience life as it should be for a kid, fun, free, an adventure of sorts? Basking in my \"feeling sorry for myself\" attitude like a corn dog in hot grease, we passed a mom pushing her son in a wheelchair.  The boy was in his teens and looked like he might have severe cerebral palsy.  His limbs were crooked and very uncomfortable looking, tight.  His neck was turned so that his head was positioned to the side.  Your heart would go out immediately if you saw him. But, he was smiling and eating cotton candy.  He looked happy despite his obvious disability and discomfort. He was simply enjoying the carnival.  I looked over at the tall, strapping boy lopping along side of me and thought  \"He suddenly wanted to go on more rides than he did last year, and he wanted to play the hokey games! \" Fun is in the eye of the beholder I guess......and clearly, my boy and the cotton candy muncher weren't seeing what I was seeing.... At that, I told myself \"Get over it!\".\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SkUUs0pETCI/AAAAAAAAAcM/izEWBeh7YR0/s1600-h/20c8220d094261a8.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/06/cant-ya-just-have-fun.html", "title": "\nCan't ya just have fun?\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2009", "body": "\nWell, Mr. Casey D. has returned to Motown after a fabulous week in Indy!  He had a great time from all accounts (non of which of course were told to me by the good time boy himself).  His Aunts Sue and Cheryl split up the week, and both showed him a rockin' good time.  As mentioned in a recent  blog  entry, I don't think he really missed me at all but I guess that's a good thing. My dear sisters offered to bring him home Sunday afternoon and offered to stay and hang out for a day too.  I accepted, not wanting to make that long drive again in the same week!  Plus, I was a little hungover from a wedding we attended on Saturday...Hey, I don't get out much okay! So, Sunday, Father's day, started out okay.  No Casey made it seem a little less fatherly for Bill to be celebrating.  However his own  parents did come over so he could celebrate his Pop (it's really only fair, Ernie (Bill's Dad) has been a father far longer than Bill and deserves some recognition). We cleaned and prepared and I went to the store to buy some snackies to make the in-laws visit fun.  But when I got home, Bill quickly lead me out to the backyard in a panicked fashion.  Ricky, our youngest and most unliked at times feline, had made his way to the top of a tree in our backyard! Ahhhhhh, funny, funny.....So funny...........  And so, that was around 2pm.  The In-laws were on there way, stuff still needed to be done, and the cat was stuck in the tree! Long story long, after many failed attempts at trying to get this idiot down, and much concern on the part of my in-laws and ourselves, making it almost unfathomable for me to be a fab hostess like I usually am, we gave up around 2 am.  It was so sad, he meowed and meowed but nothing was bringing him down, not even the opened can of salmon we left high as we could on a branch.   I had called the fire department and as I told my story, the operator cut me off, and said they will not come and that I needed to put a can of cat food at the bottom of the tree and he would come down eventually?  Really?  A cat can smell cat food from 40 ft?  Really?........That damn salmon that I put high up probably didn't even make it's way to his nostrils!  On top of all this drama, my sisters who were bringing Casey back never arrived at the time we thought they would.  Freaking out, I called, to get both their answering services on their cells!  What the....?  Suddenly Cheryl called to tell me Casey had puked all over Sue's pillow she had brought in the back seat and they were taking care of things, not to worry!  Yeah, okay.... They finally arrived around midnight, and a sick but awake Casey seemed very glad to see us!  He was also excited to see his new room.  What then followed was  about 6 trips to the toilet for not puking, but the other end's activities.  So, between wondering if my little cat was falling off a branch out in the dark of night getting eaten by a raccoon and my son's mysterious and sudden onset bowel activity, non of us got much sleep! Things got better the next day.  Casey seemed to feel okay, despite more bathroom trips (finally remedied by some Immodium), I had to have our friend come with his lumberjack gear and get the cat out of the tree.  He had made it through the night miraculously, but somehow got even higher!  Kevin, our cat lifesaver, heroically made it up the tree and got the little ass down, risking life and some limbs (of my tree) to save the little jerk...... (he's really up there, just look at our friend and then go up and to the left) We later went and had Greek, made our way through IKEA, had some cinnamon rolls and coffee, drank some booze, watched the \"Bacherlorette\" (the sister's idea, not mine) and had a great time despite all the crap the had occurred!  They left this morning before I hauled Case off to his first day of camp, which is another blog entry entirely....and I was sad.  I miss them already...... If you don't have a sister, you really should get some....but not cats....don't bother........\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SkJEOps5wwI/AAAAAAAAAcE/ANEfnewhV5I/s1600-h/100_1053.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/06/comedy-of-errors-pre-caseys-return.html", "title": "\nA Comedy of Errors, pre Casey's Return....\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 20, 2009", "body": "\nFor the last two years, I have promised Casey that I was going to paint his room red (per his choice) every time he goes to hang out with the family in Indiana.  Yep, that's what I promised... So the first year, the time just got away from me and I just never quite got the old paintbrush out, and much to the disappointment of Casey, he came home to the same icky faded green walls and teddy bear border he'd known since he was born. The next time he was away, promises were once again made.  Well, in all fairness, I got the teddy bear border down.  I tearfully ripped down the last vestiges of Casey's babyhood, recalling the day when, bulging with pregnancy, my sister Sue and I put that border up, wondering at the cuteness of it when we were done.  It was sad, but change is good.  The border was down but the green wasn't.  Sadly, Casey was so wanting me to do something to his room that just this tiny change was much appreciated!  In other words, he took what he could get!  What a good mom..... Considering his latest visit was to last a week, I told myself that I HAD TO PAINT HIS ROOM.  Had to...  I really had no excuse.   The red was still on my mind since that's what I promised him it would be, but the more I thought about it, red is well, stimulating.  Actually, I've read it makes one hungry, but to me it's a busy hue, and I had to wonder if that would be a good idea for a room in which one had to go to sleep at night.  Considering the fact that we have to give the boy Melatonin sometimes just to settle him down to go to sleep, red might not be the all around best choice.  But I did promise.  Well,  four  walls offers opportunity for creativity, so I chose to paint one and half walls \"California Ruby\" red, and the other two and a half \"Almond Toast\".  Breaking up the red with a calmer, earthy tone seemed to make sense. I started on Tuesday, and as of today, I have all the walls done, with two needing touching up/second coat perhaps.  So I'm doing good.  He's coming home tomorrow and I'm anxious to try and run out and get him a new bedspread to go with the room's new \"big boy\" look.  I'm quite pleased with the results, and I hope he will be too, 'cause I'm not doing this for another 10 years! It's still a little strange to pass by and not see that nursery color.  I've sorta saved a little piece of those days though!  I was happy to discover that at one point in his baby days I tried to start a measuring chart of sorts on his door, and it looks like I only  got around to doing so twice, but it's there, and it's priceless.  I can still see the green, and I can physically see how little he once was.....Sorry Casey, I won't be painting that! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sj0tcj6rtrI/AAAAAAAAAb8/XQSHkDMmNAU/s1600-h/100_1003.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sj0tSJ4BBCI/AAAAAAAAAb0/HT__TntGpVI/s1600-h/100_0999.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/06/promise-kept.html", "title": "\nA Promise Kept....\n"},

There was no end of year party that the parents were invited to.  They did have a huge bowling party with some other classes that Tuesday before but parents weren't invited to that either.  I popped in anyway to see what was happening and say good bye to the teachers.   He was having a great time.  The alley was set up like Midnight Bowling with dark lights and fluorescent stuff on the walls, rock music blaring.  I was standing chatting with his teacher when he suddenly walked up and put his arm around her and did his little lovely smelling thing to  her  cheek.  Yes, I was jealous, I was.  But I'm glad he loves her so much.  On the last day, his teacher came out to meet me when I dropped him off to let me know that she will officially be his teacher again next year!  I was elated, but it got better.  The teacher Casey had in 4th grade is coming over to take the other AI teacher's place and he loves her too!!!!!  It's going to be teacher heaven next year and I am elated!  I told Casey about it but I think it's too far into the future for him to absorb yet, but not me! He made mention a few times the weekend after that he was going to miss Ms. M..  When I asked him why, he replied \"She adores me!\".  Like I don't.  Yes I was jealous....  Anyway, it's cool that he wasn't that thrilled to leave school, it may make going back for 6th grade that much easier. Casey is now with his Auntie Cheryl in Indy, being spoiled and being kept extremely busy.  I don't think he misses me...yes, I am jealous...but that's okay because he's having a great time and I am able to work without worrying about him.  He often talks of living in Indy, and I think he thinks his life would be like it is on summer break all the time.  Trips to the Children's Museum, lots of fast food, fun, frivolity, sweet Aunts who hardly ever get mad at him.  Since it probably won't ever happen, at least not in the near future, I'll let him live the dream.... I have personally felt a little like I'm on vacation, despite working.  As any parent knows, not having to be \"on\" all the time is so nice.  Not having to keep someone busy, entertained, worrying about someone's safety, feeling guilty if you aren't doing all those things every minute, that's a vacation in it's simplest form, for me at least. We're going to a wedding Saturday night, and out to see a movie Friday night, another movie with my dear friend tommorow...nice.  I have been working out, and cleaning, and organizing. Somehow though, there's always a little emptiness, missing little sounds, rather cute or annoying, walking by a room to see what someone is doing and no one is there.  It's weird.  I enjoy my time, but I know by Sunday, I'll be havin' a Casey \"jones\" and won't be able to wait to hug his chubby little self!   Separation does make the heart grow fonder, at least mine! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sjl0dKtKsfI/AAAAAAAAAbs/48wZwEp5yjU/s1600-h/100_0956.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/06/schools-out.html", "title": "\nSchool's Out!\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 29, 2009", "body": "\nAlmost a month!  Almost a whole month it has been since I have last blogged!  Shame on me. It's not like I had nothing to blog about. On the contrary, much has happened the last 4 weeks that would have made great fodder for a number of entries.  But alas, not a one has has made it's way here.   I haven't gotten any big requests for an entry, so I don't think I've dissappointed anyone, so that's good.  My 12 followers haven't started a petition to get me to do another entry, so that makes me feel like no when really gives a ..... But like I always say, I blog for myself, and the only one I should care about disappointing is myself !  Oddly, even I'm not that bummed.  I think it's only a genuine blog when one writes when they want to write and from the heart.  So my heart hasn't been into it lately. I have for some reason unbeknownst to me been capitvated by Facebook.  I spend a lot of time there.  It's cool, I've  reunited  if you will with some friends and family that I haven't seen or talked to in years, so there's that.  But my fascination with checking in to see status updates and to see if someone has commented on my own is really sorta weird for me.   At one point I just quit Facebook, didn't tell anyone, just did it, my apparant addiction startled me so. I had to be free, I had to stop checking to see if someone found my witty status remarks funny, I had to stop seeing who was online so I could chat them up even though they probably didn't want to talk to me, I HAD TO STOP! My friends were surprised and razzed me about it.  And within a week, I couldn't stand it any longer and got back on.  The only advantage to doing that whole martyrlike sacraficial act was that I was able to quietly ditch a person who I had accepted as a \"friend\".   He had been my manager years ago at one of my first jobs, and at the time, there was a group of us that partied together, and I always wondered if he had a crush on me.  I mean, he did buy me all the Cadbury Creme Eggs that were marked down after Easter in our store.  I think that says \"crush\" right there.  And although I took and probably ate them all, we never \"hooked\" up so to speak.  But alas, he found me on Facebook, and we   reunited . It was good to hear from him, but, he would send these daily queer heart things and happy faces and talk about Nascar and that was just about it for me, and so, I ditched him.  I quietly ditched him. I figured after a week of me not posting, he'd think I fell off the face of the earth. Facebook let's you do that.  I haven't be defriended yet that I know of but it could happen and I check periodically. If only real life could be that easy!  And so, that's what my life has been lately, in this order:  Casey, Bill, cats, work, housecleaning, trying to lose weight for the weddings coming up this summer, Facebook, email, fish.  Sad huh? I haven't even been reading other's blog.  I take that back, I have been reading the Queen of Autism blogging, Kristina Chew, formerly Autism Vox.  But then, she's my Facebook friend, and she posts when she blogs, so that way, I go and read, I don't have to seek things out. Facebook is just making things too easy. Reunions with people I haven't thought about for years, getting rid of people after I've met them, finding immediate approval about my status updates, reading blogs without seeking them out.  I couldn't do this without Facebook.  I  love  Facebook! I gotta go and post that I blogged now, on Facebook....... Hey, come over and look me up, Bonnie Stonebraker Davis.  But don't you dare defriend me!  http://www.facebook.com/inbox/?ref=mb#/profile.php?id=1174800152\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/05/facebook-is-my-friend.html", "title": "\nFacebook is my Friend\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 1, 2009", "body": "\nFirst off, for all you moms and dads who have little ones with Autism read  this  because I think it could really give you a little hope despite things you are or  aren't   doing for your kiddo. Go, read it, and then come back, I'll wait...tra la la la!....Cat!  Get off the sink!  Casey, don't chew on that!  Stop!  ugh..... Okay, sigh.....oh sorry, you're back...yeah, so anyway, did that make ya feel good?   I have to atest to it, Casey seems to get better every year, speech wise, independence, how he carries himself, all that.  He still has a ways to go, but he's come so far, and I believe that most of it is attributed to age, experience, maturing.  We have given him vitamins, lots of vitamins, tried the diet, done some therapies, mostly at school, and lots of love, but age has been the biggest \"magic bullet\" I believe.  So, despite all the things that are yet to come, there have been so many things that have gone away, thank GOD! Having said that, with age has come anxiety for Case.  He's been experiencing it mostly in the form of saying he's hearing voices in his head, and allowing them to drive him to the point of crying.  Another anxiety I think I've mentioned before was his problem with the year 2009, he hates it for some reason.  Of course, he hated Saturdays for about a 6 month period, and he's over that now thank God again (he actually said to himself in the toilet at the library last  Saturday  \"I used to hate Saturdays but now I think they're really cool\"!  Supports the age issue above I think, our attempts never helped, he got over it on his own for sure!) These are the two anxieties that have stood out. So, we took him to a doctor here who I had heard about for years, all good things.  I have known of her since he was around 3, and known a good many parents who have taken there kids there.  She's a medical doctor, I'm done with going to a DAN focused doctor.  The appointment was interesting, and long story short, she gave me two options for dealing with Casey's Autism as a whole: either try meds, or explore and stick to biomed with her support.   I really respected her at the point she said with no hesitation that in all her years of treating kids with Autism, biomed or otherwise that she has never \"cured\" one, nor has she seen a child who has been cured.  I respected her even more when she said she didn't look down upon parents who chose the medication route over biomed.  Biomed is a huge commitement and she understands that.  And with that, she prescribed Wellbutrin and told me to make an appointment in 6 weeks after trying the Wellbutrin, and we'll let her know how that goes and if we want to persue the biomed stuff. Well, it's been over 3 weeks since then, and I still have not tried the Wellbutrin.  I immediately got home and started reading about it online, and honestly, I can't find anything good about it pertaining to Autism, nothing.  If you have something to offer, please do so.  Plus all the stuff that it can cause, including thoughts of suicide, really frighten me.  So, other than a really good fish oil supplement that I found that she thought he could benefit from for his skin, I have given him nothing. On another note, allow me to brag for a moment 'cause lets be honest, we don't get to brag as much as typical parents.   This morning, we were watching the news over breakfast, his choice, and they mentioned the date March 17th as the day of something happening.  He goes \"They said March 17th!\" and I said \"Yeah?\" wondering what significance it held for him.  He answered, \"That was a Tuesday!\".  Really?  I walked over to the calendar, and indeed it was.  I started spouting off dates, one after the other, to which he would reply the exact day it fell on with no hesitation!  I was a little breathless honestly, I really was not aware of this skill he has (yeah, it's a splinter skill, whatever, it's a skill and it's cool), and I couldn't stop asking him different days.  He was never wrong on one, nor did he have to think more than a moment to answer.  Wowzer!  Do your kids have such skills?  I bet they do, please share in the comments section if you can.   I think I was so surprised about this because he hasn't really displayed a skill like this since he was little and put the US  and ABC puzzle together in minutes and he was only 2 or 3 years old.  Also, his math skills are so awful, at least on paper and trying to do homework, that I have to wonder if he is doing this mathematically or does he literally have the calendar page memorized in his head?  I wouldn't be surprised if it was the latter. One more thing, I have been reading an awesome book called  \"A Regular Guy-Growing Up with Autism\" by Laura Shumaker .  You really must read it.  I have to confess, I don't read much more than stuff on the internet and magazine articles, so it says a lot that I have commited to this book.  It's so interesting, relatable, honest, funny, sad, all that.  I like it because for the first half, I could relate, as Mrs. Shumaker's son is growing up, but now I'm at the point of learning, as she recalls his years from around 13 on.  I can't wait to find out what he was like as a teen and now.  Please, please, please read it.

{"date": "Friday, May 8, 2009", "body": "\n Yeah, that's a picture of Casey's hand.  Can you see those little spots?  Really?  Barely?  Yeah, us too!  But he has Ringworm and can't go to school! He's had these spots for a couple of weeks, me applying creams and lotions not sure, maybe wondering about Ringworm, but just trying on my own to extiguish it.  He never complained about it, scratched it.  It never bled, or oozed. It's on his right hand, his writing hand, the hand he uses ALL THE TIME.  There have been no other cases at school, it hasn't spread, no pandemic as it were. So, yesterday, his teacher, who I love, calls me from the bus on their way a field trip and starts asking me about the \"lesions\"....Lesions, geez.......Had I noticed them?  Of course, mother's notice everything.  Did I consider Ringworm?  No, I fibbed, not wanting to look bad.  Well, she was certain it was, she had seen many cases.  Would he wear a bandage to cover it?  No, I answered, I have never been able to get the child to wear one.  A glove she had wondered?  Sure, if you can find one! By the end of the day, she called to confirm that 3 other \"experts\" in Ringworm diagnosis had confirmed her suspicions and he would need to go to the doctor to get the final call.  If he had it, he would not be able to come to school tomorrow and not until the \"lesions\" cleared.  Are you kidding me? We went to the doctor, who literally asked after he did in fact diagnose it as Ringworm, \"is that all you came for?\".  \"Yes\" I answered in a sarcastic way.  He wrote a prescription and we were on our way. I know, I wouldn't want my child around a kid with Ringworm, if it looked like this: NOW THAT'S A \"LESION\" So, we're off to breakfast with Miss Eileen, and then the day is our's.  It's beautiful out too....yes, it is a \"lesion\".\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SgQkDXGw4YI/AAAAAAAAAbU/MLuapXBXN_Q/s1600-h/100_0795.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SgQmoaIzFjI/AAAAAAAAAbc/2mY369oZrFM/s1600-h/75a09cc1f3a5c42a.jpeg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SgQkDXGw4YI/AAAAAAAAAbU/MLuapXBXN_Q/s1600-h/100_0795.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/05/ringworm-around-rosey.html", "title": "\nRingworm Around the Rosey\n"},

Re: the note sent home yesterday about Casey pinching the gym teacher's butt..I checked with her and she said it was more like cupping her butt cheek. She was walking next to him trying to get him to run when he did it. He did go down to gym a little agitated as he wanted to stay in my room for the Earth Day Walk, so I think he was on edge to begin with and she then pushed him a little farther down the road. She took it with good humor, but...it really was inappropriate, especially when the other students see it. I am wondering if he could have gotten it from anything he watches at home - he said today that he was no longer allowed to watch Pee Wee Herman... I have a few questions. Did he \"cup\" or just \"place\" his hand on her ass?  Honestly, do they think he is getting any sexual gratification out of this at this age?  Having said that, he did ask me if I was wearing a \"bra\" the other day!  Hhhhhhmmmmm..... And, why didn't he get to go on the Earth Day Walk?  It was Earth Day, walking the earth would have been a good replacement for gym I would think.  I'd be agitated and touch the gym teachers butt too! In response to the question  I am wondering if he could have gotten it from anything he watches at home  , I would have to say no, we don't watch that haughty reality hit \"Whose Ass Can You Put Your Hand On?\", unless he's been sneaking around watching it!  Damn kid! Oh, and he lied, he does still watch Pee Wee, but, I have never seen Pee Wee or anyone on the show put their hand on someone else's ass.  What Pee Wee does out of the Playhouse is a differenet story all together and has no baring on Casey! So, yeah, it was inappropriate, I agree.  I told him so...but it's all still a bit funny.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 22, 2009", "body": "\n This, is Casey's new look.  The Faux Hawk.  Not a real Mohawk, but a Faux Hawk.  For those of you not getting it, it's a Mohawk like style gelled and sprayed out of a regular haircut.  There is no shaving involved, no permanency, although he has woken up with a Faux Hawk from the day before, a testament to the fine hair styling products we use I guess. I usually help him get his bedhead under control each morning and one day, just for shits and giggles, made it into a Faux Hawk, totally expecting him to flatten it down immediately.  But instead, he touched it delicately while admiring himself in the mirror, and walked away satisfied.  The next day, I asked him if he wanted the same, and he did, and thus began the era of the Faux Hawk. I'm not a trendy gal, so needless to say, I don't try to have a trendy child.  But after going to his school for something or other and seeing the other boys with an array of hairstyles beyond the realm of what I could have ever seen when I was in grade school, I considered this trendy move on our part.  Perhaps others will think he looks cool at least with the Faux Hawk.  Or, is it possible to look cool while regaling yourself out loud with one of your favorite commercials, despite whatever hairdo you might have?  Who knows?.... I even wrote his teacher a little note stating that I am not forcing the Faux Hawk upon him, but that he insists on it each morning.  She in turn replied that everyone loves the new look and even a teacher he didn't associate with came in to tell him how trendy he looked!  So, apparantly, the Faux Hawk is going over well all around. I'm a bit fascinated with this whole new awareness of appearance, because he truly has never cared much before about his clothing or hair or anything like that.  In fact, I'm very conscious of what he has on each day, just so he doesn't \"look\" like a nerd.  But I love that he is thinking about his hair and how it looks.  I love that he stands still and watches in the mirror the whole time I am creating the \"do\".  It's normal for kids to want to look cool, and if he thinks that he looks cool with the Faux Hawk, then he has some normalcy going there, and that's really cool!  Just a little sign that he's growing up I do believe.

Spring Break came up before I knew it, and I finally decided to take him there the weekend before, and then come back, work Monday thru Wednesday and then go back and spend the rest of his Spring Break in Indy.   He's having a great time.  At this very moment, I believe he is at some big indoor amusement park dealie driving racing cars with his Aunt Sue.  He loves Indy.  I know he thinks life there is awesome because he is only there short spans of time.  During these time spans, everyone caters to him and we try to do stuff that's fun for him, he eats out a lot, and gets pretty much whatever he wants.  I think he believes that's how things would be if he was there all the time.  Not to mention he has a great love for the local Indy news station.  Indy is a dream land for Casey.  While childless, I actually watched \"Twilight\" sans Bill in the room, too much of a chick movie I suppose.  (Having said that, he was watching \"Dancing with the Stars\" in the other room.  Hhhmmmm?.....)  I really enjoyed it, the characters were good, my disturbing attraction to the mysterious Edward was troubling and exciting at the same time (especially since I'm pretty sure the actor who played him is like 15 years younger than me, but a lot of other \"older\" broads have agreed he is alluring),and the story was great.  I didn't read the book, way too much trouble, but I think I might now. I have cleaned, worked longer without worrying about getting Casey off the bus, read some magazines, and tonight, we are going out with our dear friends to celebrate a birthday.  Margaritas will flow, and it will be fun.  I do however miss Casey immensely.  Isn't odd how when your kids around, you're constantly thinking about what you could be doing if you didn't have to mess with them?  And now, I have this time, and I'm missing him!  My sister keeps sending pictures over the cell of him enjoying Dairy Queen, or at this amusement park deal and I am jealous that I'm not there watching him have fun!  I guess I'm not as sucky a mom as I thought. And most importantly, he's having fun, and getting loved.  And even more importantly, we didn't have to get a babysitter and I can whoop it up tonight!

{"date": "Sunday, March 29, 2009", "body": "\nLast night we went on one of our traditional \"go see the latest kid crap movie\" with our dear friends who have two kids themselves.  We find that kids flicks are more bearable with other adults along for the usually boring ride, who are always happy and never embarressed to share a beer during the viewing!  Yes, the theater that we pick out on purpose has a bar, if it doesn't, we have flasks.  Call social services, whatever. So, lately when Casey goes to see a movie, he's been known to hum and literally jibber jabber through most of it, unless of course he's trying to get us to take him to the bathroom at least 3 to 4 times during the film.  Despite the fun concessions and gigantoid  soft drink I allow him to have, he still can't get into some of the movies we've gone to see lately. When my friend mentioned that the one we were going to see was in 3-D I was kinda curious and a little excited by the prospect.  Earlier this week, Casey had found some 3-D glasses in a magazine (or more like a little board shaped like glasses that you had to hold on your face to look at 3-D pictures in the magazine).  He actually asked me in his own way to make them stay on his face, so I punched holes and attached a string. As you can see, it worked out pretty well, and he was happy.  He wore them on and off the rest of the night and insisted on wearing them to school.  I took him a little later so people wouldn't see him coming in with them on.  I mean, I admit it, he looks a little goofy, but something about them and the way they make things look really appeals to him. Back to the movie!  Well, we got glasses going in, which were much better than the ones pictured.  I tell ya, 3-D has come a long way since I was a kid.  Things actually look like they are coming at you!  At one point, I actually thought a person had stood up and was standing in the way of the screen, but it was a character in the movie!  Whacky!  It kept Casey's attention too!  I noticed he would watch, hold his hand out, as if to touch what was coming at him.  Occasionally, he would look over the glasses to see what it looked like without.  He even leaned over to me several times and asked a question concerning the plot.  Comments were also made that were right on!  I was thrilled!   Lesson learned?  I guess in order for Casey to enjoy a movie, it has to be 3-D! It's all how ya look at it right?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sc-jvVEjF9I/AAAAAAAAAas/YhgquSAheoc/s1600-h/100_0634.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/03/3-d-makes-for-successful-movie-outing.html", "title": "\n3-D Makes for a Successful Movie Outing\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 31, 2009", "body": "\n Mr. L---, Our son, Casey Davis, is in your fifth grade vocal class. You may recall meeting me (Bonnie) prior to the Spring Fling last Friday.   Today, I attended the daytime performance of the Lewis and Clark presentation.  After watching the performance, I have to ask why Ms. M.'s and Mrs. S\u2019s students with ASD were not included in the onstage performances along with all the other fifth graders from general education and cross categorical classes.   With my video camera at the ready, I waited for the students with ASD (including my son) to have their chance to shine on stage with the other kids, but it never happened.  I did however, film them sitting in their places next to the other kids, standing when they were supposed to, holding their song sheets appropriately and following along, singing their hearts out.  Even one of the more severe students in the group was standing and singing, thoroughly enjoying herself.   This really angered and saddened me at the same time.  As I watched the students on stage, I noted a lot of different kind of kids.  Some did the choreography great, some stumbled a little, some sang with expression and some hardly opened their mouths.  None of them seemed like they were on the road to stardom, but you could tell that all of them were having a great time, and probably experienced pride in the fact that they were on stage for their parents and friends to see.  I just wish my son and his classmates had had this opportunity as well.     I tell you this in the hope that this scenario will not happen again and that Casey and his classmates will be included in any and all performances the school puts on.  Personally speaking, Casey had the lines memorized from the CD that was provided and he had been doing some of the moves that were in the show for the last month.  We just hadn\u2019t realized where the moves had originated from until I witnessed other students performing the same moves on stage.  Again, I just have to wonder why he didn't have the same chance to perform on stage as his fellow students.   Music is one of the greatest forms of self expression and shouldn't be limited by one\u2019s disabilities.     Thank you,  Bonnie and Bill D. We didn't got to the second performance this evening.  We went swimming.... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/03/email-says-it-all.html", "title": "\nAn Email Says it all\n"},

How can a man who I have practically idolized since he's come into the public sector say something like this?  I luv him, I luv his wife, I love that he's African American and is the president.  I love that his name makes people feel unstable, I love that he has a beer at basketball game and doesn't care if anyone sees him drinking it.   I guess his joke hits home because Casey goes to Special Olympics Swimming each Sunday.  He loves it, and so do all the other kiddos with varying degrees of some disability or another.  Non are a like, but they are a team, a group.   When he's done, the older swimmers come in, happy to be there, happy to be with their friends, happy to be part of a team.  If you have experienced any sort of Special Olympic event or practice, you know from where I speak.  It is truly \"special\", and  not  in a goofy nice use of the word for disabled people! So when you hear someone make such a comparison as the President did, it hurts a little.  It all goes back to the fact,  I believe, that the vast majority of people feel superior to those with disabilities, so it's easy to make such a joke about them, and unfortunately, it's funny to many. I don't know if President Obama feels this way.  I doubt he does, because I know he is a good person.  And I know it's easy to do. I know kids with disabilities have funny gaits, funny ways of speaking, funny characteristics, all which they can't help.  I know it's easy to use them as fodder in self deprecation.  I have done it myself over and over.  I can be the queen of insensitivity! Which brings me back to why I feel like I have to get on my soapbox about this whole thing. It seems to be happening more and more. Bill told me of a co-worker, during a discussion on Oscar winners, commenting that Dustin Hoffman should never have won for \"Rainman\".  He didn't understand why someone would get an Oscar for acting like a \"retard\".  I asked Bill if he said anything, considering his office mates know his son has Autism.  He didn't. I was working with my bosses boss this week when he was helping me do a little extra something that I usually do myself.  I joked that they need to hire assistants for us and he said \"Yeah, maybe we could hire some disabled kids!\".  Did I say anything?  Nope, I did not. So, is this passivity that Bill and I exhibited the norm?  Should we start speaking up when people make such comments, even if it might embarrass a boss, friend or co-worker, or President?  I know I've been taken to task for a comment I've made here and there.  It did embarrass me, put me on the defense even, but it made me think.  It made me be more conscious (especially since Casey was born) of what I say.   Do I stumble occasionally? Yes, I admitted to being the queen of insensitivity! And so, I am getting on my soapbox to say, with my bullhorn in hand pointing to you my audience, and symbolically to myself,  \"PEOPLE, THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK!  CONSIDER OTHER'S FAMILIES, CONSIDER OTHERS PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES, CONSIDER OTHERS FEELINGS BEFORE YOU REFERENCE A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE  TO GET A LAUGH!   THINK! That includes you President Obama, but I still luv ya!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://cbs2.com/entertainment/Obama.Special.Olympics.2.963712.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/ScOfMNA14QI/AAAAAAAAAZ8/eeO37zGWwHg/s1600-h/1df949a6e8e7e55e.jpeg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/ScOe7YixIzI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/1_nbxPumBGg/s1600-h/d3b0d8f74c1cdb52.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-my-soapbox-again.html", "title": "\nOn my Soapbox Again......\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2009", "body": "\nIf you are a regular reader to my blog, you know that for the most part I try to stay pretty upbeat.  I really don't want this to be a whining forum, because personally I find it boring. Most of my time spent with Casey and Bill is great, with it's normal family ups and downs, but nothing horrible, so I don't have much too complain or whine about.    Now having said this, I think I should use my blog more to get input from other Autie parents.  A lot people seem to get a lot of good advice as I read through comments on other blogs!  Free, great advice from people with world's of experience.  So I think I will take advantage of the possibliity of getting a bit of free and useful advice today and share something about Casey that's been happening as of late. First, I can't pinpoint an exact reason, or subject or time, that has to do with this, it's very random. \"This\" being these very strange times for Casey of total breakdowns with tears and true fear showing in this face and his not being able to quite get out what it causing the episode at hand.  Case in point, last night.   He was laying in bed when he suddenly started crying and saying that he had pictures in this head and he couldn't get them out of his head.  We began to gently interrigate him, but to no end, hearing everything about the \"picture\" as being the one his wall that I quickly took down, to pictures from the computer (\"Did you see something scary on the computer?\" we'd ask?  \"No\" he'd reply, fearful of losing computer).  He laid there and just cried, screeching out occasionally but we could never quite get out of him what he was upset about. He made his way into our bedroom where we have a tv hooked to cable and decided that watching a DVR'd show about a local news channels 60th anniversary would get the pictures out of head!  I laid with him and watched, and he did calm down, almost as if the diversion of the tv show helped, as he thought it would.  He eventually feel asleep, and slept fitfuuly all night. Sunday at Special Olympics swimming he cried and was flustered all during practice, siting that it wasn't 2009, but 2007.  This old debate has been going on for quite sometime now and I may have even blogged about it at some point.  He has a  thing about 2007, and I don't remember it as a great year, but he must.  Yet another mysterious thing that causes a breakdown. I could go on and on with little examples of these sort of episodes.  He's 10 now, and about as tall as me (I'm guessing 5'5, 5'6) and 125 lbs.  I am guessing that hormones maybe setting in although I have seen no evidence of puberty other than b.o..  I often fear that perhaps he might have some psychosis involved along with his Autism and it's starting to manifest itself.  Could he be schizophrenic?  He's afraid of mirrors and he is always afraid some toy that he hates is outside his bedroom window.  Or, has he had bad dreams that sort of manifest themselves in his memory so strongly that they even affect him when he's awake?  Or, is he acting out because of some other issue or emotion he is having that he's not sure how to deal with?  COME ON PEOPLE!  HELP ME!  YOU'RE ALL PSYCHOLOGISTS AREN'T YOU?!!!!! Speaking of, we do have an appointment with a doctor in May who is an MD and a psychologist who works a lot with kids with disabilities.  I am really anxious to see her and share this stuff with her.  Although I'm not really big on the idea of meds, I have to wonder if perhaps this is all anxiety driven and there might be something to help qualm all this craziness.   But still, tell me what you think, tell me your experiences, and if you haven't had any, send my blog to someone who has and ask them to comment.  I need all the help I can get!.....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sckyqi_88qI/AAAAAAAAAac/QysW8WO4gIU/s1600-h/100_0588.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/03/is-there-therapist-psychiatrist.html", "title": "\nIs There a Therapist, Psychiatrist, Psychologist, etc. in the House?\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 12, 2009", "body": "\nWow, I got a whole hour to myself!  So what do I do? Do I change the sheets on all the beds (all 2) which really should be changed? Do I workout my big fat butt that really needs to be worked out? Do I map out my work for tomorrow as I navigate the mean streets of Detroit, checking out new stores to call on for my boss, who chose to stay off the mean streets of Detroit herself? Do I make some spaghetti and fake meatballs and blog? YES!  That's what I am going to do, and still maybe have time change the sheets.  The rest can go to hell! Where should I start?  I suppose the latest on Casey and his school situation would be my best bet, considering this blog is about him primarily. So, he's doing great.  We have the whole day back to a routine that is working for him.  We get continuous great reports from his loving teacher, and he is just a joy to be around (for the most part).  You can tell his anxiety level has dropped profusely since getting back to his original classroom and out of a room that expected him to be just like all the kids.    His teacher and we have both noticed a lot more speech, conversational speech, coming out of him.  He initiates a lot of conversations, which is always awesome.   The mornings are a breeze.  No more mystery sicknesses, no more not getting out of bed, no more arguments.  He actually bounces around in the morning, eats great breakfasts, and is extremely cooperative.  It's amazing what a few changes at school can do for a boy. I recently went to Chicago for a 3 day meeting.  My mommy came and stayed to help Bill out with being there when Casey got home from school and what not.  Bill actually loves for her to come because she is a cleaning addict and feels she needs to be doing so at all times, in between watching various reality shows and Dr. Phil.  I joked to Bill that really the only difference of having her here instead of me is the clean factor (oh, and the whole sex thing can creep it's sick joking little head in there, but we'll let that go!!!)   I got to hang out with her a bit more when I got back and then Case and I took her back to Indy over the weekend.  It was fun visiting with the chicks in the family, including my lovely neices, who are usually pretty busy!  And we dyed my hair, on the recommendation of my neice and sister who are way hipper than I, and got it back to it's actual brunette tone.  It's still taking some getting used to coming from a drab washed out light brown/dark blond, but it's growing on me.  No, I will not include a photo. Disturbingly, our basement is flooding right now.  No standing water (yet) but just water flowing into whatever drain it can reach, drenching part of our carpet, forcing us to wear rubbery shoes each time we go do laundry.  We had to use various workout equipment pieces to build a 'bridge' for the kitties to reach the litter boxes so they don't have to slosh through the wet carpet.   It sucks, but I am trying to tell myself much worse things could be occurring.   Billy's 45th b-day is this weekend so a lovely dinner with our family has been planned.  Should be fun!  I still hate that he's 5 years older than I and looks younger.  Oh well. And that's about it!  I kinda feel like I just produced one of those nerdy Christmas letters people send out with their cards each year.  Around here, we enjoy having Bill do dramatic readings of such letters, much to my amusement.  Everything is always wrapped up in a pretty little package in them, and those who wrote them always seems to have it just a little better than we do!  I hope you don't come away with that same feeling after reading this...I mean we can't all have a flooding basements and old husbands! I gotta go strain my sgetti....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sbmr-mQ5_eI/AAAAAAAAAZc/AOcu_MWmGgY/s1600-h/100_0560.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SbmqjDv2M5I/AAAAAAAAAZU/u6F0N6DseJY/s1600-h/100_0516.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/03/just-bunch-of-stuff.html", "title": "\nJust a Bunch of Stuff\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 16, 2009", "body": "\n As I drove up my driveway today, I noted a box by the side door.  As I got closer, I could read the name on the outside of it,  the company that I order monthly from to get Eco friendly cleaning stuff and body stuff and vitamins.  I believe I mentioned the company in one of my prior postings, but I'm not even going to link you to it.  When I do mention the name, or talk about how much I like this or that, people always think I'm trying to sell them something, but I'm not, and thusly, I don't want you to think that either... again, I'm not trying to sell anything. Whenever I get these shipments, I get this little flutter in my chest, like you do when you get a present from someone who you know buys really good presents.  I know what's going to be in there, I ordered the stuff. It often eludes me at that point what it is I ordered, it's usually been a little short of a week since I made my order,  so it's sorta like a surprise to open.  Often, I order things I've never tried, and since it's mail order only, I've only seen pictures, and never had the chance to smell or hold the item.  Yet another exciting aspect, for me, to get my box from #$(!$(@#$%.  It's sorta goofy that something like this can make me this giddy, but it does, and maybe that's a small part of the reason I order this stuff, other than I think it's awesome and know it works great. My point of sharing this sorta of pathetic little tale is the idea that isn't it great in life that such little things can make us giddy, give us a little happiness and/or excitement in such a bursty fun way that it can really give you something to look forward to.  For me it's little things, like getting this box once a month.  It can also be something so small as getting my favorite Fage Greek yogurt with honey on the side at Trader Joe's and knowing it's in the frig, waiting for me later that night.  It's buying a new thing of eyeshadow and trying it out.  It can be knowing I need to go to PetSmart to load up on cat and fish supplies and having an excuse to go over and visit the homeless kitties.  Just silly little things that perk up my spirit. And really, in this day and age of watching one's budget, not taking trips very often, not really going out on big shopping sprees, or eating out as much as we used to, it's nice to have little things to bring out that feeling of giddiness.   Now, you're probably thinking, \"Uh, what about Casey's awesome time at school?  Doesn't that make you giddy?\".  Of course, something like that makes me ecstatic!  Anything with Casey doing well or progessing is a blessing from above!  But the little things I speak of are strictly for me, my little joys in life and no one elses,  my  special little treats! So, what makes you giddy? PS:  although the woman in the picture above is looking excited and GIDDY, it's not me!~ \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/Sb7Gd51qFwI/AAAAAAAAAZs/kdvfYuccMxY/s1600-h/9d9f8e14d6335e94.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-makes-you-giddy.html", "title": "\nWhat Makes You Giddy?\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 5, 2009", "body": "\n Gosh it seems like forever since I last blogged, and gosh, it seems like I start out most of my blogs in this very fashion!  What is my deal?  Okay, I have been in Chicago for the last 3 days for a stupid meeting all about the stupid field I'm in.  I really didn't seek out computer access while there, and not having it readily available (unless I paid out 6.95 on my credit card for who knows how long on in the hotels media center),  became somewhat of a respite for me.  I really find myself to be a self made slave to the computer.  My job has me out in the field for most of the day, so I don't have one where I am at the computer all day.   So, before I even feed my hungry critters (Casey not included in this group, he's usually still snoozing), I hop on and check email, check Facebook, check my work email, check  PerezHilton.com.  Then, while Casey and I are having breakfast, I go through them again.  I'll shoot off a funny \"wall\" comment on Facebook, reply to something my boss sent a general email about, check to see if someone commented my blog. I'm off to school and work, and then I get home about 15 minutes before Casey's bus, and what do I do?  I get on and check all the aforementioned again.  Wow, it's been 7 hours, and nothing new!  Imagine! Casey gets home, hops on the computer.  It's his down time okay!  Sue me.  Suddenly he runs into the toilet, and I quietly rush over and start to check Facebook, someone has to have commented on my status by now, 'cause it's funny right?.....\"Mommy's on the computer!\" shouts Casey as he's furiously pulling up his pants running from the bathroom, not flushing.  Nobody commented on my status, and I got an email from Kmart.com about their latest sales....yawn. I finally kick Casey off to persue other interests (ie Pee Wee videos, and Pee Wee videos, and oh, Pee Wee videos).  I hop on once again to see all the activity that has occured in the 45 minutes since I last checked.  Ha ha  oh look, Rebecca commented on my status...oh look, someone sent me a green beer for St. Pats Day.  Send one back?  Ignore....Casey's teacher just emailed to say he had a good day.  Well, that was worth stopping and checking for at least.  No one has commented on my blog.  Maybe because I haven't been on it for about a week.  Go figure. Yes, I am pathetic.  I will say that I actually canceled my Facebook account for  almost  a whole week!  Yes, I know, what a sacrifice.  I know.  I have to confess though that I did get on Bill's account, just to see if anyone commented on my sudden disappearance.  There was a mild wave of curiosity, but I don't think anyone particularly cared.  But, just as my dear friend predicted, I was back in less than a week!  I couldn't stand it.  But I have to ask, what was it that I was missing? Is it a feeling of being connected to others?  Is it being part of something that everyone else is?  What is it that makes one feel that they have to constantly be checking for recognition?  What I ask you, makes me give a rat's ass if someone reads my blog?  I swore I was writing it for myself!  It's crazy! And so, I sit here now, writing this entry, which is pretty self deprecating and a little embarrassing.  I'm guessing though very relatable?  Right?.....perhaps you'd like to comment?.....I'll be checking later.....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SbAhHMDpELI/AAAAAAAAAZM/mnmZnMsiCQg/s1600-h/13e277655b23b704.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-is-wrong-with-me.html", "title": "\nWhat is Wrong with Me?\n"},

I know I sure wish I could have gone to one as a child. This mainstream schooling is nonsense. xo -comment from DJ Kirby Thank you  Ms. DJ Kirby !  Her comment really made me think this morning when I read it.  She left it on my last entry concerning Casey's problems and impending solutions to said problems.  Her comment really puts things in perspective for me.  I actually feel better about \"going backward\" so to speak, and it sorta wipes away my feelings that we failed in this whole endeavor.  Again, thanks!! I got two calls from the special ed. administrator yesterday, concerning their ideas on how to work with Casey's schedule to allow him to go back in to the AI room (Autistically Impaired-ugh, really need a better title) permanently, but still allow him some times during the week in which he could be with the other class during periods where he did well with them (ie, gym).  Long story short, I really approved of all their ideas and it appears a successul plan is underway.  (She says letting out a sigh of relief.)  I made a huge point of saying he no longer goes by that stupid discipline plan when he's with the other class, and he will never again lose lunch and recess with friends.  The administrator heartily agreed. Yesterday was his first day back to the norm somewhat.  He came home a happy camper, and I recieved an email from his teacher  titled \"Woo Hoo!\": Hi Bonnie, Just wanted you to know Casey had an awesome day all day and completely deserves the computer at home. He was happy all day long, focused, worked hard, a bit hyper verbally, but not in a stressed way, just excited way. We had Brain Gym with Mr. Z. today who is bald and Casey said to him, \"Well, I guess you don't have to brush your hair!\" He took it very well and it was fun. This morning I was walking in the hall after talking with Casey about how he would be in our room all the time now except for Gym and I said to him in the hall that I was so glad he was in school today. He said, ever so softly, \"Me too, Mrs. M.. It makes me feel very special.\" My heart!!! Totally made my weekend. Hope you have a great weekend and a good trip. Take care, J. Ahhhhh, something good for a change.  Dare I say things may be looking up?!  I am sure there will be more to report...... Back to DJ Kirby's comment for a minute.  For awhile, I was really into the whole concept of inclusion, mainstreaming, etc..  He did it last year somewhat successfully, however you define that.  But this year, when he started going to Social Studies and Science, the work was extremely difficult.  He was sent home study guides that he basically memorized with no real concept of what he was memorizing.  From all reports, the classes had become mostly lecture, and note taking oriented, which his para did for him since he was usually just trying to keep it together to behave properly. The kids in that classroom never contacted us to have Casey come to a birthday party, or a slumber party, last year either.  Granted, he wasn't a fixture in the classroom all day.  And I doubt if I had him fully included he would have been either, probably spending a great deal of his day in a resource room. But, say what you will about his AI classroom.  Sure, the kids aren't overly verbal and there are only three.  They usually are in their own world somewhat, but in some ways, I believe there is a commonality among kids with Autism, just as there is with children who love hockey, or kids who love Legos.  I have to wonder, especially as they get older, that despite all their overt lack of social skills and social resiprocity, if they might find comfort in being with like beings, as DJ said in her comment?   Of course kids with Autism need to be exposed to children who speak and interact, and who behave somewhat properly.  However, I don't think sitting in a classroom hearing a teacher spout off information that you're barely taking in is any kind of good social situation, especially when there are 30 kids around you.  You have major sensory issues, and these 30 people whose faces you may not even really \"see\"are whispering, cracking their knuckles, tapping their pens on their desks, coughing, the flourescent lights are buzzing, a fan maybe blowing.  And all this may be magnified 100 x's over, depending upon your sensory issue or issues.  SENSORY OVERLOAD!  No, this can't possibly be beneficial for most kids with Autism, in my opinion.   Bring one or two \"typies\" into a smaller room, set up social situations.  Allow them to play a game, to practice proper social interaction, take turns reading, etc.  This is hopefully what's going to happen for Casey and his fellow AI classmates.   And in the meantime, allow them to do their work, to learn what they can learn, the way they can learn it in a small room, with a few kids like themselves, somewhat on the same behavior and developemental level, with staff who knows about Autism.  Let them learn at their own pace, and in ways that are of interest to them, not the general populous. Sorry this is so long but I feel strongly about all this.  In a perfect world it could all make sense I think.  In a perfect world.......\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://djkirkby.blogspot.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SalKL9QAY2I/AAAAAAAAAY0/pUjBZEQ1RN4/s1600-h/100_0480.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/02/dj-kirby-inspired-me-today.html", "title": "\nDJ Kirby Inspired Me Today!\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 27, 2009", "body": "\nSo it's been quite awhile since I've blogged.  It's been a busy and weird, somewhat irritating and difficult couple of weeks, Caseywise.   The whole trial and error period of his going  into the different classroom part of the day turned into, after extensive conversation and brainstorming in a meeting with the staff, his being able to chose whose room he wanted to be in a certain points of the day.  Sometimes, he couldn't choose, because he had to go to Specials (gym, art, etc.) with the new class.  What came out of this was that he basically chose to be with his original class when ever he had the choice! When choosing became an option, his anxiety didn't seem to go down, his faking sickness to go home hadn't stopped, and his overall snotty demeanor continued.  Finally, after a few episodes of breaking into tears, he explained in his way that he hated the new kids.  I'm thinking the kids in his newer class situation.  Come to find out at yet another meeting, they have a new student in his original classroom, who, apparently, is quite verbal, and is giving Casey a run for his money in the argumentative department. This new kid likes to set Casey straight on what year it really is when Casey wants to pretend it's 2007.  This other boy  vehemently denounces Casey's fantasy with facts and that has caused quite a bit of upset in his original comfy enviorment.  Oh good, more stress on the child! His teacher thinks this could be a good thing in terms of bringing out more conversation and interaction, but so far, most exchanges between the boys have been less than friendly. Anyway, on top of this, he consistently gets in trouble in the new classroom, episode after episode of trouble.  According to one report, after being told to stand by a parapro, Casey came at her, hands out as if to hit or scratch.  They reported that he said he was going to hit her.  I had to wonder, was this after you asked \"Casey, were you going to hit Mrs. D.?\".  Hhhmm, sounds like a good idea ,\"Yes\" he had answered.  But was he really?  Doesn't sound like our boy, and if indeed he was, why is he suddenly being so physical when he never was before? To follow this little joyous occasion up, he lost lunch and recess with his \"friends\" for 3 days as a result.  Wow, isn't that a great idea for a punishment for a kid who literally is dying for social interaction!?  Even if he doesn't want it or care about it?  Ugh....HE needs it!   The next day, he got in trouble once again when he shouted \"stupid asshole\" at the same parapro who he seemingly came at the day before!  Oh, and she was the same one too who he had scratched a few weeks ago.  Coincidence?  By the way, we are not taking responsibility for the \"stupid asshole\" comment as I have never called Bill that.  I've called him other things, but that is a Casey D. original! And so, long story long, it was decided that all this is not working, they aren't working with us, they aren't going to work with us, Casey needs consistency and to be able to get back into working on IEP goals.  Most importantly, the kids needs to be worked with properly, and he needs to be around professionals who know how to do so. As of today I hope, he will not have to make any choices, and will have a nice consistent day of work, and play, and arguments with new kid.  I guess he has to have a little stress, right? (PS: if there are grammatical errors or just nonsensical sentences in this blog, please forgive me, I don't have time to edit right now)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/02/another-journey-has-endedthank-god.html", "title": "\nAnother Journey has Ended...Thank God!\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 14, 2009", "body": "\n HAPPY VALENTINES DAY EVERYONE! I hope your V-day is all you hoped it would be and more!  Personally speaking, I have to laugh at how my expectations about Valentines Day have changed over the years. For some reason, when I was in my teens and early twenties, Valentines was extremely important to me.  Sadly, I never had a boyfriend until I was 18, and even then he was a bit of prick who never really bought me anything for Valentines.   In highschool, they had this little deal where you could buy Valentines hearts, address them to friends and then at the end of the day, they would be delivered.  I recall begging some guys, in a coy way, who were my friends, to buy me one.  My girlfriends and I of course always bought eachother one so we were guaranteed something being delivered.  I remember watching as the stereotypical pretty, popular girls got their pile of Valentines hearts and I would get like 3, from my two best friends and some guy that took pity.   In my early twenties, I worked at a grocery store, and if memory serves me right, I actually begged (there's that word again), or actually hinted profusely to all the guys I worked with that it sure would be fun to get flowers on Valentines, even though I had no interest in them.  My friend at the time, who I suspected was gay, came through with a haggard bouquet of red carnations...awwww. I dated a guy for awhile who was fun but who I was really not overly attracted to.  He was smitten with me (who knows why, I don't even think I put out, sorry, had to say it) and a few days before Valentines offered me a proposition.  If I would commit and be his girlfriend, he would show me a Valentines like I had never known.  Roses, jewelery, candy, and dinner out had been promised.  Being the Valentine whore that I was, I actually considered it, thinking I could break up after the festivities, before I was expected to put out.  But my conscience got the better of me and I declined.....my Mom still see this guy working at the same grocery chain we worked at together all those many years ago.  Weird.  Nice guy though. And so I married the lovely Bill, who has come through for many years on Valentines, always surprising me with a lovely flower arrangement and sweet card.  For some reason, I'm always surprised and delighted. This year, he's sick.  He wasn't out and about to do what he usually does on Valentines, and I don't care.  I put a kibosh on flowers considering our newest addition, the kitten from hell, who would have his way with a bouquet quicker than flies on s&*#.  Casey missed his Valentines parties at school due to a big bad case of diarrhea, so that was a bummer for him. To make up for all of this, I ordered Case and I the \"love pizzas\" from Papa Romanos and got Bill a special pint of Ben n' Jerry's since that is one of the few festive things that sound good to him.  I know, we are serious partyers and we need to settle down, but we know how to celebrate! When I got home from picking up these items, there on the counter was a card from my boys.  I was again surprised and delighted....at this point in my life, it doesn't get much better than this.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SZdgq9GV41I/AAAAAAAAAYs/b1jN_GT4uWs/s1600-h/65ce42a022f14d50.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/02/confessions-of-valentines-whore.html", "title": "\nConfessions of a Valentines Whore\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 10, 2009", "body": "\nCasey's teacher called around 2:30 this afternoon to report that Casey was complaining of a stomach ache.  She explained that he hadn't really complained much all day until they were coming home from a field trip, and when he had to go to the other class, that he hates. The she told me that he said he didn't want to ride the bus home and have to wait for the other 4 kids to get off before him.  She also reported that he had had a healthy bowel movement at school (good to know!)  There has been, she reported, some bug going around, so maybe that could be it but he did seem fine most of the day. So, being a good mom, despite the fact that nothing had really been proven, and despite that he only had one hour to go, I got my work done toot suite and got on the road. As I rounded the corner to the hall leading to his classroom, I could hear him before I could see him saying \"OK \"blank\" upper elementary school ( I'm hiding the name of the school to protect the innocent), I'm going but I'll see ya later!  This is the end of the Casey show at \"blank\" upper elementary!\".  Wow, he sounded so sick! His parapro looked at me and said \"He seems fine now!\".  Great. I hauled his little ass to the grocery and he picked up a Butterfinger, always good for an upset stomach.  I got him some ginger ale, just in case he wasn't really feeling good, but I really had my doubts. In the car home, I asked him if he felt OK and he said he didn't have a tummy ache but a cough, followed by a fakey hacking cough sound.   I believe he fooled his teacher and me. Duh, really? I have to wonder though about the bus issue.  He is the closest to school so he's the last to get dropped off, so maybe it seems like a long ride, but I'm surprised he'd go to such extremes to avoid the ride, let alone put so much thought into getting out of it. Somehow, the stripes seem appropriate!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SZInfJlaAtI/AAAAAAAAAYk/JGWWjb70UDw/s1600-h/100_0485.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/02/i-got-dupedi-think.html", "title": "\nI got Duped...I think!\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 13, 2009", "body": "\nI do, I hate You Tube....Do you want to know why I hate You Tube?  Well, I'll tell ya!  I hate You Tube because if it weren't for You Tube, Casey wouldn't have been standing with me at the checkout desk at the library, the quiet library, and he wouldn't have said \"Welcome to the wonderful world of playing with yourself!\" in a very loud announcer like voice. The friendly librarian feigned not hearing him and proceeded quicker than before the comment was made to get us checked out.  I was, well, appalled. I know that You Tube in and of itself can be fun and cool.  I personally have found some great stuff on there.  How often are we emailed a funny YouTube video that we proceed to check out?  Sometimes it can be educational.  I found several very interesting videos posted when I was trying the gf/cf diet oh so many years ago.  YouTube has it's positives, especially for it's entertainment value if nothing else.  I still hate it because Casey is addicted to it.  I know, scream at your computer \"Well then don't let him watch it you idiot!\", I hear ya, I know!  I know.  But sometimes he gets on there when I don't know, or he'll be innocently checking out the multitudes of bits and pieces of kids videos or old commercials when something just really gross will pop up before you know it! Case in point, he loves Pee Wee Herman as I have reported in past posts.  So, for some reason, someone felt the need to post snippets of the Pee Wee's Playhouse on YouTube.  I don't understand one's need to this, but, it makes Casey happy, despite the fact that he has most of the videos of Pee Wee's Playhouse.  This is what he has chosen to watch as of late, innocent enough. But, suddenly, I\"ll hear \"the laugh\".  It's hard to explain but it's just this little laugh he does when something isn't quite appropriate for him to watch.  It's a bit evil in tone, but oddly, loud enough, and different enough for us to know he's watching something he shouldn't, as though he wants us to catch him in the act. \"The laugh\" made itself heard recently and I immediately ran over to see what was so \"funny\".  A few minutes before, it had been Pee Wee, but now, it was a video of Howard Stern, the gross shock jock, doing his own version of Pee Wee's Playhouse, called \"Pee Wee's Play with Myself House\".  As if this isn't inappropriate enough, Stern is dressed like Pee Wee, and is acting like he's masturbating under a blanket along with a bunch of other guys dressed like some of the characters from the real show.  Needless to say, it was really disgusting, and creepy, and not funny  AT ALL , especially for a 10 year old to see.   Don't get me wrong, I am not a humorless person, I crack up at all kinds of stuff, dirty, bawdy, inappropriate sometimes.  But why is it funny to take a children's show and make it into something like this.  Worse yet, why should it be connected to a line of video snippets that a child might me checking out?  Why can't YouTube either block things in some manner or perhaps have a separate website that you have to pay for to see really adult stuff?  They know kids are on there.  I don't care what kind of warnings they give.  Why can't there be some filter? So, I am pretty sure that is where today's comment in the library came from.  It just makes me sad.  I love that he is so innocent in so many ways still, but already, his little brain is aware of something like that, and even worse, that it can be construed as funny or shocking, which is why I think he said that today, just to get a reaction.  I don't know how much he knows about anything, but if he's going to learn, I certainly don't want to be from watching Howard Stern fake masturbating. I guess the filter I mentioned before will just have to be me.  Me not letting him watch You Tube!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/02/i-hate-youtube.html", "title": "\nI Hate You Tube!\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 7, 2009", "body": "\nJust when I start to think Casey's drive to have a friend has severely diminished, a simple trip to the pool puts my fears to rest.   We went to the pool last night while Dad worked out, me praying that the kid talked about  here  wouldn't be there and we would be able to swim with no one bugging us. When we walked in I noted a child that looked familiar and realized it was the brother of a boy who Casey had formed a friendship with at his old school.  I suddenly became aware of his parents and finally the boy himself all hanging out in the pool.   I have to confess, I'm a bitch.  I had issues with the mom of this kid somewhat, our personalities collided a bit, and I'll admit it, I let Casey's friendship with this boy fizzle because I was selfish.  I didn't want to have to deal with her, and so I chose to forgo Casey having a friend so I didn't have to feign pleasantries.  Yes, in this case I suck. I struck up a conversation with the boy's parents and Casey found his old friend almost right away.  It was actually very nice to talk to them,  and with their son being a year younger than Casey, the conversation revolved around the school Casey is at now, which is where their son will be attending next year.  All the while, we scanned the pool, they for their little one, Autistic, and the boy who was Casey's friend, also Autistic, and me looking for Casey, mainly to make sure his trunks weren't falling down or that he wasn't splashing someone inadvertently. Suddenly we noticed that Casey and M.(I will call the friend this because I'm not real sure if his mom would care if I used his real name or not.) were off in the corner of the pool really, well, hanging out together!  M. is quite a busy guy, being afraid of nothing, and was sorta jumping in with daredevil preciseness backwards, sideways, anyways, all the while Casey giggling and egging him on.  Then Casey decided to jump in too, something he hasn't done in a long while.  Later they were wrestling like two little typical guys, acting the fool and splashing anyone in their way.  They were having a great time.   The interaction was sorta new, having been more of a parallel play back in the early days, and it was exciting and fun to watch.  I was thrilled. Miraculously, Casey even almost went down the water slide with M., but chickened out at the last minute, but he followed him up the stairs, and then realized that he is scared to death of the slide and made his way down.  Perhaps their next meeting?  Who knows? M. is about Casey's \"level\" developmentally, not quite as talkative, but a really good boy.  They even look at little alike. His birthday parties had been one of the few that Casey had ever been invited to, he was one of the few kids Casey ever talked about.  I had ruined all this for him because I was a wench.  I guess I was given a second chance last night, and watching their interaction made me realize that my comfort level with his mom was so unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  I was grateful I was given a chance to let him have his friend again...... And so today, I had planned on taking Casey to a local concert, and picked up the phone and invited M..  His mom was elated as she had a lot to do and was worried that M. would be bored.  Casey and M. had a great time singing Veggie tale tunes together in the car, dancing at the concert, playing in the play land at McDonald's.  I basked in the glory of watching our boy be interested in another kid, and that kid in him.  M. is coming over Thursday for a play date.   A little bit of normalcy can go such a long way.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/100_0470.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/02/happy-reunion.html", "title": "\nHappy Reunion\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 6, 2009", "body": "\nWell let's see, each day this week had some sort of marked event but I have to confess I truly try to put them out of my mind.  Some that stand out were my meeting with the teachers Monday morning, Casey getting written up for scratching a parapro, and oh, the in school suspension on Wednesday for hitting a kid on the arm.  No big deal right? The meeting Monday was a bit of a cluster fuck.  Excuse my language but it's my blog!  And it was a cluster fuck.  It went on for over an hour and a half with 2 teachers, a parapro for part of the time, and the administrator for special ed.  Keep in mind, this was all prior to Casey's juvenile delinquent like behavior the rest of the week (oh, wait the scratching incident was happening  while  the meeting was in progress..ha ha...sorry).  Long story short, after discussing the issues, we decided that for a couple of weeks they would give him the option of choosing what classroom he wanted to go into, his old or new one, and at what points he did it.  This way, they believe they can feel out where and when he's most comfortable and if he chooses one over the other, then that is where he might have to stay....do you see why I called it a \"cluster fuck\" now?  I just sat and listened and nodded and watched as the two teachers involved feverishly looked over their colliding schedules and went back and forth and did a lot of \"what ifs\" and \"that's not going to work for me at\".  Whatever.  I am looking at it this way.  Neither class is perfect for him, so if he gets to choose where he is, and he's getting his work done, and is happy and not getting written up every five minutes, than so be it.  And it's only for a couple of weeks.  So that's that.   So, the scratching incident.  I guess he was getting his computer time reward (geeze) and when he was told to get off (and boy howdy, there was a frickin novel explaining their steps of doing this-way to cover your asses ladies!) he didn't, got warned again, and when the parapro finally tried to grab the mouse, he scratched her!  Broke the skin too!  I gotta cut his nails....but I digress.  Seriously, it was bad, but boy, I tell ya, I get this kid off the computer all the time and never get scratched. I know he was wrong for the most part, but I just have to ask what were they doing wrong?  There was something, a step, not being taken to set him up for success.   Keeping in the physical brutality vein, his smacking the kid's arm was yet another situation where I have to say, what was done wrong?  Apparently his \"peers\" in his  new class have taken it upon themselves, as I learned in the cluster fuck meeting, to do a little discipline of their own,  friendly  discipline mind you, with a wink and a nudge apparently, as was reported by the new teacher.  She seemed to think this was a good thing but finally admitted that the kids do \"shush\" him a lot with their little innocent fingers pushed to the lips.  So, a kid did this to him, and I guess he slapped him on the arm!  First off, when I was in school, no one disciplined me but the teacher, and had another kid told me to \"shush\" I think I would have been mortified (my much ballsier sister Sue would have slugged them too, and she is not Autistic, we think, hee hee).  I don't know that having fellow students being allowed to offer friendly discipline is a great idea, especially for their own safety.  He got reprimanded for the slap at school, and that was that. He finally told me the night of the slapping incident, out of the blue, \"I don't want anymore office referrals!\".  I guess that's what they call their stupid punishment system.  I lectured him a little, feeling secretly proud that perhaps all this  was  having some impact.   I go back to my view on the whole thing, they aren't setting him up for success.  I tried to offer suggestions.  And yet, they continue.  I have to wonder, who  really   is the one in need of some disciplinary action?  Don't get me wrong, I know he's not an angel, but I know his potential.  I know, in the immortal words of his preschool teacher, \"he can rise to any occasion\".  They're just not helping him do that! On the bright side, he got a haircut the other night and he was awesome and now at least looks  like an angel! Does this look like the face of a juvenile delinquent?  I ask ya, does it?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/100_0465.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/02/week-in-review.html", "title": "\nThe Week in Review\n"},

{"date": "Friday, January 16, 2009", "body": "\n I sat in awe yesterday as I watched the news coverage of the plane that landed in the Hudson River yesterday!  To tell the truth, I think I was more in awe of the fact that something like this ended so well more than the pilot's skill, how it landed, etc..  It's seems in this day and age, the news is always, well, bad.  Just bad, bad news.  The war in the Gaza Strip, the finding of the remains of that poor little girl in Florida whose weird mother might have killed her, the horrible cold snap that is really debilitating large parts of the country.  The list goes on.  But there I was, watching a \"Special Report\" the even interrupted the great Oprah, reporting the fabulous news that 155 people had lived through landing in a freezing cold body of water and lived to tell the story!  Awesomeness! So, at this point, the silly thought I mentioned in the title suddenly invaded my mind.  I had just been to a presentation on  Brain Gym  the night before, which is based on a lot on good energy, and how if you present good energy to a child or those around you, it will come back to you.   Well, (and let me preface my statements right now by saying, if you hate Obama, or you're gonna hate me for being positive about him, or just hearing about him in a positive light in general, x out now), perhaps the excited energy coming from the population due to Obama's upcoming inauguration sorta flowed to that plane, to that situation, and thus, the safe landing. Yes, I know that's silly, that's why I said a\" silly thought\", Silly!  But it would be nice to think that if we could all produce that much positive energy, horrible things, like plane crashes, could be diverted.  Murderers would feel the wave of what I picture as rainbows emulating from our bodies and think \"Bad idea!\", our enegry waves would combine and push the cold out, our energy waves would make companies let go of one over paid white collar nerd to allow 3 blue collar hard working folk to hang on to their jobs.  Ah, one has to wonder what the power of positive energy could do if millions had it. I brought up the whole Obama thing because that's something I can personally say is causing me to emit a lot of positive energy, it's very exciting.  It makes me feel like I feel when I put a fresh coat of paint on the wall and everything is fresh and new and the old is covered and forgotten.  And thus, this Obama Energy is what lead to my evilness alluded to in my title! A great friend of mine who happens to be a staunch Republican and I were discussing the crash on the phone this morning, and I started in on my whole Obama Energy theory.  I knew it wouldn't go over well as I said it, but I said it anyway just to, just to well, first express my thoughts, but also, to piss her off!  Is that mean?  It was just fun mean, just to get a rise out her.  It did.  We're still friends though!  I guess that positive energy doesn't get soaked up as easy as I hoped!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SXC3KWKawaI/AAAAAAAAAXM/Sn7AgqFzOkQ/s1600-h/PH2009011502711.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Gym", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SXC9ZngdeZI/AAAAAAAAAXU/pqqnRwwLUjA/s1600-h/6518ab3e41eb4dc8.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/01/silly-thought-that-lead-to-my-evilness.html", "title": "\nA Silly Thought that Lead to My Evilness....\n"},
{"date": "Friday, January 23, 2009", "body": "\nAs reported  here , point sheets and intense smelling of others has been cause for much ado in Casey's new classroom.  Yesterday, this was no less of an issue.   Ugh... I looked at his point sheet promptly after he got home to find 2 forms stapled to them.  Long story long, it was reported that he \"kissed\" a boy that he considers a good friend out on the playground.  This boy is a friend he knows from regular ed and I have always been happy that the kid gives him the time of day. I honestly can't imagine the whole scenario as it was explained but I think at recess Case leaned over, and did his overtly close sniff thing to this boy, the boy freaked thinking Casey was kissing him, others saw, a parapro saw and hell ensued!  Egads.....So I guess they took him to the office and had a time out.  There it is. It was a bit sad when I questioned him about the whole incident, unphased by his actions but oh so phased by the schools reaction!  I think he was told he was in trouble for trying to kiss his friend so much, that he couldn't even relay to me that he was sniffing him.  He doesn't just kiss people, HE SMELLS THEM!   He didn't seem overly upset about the whole thing.  I am hoping he got something out of the whole broo ha ha, clearly he didn't from his last  incident .   I don't mean to sound so easy going about the whole thing, but I have found if I freak over everything that happens at school, I would be freakin' a lot, and I do that enough at home, work, etc.  I figure as long as he isn't being physcially tortured, mentally bruised, and no tears have fallen, let them handle it!

{"date": "Saturday, January 31, 2009", "body": "\n I have been really bad about not keeping up on my blog.  I have to confess sometimes, I get so tired of thinking about \"AUTISM\".  I told my sister just yesterday that I am beginning to think it would be much easier to just consider Casey excessively quirky and go from there.   This whole past week was sort of a debacle at school, shouting, yelling that he farted, yelling in the bathroom, fighting me to go, and then, ultimately, getting sick Friday morning.  Gee, could there have been some connection?  Perhaps he didn't feel good all week? On top of school issues, the weather has been sucky at best, cold and snowy, hard to drive in in my stupid Chevy Cobalt.  But, since I have to drive for my job, I don't have much choice.  Constantly telling myself \"You're lucky to have a job!  You're lucky to have a job!\", I wallowed in self pity a little less but still did despite my attempts at \"glass half full\"ness.   It's always hard when your kid is sick too.  I had to take a sick day (this early in the year) and worse than that, he was vomiting throughout the morning.  Oddly by 11am, he was asking for computer and Jalapeno Cheddar Cheetos!  A quick recovery I would say, and for a moment I had to wonder if the vomiting and the sick stuff was an act, but knowing Casey doesn't quite get the fine art of \"faking\" yet, I suppose all the vitamins I pump into him might have put him on the mend.  Oh well, it was a good excuse to hang out with him for the day, give him a break from the torture that is school, and get my laundry caught up, and I didn't have to drive! We've had a bit of a \"friend\" issue as of late.  I might have mentioned it in a past post but don't have the mental energy to try to reference it here, a little boy at our pool has taken a liking to Casey and wants to constantly come over to our house or have Casey come to his, which ain't happenin'!  I have had to cancel out on him twice now, and I had good reasons, but I think subconsciously, I know Case has no interest in him, not because Case is Autistic, he just has no interest in this particular boy.  In the past, he has had other kids that he gets interested in, and somewhat connects and I know he has it in him.  But to force a friendship doesn't seem productive to me, especially considering this kid who is very controlling, argumentative, and well, I'll say it, a little bratty.   So, I envision him coming over, Casey running off to do something he WANTS to do, and this kid following me around asking questions and wanting me to play with him.  NO, I'm not doing it.  Why then, do I struggle with all this when I know it will be a bad situation to have him over?   I guess I just want Casey to have a friend so bad, I sometimes feel like I settle for things and it never becomes anything, and this might be that very kind of situation.   Coincidentally, I watched my good friends boys the other night, one of them being Autistic and being on the same level as Case but of course having completely different, awesome attributes, and her younger being just one of the sweetest little guys I know and they all hung out.  They just played around each other, and although Case didn't make a huge effort to play with either one or they him, there was parallel play, and sort of an unspoken kinship.  It was fun, and I probably should have them over again, real soon. Isn't it funny how sometimes something that you're seeking is right there in your lap but your too busy looking for it to notice!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SYR8SF3b9gI/AAAAAAAAAYU/vTPlkSUvKm4/s1600-h/100_0446.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/01/school-weather-friends-and-all-that.html", "title": "\nSchool, Weather, Friends and All that that Entails\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "body": "\nWhat a morning!  After a nearly flawless morning with little to no yelling due to a pretty cooperative boy, I was off to work.  My first call was at a store that is probably a good 5 miles away from home and school.  I arrived, did my work, and got back in my car, ready to jaunt off to my next call.  The weather this morning was pretty crappy, windy with blowing snow, and already cold temps dropping by the hour. Suddenly my cell phone rang and the name of Casey's school popped up on the caller ID.  \"Shit\" I thought immediately \"either he's puked or hurt himself.\"  His new teacher greeted me warmly, the conversation going something like this: \"Hello\" \"Hi, is this Mrs. D@#*( ?\" \"Yes\" \"Hi, this is Mrs. C*&^%\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Oh, well, this has not been good morning!\" \"No?\" \"No, first off Casey complained of needing glasses.  Does he wear glasses?\" \"No, he doesn't.\" \"OK, well, he said he needed them and at one point said he needed his F*&^ing glasses!\" \"Oh Jesus!\" (gee, why didn't I just tell her then that I have a profuse potty mouth and she can thank me for that word usage?) \"Yeah, so he lost his morning break which he of course wasn't happy about but you know, that can't be tolerated.\" \"No, I understand.\" \"Also, we had a transformer blow out and we have no electricity or heat at this time.  My classroom as you know is in the middle of the school and we have no windows so we've moved to the reading lounge.\" (did you have reading lounges when you were in school?  I think they were called libraries?!). \"Oh wow, that's not good!\" \"No, so can you come and get him?\" \"Oh, are they letting the whole school out?\" \"Not at this point, but,....I mean I can take him down to his other room but the teacher is sick and there's a sub.\" \"Well, is he sick?\" \"No, but he's upset and ....\" \"Okay, I'll come and get him.\" In a rather much happier and perky voice \"Okay, we'll be waitin' in the office!\". So there I go hauling my cookies all the way back up to school, having a thousand different emotions at that point, hating his teacher for not knowing how to deal apparently, pissed off at  our choosing to make this whole class change for more reasons than I care to go into at this point, pissed that my job is such that now I have to take a valuable sick day this early in the year.  I think I was most upset that it just seemed point blank that it was decided he had to be taken out.  There was no dealing with him apparently.  Why didn't I say more?  Why didn't I say what I was thinking right then? I pulled up to the main street the school is on to a line of cars waiting to go through an intersection with traffic lights that didn't work, and noted after make my cautious turn through it that most of the buildings were dark.  Pulling up to the school, I could see children sitting in the lobby having class on the floor.  I went into the office where I was met by his teacher.  She apologized profusely about calling me and said she was frustrated that they weren't making an effort  to dismiss the children.  As we were walking, a tall shadowy figure with sound canceling earphones was coming towards us along with his parapro.  His voice carried down the hallway, \"Oh boy, the lights are out!  This is not right!  OK everybody, see you tomorrow, I'll be back tomorrow!\".  This line was said twice before he finally reached us.  His teacher looked at me and said \"Yeah, he's not dealing well with this.\"  Clearly. She thanked me and said she had to go as she was considering calling the rest of the parents of her class.  At that point it was 63 degrees and getting colder in there, on top of the darkness. Casey continued his self regulating diatribe on seeing everyone tomorrow and how this wasn't right as we proceeded to the car.  I felt a little better about the fact that he was distraught, and that she wasn't trying to just get rid of him, but probably felt that this was the best thing for him.

{"date": "Monday, January 19, 2009", "body": "\nWe got a Wii over the weekend, finally.  We had promised Casey one for Christmas and then, stupidly, tried to find one a week before Christmas, and of course, no one had one.  He's been bugging us ever since.  I finally tracked one down at Toys R' Us Friday night and literally raced to get it. Case was excited, but Bill and I ended up playing with it more that night than him.  He really wanted his game Big Brain Academy that his Aunt Sue had got him to play in Indy.  She promised she would send it, but it hasn't arrived yet. Saturday, he seemed to have very little interest in the Wii despite our repeated attempts at getting him to play, and ultimately, playing eachother while Casey sought out other activity (not activities, activity, computer).  Since we got it the night before, all he showed interest in doing was creating Miis, your little namesake person that you use to play the games. So in the interest of getting him off the computer, and getting him interested in his new gift sans the game he wants to play most, I told him to create some more Miis for the little area where the Mii gather.  It looked a bit lonely with just Bill, Casey and Me.  He actually thought this was a cool idea and proceeded to do so.   Today, he hopped on and started in his Mii creations again.  I looked at the ones he had made, aimlessly wondering around the Mii mall or whatever they call it. Most of them looked acutely similar to his orginal one, except with longer hair, or shorter or taller. Suddenly, I saw an African American female Mii strolling by. I asked Case who that Mii was, so he grabbed her with his virtual Mii grabber and the name \"Reba\" popped up over her head.  \"Reba?\"  I asked?  \"Reba the mail lady on Pee Wee's Playhouse!\" he replied matter of factly.  I couldn't help but crack up, not only does he like creating Miis, but he had to create ones from shows he likes!  What a clever little boy.  We shared a laugh together as he  put Reba back down with her Mii friends. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SXU8VcxkMSI/AAAAAAAAAXc/gsS5taw0nQw/s1600-h/cafd5639ad4fa49c.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/01/we-got-wii-over-weekend-finally.html", "title": "\nWiis, Miis, and Creativity!\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, January 4, 2009", "body": "\nI know they will probably never read this and I'm not writing this thinking they will, but I just want to say how very sorry I am for John Travolta and his family over the loss of their son Jett.  It really hit me yesterday when it was the first thing I saw on Yahoo news.   John Travolta has been in some of my favorite movies, Grease, Saturday Night Fever (and I even like Saturday Night Fever 2 for all it's cornieness).  I watched \"Welcome Back Kotter\" as a kid and like most young ladies in the 70's, had a tremendous crush on him.  From all reports he seems like a super nice guy, and given how long he and his wife have been married, you got give him credit for that too. It wasn't until recently that while surveying various blogs that it came to my attention that rumor had it his son was Autistic.  I was fascinated since it seems like most celebrities with children with Autism make it their cause celeb.  I had never heard that rumor before so I started investigating.  I personally never found a for sure sort of source saying it was true.  There were stories on some Kawasakis Disease Jett was said to have.  But no concrete evidence. I got sorta irritated by this.  Was he hiding his Autistic son?  I started finding a lot of photos of the family, and perhaps I was looking for \"somehthing\", a \"sign\", but there were shots that he had the\"look\" in.  I don't know if one just gets this ability from being around their own kid and their friends Autistic kids to pick up on this, but there is a \"look\" to kids with Autism that seem common among many, sort of a disconnectedness when everyone else is looking at the camera and smiling in a photo, eyes elsewhere, mouth slightly open, both expressionless.  The way the hands and the body are held.  I can't explain it but somehow, you can just tell.  It's not a bad thing, it just is, and I know not all kids with Autism look this way in every photo or everyday, but it happens.  I picked up on this in some of the photos I saw of Jett Travolta, but again, was I looking for it? Anyway, I sorta lost my interest in the subject after that.  Clearly, the family didn't want to make it public if it were true.  I read today that Scientologists don't even recognize Autism as it's own condition, but as a mental illness like any other.  Maybe that's why they didn't address it as such. But when I heard the news of Jett's horrible death, my mind went right back to this  thought that he could have been Autistic, and it made the news of a young mans death even that much worse.  I have never ever connected Autism to any sort of threat of death due to it being a condition.  Not like Leukemia or something similar.  But, I know a lot of kids who have seizures due to their Autism, and apparantly, this could have been the case.  Our boy has never been tested for seizures, but just the other day, my sister noted how he can gaze for long periods without blinking, something I never noticed.  Could that be seizure activity? This story is so sad and tragic no matter what was going on with Jett.  I sort of hope though, that if and when they do find what caused it, they might address it to the general public and let people know if this is something that could happen to them, maybe raise public awareness.  I know, a lot to ask of a family who just lost a child.  I think though, that is why this particular story, despite Travolta's celebrity, has affected me.  It might be hitting home in a way I never thought about or wanted to!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/01/my-heart-goes-out-to-travolta-family.html", "title": "\nMy Heart Goes Out to the Travolta Family\n"},

Case made it to school the last couple of days with no problem other than a disorganized mother floundering around in the morning trying to get him ready after she has allowed him to sleep in much too late.  I really need to get the child to bed earlier, perhaps using the old Melatonin again, although if I recall last time, he said he heard voices even worse than he usually does when he took it!  I really am a loser when it comes to organizing time in the morning for him and me!  Really, what makes me think that I can get up by 6:45am and get him and me out the door bathed, tooth brushed, fed and fully equipped by 8:20?  I truly need to get up at 5am to get my shit together.  Gee, maybe I'll try that tomorrow.  I'll let ya know how that goes! I am not sure how school in the new classroom is going  for him yet, 'course he's only been back 2 days.  I need to give him at least a week to get back into the swing of things I think.  I did cancel our IEP scheduled for Wednesday because I still don't think he's had enough time to transition over.  The director I emailed concerning my cancellation fully agreed, a total shocker, so I hope another month or so might get him into the swing of things.  This I will update you on as well 10 Readers! As for me, I really thought I would try to take off the 30 lbs I gained over Christmas with healthy eating and a strict exercise regime, but after imbibing in 3 not so  \"Fresco\"  style items at Taco Bell and what remained of a hefty box of Gobstoppers for lunch, you could say my intentions flew to the wayside for the day!

{"date": "Friday, January 9, 2009", "body": "\nAs mentioned in prior posts concerning Casey's new classroom situation, they now send home daily a point sheet which details his day in terms of how many points he gets or points he gets taken away (for bad behavior).  It's sorta ridiculous really, not only because the points are in groups of 500's and Casey needs a calculator at this point to add 5+9, but because points are not a big motivator for Casey.  Sure, if he gets so many points, he gets computer time or he gets to go to some party they plan at the end of the week etc.  So, it's not so much the points, but the reminder of what he gets if he maintains all his points that really, well, makes the point, to Casey. While I call the system \"ridiculous\", for some reason, the point sheet is the first thing I pull out of his backpack each afternoon after he gets off the bus.  I can't wait to see how he did and how many points he got, and also to see if they wrote any comments.  Monday, he got a pretty good report, it actually said he had a really good day! Immediately following that however, it said that there had been 2 episodes of him grabbing a para's head and his new teacher's head so he could \"smell\" them.  This is a pretty common practice in our household.  Prefaced with a \"Let me love you Mommy.\" said in a rather sultry voice (weird I know, but it is sultry) he grabs me round the neck and pulls the side of my head to his nose and sniffs me deeply.  Being the olfactory sensitive child that he is, I suppose he's soaking me in this way.  He also tends to do this to other women (no, I'm not too jealous), and usually ones who he likes.  I'm used to it but his unsuspecting subjects aren't.  I can only imagine how well these little episodes went over at school....well enough for him to lose some of those all important points.  Reportedly, they told him \"No thank you\" and gently pushed him away. That sorta made me sad.  I mean, I know it's inappropriate at school, and I usually try to banish this behavior out in public, especially since he his about my height and when he does it I'm pretty sure it looks really weird to any onlookers nearby.  But at the same time, it's sorta sad that his senses cause him to seek out scents as a comfort, and he's told it's wrong.   People use their sense everyday for pleasure, listening to music, smelling flowers, watching a sunset, touching something silky.  But, as usual Autism throws a wrench into things for Casey using his senses for his own pleasure.  It kinda goes along with say, oh dancing vs. stimming.  Sure, it's okay for folks to wiggle around rhythmically to music on a dance floor together.  It feels good and it's fun.  But a kid    stimming  in a mall  because it feels good is suddenly cause for paparazzi like cell phone photography.  I guess that's why when Casey starts stimming out in public I occasionally do it with him, there's power in numbers. Needless to say, his loss of points at school for this \"behavior\" was all the punishment he got for these incidents.  I explained to him why he could only do it at home to me, and he said \"Let me love you Mommy.\", and with his nose pressed firmly to my temple, I did.....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2008/11/mobile-phone-filming.html"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/01/scent-of-things.html", "title": "\nThe Scent of Things\n"},

{"date": "Friday, January 2, 2009", "body": "\nCase returned the other day from his big visit down  in Indy with his Aunties.  He had a lot of fun bowling, visiting the Children's Museum, going to movies, etc.  I got great reports from both sisters on his behaviors. I was told how sweet he was, how much affection he gave them, the laughs they had!  I was glad, and I'm glad he can be away from me and \"keep it together\" as it were.  I know a lot of kids with Autism have a really hard time with change and change in routine, but for the most part, this has never been one of Casey's issues (although he does have many).  I suppose this could be attributed to the fact that we have traveled back and forth to Indiana since he was a baby, making his first trip the December after he was born.   Since then, we probably go there at least 5 to 6 times a year.  He's great in the car, except for the years he was potty training, and that was more about my own anxiety that there would be an accident in the ol' car seat.  Nothing really phases him, with the help of radio and a dvd player. The one thing that bums me out a bit when he visits them, and at the same time I find so cool, is how well he does with schedules there.  My sisters both make him a schedule for the day, mainly to keep him off the computer for prolonged periods of time.  And, he follows them, thus the coolness.  I heard several times how he was told to check his schedule and he would pick up from there and do whatever was next, making things go smoothly, and keeping him off the tv and computer for the better part of the day. The thing that bums me out about this is that it is almost impossible for me to implement a schedule here.  I really try, I will write out everything he has to do to deserve some time on the computer.  For example: 1. read 3 books with Dad 2. jump 100 times on the trampoline 3. play a board game with mom 4.  go swimming 5.  eat lunch 6. computer time But all I get is a fight and a grousing boy running into his bedroom to turn on his second thing in the whole world, one of his favorite videos, so he can \"dub\" and rewind certain parts 500 times before I have to yell at him.  Don't get me wrong, I occasionally get some cooperation, but for the most part, my little creature of habit isn't having it!  After he returned home and I tried a schedule, he actually told me \"I don't do schedules here!\".   Groowwwwllll! And I think that is the biggest obstacle I face as far as getting him to follow a schedule, being home.  When he's home, it's comfort time.  When he's at his Aunt's, he's out of sorts a bit, maybe looking for more guidance perhaps, and that's why a schedule works for him so well.  I think it gives my sisters a certain sense of accomplishment as well, especially when he is cooperative, pleasant and fun. So, I will bask in the satisfaction that our little guy was a joy to be around for his Aunts, and maybe even take some credit for his being so good, maybe we've done a few things right.  And, I will make it a New Years Resolution to make schedules work at our house too!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2009/01/different-place-different-child.html", "title": "\nDifferent Place, Different Child....\n"},
{"date": "Monday, December 29, 2008", "body": "\n Well, Christmas is over and we had a great time.  Casey did great throughout, and despite sorta diving into computer action for comfort and familiarity, he really enjoyed Christmas with my family in Indianapolis.  My sister Sue held the festivities at her beautifully decorated home (even the fish bowl had ornaments in it) and we had tons of people, food, gifts and fun.  Bill and I won the Wii bowling tournament (we were good, I mean, really good!)  Casey got some gifts I don't think he expected due to the fact that all he asked for was Barney and Veggietale dvds.  I advised against it and my family got creative and he got some stuff I think he'll really get into. We hung out a few more days after Christmas and then after much discussion and planning, decided spur of the moment that Casey was gonna stay with his two Aunties (who my mom said loved him more than I did, isn't she a peach?).  And so, we are childless at this point.  Today is Bill's Dad Ernie's 85th birthday today, so we went over to his parents pad last night for a little birthday bash with family and friends.  It was a lot of fun celebrating the 85th year of a very sharp and funny man!  I can only hope Bill can follow in his footsteps!  We got to see my sis in law and her hubby,  and mom and dad in law of course, and Bill's brother who was worn out from babysitting our 3 cats and 11 Bettas while we were gone.  Again, more food and fun was enjoyed along with some lovely champagne! Being childless, we decided after the party to go hang out at a local bar with Don, Bill's brother, and have a few beers and some good conversation.  It felt like quite a luxury not having to worry about a babysitter waiting for us.   And so, we are now going to go out and choose a new paint color for our bedroom.  Bill is on vacation and has committed to painting it.  I can't decide if we should do something swarthy and sexy, or something bright and optimistic.  I'm leaning toward swarthy and sexy, maybe an aubergine?  Anything will be better than the ugly light blue I painted it some odd 11 years ago!

{"date": "Wednesday, December 17, 2008", "body": "\nHey 8 readers, remember how I was all nervous and anxiety ridden over Casey's performance at the 5th grade winter concert?  Well, it was all for not! He did wonderfully!  I was a little nervous at first for him because when we arrived, his teacher was there and told me that apparantly the kids who had volunteered to be his peer buddies that night (aka people to make him stay in his spot and not look like a total nerd) didn't show!  Thanks guys.  But, she had come only to see him perform but said she would be happy to step in.  I was relieved of course and offered to do so myself.  She prodded me on to go and sit down and enjoy the show, but to stay close to the area Case would be standing in the bleachers, \"just in case\". Luckily, at the last minute some kid did show up to help so it worked out well.  Case walked in with the other 10,000 kids in the fifth grade classes and stood where he was supposed to (they put an orange dot on the floor where he stood just to remind him where to stay). He sang his heart out, and despite a few funky stims due to his excitement, and an attempt to stand on the bleacher in front of him, we felt like he did really well.   He sang 4 songs with the group and then sat out the rest, since some of them were done by just the chicks, and some were sung in round, and some were done with hand movements that were deemed too difficult for Casey to follow.  They did this queer \"concert etiquette rap\" which had some not so tricky arm movements that he wasn't included in.  I looked over and watched him where he sat off to the side with his \"helper\" and teacher, and he was singing and doing some of the same movements.  I looked at the kids doing the \"rap\" and some of them sucked. HHhhhhhmmmmm......let it go Bon. Anyway, we were very proud of our boy's performance, we were happy that he was up there,  joining in and behaving appropriately, for the most part.  His teacher beamed with pride as well.  Casey was the only kid who participated from her class.  That's a bit sad to me, but, that's their parents choice.   The old saying \"All that worry over nothing\" certainly rang true that night!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/12/casey-performs.html", "title": "\nCasey Performs!\n"},
{"date": "Monday, December 15, 2008", "body": "\nGeeze, too much, too much animal nonsense here on my blog about my son with Autism!  I apologizefor verging from the original intention of this blog.  I almost wonder if I should start a blog about all this additional crapola subject matter I seem to like to spout off about on here!  I think though that oneor the other blog would get neglected.  My New Years resolution, blog about Casey here 95% of the time, cats, kittens, and bettas 5%.  I am sure certain individuals will see to it that I stick to that and remind profusely when I don't....DON.....REBECCA..... Any hoot, I guess I didn't really post much about Casey last week because there wasn't much to post other than the note I recieved that first day concerning his ok day in his new classroom.  Not much after that was reported, and as my sweet (and often dilusionary) hubby would say, \"No news is good news!\".  Casey hasn't fought me on going to school, nor has he sounded off about any negativity he is feeling, so I am not sure how the whole thing is rollin' right now.  Today will be another weird day because they have their big Christmas concert and each class performs today and tonight.  Which brings me to a whole other subject all together. Right now, Case has music with regular ed one day, and just the \"Center\" program another day.  Apparantly, this is the first year the music teacher has experienced having the \"special needs\" (yuk) group in his room, so it really threw off his concert plans.  Ahhh, poor guy....I guess he didn't realized that throwing choreography in with singing brand new songs might be a little tough for some kids who can't even talk, focus, or maintain a proper stillness for more that 5 seconds without being held in place!  Hee hee...where's the prep work I say?  He knew these kids were going to be in there!  I don't know why I went there, irresponsible and funny at the same time.  So, in short, it's been a challenge and I am really anxious to see how the whole things turns out.   Casey has really latched on to the songs they are singing and we hear them being sung all the time, which is a delight!  He actually has a good little voice and a natural rhythm (neither one he gets from me).  The school gave everyone a copy of the songs to practice at home and I couldn't believe the first time we listened to it together how he sang along of course and did some pretty cute little hand movements and gestures too. I think he will do fine tonight, if he can just stay in his spot.  He gets really excited at being on stage, and in the past, for example at his dance recitals, he tends to steal the show with some sort of improvisational number.  That's ok when he's on stage with a bunch of kids who aren't really doing the number to begin with.  It's sort of a comic relief actually.  But tonight would not be cool for him to hop out in front of the choir and begin his boogying down and perhaps singing to  himself.  I pray they have a parapro to assist.  I of course will give a full report and perhaps a peek at the actual performance tomorrow.  Say a little prayer Bill and I won't be crining in our seats! Ok, so 5% of this can be about animals.  Ricky, our new kitten, is doing swimmingly so far!  He used the litter box, which was the main thing, and seems to be getting along ok with the old cats.  I feel sorta bad for them, it's like bringing a little kid in a nursing home letting him run amuck!  A few smacks and hisses have been thrown but no one is the worse for wear, so far!

{"date": "Friday, December 12, 2008", "body": "\nHi 8 readers.  Indulge me if you will.  I promise I will do a weekly wrap up of Casey's first few days in the new classroom, but as you can tell lately, my writing seems to have strayed from Autism and children to animals.  I shouldn't say writing, more my photo offerings have verged over to the beasty side.  And today is no exception when it comes to all things animals. As featured in my Wordless Wednesday, this is Simba. I know, he's adorable.  We have had him since we've been married.  So, we know for sure that he's at least 15 years old.  Not too shabby for a cat! He is an extremely sweet and loveable cat, wanting to be where his people are, and if company is over, being with them too.  Simba is dog-like in many ways because he comes when you call him, he begs for food and is a voracious eater.  I simply adore him. In the morning, he usually comes in the bathroom with me, and follows me to the kitche to insure that his wet food gets distributed properly.  But, when I got up this particular morning, he was no where to be found.  I went through our house to all this favorite sleeping spots, but never found him.  He finally limped downstairs, and he clearly was not himself.  I could just tell by his expression if you can believe it.  You know how you can just look at your kid and  know  he's sick?  Same thing.   Being about 90 in people years, I decided I best take him to the cat clinic.  And in doing so, found out he's lost about 3lbs over the last 3 years, and has a heart murmur, and a oddly shaped kidney.  The doc ran some diagnostics on him, he had to have his paw shaved to get his blood pressure checked, and he pee'd on his blankie.  He also go intravenious fluids.  He seems to be feeling much better now and begged for my sushi.  We will find out what the tests show tomorrow.  If you are a cat or animal in general lover, please say a little prayer that he has a few more years in him, we love him soooooo much! While he was having his tests done on him, I started connecting to a little kitten guy in the waiting room who was waiting to be adopted.  Only 6 months old or so, he was found in a taped up box by the side of the road!  Yes, the side of the road.  My cat obsession got the best of me and I took him out of the little cage they had him in and he purred and licked my face and loved on me and never tried to get away and I fell in love!  I felt a little like I was cheating on Simba, but we've thrown around getting a new kitty, and his situation, utter cutie pieness, and social skills won me over.  I filled out the adoption papers and called Bill on the way home to tell him.  Unphased, he said he'd think about it.  Perhaps when they send that picture of him they promised, he'll make up his mind! Cats, gotta love 'em.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SUK08fmRJMI/AAAAAAAAAVo/KZtJ4atMzuo/s1600-h/100_0093.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/12/taken-sick-day-for-sick-cat.html", "title": "\nTaken a Sick Day, for a Sick Cat!\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 9, 2008", "body": "\n So, this news is a little late in coming because I just haven't found much time to sit and really put any work into retelling this scenario.  But, since I just came home to get a warmer coat while working, and all is quiet, I will take a few moments to share with my now 8 readers. Friday I finally got to meet up with all involved in the potential transitioning of Casey over to a new class room as was recounted in an earlier post. There was his potential new teacher, who all in all seemed optimistic and open to his being in her class.  There was his old teacher who claims she adores him but seems too optimistic to get him out of her class.  There was a lady who is in charge of the \"Team\" room where kids go for discipline and rewards (confusing I think) and who seems like, well, I'll say it, a bitch.  Rounding out the group was the woman who didn't even want me to see this very program last year and gave me about 2 minutes in each classroom.  She's an administrator of some kind, some muckity muck. Oddly the meeting went smoothly.  I was able to explain my concerns and worries, and they all seemed very open to working with me on these.  We discussed his transition over, which everyone seemed happy about.  At first, a hour or so a day was thrown out, but after light debate, it was finally agreed that it would be half a day for the next week.  He would meet up with the new class in the morning and go to their room straight away and then come back to the old classroom in the afternoon.  I had to giggle as the new teacher wanted the opposite, but the muckity muck changed it completely, as if to say, \"I'm in charge!\".  Politics, I swear! The biggest issue I had was with the discipline program they have too and how they kids track a point system all day for what they do and don't.  If they keep their points, they get rewards, if they don't,well, I think they have to go to the \"Team\" room and hang out with the afore mentioned bitch.  I won't go into why I think of her as a bitch, other than her overall demeanor, but I made it clear that I didn't want Casey in the \"Team\" room all the time because he isn't being set up for success.  They all seemed to agree, and in all fairness, the bitch was even giving some good suggestions on things they could do in class to help him. I felt at times that parts of this meeting had been rehearsed prior to my arrival, as if to appease me in some way.  I am still in doubt as to whether they really think he can handle this or whether they just feel it's a better inclusive enviorment for him and, that way, they don't have to fiddle fart with taking him to general ed.  I am a bit of a conspiracy theorist so I hopefully I'm  wrong. He was supposed to start yesterday, but his current class had a field trip scheduled for then and today and so he starts tomorrow.  I have been talking it up a bit, and he has said he would like to be in the new classroom.  I fear however, that when he sees what it entails, the curriculum, the lack  of silly field trips, and the structure, his happy little world may be knocked upside down.  Then again, he may step up to the challenge and embrace the structure, maybe more of that is what he needs.  Hopefully the influence of higher functioning more verbal classmates will help too.  I'm trying to be \"glass-half full\" person, but it's very unnatural for me, ask my husband! I laid awake the other night thinking about the change with a pit in my tummy.  This is what I wanted for him last year, and now that it might be happening, I am doubting why I wanted it in the first place.  I have always been happy with him being \"comfortable\" and maybe a little challenged at school, but mostly, comfortable.  I fear too that because he has been so comfortable for so long, a very realistic classroom setting is going to be really too hard for him to handle.  I hate for him to be miserable, to be stressed, to have anxiety, as does any mom.  I guess if you have a typical kid though, you can reason things out if they have a bad experience, get information from them on it.  With my boy, I can't.  If he's sad, he really has trouble telling us why, and if he is upset about this class it could backfire in nasty behaviour and shutting down before any sort of conversation could ensue. BUT, back to being \"glass-half full\" person, this might just be the thing he needs.  He may really blossom in this room, I hope so.  I just want him to be happy!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/ST6TWBe7CmI/AAAAAAAAAVA/GzAfwoSzBxs/s1600-h/100_0237.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/12/plan-is-officially-in-action.html", "title": "\nThe Plan is officially In Action\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, December 3, 2008", "body": "\nI just posted (so go read the one  before this if you will please) but I was just thinking about the fact that last night I grabbed Jenny McCarthy's first book off the library shelf and sorta grazed over it.  Casey was playing at the library computer, and since I already went through the various encyclopedias and reference books that I cared to on other occasions that are within reach, I got up and got a book off the wall that holds books on homeschooling, and disabilities.  Jenny's book was there.   I had never really thorougly read it before, and it's the first one I'm talking about, not the new mommy warrior one (that just makes me puke for some reason).  It was certainly an easy read, each chapter being about 2 or 3 pages long, some one page (I am seriously not exaggerating).  I strummed through, seeing anecdotes on her son's behaviors, his seizures, her separation from her hubby (he truly didn't get it).  From all accounts, the kid was a mess.  I could relate to a lot of the stories, and her feelings, although I sorta hate to admit it. After finishing and getting the general gist of the thing, I started to see why so many people found her inspiring, and helpful.  She definitely gives some good information about the biomed aspect of things.  A lot of it made sense.  I think she's a good mom.  There, I said it!  I am not as anti-Jenny, as I thought I was.   I think the thing that makes me a little anti-Jenny is that the way she tells her tale is very, uhm, convincing.  I mean, if I were a mom of a newly diagnosed kid with Autism, her book could possibly become a bible for me.  I would run out and find a DAN doctor right away!  I would try all the things she did, even though, she never really makes a point too much of saying how different kids with Autism are.  I think this could be dangerous and disappointing. Years ago, my friend and I went to several presentations on the biomend aspect of Autism given by a local dentist who had a child with Autism.  This was my first experience with terms such as yeast, supplementation, gf/cf diet, mercury poisining.  We of course were fascinated and drawn towards trying anything and everything for our kids.  I had so much hope, much like Jenny's book dishes out.  I thought I had found those magic bullets.  Guess what, I never did.   In all fairness, I never followed a full fledge regimen.  I started too, but got bored with giving my kid 9 vitamins everytime he ate. I tried the diet, it never worked for us.  I never attempted getting rid of yeast if there was any in the first place.  Chelation was out of the question.  My friend, on the other hand, has followed her DAN doctor's suggestions, gone organic and dairy free, supplemented per results of testing.  She's done everything right, and she is seeing results with her child, which is awesome.  We've actually seen great improvements with b-12 shots in Casey.  I doubt though, that either one of us will ever tell ya that our children have lost their Autism label, as Jenny's son apparantly did. And there in lies another issue I have with her.  Why is this so important to lose that label, and let everyone know about it?  I don't see people scrambling to get rid of a Downs label.  Heck, some people  fight  for an ADHD label for their kid, just so they know why they are doing so bad in school!  It almost makes me suspect that in Jenny's mind, Autism is something to be ashamed of, to fight.  Be that \"Mommy Warrior\" against.  It makes me wonder, am I in the wrong for not doing all I apparantly could?  Am I wrong for not being that \"Mommy  Warrior\" when it comes to things like chelation and ridding your child of yeast?  Am I wrong for not persuing such things? Dammit, why did I even read that book.  Such simplicity making me doubt myself!

{"date": "Thursday, November 20, 2008", "body": "\n Well, we finally got to \"view\" the classroom that they are considering moving Casey into.  Bill and I arrived at the school about 9:30 to find a class of 10 guys and gals with 2 parapros and one teacher.   All the kids were sitting at different \"stations\" headed up by either a para or the teacher.  They were quietly working and well-behaved.  The room was very spacious since there were only 10 desks and a few station tables.  Lots of informative stuff was posted on the walls (how much a coin was worth, actions that appropriate, actions that are not, calendar, schedule, etc.).  After about 5 minutes of us quietly watching, and me taking notes, they all took a break.  They were allowed a snack and some music was turned on, which caused a little impromptu dancing which was supported and encouraged by the staff.  Others chose to go down to the \"team\" room to spend their break.   Then they came back and, and, and, they were just so GOOD.  So well behaved.  I was curious to know if the teacher might have slipped the children  some sort of valium like drug before we came.  There was not one meltdown, not one tantrum.  Their classroom is connected to the library which was their next thing to do.   They all quietly disappeared with the paras and the teacher sat and talked with us for sometime.  She asked what we thought so far, and told us somethings about how they work.  It was all very pleasant and promising.  Being the conspiracy theorist I am though, I couldn't help but wonder if it was always this way, had their been some prep work?  She did tell them at one point \"You guys made me look so good today, you get a marble for the party jar!\" whatever the hell that means. So, you would think that I would be completely gun ho to have Casey go straight into that class if I could.  But, me being the glass is half empty type that I am, really started to have my doubts about Case being in there.  He has breakdowns, he is very, oh crap, I can't think, oh, impulsive.  He does a lot of self talking, he doesn't listen well.  I just wondered how well this could work for him. However, I liked seeing the kids, after they returned from the library, sit next to each other and discuss the books they had gotten, sharing.  I liked just in general that they talked and interacted at all.  They all have different \"disabilities\" or issues, but somehow they all seemed to get along.  I wanted to picture Casey in that setting, being successful, but I was having trouble doing so.  Probably due to some scars from our first experience all those many 4 or 5 years ago when we tried to get him in a similar class and the whole thing was a disaster.  But that was years ago. There's also the issue of a discipline plan they are all on that I can't even begin to imagine Casey being able to follow and keep track of like the others do.  Bill was really trying to be positive, saying he thought it was doable for him if modified a bit.  I couldn't see it. But I guess I won't know anything until he does it!  We requested that he be transitioned dow to the room slowly if possible, maybe spend an hour a day, just to see how he does.  The teacher there and his current teacher felt this might be workable and are going to look into it.  I am praying they can make it happen, I don't want to just dump him in there after Xmas break. So, we'll see.  Something is telling me I need to have more confidence in my boy...............\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SSXqwx6ttVI/AAAAAAAAATI/O-BDylJDlSA/s1600-h/100_0015.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/11/new-classroom-new-worries.html", "title": "\nA New Classroom = New Worries\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, November 15, 2008", "body": "\nI was really trying to come up with something clever for my latest post, something informative or inspiring.  But since my last post, nothing truly interesting or exciting has happened Autistically speaking for us.  It was an extremely long and irritating week. Let me preface things by saying that I don't like being inconvenienced, and this week seemed to be full of inconveniences.   Monday began with Casey's visit with his doc, which I blogged about.  The visit itself wasn't so much an inconvenience as was the timing, and the drive.  I made the appointment for 6:45 pm.  What the hell was I thinking.  I tried of course to change it when I realized my error but it's hard to change an appointment time on the day of.   Tuesday was really irritating because I had a gyno appointment and we all know how fun those are ladies!  On top of that, I scheduled it midday, it ended up taking over 2 hours and my whole work schedule was a screwy mess!   Wednesday of course couldn't be free.  Teacher conference at 6 pm.  I also watched my friends 2 boys because the schools had half days.  I really don't mind babysitting her kids, they are sweet and I think Case enjoys having them over, but it reminds me why I only had one child.  The teacher conference was OK, and oddly seemed to circulate around the whole subject matter of Casey moving over to another classroom as I explained in another post.  Weird. I am going to go and view the class next week and make my decision.  I am leaning towards the change.  That could be a whole other blog entry so I'll stop there.  After the conference, we had a bit of fun while dining with my sister Sue and her hubby who were in town for his work.  It was nice to sit and have a beer and some fattening grub and catch up. Thursday by far was the most dreaded day of the week for me.  I had to work with my boss and her boss, and I could go on and on about the stress and anxiety I felt all week prior, but I won't.  I slept little the night before and when I did, I had dreams about not making it to meet them on time, junk like that, and then my alarm went off at 5 am.  Luckily, my sister who was visiting was able to take Case while I worked which took a bit of the load off.  I just so hate working with my boss and being watched over.  One of the benefits of my job is that I never have anyone watching over me and I loooove that.  So when it happens, it's extremely stressful and I just always feel inadequate.  Add on my bosses boss into the equation, and well, my head just about explodes!  Thankfully, my boss arrived alone, explaining hers left early!  Yay, so now the day will only be half as bad!.....and it was, and it's over, and that's all I'll say about it. So, Friday came and went with nothing big and that was awesome.  I worked, my friend whose kids I watched picked up Casey so I could do so, I bought another Betta (shut up friends and family who make fun of me!  I thought Gil was dying...he's not), and we went swimming last night and relaxed and it was like, aaaahhhhhhh. I hope I don't have another week like that for a long time.  I won't say \"again\" because I know that's just too much to wish for!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-week-in-review-if-anyone-cares.html", "title": "\nMy Week in Review, if Anyone Cares......\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 17, 2008", "body": "\n Bless me Father for I have sinned.  It's been about oh, thirty years since my last confession.... No lie there!  My Catholic upbringing has engrained in me a sense of guilt at all times.  In this case however, I think my guilt is quite jusitified! About a month ago a little brown bag came home from school with a note attached explaining that this was a science project given to the students and they would have a month to complete it.  It entailed making a \"car\" out of the supplied items and then writing a report on it.  At the time they were studying Newton's Laws of Motion.   Now, such subject matter is so above Casey right now.  I always tend to think that we have Case in regular ed classes such as this particular science class, just to be around typical kids, and to learn how to be a student.  And if he comes away with some knowledge, then all the better.  His memorization skills are so excellent he actually does well on the written tests, because he memorizes the study guides, which don't veer too far off from the test material.  But when it comes to putting the subject matter into practical use, he totally can't grasp it.   So when this project came home, and I read the instructions, I giggled a little sadly to myself, thinking, \"There is no way he can do this.\".  Weeks went by with that stupid little bag laying on his dresser.  He of course never touched it because he could read the note attached.  He knew it was from school so it wasn't fun.  I kept putting off even looking at the stuff.  I considered contacting his science teacher and asking her if there was a modified way to do this for him, but I didn't.  I don't have an excuse, I just didn't.  Towards the last couple of weeks, I considered pulling out all the stuff and encouraging him to work on it with me and see if little by little something could be accomplished (knowing full well it wouldn't happen that way either).  More days passed, with the little brown bag just laying there, taunting me, reminding me of what he's not capable of doing, at least not now. Maybe that's why I was avoiding it all together.  Subconcioulsy I know he is not at a level of intelligence to figure out how to build a car.  He's never even had an interest in cars, not even toy cars.  He did have an interest in car dealerships and car insurance, but unfortunately, that wouldn't help him in this situation. So, last night, the night before the project was due, I whined to Bill about it, I whined to Casey about it, I dredded even looking at the stuff inside.  I finally poured the contents on the floor, which included film canisters, straws, bamboo sticks, clothes pins, rubber bands, pipe cleaners, and other asundry crap.  The instructions said to use whatever you could but didn't have to use all of the items.  I sat for around 45 minutes with Casey by my side, chewing on the film cansiter and straws, trying to configure a way to put stuff together to make a car that rolled.  Finally I came up with this monstrosity  It rolled!  I mean, it rolled.  And Casey chewed on one of the film canisters.  So, he was involved right? Then came the report, rather indepth I would say.  I won't go into detail but I let Casey type out the cover  page with my assistance and then I typed the rest in a Casey like fashion.  Bill hovered around trying to encourage me to do things more legit, saying he would explain the Laws of Motion to Case and maybe then help him write the report.  \"Yeah, good idea\" I answered as I printed out my....Casey's report and shoved it in a plastic baggie along with my....his car.  Bill is a much better person than I. So, that's my confession.  I did Casey's report basically and I made the damn car.  I admit it.   Casey could not and would not have built a car.  He would not have been able to!  That's a fact. And the report was so detailed, I gotta tell ya, he couldn't have put much into that even with my help.   But, now he had a car to take.  I think they were going to have a race with their cars, and he would be able to participate.  He had a report, and if he had to read it aloud, he had something to read aloud, and he might even understand it a little.  Because of these facts, I feel justified in my deception. I learned a lesson or two from this experience.  Number one, don't wait till the night before a project is due to do it-duh.  And number two,  next time something comes up like this, I really need to touch base with his teacher and ask her to bring it down a notch or twenty, because my ulitmate goal in just about anything he does is to set him up for success and not asking for modifications did not do this.  Now,  rehearsing with him to answer if asked \"Yes, mom and I worked on it together!\" is a whole other confession!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SSHRWl8UxfI/AAAAAAAAAS4/p1MNVwWGsKA/s1600-h/000_0002.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/11/i-have-confession-to-make.html", "title": "\nI Have a Confession to Make\n"},

We started seeing him because we knew our insurance would cover it, and we have seen some changes in Case with his guidance on supplementation.  We had gone to another awesome DAN doctor, but just that one appointment was over $700 out of pocket.  Needless to say, we went with this  current doc, since we could forsee each and every visit and consultation costing that much and more, with no insurance assistance in sight. He's ok, sort of overwhelmed it seems, a little scary sometimes.  But, I maintain that what he has suggested for us has helped Casey with his speech, eye contact, and focus (here and there).  He's still Autistic, always will be dammit.  But it's just like anything else, people take vitamins to stay healthy.  They take Vit. C to prevent colds, St. John's Wart to improve their mood, calcium to strengthen their bones.  Thusly, I see nothing wrong with giving Casey things that have come from nature, and not labs, to help him be the best he can be. So, I think I've justified why we take him to this guy.  I'm not about \"curing\".  I am not Jenny M., although I wish I had her figure! I told Casey about the appointment yesterday afternoon so as not to cause too much worry.  He hates doctor visits (who doesn't?).  He quickly told me then and throughout the time preceeding  our appointment, that \"this is not a check-up, no shots, no blood pressure check, no heart thing!\".  Yeah ok.... Anyhoot, during our appointment, Casey was very high strung, having a lot of anxiety.  At our first appointment in June, blood had been drawn, a rather terrifying experience for him.  On our second, the doc administered a b-12 shot on him, to see if we saw changes.  We did.  On the 3rd visit, he showed  me , yes me, how to administer a b-12 shot and had me do it right then and there.  All these experiences have added up to trauma for Case, and thus his anxiety. The doc seemed tired, it was their late business hours day.  We discussed a few things (one of which thrills me to no end, and that is stopping the b-12 shots to see if it's something else helping him that we have been giving at the same time).  He said  Casey had gained 7lbs since July (I didn't tell him I probably did too) but said his BMI was good.  He grew an inch or so too, in 4 months.  Scary! Casey was spinning around on the doctors chair, one of those stool things with wheels.  Suddenly out of the blue, he goes \"I'm in the Olympics, and this is my sport!\".  The doc looked at me, and I him and we cracked up.  Something in the doctor's face suddenly took on a happier feel, as if he felt something he was doing for this kid was working.  There were no shots tonight, no blood pressure taking, no heart thing. And with that, he prescribed some new item to try, and our appointment was done, much to the joy and happiness of one little boy who was on his way to the elevator before I was finished paying my co-pay....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/11/uneventful-but-satisfying-doctor-visit.html", "title": "\nUneventful, but Satisfying Doctor Visit\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, November 6, 2008", "body": "\n  I was recently discussing with my friend Rebecca how Casey is totally into  The Wiggles  again.  Her  own kids are 9 and 6.  They like  High school Musical ,  Hanna Montana , and  Pikachu  or whatever it's called.  In other words they enjoy  age appropriate entertainment . Ironically, she and her hubby had just been reminisicng about how much their family enjoyed  The Wiggles  oh so long ago. We had even gone together to see them live about 5 years ago. But when she brought it up to the kids, they looked mesmerized, with no memory of them.  It made her sad.  I jokingly said something to the affect that \"See, ya need a kid with Autism so you can relive this stuff over and over again.\" I have noted in reading blogs of other Autism parents that many of their older kids still watch videos that technically are way too young for them.  For instance I know one mom who mentioned her over 10 year old child was really into looking up \"Barney\" clips on YouTube. Lately, along with  The Wiggles ,  Barney  has made a reappearance in Casey's viewing repertoire as well. At first it bothered me a little.   Barney  seemed okay in the day, but wow, now when I watch, it hits me how, well for a lack of a better word, queer it is.  The kids over act, the songs are irritatingly catchy and everything is just so\" goody two shoes\".   The Wiggles are pretty goofy too, but the songs are way better, and it's a bit more watchable for me.  It's almost that his sudden re interest in something that he liked when he was 3 or 4 comes off as a bit of a regression. Watch ability aside, the more I am forced to watch with him so he won't rewind certain bits and watch the accompanying previews 30 times, I am struck by how really beneficial these videos could be in some ways to him.  Barney particularly offers some very basic but steady lessons in social skills.  The kids are always greeting each other appropriately, friendship is a focal point, politeness is always displayed.  Heck, diversity is also huge in the Barney videos, which feature African American, Hispanic, and Asian children playing together in harmony.  So, really at this point in Casey's young life, how can watching this be be worse for him than watching some silly episode of  Hanna Montana  where the kids are overly cynical, they're usually getting in trouble for humor's sake, and everything is as basically as unrealistic as the Barney videos anyway? \"Age appropriate\" doesn't always mean \"appropriate\", that's for sure! Casey even asks me questions about the episodes, which leads me to think he is analyzing things more, getting more out of it.   He's noticing things, like that Gregg Wiggle left at some point, or that Barney isn't around when big people are in the scene.  Wow, I didn't even notice these things really.  I say anything that prompts a conversation has to be good.   So, I say bring on  The Wiggles , bring on Barney!  My kid, as do many kids with Autism, seeks out comfort and sameness, and I think in a way he finds both in these videos.  But, I think he's also discovering more, and therefore, watching these again in my opinion cannot be considered regressive, but just, reflective!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SROcBGSwrMI/AAAAAAAAARM/nr9uobqMjM0/s1600-h/2874899095.jpeg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SROb3BgyzHI/AAAAAAAAARE/KJFV1S6_0V8/s1600-h/3997001980.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/11/regression-or-new-reflections.html", "title": "\nRegression, or New Reflections?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 2, 2008", "body": "\nI got repremanded last night by a dear friend who has me on his RSS feed, because the other blogs he follows have 10 entries a day, whereas he's lucky to see one from me, every other day!  Well Mr. DJ, I don't get paid to do this stuff like some of those fancy bloggers out there!  So, I felt I better blog a little something about Halloween, since it indeed has been a couple of days since my last entry! Honestly, it wasn't too exciting!  Bill and I attended Casey's Halloween party at school which was cute, but thought provoking in an uncomfortable way (this will probably be fodor for my next entry).  They made cookies and played games, ate cookies, and danced.  Casey really seemed to enjoy it until he started saying he could hear voices of \"Toy Story 2\" in French in his head.  I did a calming pressure maneuver on him and beat it out of there.  I think our prescence was throwing him off a bit. Later, we went trick or treating with some friends who live nearby.  Case didn't really want go at first, letting us know he'd much prefer to stay on the computer.  But once he got going, he had fun.  His costume was perfect for the weather we had, and it was nice not to have to put a coat over it.   He did a great job walking up and saying \"Trick or Treat\" and holding his bag open.  His only downfall was trying to watch people's tvs if he could see them, but with a little prompting, he would move on.   Due to some costume malfunctions (not my son's) we kinda cut things short and went back home.  His dad, who had stayed behind to hand out candy, was ready to take him out too so they hit a couple of street blocks, bringing home even more fat inducing fun.  Once that was over with, Casey was done.  He didn't even look at the candy he gathered, just not that important to him!  In fact, he didn't even eat any of it.  Dad and I did, but he didn't...... Go figure. And so, the evening ended with us and my bro-in-law sipping adult beverages and watching \"Night of the Living Dead\" and Casey happily  ensconced in his room watching \"The Wiggles\".  It was a quiet but satisfying Halloween.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SQ3LLrn9_-I/AAAAAAAAAQs/waOueqI1Ya0/s1600-h/DSC02811.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/11/halloween-recap.html", "title": "\nHalloween Recap\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 31, 2008", "body": "\nLast night I went with my dear friend Paulette to a little talk on healthy remedies and lifestyle.  The woman, Judy,  who presented it is just a mom (silly thing to say- just  a mom) who has done tons of research and used everything she talked about.  I met her recently when I went with another dear friend to a \"workshop\" she also gave on keeping a healthy home with natural stuff. The natural line of products is called  Melaleuca ,  and I am just in love with it.  I sorta promised myself that I wasn't going to blog about it because I didn't want people to think  I'm  selling it, because I'm not.  But it's just one of those things where when you try something that you really like, you want everyone you know to try it too.  If you're interested in hearing about it or want to know more, email me, I'll hook ya up! Anyway, back to last night.  Most of her talk was on healthy remedies for common illnesses we all get throughout the winter months, colds, flus, viruses.  I thought I would share a few things she mentioned so if you want to do your own research you can. One thing I have to mention first and foremost because I actually did it this past weekend was her suggestions for sinus infection and inflammation.  Crap, ok, now that I think of it, this goes back to Melaleuca, sorry.  Sorta the premise for many of their products is that they contain Melaleuca Oil, or tea tree oil.  Seriously, this will tell you what it does   here   So, I have this crappy sinus infection all weekend, and I'm ready to call the doc on Monday.  I was using my netti pot and if you're not familiar, look up Sinucleanse (not a Melaleuca item so see, I'm not trying to make money) and decided since Melaleuca oil is a natural germ killer, maybe a few drop sin the water of my netti pot would help kill the infection.  I did this Saturday and Sunday, multiple times.  It was weird, and I wasn't sure if it would work, but the infection was gone by Monday morning, so no doc, no antibiotics, and as a result of antibiotics usually, no yeast infection (sorry to any males reading this).  I asked Judy about this last night and she highly agreed with my course of action and said I should do it daily to fight off more infections. She also told us about how if you are feeling a cold or some sickness coming on to use  grapefruit seed extract oil  to fight it off.  It's a natural antibiotic and is extremely strong.  She suggests up to 15 drops in orange juice  several times a day when you are starting to feel bad.  You can use it on the kids too, just use as much as you can get away with before they say it tastes bad.  You have to stir it a lot too or it will sink down to the bottom of your cup.  This is the  one   she uses and several gals there had used it too and said it was good and lasted a long time.  Also, she made a point of saying if you are on any heart or blood pressure medication, not to use this as it makes your medication not work. Now here's a weird one, and one I don't know that I'll try, but so basic, it's almost worth trying once.  She actually said that when she is getting sick she does a combination of stuff including, cutting up a garlic clove in small chunks and swallowing it down with milk.  It sounds so gross to me, but garlic is supposed to be really excellent for you, and a natural antibiotic.  Judy said swallowing (not chewing) it with milk helps you not to get stomach upset from it.  If I ever try this, I'll be sure to give all my friends and family fair warning to stay away, and let you know if it helps! Another item she shared, and we got to try was ginger water.  She simply got fresh ginger, peeled it, and cut off a few chunks and threw it in boiling water.  She said to take the ginger out after about 15 minutes or it would be too strong to drink.  After doing this, you can sip it all day, hot or cold, and you can add lemon and honey for taste.  We all tried it, and agreed it was not offensive at all, and kinda reminded me of weak herbal tea.  It apparantly is yet another way to stave off sickness, naturally, easily, and in this case, a little more pleasantly. She offered some more suggestions such as the use of oil of oregano and colloidal silver.  You can research these on your own because she really didn't discuss them enough for me to give you valuable info, but I know they seem to be good things to use to fight off sickness as well. Also, if you take vitamins, she suggested doubling up on them when you feel like you're getting sick.  Judy actually mentioned doing many of these things together to really fight off whatever is trying to attack.  And do it all for more than just a day, even if you start feeling better. I hope I haven't bored any of you too much, because if you are already reading to this point, then you must have been interested.  I don't want to get sick, but it's sorta nice to know some alternatives before I have to run myself, Bill, or Casey to the doctor.  And aren't things almost always better if they're natural? Here are some books that she recommended as well....

{"date": "Monday, November 3, 2008", "body": "\nCasey has been involved in Topps Soccer for about the last year now.  They have 2 sessions, Spring and Fall, and the Fall one ended yesterday.  This is a pretty leisurely, purposefully unstructured team, which is a great thing for Case.    They simply bring the kids out on the field, do the warm up, and then divide them into teams and let 'em at it.  Parents of course are encouraged to go on the field to help their kids or whoever might need assistance.  Bill and Casey have gone this past session almost exclusively while I chose to stay home for a little \"me\" time.  I figure it's good for them to bond over sports and Bill being a former Special Olympics coach (ironically way before Casey was ever in the picture) loves being involved.   We've seen Casey's skills improve over the last couple of months.  He even got a little angry and talked some trash when someone kicked his ball out of the goal! He actually tries to get in there and kick the ball.  Often he gets lost on which goal is his or where he even needs to kick the ball, but he does have fun at least trying and the fresh air and excercise are always good things!  He's number 10 there in the photo, doing his best!  The cool thing is no one seems to care.  It's all about fun! At the end of each season the parents line up and form a tunnel the kids run through, and love.   Then they go and have a pizza feast.  While they eat the coaches present trophies, which they get every time.   Case doesn't usually get too excited about this part, but this time, when his name was called, he seemed a little more interested, shouting something that I'm pretty sure he got from a tv show  about \"You deserve a trophy!\".  And of course to top things off, the team posed for a group photo.  By the looks of things everyone was pretty happy about their trophies!  I'm really glad Case gets a chance to be part of a team, and I'm especially glad that with each passing season, being part of a team seems to mean more to him! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC02821-1.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SQ9XofntEgI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/AtEVbCQXdhw/s1600-h/DSC02816.JPG", "http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC02819-1.jpg", "http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC02820-1.jpg", "http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC02824-1.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/11/another-soccer-season-ends.html", "title": "\nAnother Soccer Season Ends\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 28, 2008", "body": "\nOk, I've done an entry on a Halloween Party we attended.  I can't do an entry on decorations, and how fabulously I decorated my house because, I haven't.  Casey's party at school is Friday, so I can't really speak to that yet, it's only Tuesday.  But in the excitement of Halloween and all it's creepiness, I would like to introduce you to  VLAD!  Scary huh? \"Scary?\" you ask?  Well, yeah!  He should look like this..... See the lovely, long, flowy, finny things hanging off my first Betta Gilbert, Gil for short?  That's how a Betta should look! As reported  here , I have what some would call an obsession with Betta fish.   At the point that I wrote this   entry , I believe I only had 7 Betta's.  I now have 11 Betta's.  I was seriously going to stop at 7, really.  But I suddenly became, in my head a Betta fish rescuer.   I found  Vladimir, Vlad for short  while working in a large grocery chain.  I won't mention names, because, I like to think that I am that important that someone from this chain might happen upon my entry. So anyway, as I am so wont to do, I was working, at this unnamed chain (Meijers) and I always happen by the fish department.  No seriously, it's sorta where I need to be for my job, so there I am.  They usually have a lovely assortment of Betta's, and I like to look, not buy, all the time, just look.  (I have only purchased one Betta prior to this at Meijer-oops, Duncan).  As I scanned the stupid little cups they put them in, I happened upon this poor fish whose fins looked at though they had been ripped off.  Also, his one eye was bugged out and gross.  All the while, I was chatting on the phone with my dear friend,the lovely Rebecca, and suddenly described the situation to her.  I had to wonder what happened to this poor fish, and why they thought they could sell him in this condition.  Being the Betta lover, and sudden rescuer that I thought myself to be, I told Rebecca that I was going to ask the fish dept. attendant if they would discount this poor thing for me so I could take it home and SAVE IT'S LIFE! Rebecca, who has no love or respect for the betta or my love of the betta, found this tremendously humorous, and requested that she be put on speaker so she could secretly hear my conversation about marking this fish down.  That's how ridiculous she thinks I am!  So, I did.   I approached the young fish attendant, phone on speaker in one hand, the ripped up fish in the other, and the conversation went something like this: \"Hi, yeah, this fish looks like it came in really messed up, do you guys discount fish?\" me asks. \"Uh, let me ask my boss?\" he says, grabbing his walkie talkie. \"Uh, yeah, this lady wants to buy a damaged fish, can we discount it?\".... Silence from all parties. \"Uh, ok.\" he says putting his walkie talkie back on his belt \"No ma'am, my boss says we get credit for it either way (whatever that means) so we can't discount it!\" \"Seriously?!\" I ask, my face turning red at the mere thought that they think they could sell this \"Elephant Man\" of the fish world \"Because no one is going to buy him, and he'll just die in here...\". \"Yeah, she said no, sorry\". \"Well, what happened to him?\" I implored.  At this point, I thought I saw the young man go sneakily to the walkie talkie, perhaps to call security. \"Sometimes at night when no one is here teens come in and put fish in the same cup to see if they fight or not, and they do, and they rip up each other.  Sometimes we find them dead! \"  I sucked in my breath at this point, and he continued \"I think that's what happened to this one!\". I clicked my phone shut, too angry to let Rebecca overhear now, and I started in on him about how they should lock them up and blah blah blah.  He said no one could buy them if they are locked up at night.  Who, I asked is buying a Betta fish in the middle of the night (well, perhaps me if I had insomnia). \"So, do you want the fish ma'am?\". \"Bag 'em.\"  I replied, at a loss for what to do, and not being able to leave him.  \"Because no one is going to buy him, and he'll just die in here...\".  My own words haunted me, and made me feel stupid as I carried this thing up to the cashier.  I'm pretty sure the attendant snickered behind my back. Well, long story long, I named him Vladimir, because he was sorta of a horror, and Vladimir is Dracula's first name, and he is the star of many a horror film and you get the picture.  Plus, I always wanted to name something Vlad, so what better creature than this monstrosity.   I went online to see what I could do for him.  He was really sad and pathetic, and didn't eat for 2 weeks.  But, after I gave him some Betta medicine daily and changed his stinky water, and kept him away from the others so as not to frighten them, or make them sick, he started eating, just this week!  And his bulbulous eye thingy has disappeared, and his fins look as though they are growing back!  And I am just happy as a clam! I have to ask myself why I would put this much thought and work (and a little dough) into a gross, sick Betta, and I really don't know.  It's not like saving a cat or a dog.  Honestly, I am not even going to try to justify it.  I just thought it was a stupid funny story to share.  I understand if you feel that I am mentally unstable and won't be visiting anymore.  But I did save him dammit!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC02791.jpg", "http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC02738.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/i-so-need-to-get-life.html", "title": "\nI So Need to Get a Life!\n"},

Kristina Chew, the writer of this blog was interviewed in this piece  that they showed on The Today Show  .  If you missed you it, here it is.  I wish they would have talked to her more.  It was cool to see her and her family.  The whole segment is on a book by a doctor who sticks to the idea that vaccines do not cause Autism.  If you haven't seen it, take a look.....and then if you feel the need read my two cents after...... Interesting no?  I have never been one to think too much about vaccinations in terms of them causing Casey's Autism. He always showed signs, always.  Now, could the hep b vaccine that he got the first day of his life have caused something?  We will never know.  I have always bordered on being quite bored with this whole topic in general, and when people have asked me if I thought shots caused Casey to be Autistic, I say no.  Now, my sort of laissez faire attitude towards this shouldn't be misconstrued as not careing about the whole issue.  I do have friends who swear vaccines caused their child's Autism.  I'm more or less dismissive of the whole thing because I think Casey was born this way, much like Kristina said of her son Charlie.   I did take a stand and stop getting Casey immunized all together at around four years old.  That is about the time all this came at me, along with biomed stuff and so on.  I chose to stop his immunizations because if there had been damage from prior ones, then why would I continue to put something in him that could possibly be a danger?  I agreed with the woman who says that there might be a subset of children who react differently to vaccines.  I was never sure, and didn't want to take any chances.  To this day, he still hasn't had his full set of immunizations.  Oddly, neither did I as a child. I really try to avoid controversial topics such as this in my blog.  I'm more about fun, and sharing stuff about our lives, but I just thought it was an interesting thing that someone would actually threaten a doctor for writing about what he knows a lot about and believes in so strongly.

No, not my own hot tub unfortunately.  I am going to throw this out here and if I get any feedback, great.  If not, it will just remind me of how few people read my blog, which won't be surprising. So, my idea is to offer the services of my personal Occupational Therapist and sister to all of you.  No, she can't come to your house, but, I can give people a chance to send me questions about your kid that you would like to ask an  Occupational Therapist   and I will relay them on to her and let her answer them for you!  They can be about Sensory Processing, stimming, handwriting, behaviors, etc.  She isn't a doctor of course, but she has been doing this for over 20 years, and most of those in a grade school setting.  She deals with kids with Autism, PDD, ADHD, ADD, LODOFD (I made that one up, but you get the picture!).  She has spoken at conferences on Sensory Issues among others.  She is downright awesome.   I thought this might be a cool thing to do for people who don't have an OT at their disposal, or perhaps are not pleased with the OT they get at school, and want to know how to fix that.  Just anything.  I hope to get lots of questions for her, and I will keep your name anonymous if you wish.   If you have a question or two, just send them to my email address, let me know if you want your name connected to it, and I will pass it along to her and get an answer.  Once I get this all together, I will make a huge post of these questions which will hopefully help not only the asker but others!  My email is bbdavis6469@yahoo.com. so ask away. I wanted to ask too if you are somewhat familiar with my blog if you would make some of your readers aware of this little service I am offering.

Casey has been wanting to tour our local NBC affiliate WDIV channel 4 for a really looooong time now.  At one point this summer I tried to satiate his pleas by just taking him down to the studio  just to hang out  in the front of it.  That helped, a little.  I was really having trouble trying to set up a tour, as I really had no \"connections\" and my emails were going unanswered. Finally, just by chance, I found a \"connection\".  I was at a party over the summer at a friend's house and we were discussing this whole Casey/studio tour issue.  Suddenly, my friend Barb revealed that she knew a weekend producer from that station and that this woman had set up a tour for her scout troop!  I was flummoxed!  Who'd a thought my ol' friend Barb would be my connection?  She was more than happy to give me the woman's number and I was more than happy to take it. Well, long story long, I called, tried to set up a tour for his bday, didn't work.  So, I took whatever I could get and so this weekend we had our tour scheduled.  Casey, was flying high all week, talking about, the anticipation almost palpible. We were scheduled to arrive at 9am, after the initial newscast was over and when they would be doing \"break-ins\" during the \"Today Show\".  Casey was more than happy to get up that morning.  The drive down to Detroit was smooth sailing and parking a breezed since it was the weekend.  Casey was the first one out of the car of course, heading for the door of the studio.   We were welcomed by Lisa the producer who took us into the control room.  It was really interesting to see how everything happens behind the scenes of a newscast and how many people are involved.  Casey was a little bored with this part but was really good despite it.   Next, we got to go out to the studio.  It was if the heavens had opened for Casey, he was excstatic!  He couldn't stop talking about the \"new\" studio (which it was, being recently remodeled).  We ran into mutual friends there, who were also touring!  We met Andrew Humphrey, the weekend meteorologist, who was extremely kind.  He showed us where he reports the weather, let us stand in front of the green screen, and even let Casey use his 'clicker' that changes the picture behind him.  We got to see ourselves on camera in front of the maps, it was awesome.  He was super nice and gave us a lot of time. Unfortunately, Casey quickly lost interest in the weather when he spotted the news desk where the anchors sit.  \"There's the desk\" he shouted.  The producer allowed the kids to take turns sitting in the chair.  Casey got to read from the teleprompter, which he is very good at.  We got to see the remote control cameras (no more cameramen anymore!), how they do the traffic report and much more.  Best of all we got to stand in the actual studio while the did a breakin during the Today show.  It was a little stressful as we were warned that we had to be really quiet and as you know, kids with Autism, well, can't sometimes.  But he didn't utter a sound during the 5 or 10 minute span, we were really proud of him. After that, we got to see the newsroom and where all the news vans were parked.  It was just so cool to see the behind the scenes stuff.  Casey was beside himself. After we were done, we got in the car and he almost seemed to be in a trance.  I asked him what he was thinking about, assuming his answer would have to be about our experience.   \"Now, \" answered, \"we need to go tour WXYZ!\"........geez............    \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SP8pG3jY_dI/AAAAAAAAAPk/0YnCrAW11Go/s1600-h/DSC02750.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SP8o8eWrmmI/AAAAAAAAAPc/ZAEjQ46Jzy4/s1600-h/DSC02753.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SP8oyv-eJ5I/AAAAAAAAAPU/czbER7XxTik/s1600-h/DSC02752.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SPuUivkJL_I/AAAAAAAAAPM/NjwyLiJDq90/s1600-h/DSC02754.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/caseys-dream-came-true_24.html", "title": "\nCasey's Dream Came True\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 23, 2008", "body": "\nI recently learned about a new sensory item on the news that worked like a weighted vest but wasn't quite as cumbersome.  The report went on to mention how it helped many kids with Autism and ADHD, and how it affected their proprioception and balance and really helped them to focus more and be in tune with their bodies.  It's a weighted belt called a Miracle Belt. Casey's biggest issue at school is focus, and if you ever saw him walk, you know that he has trouble with knowing where his body is in space.  In the past,  I've had him carry a backpack with something heavy in it and you can tell a difference.  So this Miracle Belt was appealing and I read up on it. www.miraclebelt.com I finally broke down and got one, they aren't cheap but we felt like it could be helpful.  So, after I got it and showed Casey, his first response was \"Send that back!\".  Great!  He went on to say that it was for babies, and it \"hurt\" after I bribed him to wear it for 2 minutes. The same week I bought this cheapie little magazine that I like and came across an article about a boy with ADHD and how that very belt worked for him.  It's in  Woman's World  magazine if you're interested in reading it.  The mom in the story used a great idea of telling her son the belt would give him magic powers to think better.  She's brilliant, I yelled at Casey to put it on, not making him like it at all.  I actually read the article to him, and believe it or not, I think I sold him on it.  Thank God for second chances! So, presently, we are at the point where he will wear it when he does his homework.  Now granted, this has only been in the last 3 days, but I can tell a difference when he's doing his work.  Oddly, his writing, which is, let's face it, horrific, has been smaller, more precise, more legible.  When I told him last night to do 4 worksheets his teacher had sent home (and requested I not help him with, that's another blog), he sat for a good 10 to 15 minutes straight, completing each one with just a little  bit of encouragement from me to get things done.  I was really bowled over!  I looked over the work when he had finished, and although not perfect, or even correct at some points, he still sat, for a looong time, and finished.  And he never tried to escape or complain!  Stunning!  A miracle in and of itself! I am in no way selling these Miracle belts or am I affiliated with the company, but I just thought I would share my experience thus far.  I know as a parent with a kid like Case, it's always nice to hear first hand what works and what doesn't, and this thing really seems to help him!  Fortunately, they do have a trade in program because as the kid grows, so does the need for more weight in the belt.  Right now the one he wears is about 4lbs.   I'll continue to report on any more improvements or miracles we see come from it, and I will be equally as eager to report how crappy it turned out to be.  But I'm hoping for the best! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SQDzIbD1O4I/AAAAAAAAAPs/e-uJ3L0Cayw/s1600-h/DSC02783.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SQD0p2DITWI/AAAAAAAAAP0/p7Rr24E1XR8/s1600-h/DSC02784.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/miracle-beltdoes-it-work.html", "title": "\nThe Miracle Belt...Does it Work?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 26, 2008", "body": "\nEvery Halloween our local VFW hall holds a party for kids with disabilities and their family on the Friday before Halloween.  We've gone for the past 4 or 5 years now, so this past Friday night was no exception.   It's always the same, you get there, you get in line and a row of friendly old folks give out a name tag, a goody bag, and several treats that you can tell they got from local organizations.  After that excitement, you go into the hall and find a table.  There is almost always someone we know there, so we sat down with a mom who brought her son with Down's and his \"normal\" twin.  Casey immediately started dancing, as he is always wont to do. He continued dancing for most of the 2 hours, stopping in between for bites of hot dogs, lots of drinks of pop, and a trip or two to the little Halloween Village (aka painted giant boxes that looked like buildings) where people handed out tons of candy, and my fat butt is so grateful for that!  He loved it though, and had a great time.  He even asked the dj to play \"THe Monster Mash\" again, his favorite Halloween tune.  He even at one point walked up to a mom there and asked her if she was Sara Palin, because she looked like her, but I don't think she was in costume! I guess what I love about this party so much is that our kids can look as goofy as they want, they can run around and just be themselves because really no one is judging them, they aren't out of their element.  If we had been at a party on the same level but that wasn't for kids with disablitlies, I probably would have corraled Casey more, made him not run across the dance floor, not allowed him to flap around so much, but I didn't have to.  There were kids in wheel chairs, with Downs, CP, adults with issues having a great time.  And that same feeling I was feeling was almost palpable amongst the friends and family there.  Everyone just had a wonderful time.  THere were no pitiful or judgemental glances, just happy people being themselves.  I don't mean to get corny, but I am sure some of you can definitely relate to that! By the way, due to my lack of organization and planning, we went to WalMart 30 minutes prior to the party to find a costume.  My boy actually chose a pirate costume, perhaps as an hommage to Captain Feathersword from the Wiggles?  He looked way cute and kept most of the costume on all night!  I of course forgot my camera.  I'll have to get some shots on Halloween! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SQSMsPT9-BI/AAAAAAAAAQU/QWiQIXKZ3eA/s1600-h/552710906.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/annual-halloween-party_26.html", "title": "\nThe Annual Halloween Party\n"},

Casey has been wanting to tour our local NBC affiliate WDIV channel 4 for a really looooong time now.  At one point this summer I tried to satiate his pleas by just taking him down to the studio  just to hang out  in the front of it.  That helped, a little.  I was really having trouble trying to set up a tour, as I really had no \"connections\" and my emails were going unanswered. Finally, just by chance, I found a \"connection\".  I was at a party over the summer at a friend's house and we were discussing this whole Casey/studio tour issue.

{"date": "Wednesday, October 15, 2008", "body": "\nI'm at the library right now, killing time while Casey plays games on the library computers.  He really shouldn't be playing the computer.  At least I told his teacher that I wouldn't allow him to play on the computer today.  Bet your wondering why, and why he's playing if I said that!? Well, his teacher calls today, and after some polite small talk, tells me that there was a \"situation\" at school today.  Her voice sounded grave, grave enough to cause me to have sudden images of Casey pooping on the floor (not something he does normally, on purpose) or Casey knocking someone over, or Casey screaming F*&^ so loud, the whole school heard it.   She explained that they were bringing that new para in that I talked about  here , and she was going down with him and the regular para to science.  As explained to me, he was following them (hhhhmmm, thought they were supposed to be shadowing him, hhhhhmmmm)when suddenly, and hold on to your hats...I hope you can handle this one....take a deep breath... HE WENT INTO THE GIRLS BATHROOM!!!!! That's right, he went into the girl's bathroom!  Can you believe this?  Stifling my laughter (and all you Autism moms know what I'm talking about, and if you don't, don't read my blog, you're uptight), I continued to listen.  Apparantly, his sudden appearance in the girl's room caused quite a stir!  All the girls started shouting \"Casey (apparantly, everyone knows Casey), you can't be in here, get out!\".  HORRORS!  His regular para rushed in and found him jumping and stimming and laughing (call juvenile detention!).  He apparantly would not leave when asked, causing his para to report to the teacher that he was being obstinate.  I personally think, know, that he was reacting to the rise he got out of the chicks in the bathroom. Well, after they finally got to science, he didn't do so well, probably anticipating the punishment he was going to get when he got back to class.  And indeed, he did, the teacher reported, lose computer time, and Coke!  Needless to say he was upset. When asked why he went into the girl's room, he said simply \"I wasn't paying attention.\".  It's as easy as that.  His teacher tended to want to believe him which was cool, and I did believe him.  I was then interrogated by the teacher concerning whether I let him use the Ladies Room on a regular basis.   I don't like being questioned about things like this by someone who doesn't have a kid with a disability.  In fact, I'm pretty sure anyone with a kid with a disability would never question such a thing.  Of course I take him in the Ladies room when we're dadless (when Bill is with us, it's all boys room and urinals and whatever boys do in there). Would I let a 4 year old go into the men's room by himself?  NO, and that's about Casey's bathroom mentality at this point in time.  I think I covered all his habits  here  awhile back.  There's no way I would let him go alone into a men's restroom with no way of helping him or wrangling him in, short of covering my eyes and making a mad dash past guys at the urinals.  On top of those issues, how do I know some freak wouldn't follow him into the stall.  I don't, and that's that. So, to wrap this too long story up, I finally concurred with the teacher that this was indeed an inappropriate act, and that we would carry through with the punishment at home, and do a social story about it, blah blah blah.... But the more I thought about it, as much as it is his fault, and he shouldn't have done it, it's also their fault for not walking with him.  And so I decided he will be punished by not playing the computer at home....the library is another story....hee hee Please don't think I'm taking this all too lightly, I really don't like that he did what he did, but my God, there could be much worse things.  It was cute by the way when I asked him what he saw when he went in there.  \"Girls washing their hands!\".  Of course. On the flipside, we went for a well needed haircut and he did awesome.  Five years ago, I had to strangle hold him while tears, saliva, and hair covered his face and mine, and I always felt like we both needed strong medication when we were done.  This time, as in the past few recently, he sat straight, scrunched his shoulders only a little, and was just really good.  See, for all you mamas of the little ones with Autism, there is hope! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SPa5Yn5WKKI/AAAAAAAAAOk/gRmGaxF-KEg/s1600-h/3436623112.jpeg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SPa8XsQGWBI/AAAAAAAAAOs/Qts2ZK55OFA/s1600-h/DSC02749.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/are-you-kidding-me.html", "title": "\nAre You Kidding Me?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 12, 2008", "body": "\nWe have a strange thing that happens in our house every weekend just about (like most people I'm sure on some level).  Our thing of course involves Casey. Every weekend, he is happy as a clam throughout Saturday morning.  This time of the day usually includes breakfast, watching Qubo on NBC (a little group of kids shows all together they show from 10am to 1pm, but there is also a Qubo cable channel that shows the same shows  all  the time and this is important to this tale later), and dilly dallying on the computer. When he first discovered Qubo, we couldn't leave the house until 1pm, when it was over.  This rule sorta went down the tubes later on thank goodness.  But now, after the day is over and night begins to fall, Case begins to get very emotional about Saturday in general, saying that it's not Saturday, kids shows are not over, etc..   He gets to the point of crying and really upsetting himself. We switched cable companies recently and found out we now had this Qubo channel, and thought the whole issue he had each week would be done, because he could watch \"kid shows\" anytime he wanted.  This however, has not helped for whatever reason.   Last night Dad took him for a bike ride.  I was in the kitchen awaiting their arrival back.  Through the open window, I could hear very loud talking verging on yelling and knew it was not neighborhood kids, but my child back from his ride.  Bill was clearly upset with him and he was in tears.  Bill explained that the first half of the ride was good, but then for whatever reason, Case began his beligured monologue again on how kids shows are over and it's not Saturday and all that same stuff, and all the while, yelling it very loudly while riding.  He also goes so far as constantly telling us that it's not 2008, it's 2006!  Ok, whatever. Later on, I was helping him get ready for bed when I was trying to reason with him about this whole silly Saturday routine and how he had to let it go.  I finally got out of him that it made him sad that Saturdays and Sundays go by so quick and then it's Monday.  Ok, a breakthrough, so I guess when night starts to fall, perhaps he's reminded that the kids shows he used to only enjoy in the morn are over, it's almost Sunday, and Sunday is very close to Monday.  I thought I had it all figured out. But it just broke my heart that it tortured him so to anticipate the weekends being over with.  I don't believe it's because he dislikes school or anything like that, I think it's just that he gets his ultimate down time on the weekends and he loves it so much.  I tried to explain to him that weekends were like cookies, or pizza, sort of a treat, and that you always get one, it never changes, they always come. I laid down with him to watch the Wiggles Magical Adventure for the 800th time and he seemed calmer.  Then, Dad came in to say good night and he starts yelling \"It's 2006, it's not 2008!\". Bill quickly kissed him on the head and scurried out of the room.....I laid there and endured some more bitchin' until he fell asleep.  Guess this problem wasn't solved after all...... Any suggestions would be truly appreciated!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SPIRJm5RunI/AAAAAAAAAOU/oxBw-A5rKGI/s1600-h/qubo_channel.gif", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SPIR4uL5h7I/AAAAAAAAAOc/-YTE5Vw39hw/s1600-h/70021487.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/i-love-saturday-i-hate-saturday.html", "title": "\nI Love Saturday, I Hate Saturday\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, October 11, 2008", "body": "\nA new issue reared it's not so ugly head this week for Casey in his educational career.   First, let me explain a little about how our local school system is set up as far as special ed. goes.  You have what Casey is in, the AI (Autistically Impaired-ugh) classroom, and then you have cross categorical classrooms that \"address\" the needs of kids with more intense learning disabilities, some Downs kids, Aspergers kids who can't make it in regular ed, emotionally impaired kids.  It runs the gammet.  The classes tend to be larger, and more on course with a regular classroom because many of the kids are able to keep up with the pace. So, at this point, Casey, being in the AI classroom, also goes with a parapro to general ed science and history.  At first it was rocky as I think I chronicled a while back.  But with the help of a great parapro and just getting comfortable, things have been going much better, and he even got 80% on a history test!  Not bad I would say.  The other day however, his teacher called to let me know that there would be a new para coming in to take him to science in the afternoon while the other great para would still be taking him to history in the morn.  Of course, what I surmised from this new development was that they needed to keep 2 paras in his AI room at all times with the teacher as well, and taking the one out twice a day was getting harder to handle for the other para. Fine.  Understandable, of course, I'm thinking, keep the new para in his AI room and let the other continue to do what she was doing.  Why train another?  Unfortunately, I don't believe I have much say or control in that whole thing. Jump to the next day, his teacher calls me again and we begin to chit chat about a few things and out of the blue she asks me if I had toured the afore mentioned cross categorical classrooms last year?  I had indeed done so, much to the chagrin of the special ed , for lack of a better title, administrator, who, like so many of the other staff in this system it seems, gets irritated with the thought of parents trying to get their children in the least restrictive enviorment they can.  I had toured it wanting to weigh my options, because I knew what his AI classroom would probably look like ( as it does now) and not knowing who the teacher was going to be. I was unimpressed to say the least of my tour.  I was rushed through about 4 classrooms by the administrator, who could have cared less what I thought of them, because in her head, she believed he would never make it anyway based on what little she knew about Casey.  She never said this, you just know things as a mother.  The classrooms seemed overpopulated to me, a lot going on, too much.  And the biggest deal breaker in the short time I had to look at the program was the discipline program they are on where they carry around cards where they get points for good behavior and get points taken away for bad.  Well, seeing as how Casey still has problems adding 2+2, I knew that wouldn't work, and it seemed to be a very big part of their day.   So, sharing a lot of this with his teacher over the phone, she started saying that at a staff meeting they had discussed Casey maybe being at a point now that he could handle going into one of these cross cat. classrooms.  Funny I thought, last year this broad (not his teacher, the administrator) didn't even want to let me tour it, and now they think Casey is ready for it?   At first I was excited, thinking how cool it was that he has matured and advanced enough to have that considered as an option, but then the conspiracy theorist got the best of me and I started trying to reason out this sudden suggestion. First of all, the whole parapro, or lack of parapro deal is due to Casey having to go to regular ed.  It's in his IEP, they have to do it.  But, wouldn't it be easier to stick him in a classroom thats  sorta  like a regular ed room, and that way he wouldn't have to go back and forth, and his AI room could maintain their paras without losing one.  I know this is their plan.  They aren't really looking out for his best interest, they are trying not to hire more staff.   On top of that, there are issues of grading coming up, how to grade him in regular ed, with a modified curriculum.  This is all new to the general ed teachers who have never had kids until this year mainstream.  All the problems they are having are things that they didn't plan for or even anticipate. Part of me thought, maybe it would be cool for him to be in the cross cat. room, and just say that he can't follow their discipline program and they'll have to modify if they want him to do something of that nature.  It might be good to be with some kids that aren't quite typical, but also aren't non verbal with tons of behavior issues.  Maybe, it would be just enough like a regular classroom, that he wouldn't have to go out to regular ed and switch up his day so much.   But, he has adapted to his schedule, his para rocks, his teacher rocks, he's happy, he doesn't fight me to go to school, he gets time with typical kids, while having the option of coming back to his small class setting in the AI room to calm and get his self together.   Why rock the boat?  So I can say \"Yeah, my son is in a cross cat. room!\". I told his teacher before I would even consider thinking about the change, I would need to tour the program again, and for more than 5 minutes in each room.  She said she would work on arranging that. I am definitely not going to rush into things.  I have to make sure they are trying to do this for Casey's best interest, and not their own, but as you can tell, I have my doubts. More to come I'm sure.......\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/heres-interesting-dilemma.html", "title": "\nHere's an Interesting Dilemma\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 9, 2008", "body": "\nThe great  Good Enough Mama  wrote a fabulous entry about how she was    the world's worst mom .  She called out to all who read it to share the reasons they might be the worst mom.  Well, I love a challenge.  But for the sake of not incriminating myself, and to avoid having someone call social services toot sweet on me, I decided to totally rip off Good Enough Mama's entry, and simply comment and commiserate.  I hope this is ok with her, and if not, please let me know  Good Enough Mama !  So, here goes. Good Enough Mama's comments are italicized and mine are bold, in case you couldn't figure that out! 1. Tonight, after removing them from the oven, I dropped Little Man\u2019s chicken buddies on the kitchen floor as I attempted (stupidly) to transfer them to his plate. I glanced quickly (after gasping, albeit quietly, \u201cOh, shit!) into the family room, saw that he hadn\u2019t noticed, and bent down to retrieve the buddies. Blowing on them to remove the dust/rotting food particles/hairs/critters, I started to sing the theme song to Leave It To Beaver and promptly tossed them on his plate. Crisis averted, I actually had the nerve to congratulate myself on a job well done. Job well done indeed!  What the heck?  Were you going to waste those precious nuggets?  And clearly any questionable matter that be  might stuck to them is matter that is already in your house and that your son is used to, so thusly he will not get sick from it!  At this point in time, I can't recall a food dropping episode, but if I did, I would do exactly what you did.  I have given him stale food, because he wanted it real bad and we didn't have anything else he wanted.  I suppose that may be on the same level! 2. When people (mostly those who read about my life here) tell me that I\u2019m doing a great job with Little Man and that I shouldn't\u2019t be so hard on myself, I actually accept their kind words. I put my shoulders back a little, tousle my hair, and smugly smile, all the while thinking, Holy shit, I really DO have people fooled. It\u2019s a good thing they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m really like as a mom.  Oh my God, can I relate!  I have gotten comments that embarrass me inside that are complimentary, and yet so wrong!  But ya know what, you have to think, maybe others see something I don't, maybe I'm not giving myself credit.  Maybe I am super!  Maybe I should win an Oscar for making these people think I'm fabulous!  And that's ok! 3. I often bitch and complain about my life as a wife and mom. I do it in front of my kid. I regret it instantly, but still. I bitch. For example, I\u2019m so SICK of this crap! I can\u2019t take it any more. I am SO DONE with this life. I am losing my FREAKING mind!  Yeah, you might want to consider it carefully before you call me June Cleaver again. I\u2019m so much more Roseanne than June. Sad, but true. I often fear the mental scarring I have incurred upon my child due to my bitching sessions in front of him.  I have found myself yelling so much he felt it necessary with his Autistic, developmentally delayed mind  to say \"It's ok mommy!  It will be alright!\".  I AM A BITCH! 4. I trick my kid into thinking that chores are fun. A lot. Hey, buddy! Want to help mommy with the laundry again? It\u2019s your lucky day\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll let you push the buttons AND pour in the detergent\u2026 Honestly, I can't empathize with you here because this is nothing but brilliant, nothing wrong with it.  So you're playing on his naivety a little, what parent doesn't do that?  I am the worst because I make my son do nothing much to my husband's chagrin, and someday he will make a miserable boyfriend and husband thanks to me! 5. I tell Little Man that he has 5 minutes left of television time, then let another hour slip by, just because I\u2019m enjoying the peace and the time at my computer. He is going to be up a fecking creek when it comes time to learn how to read a clock in school. Or is it ME who will be up the creek? Who am I kidding? It\u2019s SO going to be me. I can't say anything about this is justifiable, other than you get some quiet time out of it, which is rightly yours.  I have found myself saying \"5 more minutes Case!\" for an hour at a time myself, but I usually try to think the 5 minutes isn't up, thus, I'm not the bad one! 6. I spit on my hand and smooth out Little Man\u2019s hair when we\u2019re going out. If he gets canker sores on his scalp, I\u2019m so at fault. Uh, gross, but necessary.  Casey has too much hair for this method to be effective but I have had to take so many other gross and drastic measures in order to fix problems, so this too is relatable.  I won't go into any of them directly, but let's just say because of one incident, I always carry around a little portable roll of toilet paper with us, and that's all's I'm sayin'! 7. I say \u201cmaybe\u201d a lot, when I really mean \u201cno,\u201d but it\u2019s just easier using the \u201cmaybe\u201d clause in order to get out of a jam. I\u2019m all about avoiding the tantrums and conflict. I think he\u2019s on to me, though. Lately when I say \u201cmaybe,\u201d Little Man follows it up with this retort: Mommy! Just say yes or no. It\u2019s not hard. I need to know the truth.  This is not bad, this gives him hope, false hope, but hope..... 8. Sometimes I wish Little Man were \u201cNormal.\u201d Even for a day or two, just so I could see what it\u2019s like to have a \u201cNormal\u201d kid. I\u2019m so betting it would be a piece of cake. Cake with icing. Lots and lots of icing. Well, anyone who has a special needs kid and says they have never wished that either are saintly, or are bullshittin' everyone big time.  How can you not wonder what it's like, especially if you don't have any other kids like myself?  I have to say though, that many a time, I have been around \"typical\" children, and they make me very grateful for my little doll, despite his foible's. 9. I feed my kid fast food several times per week. Like, almost once a day. He\u2019s probably addicted. He\u2019s probably going to be the next Super Size Me dooood. Feck. More therapy. YOU are very brave to admit this, and I can tell you, so do a lot of people.  LIKE ME!  I consider a day without fast food a health break  for Case.  Casey is  picky,  and I want him to eat, and I don't go by the notion of \"Well, if he's hungry, he'll eat at home eventually!\"  I don't have time for that crap!  I figure, if he eats out without fries, we're doing good!  You, and I'll repeat it, are brave! 10. Sometimes I forget to care that I\u2019m raising a child who will, as a result of my shiteous mothering, require more therapy than one family could ever hope to afford. Ok, maybe \u201cforget\u201d is a strong word. Let\u2019s say I let it slip my mind, temporarily. Ah, be not afraid my child!  I have seen children of mother's who have done every GD therapy in the book, and the kid is never \"better\", and I've seen kids whose mom sorta went with the flow and did what they could, and often, they have turned out the best they can.  You can only do so much...at least, that's what I've started telling myself.  11. Apparently, I let my son put plastic bags on his head. Also apparent is the fact that instead of removing the plastic bag and scolding him because it, like, could KILL him or something, I grabbed my camera and recorded the moment for future dramatic courtroom evidence posterity. Or future blackmail. This is weird but funny, and I enjoyed the photo!  Hey, I used to let Casey pull his testicle out as far as he could in the tub while I read to him!  Not now, it's extra weird now!  I never took photos though, that would have been disturbing! 12. There are way more reasons that I might be the world\u2019s worst mother, but I\u2019m too embarrassed to share them here. Here\u2019s where you come in: I need you to give me some reasons that YOU might be The World\u2019s Worst Mother. If you can\u2019t think of anything, make something up. You\u2019re doing it to help a friend, namely, ME. Take one for the team, sports. Take one for the team. Thanks for sharing your relatable, funny, and sometimes gross entry!  I applaud you!  And thanks for letting me use it without asking.  Please don't sue me, I don't have any money! There ya  go folks, I think most everyone can relate to something in here, and if not, then you're the  WORST MOM IN THE WORLD  for not admitting any of it!

{"date": "Monday, October 6, 2008", "body": "\nWell, the excitement that started over a week ago, has finally come to a close.  Yes, Casey's 10th Birthday Extravaganza has come to an end!  Thank God.  Just kidding.  It was a big deal to turn 10 years old.  I can't believe I have a 10 year old, it's very weird.   I thought I would share some of the highlights from the events that occured during the Extravaganza. It all started with a little school bash.  Unfortunately (or fortunately as the case may be) the batteries on my damn camera went out (as well as the battery on my video camera, what to be prepared mom!) so I was only able to capture the above photo from that event, but I'm glad I did.  It's a shot of what Casey wrote in himself because someone forgot to put his class party in the schedule.  Everyone there was tickled and thrilled by him doing this, as was I.  He had fun handing out party favors, and eating frosted cookies and Cheetos with his friends.  They had all made cards for him (all 3 of them).  It was pretty cute. That night we went to Chuck E. Cheeses for the traditional birthday with our closest friends.  These are their adorable children Sophia and Jack, and of course gargantuan birthday boy.  It was an evening of fun and lots of pizza eating for Casey.  The parents enjoyed some \"spirits\" because we found that it makes CEC more fun for us! Don and Rebecca (the parents of those darling children, and just as cute) got Case the perfect gift, a set of his very own Pee Wee Herman Show DVD's, First Season.  He LOVES them.  Thanks J/Ks. Here, you can see the boy on his actual birthday \"showing off\" the beautiful cake I made  and  decorated myself! (No, I did not get it at a bakery, I'm just that good...ha).  We had his father's side over and enjoyed that lovely cake along with some Kentucky Fried Chicken per Casey's request.  Finger lickin' good it was.  As you can see, he's striking his \"no photos please\" stance he uses frequently when approached by the paparazzi. Here  he is just this last Friday, playing hooky at the Indianapolis zoo.  My sisters and I took him and it was such a great day.  All the animals were out on display, and very few crowds were there.  Other than his constant demands for a drink all through the \"Plains\" area, he seemed to have great time and especially enjoyed the dolphin show.  (I sorta needed a drink after that too! nar nar)  Here he takes his life into his own hands as he strikes a quick pose by a python who we spotted creeping up the wall in the snake exhibition.  Where are the damn zookeepers when you need them? Here's a giraffe we saw, he was pretty cute. The next night was the big Pee Wee Herman/Mexico City Grill bash.  About 16 members of the family showed and a great time was had by all, especially Case.  We got the staff to change one of the televisions in the dining room to  Univision (a Spanish channel), and with that, and all the people and plenty of Sprite, it was Casey's idea of a party.  Pictured here is his cousin Ali who is a special needs teacher.  She loves hanging with him, especially when she's got a taco and a pitcher of margaritas nearby!  Hee hee, just jokin' Ali! The staff was kind enough to come and sing to him in Spanish and he was so excited.  He got to wear a sombrero which one of my enibriated family members helped him sneak out of the restaurant with after dinner was through. That's me looking really old next to my gorgeous niece.  And no, Casey is not choking in this photo, I have no idea why he is holding his neck. Finally, and this is sad, I have no photos other than this one, of my sister Sue's dog Fletch with a party hat on of the festivities that occured after the restaurant.  Maybe a few too margaritas for mommy were to blame!  We went back over to Sue's house where she had spent way too much time gathering Pee Wee memorabilia for him and crafting her own Pee Wee decorations since they don't make them anymore!  It was a great night and Case was a little overwhelmed but had fun. Thanks everyone and especially sister Sue for making his birthday awesome!  What a party week!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOoWh1J-MPI/AAAAAAAAAL0/ixrFzKBFICk/s1600-h/DSC02679.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOodYtVkM9I/AAAAAAAAAM8/jmemIql96V0/s1600-h/DSC02684.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOodGyiNrPI/AAAAAAAAAM0/8JPtLKYmp_A/s1600-h/DSC02688.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOocd6pfQSI/AAAAAAAAAMs/BquuRQWiOUg/s1600-h/DSC02715.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOoa-6itJUI/AAAAAAAAAMk/uABP0NweJvo/s1600-h/DSC02718.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOoaMmELiYI/AAAAAAAAAMc/2OI9CEa8Idc/s1600-h/DSC02725.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOoZ7YPB_6I/AAAAAAAAAMU/SDo7p841DJo/s1600-h/DSC02729.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOoZuOaXZKI/AAAAAAAAAMM/B4FQDSPLDIE/s1600-h/DSC02730.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SOoZZiqIQUI/AAAAAAAAAME/d4EnS57Lf3I/s1600-h/DSC02734.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/10th-birthday-extravaganza-is-complete.html", "title": "\nThe 10th Birthday Extravaganza is Complete!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 1, 2008", "body": "\nMy dearest friend alerted me this morning to a blog entry that she completely  enjoyed and felt I would feel the same.  And I did.  It's over here at   Good Enough Mama  and I highly encourage you to read it.  I'm going to take Mama up on her challenge and think of the top 10 reasons I'm not the world's worst mother, despite the fact that I've bestowed that title on myself daily!  I think this will be very cathartic for me to consider, and might even make me change my title to, \"Almost World's Worst Mother\". So, here are the top 10 reason why I am not \" THE WORLD'S WORST MOTHER ! 1. Ok, number one.  Well, I always ask for them to put half water, and half pop in Casey's drinks at the restaurant,  that way, it takes 2 glasses of whatever it is to get him acting crazy on sugar. 2.  I use only natural household cleaning items and natural skincare stuff on him despite the fact that I let him eat way too much fast food. 3.  I make sure every morning I wet down his bed head and spritz his bangs over to the side so he has some semblance of coolness in his world of naturally being cute but goofy. 4.  Going back to letting him have too much fast food, I do provide him with substantial vitamins after eating, so that  I  feel better. 5.  Whenever I cuss around him, I always make sure to tell him how bad mommy is bad for doing so, but that only adults can cuss. 6.  Then, when he does because he doesn't care if only adults can cuss, I always tell him he can only do it at home, so he won't get in trouble at school, or so we won't receive any dirty looks out in public. 8.  I always tell him not to touch the locker room floor at the rec center and clear away from the toilet as soon as he has voided.  Germs frighten me. 9.  I never talk badly about his father too severely in front of him in times of anger, and I definitely have stopped calling daddy a \"fuckhead\" when Casey is in earshot.  That can be a fun name to call someone....Casey thought one time. and drumrolllllllllllll 10.  I am not the worst mother in the world because I buy organic chocolate chip cookies that cost $5.00 so that when he eats 6 of them a day, I know he's not getting high fructose corn syrup, but  PURE CANE SUGAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you, thank you. You know, this has been very therapeutic.  I'm not bad!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://goodmum.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/the-top-ten-reasons-im-not-the-worlds-worst-mother/"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/10/top-10-reason-im-not-worlds-worst-mom.html", "title": "\nTop 10 Reason I'm not the World's Worst Mom\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 28, 2008", "body": "\nI know all 3 of my readers are sitting on pins and needles waiting to read the follow up to  \"Indulge Me if You Will\" .   Well, I have enlisted the talents of a fantastic writer (and a professinal writer no less), and novice blogger, my husband Bill, to regale you with his memories of that horrific but ultimately bountiful night.  Here Bill opens up about the ups and downs of the hours that followed my initial arrival at the hospital.  Get out your hankies out, this is a tear jerker. Bill...husband here...with my recollections of the big day... If I can put my guy hat for a moment...it was the Michigan/Michigan State game...round about kickoff...when Bonnie, after a call to a friend for confirmation, calmly announced that her water broke. LIke any rational thinking man, I lined the vehicle with trash bags, and we headed out for the hospital...After being greeting by a squadron of nurses....and a brief visit from our guest gyno (the regular doc out on a planned vacation)...we hunkered down for what ended up to be hours upon hours of Bonnie feeling miserable...and me and loyal sis-in-law Sue feeling bad for her feeling bad... Of course, as night turned into deep night...and Bonnie's misery increased (as well as her dislike for the tall, dashing fella who got her in that condition), we all took great solace in the many breathing exercises we learned in Lamaze classes...(Breath deep...Focus...Get out of my face!)...Sue and I also challenged each other to see who could stay awake the longest...(I fell to fifteen minutes of slumber about 4-ish in the a.m.) The proverbial light at the end of the tunnel was the epideral...but as the time grew near and pain ratcheted up a few hundred notches...nary an anethesiologist was to be found....(Seems a couple of C-sections were occupying these specialists)...Even Sue's early-morning screams into an empty hallway made little difference...and by the time a doc became available....it was too late for anything  but straight-on natural baby-birthing... But the fun had just begun...as we stared at what was to be Casey's noggin' trying to push its way out...(Progress was slow, to say the least)...The word surreal is often overused, but fit well here...I actually, for a few brief moments, was able to step out of the personal mode to subjectively marvel at the magic of the whole birthing process. Of course, the moanings of my wife jolted me back to the here and now, and I quickly assumed my role as primarly focal point and rooting section.  When Casey finally made his arrival at 12:16 p.m....with the aid of jelly-filled forceps...his purple, screeching presence marked a new chapter in our lives...one that to this day keeps us enthralled with what will come next. So sweet, so beautifully written.  Thank you Bill, and the image of \"jelly-filled forceps\" would make anyone woman considering getting pregnant jump in the sack with her man immediately I think!!!! Up next, my other and probably more aggressive coach and dear sister, Sue, will be sharing her recollections as well.....boy, I'm  really turning this into an epic!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC02035.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/indulge-me-if-you-willpart-deux-thats-2.html", "title": "\nIndulge Me if You Will...Part Deux (that's 2  in fancy French) A Husband's Perspective\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 29, 2008", "body": "\nHere we go again.  An actual account of the miracle of birth as seen through the eyes of a loving, humble, and sweet  older  sister.   She has a filthy potty mouth and tells it like it is, so consider yourself warned. Some words even had to be \"edited\" to protect some of my really good Christian friends from being too offended. If you think   Bill's contribution  was gross and hardcore, then get ready for this beauty! She of course supplied the photo because it's a good one of her, so I included it!  Go ahead Sue..... O.K. since Bill put on his \"Guy\" hat to share his thoughts of that long night, I am putting on my \"Sister\" hat to share with you the pain that Bonnie endured for 24 horrible hours. I am not a writer or an editor like some of us in the family but I am damn funny so hopefully you will enjoy my recollection of that long night.   The day started out comfortable for everyone, somewhat joking a little amongst the three of us and talking nicely with the nurses and doctors who at the time seemed like nice people who would give you anything you wanted if you would just ask for it. The first few hours went by pretty quickly, Bill and I taking turns sitting in the old, leather chair that squeaked very loudly each time you sat in it. We thought Bonnie might let one of us lay on the bed since we ended up being there for 24 hours and we were somewhat tired of talking positive to her ass all night, but no she never offered.   The hours went by and each hour she grew more and more uncomfortable so I spent a lot of time in front of the nurses station demanding that they give her something or come rub her feet, or back etc. I think at one point, I heard the nurses bad mouthing me as they smiled when I walked away. Hey, she's my little sister and I don't want to see her in pain,,,,,although better her than me, I'm not the one who went and got knocked up.   Anyway, the next morning she finally started to dilate and there was hope that we were going to see this little miracle sometime soon. Well, not so fast. You know how you hear of these women popping the baby right out within an hour of their arrival to the hospital, well that's a bunch of bull and  those women are not real women. I think all women should go through 24 hours of pure misery, makes you appreciate the whole process more.   From 6:00AM to about 11:00AM Bill and I stood at the side of the bed looking at a little round mirror that encompassed a t#$* and a tiny little crown of a head, maybe two inches. The funniest comment of the day was when Bonnie said to me, \"OK, you can look at my crotch to see if he is coming out\", well OK thanks Bonnie, I've been looking at your damn crotch for about three hours now and I don't see a baby just yet. Even though there are four girls in our family, we are all very modest so this crotch thing was a little uncomfortable at first for both Bonnie and I however, when there is a baby involved you seem to forget that you are looking at your sister's t&*^.   If I could just back up for a second, I promised my \"little\" sister that when the time came I would make sure she got her epidural. Well, the time had come and she was in so much pain which was breaking my heart. What do big sisters do? Well, they go find any nurse or doctor and scream at them until they bring the epidural. Unfortunately as Bill mentioned, there was a C-section going on in the room next to us but who gives a shit, my sister is in pain. I ran out in the hallway (well, I actually walked) and I saw a gurney covered in blood and the doctor was in the room with a team of people. I yelled, MY SISTER NEEDS AN EPIDURAL! Almost like an outburst like Casey does when he really wants something. The doctor came out and yelled ma'am, we have an emergency in the other room! \" I don't give a shit, my sister needs an epidural! Besides, I promised her and when you make a promise to your little sister you can't let her down. Well, no one came in to give her the epidural and she had already dilated to the point where she could not have one anyway. WOW, I felt like such a failure. So, Bill and I became cheerleaders and heavy breathers and continued to watch the little mirror that finally started to change and then low and behold out came ET! The longest little body with long skinny fingers and long toes, but the cutest most precious baby in the whole world. As they cleaned him off and we got a closer look, it was BONNIE! The I looked again and it was BILL!  A little of both of the proud parents, he was adorable! Well, my duties did not end there. My Mom and sister were on their way up from Indiana and had just about arrived to the hospital when I noticed that there was a lot of blood all over the floor of Bonnie's room. My mom is a big wimp and cannot handle seeing her kids in pain or give birth for that matter so ole sister Sue begins mopping up the blood so my Mom doesn't have to see it when she enters the room. Cause you know when women give birth there is no blood or pain, right? So, that is my story of the day when Casey was born and I would not have missed it for the world.   Very good Sue!  Well done for your first blogging attempt!  I hope you liked it too and please feel free to comment so she can see what people think about her style! ....I may have to change my policy on guest bloggers, geez.....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC_42.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/indulge-me-if-you-willpart-trois-thats.html", "title": "\nIndulge Me if You Will...Part Trois (that's 3  in fancy French) A Sister's Perspective\n"},

{"date": "Friday, September 26, 2008", "body": "\n I like to recollect back to the birth of Casey around his birthday each year.  You know, kinda thinking, what was I doing the day before, how fat I was, how swollen?  So, this being the day before his 10th birthday, I was doing just that as I drove home from buying him some b-day gifts (yes, I did find some). So indulge me if you will as I share what was happening at this point in my life 10 years ago.  I promise it won't be long, I have a pretty bad memory. The week prior to this, I had been in the hospital to be induced even though I wasn't due until October.  They had determined through ultrasound that the placenta was \"looking old\" what ever that meant so on top of the fact that I had off the scale blood pressure and had been home for a month with my feet up eating salt free foods, they wanted that baby out! So we eagerly got to the hospital early one morning and they started IV pitocin and sticking little capsules of some inducement drug up where the sun don't shine all that day and night.  Needless to say,  nothing  happened.  Let down and sore, we went back home, to wait some more. That following Saturday, I didn't feel good at all.  It was hot out, I was still swollen.  I was laying in bed sorta dozing when I literally heard a  POP  and had to suddenly rush to the bathroom. I was told that most women's water never broke, so I never imagined mine would.  But as I sat on the toilet, and pee'd, and pee'd some more, and then felt I had stopped peeing, but it was still coming out, I surmised that my water had indeed broken!  I called my friend Paulette to confirm, and she did, and told me to get to the hospital.  I wasn't really having contractions or any pain so I wasn't too concerned at that point. Bill laid trash bags across my seat in the car (he's a little anal) and we grabbed my suitcase and made a mad dash for the hospital.  There they got me all comfy, hooked me  up to an IV, my sister arrived to help Bill coach me on,  AND THE REST IS A FRICKIN NIGHTMARE!

Bascially, it's fundraiser where you were supposed to get  at least  $50 in \"pledges\".  I didn't do this because a)I sorta forgot about it, and b)why would I ask people to give money to a public school and get nothing in return?  So I sent in 20 bucks and that was that. The flyer sent home encouraged parents to come and cheer on their students as they did the 45 minute run (or walk if they choose).  I always feel tremendously guilty if I don't go to things like this because I have this fear that Casey will see the other parents and wonder where the hell I was.   So, I sorta scrambled the work schedule and made my way over.  It was a cute little program, and there were flags and teams and leaders and some sort of cheetah like freaky thing walking around (see above pic).  It sorta cracked me up because they made a track going around this tent that was playing music, and that was what they had to walk around (or run) for 45 minutes!?  I was picturing this great hike throughout the surrounding neighborhoods, people lining the streets cheering the children on!  But, that wasn't how it was at all.   Somehow, not only did I come to see him off and cheer him on while he made his way around this kinda dumb loop, I ended up walking around that dumb loop with him.  His lovely teacher walked with us for awhile and then had to see about another kiddo,  so I just kept walking with him.  I felt really queer every time I passed the other parents who had come to cheer their kids on, because they were just standing on the sidelines talking and waving pom poms, and here I am out walking with 100 little 5th and 6th graders.  How did this happen?  I'm a nerd. Casey was cool with it for awhile, although he said at one point he just needed to sit down (I'm with ya brotha!).   Anyway, the run ended with all the kids getting a popsicle and a bracelet (which I just realized was no longer on his wrist, not a surprise!).  It was hot but fun.  Here's the Red Team! I didn't get a bracelet, or a popsicle, nor was I featured in the picture!  But I walked darn't!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SNwk9d4IFVI/AAAAAAAAALc/uCRwtfSn9jc/s1600-h/DSC02675.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SNwkwZYOydI/AAAAAAAAALU/f0oP6ucaBxY/s1600-h/DSC02676.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/today-caseys-school-had-its-annual-fun.html", "title": "\nFun Run?\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 22, 2008", "body": "\n It hit me today that Joe Cool up above there has a birthday coming this Saturday, and I have nothing planned for it really, and no gifts bought or even waiting to be bought!  Now, before you go and call social services on me, I need to explain! It's his big 10Th birthday, it should be spectacular, or at least a little more special this year since he's getting into the double digits now.  But, at this point in time, the child's only interests are Pee Wee's Playhouse,  Arthur and Wiggle videos and the computer.  Oh, and Toy Story.    Well, these were the same interests he had in past years, so he has all the sundry toys that go with those themes, and lots of them.  And he doesn't play with a one.  Oh, and there's the little issue that has come up lately about how \"toys are for babies\" and \"I don't have to play with toys, I just play on the computer\" or so he says.  He doesn't really like any hand held games, we get videos from the library, and the ones he loves we have.  So, when friends and family ask me what he wants, I'm at a loss.  I know what I want...for him to branch out! When I broached the whole gift thing with him, he thought a lot about it.  He mentioned a few characters from Toy Story that he wanted.  I took to the Internet to find them, and didn't.  Then he decided he wanted a Pee Wee doll.  Ok, well, they haven't made those in 20 years, or so I found out, so they are now considered a  COLLECTOR'S ITEM , and if they aren't in good condition, then they really aren't and really aren't worth spending way too much on from Ebay.  So, there goes that idea.  Oh, and he mentioned he wanted car insurance..... Anyway, on top of that, the kid has no close friends.  You know, in Autism, social skills aren't a strength and uh....have you said \"Who is she tellin'?\" yet?....Anyhoot, a big friend party is pretty much not practical or realistic.  I mean, I could invite kids of my friends.  He knows them, but they don't play together on a regular basis, he doesn't ask about them, or  go to school with them.  We don't do play dates anymore.  So it would be sort of a big farce really.  I did do this I have to confess years ago,  when I was still struggling with the idea that his life would be different in many ways to \"typical\" kids.  I was in denial, and honestly, he never had that much fun.  In fact, when I watched his 6Th birthday video that we took at his McDonald's party, where there were about 10 kids, and lots of parents, and saw him holding his hands over his ears because of the noise level, I knew that was it, no more forced parties.  Geez, I think I even recruited a neighborhood kid for that one, what an idiot I was.   Now having said that, I have to report that for the last several years we traditionally get together with our dearest friends and their children at Chuck E. Cheese for any of their birthdays (and this was separate from the dumb forced parties, and the reason why is a whole other story entirely).  It's never forced or fake, and he's known their family since he was born, and their kids were born, and it's just sorta, natural.  So, we will definitely be doing that this year, as is tradition, and that takes off some of the pressure. Anyway, we'll probably do the typical family stuff too, and a trip to Indy(where my side presides) is in the works for more fun  and frivolity!   I think all this will be fine with Case, and I think any issues are my own.  As for the gifts, I'm still working on that.  He mentioned a laptop of his own, so if we get enough moola instead of gifts we can put it towards that I suppose.  What 10 year shouldn't have their own laptop?  The Pee Wee Doll and car insurance can wait till he has a job....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SNgQLOkSVfI/AAAAAAAAAK8/2UjXXYK4KU0/s1600-h/DSC02600.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/birthday-quandry.html", "title": "\nBirthday Quandry\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 18, 2008", "body": "\nToday around 10am I recieved a call from Casey's school.  Either puke has occured or he cussed and has been sent to juvenile detention I figured!  When I answered, his teacher Ms. Murray said \"Hi Bonnie, it's Jackie!\".  \"What did he do?\" I asked not thinking, being \"the cup's half empty\" girl.   \"Oh no, nothings wrong!\" she said, probably thinking me a nasty mom.  She went on to explain that he had just gotten back to his AI (Autistically Impaired) classroom from being in regular ed. social studies and he had the best time in there since school has started.  He was so thrilled about how well he did he was dancing around the room she reported and she and the parapros danced right along with him.  Casey told her that he sat really well and listened and wrote what the teacher wanted him to write.  His para who goes with him backed up his story, and even popped on the phone to tell me that she was just so thrilled!  She said her heart was almost pounding at how excited she was about how well he behaved.  At this point, I'm standing outside the gas station I was servicing, almost in tears, and just feeling so happy and proud.   The rest of the day, I called several family members and extreme close friends telling them of the call and Casey's accomplishments.  I kept thinking to myself, this is what he's capable of, this is his potential!  It's coming out big time.  Then of course I had to start hypothesizing on what may have caused him to have this great day!?  Was it a better night's sleep? Two Poptarts instead of one this morning?  What was it? Could it be that things are just clicking for him?  His comfort level is growing in school.  He's growing up, he's more mature.  His teacher and the staff are awesome by all accounts.  Things are just working together perhaps to cause him to ROCK! When he got off the bus,  he  said \"So, how was your day at Riley?\".  I said \"Yeah, it was great I heard!\" and he answered me and himself with an exuberant \"Yes!\".  And, we celebrated with his chosen treat of fries and a drink from Wendy's. His teacher called again apologizing for calling so much (yeah, like you have to apologize for taking an interest in my kid!  PUH-LEEZ!).  She went on to say the rest of his day was wonderful as well, and she is just so excited because he seems to be working really well with incentives that he chooses himself.  She went on to explain how she is going crazy with the incentives at this point but will start stretching them out farther as he gets more into the routine.  We have always found at home he works well when he's promised something in return, most kids do.  I think the difference this teacher has made in the school setting is that he gets to pick his incentive.  He has a board that has 6 different ones he can chose from (ie Coke, computer time, gum).  I think his being in control is making all the difference.   It's just so wonderful to get good reports, and to have a teacher so interested and better yet, excited about his doing well.  We are hoping that it continues and grows, but even if it doesn't, as mentioned before, I know what his potential is.  It's there, it will come out, it already has! I asked Casey to show me how he looks when he feels proud...... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SNLHFbbrFkI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/0YzyD2P5Z2o/s1600-h/DSC00472.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/caseys-awesome-day.html", "title": "\nCasey's Awesome Day!\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 14, 2008", "body": "\n My title may be a little too \"big for it's britches\" concerning the content of this entry, but it seems fitting in the smallest way. As my last entry reported we had a few   problems  at school last week, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't put a bit of a dark cloud over things.   Yesterday was a really rainy dreary day.  There wasn't much to do.  I decided to take him to our local rec center to swim at the indoor pool much to my chagrin.  I say that because weekends there are crowded with parties and people who don't come during the week, and people who come only because, as in yesterday's case, it was raining.  Yesterday was no different, the pool swarming with children.  I just hate it when it's crowded.  But he got in right away and was having a grand old time.  Suddenly a cute little kid happened by and said \"Hi Casey!\".  Casey of course didn't reply as he was wrapped up in his swimming so I did the PR and said hi and asked how the boy knew him and his name.  \"He's in my class at Riley.  I'm Raymond!\" he explained.  I rambled off something to the effect of that's great, and thanks for being a friend to him and blah blah.  The kid lost interest in me quickly and swam off.  A few seconds later a woman swam and said \"Hi, I'm Raymond's mom!  I got a call from Casey's parapro Friday complimenting Raymond on how well he did with Casey and how he included him during gym class!\".   I was dumbstruck! \"Oh, that's really great!\" I replied and went to explain how I had been so concerned about the new school and new kids etc..  \"Well,\" she replied \"I worked with developmentally disabled  (hair rises on the back of my neck)  children for over 20 years and I guess some of that rubbed off on Raymond.  He's such a wonderful boy blah blah....\".  The sound of the teacher in the Charlie Brown cartoons started coming out of her mouth, at least to my ears. Ok, I'm mean....I'll let it go.  But his mother's boasting aside, I was  really happy to hear that another kid took it upon himself to befriend Casey in some way.  I made a point of complimenting him on my own, and told him to keep up the good work! It gave me hope, and sorta clouded out my visions of \"typical\" kids pelting him with pebbles shouting racial epitaphs at him....I jest, but it's nice to know there's good kids out there!  His mom should be proud. So I suppose that's why I was steered by a higher power to take him swimming yesterday.  If I hadn't taken him, I probably would never had heard about this new \"friend\"!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SM0QobgD60I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/LcaTN2ENFSw/s1600-h/DSC02592.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/reason-for-everything.html", "title": "\nA Reason for Everything\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 12, 2008", "body": "\n All was going well this week since school has started (although I did have to call in sick for him on Monday because he had this cold/pukey thing happening, hey it happens!)  He started his regular ed time on Wednesday and it went great.   But yesterday, I got a lengthy note home from his teacher telling a sad tale.  I knew something was going on when he stepped off the bus and told me right away that he had had an \"outburst\".  After much questioning with no responses given, I rifled through his backpack and found her note.  She explained that when he went down to science, he started speaking out very loudly that he didn't like science and that it was too much reading!  When his para started to take him out of the room, he let out a curse word (we're not sure which one).  Great.  Anyway, he came back to his special ed room and calmed down.  His teacher made him go back for the last minutes of the regular class, just so he would realize that screaming was not going to get him out of going (I like her way of thinking).  I guess he was good from that point on, but had also been threatened with losing his rights to going on a little local field trip they were going on later that day. This really is a sad tale to me, not because of his behavior so much, that's not surprising.  He has a lot of trouble being good and quiet in situations that entail nothing of interest to him.  It's more that the \"typical\" kids saw him behave like that, and that just made him that much more different from them, disconnected from them.  Some of them probably even laughed when they heard him cuss.  All these thoughts really break my heart.  It breaks my heart because all this goes back to things not being done right in these school systems to begin with, which places kids in situations just set up to make them fail. We, his parents are the ones who push for him to be in regular ed part of the day.  We decided it was good for him to see how \"typical\" kids act in class, and hopefully model that.  We don't think he could hang out all day in regular ed the way it's set up right now.  At the same time I have to ask myself if  we, Bill and I , are setting him up for failure by breaking up his day as such, ripping him out of the comfort of a room with 3 other students only to be thrown in to a room full of kids talking and interacting, not with him, forcing him to try to pay attention to subject matter that probably doesn't really make much sense to him to begin with, and expect him to get something out of all this?  Are we the ones making the mistake, doing things wrong? And so having said all this, it makes it very difficult for me to punish him for his behavior.  It's almost equivalent I think to a baby crying, trying to get it's mom's attention the only way it knows how, trying to tell her that something is wrong.  Maybe Casey is acting out in an unconscious effort to do the same.  Maybe this situation isn't right for him. I guess I need to give it some time.  We'll see how it goes, but something tells me we may need to rethink our ideas about what's good for him, and try to figure moreso, what he wants to be good in!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SMqdSGvLGWI/AAAAAAAAAJc/qdQQiqx9Zn8/s1600-h/DSC00452.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/is-this-really-whats-best-for-him.html", "title": "\nIs This Really What's Best for Him?\n"},

My good friend reminisced today that she actually was on her way to the airport for a flight to New Jersey that morning!  Most people were probably on their way to work or already there.  Here in Michigan, just like in New York that day, the weather was beautiful.  A cool September morning, not a cloud in an extremely blue sky.  I was on my way to work at one of the grocery stores I called on at the time.  I had just dropped Casey off at his preschool program.  I was listening to Howard Stern when news broke of the first plane.  Odd that I would hear the news of a plane going into the World Trade Center on such a program.  I recall that they had thought it a joke at first.  Howard was confused I remember, at a loss for words and not sure what was going on.  That was when I knew something was not right, it wasn't an accident. I went into my store call, not really thinking too much about what happened, figuring I would go back out and listen to a real news station after I was done.  I had been standing and checking some of my items when I overheard someone say  \"They've hit the Pentagon!\".  My heart sank, and at that moment, I ran out to my car, thinking the Apocalypse or something had started.  I had about a 35 minute ride to my son's school, because that's where I felt I needed to go, despite being told when I called that they weren't going to release the children and felt that they were in no immediate danger.  I called my husband, I listened to the radio and kept hearing horror after horror.  The sky was so blue, and it was so sunny, and everything seemed so surreal. When I arrived at Casey's little preschool, I decided that it would be silly to go in and upset his routine.  So, I sat out in the parking lot for around 2 hours and waited for him to get out.  It felt right at the time.  I was near if something occurred, I didn't know what that something was, but I was there for him. Not to overuse \"surreal\" but that is the only way I can describe that day.  Things sorta went on as usual, we did a lot of the usual stuff, but our hearts were heavy, and I personally felt anxiety I had never had before.  Nothing seemed right. I walked Casey to the park that night, and noticed how there were no planes in the sky, how quiet it was.  Again, surreal.  We watched the news, talked, and I ached inside for what had happened to all those people, and what could happen to others in the future.   What were you doing that dreadful morning?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SMmmRhwZ7DI/AAAAAAAAAJU/Y1o23UiQJOU/s1600-h/694915831.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/what-were-you-doing-that-dreadful.html", "title": "\nWhat Were You Doing that Dreadful Morning?\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, September 6, 2008", "body": "\n The room is quiet, a church basement somewhere in Michigan, people sit in a cirlce looking embarrassed, quiet, reserved.  They know why they are there, but dread talking of it.  The leader of the group points to an almost middle-aged woman, whose chair is purposely pushed back farther from the circle, in the hopes of not being noticed.  She doesn't want to be there, but there was an intervention, her husband insisted.   \"Why don't we start with you!\"  the caring person in charge says. She begins to feel warmth flow over her face, she doesn't want to do this, but for the families sake, she takes a deep breath and begins, \"Hi, my name is Bonnie, and I'm a Betta Fishaholic...\" \"Hi Bonnie!\" the other group members reply in a show of support...... I recently wrote about the acquisition of a new  pet  pictured below, who Casey named Gilbert.   As you can see, he's a striking specimen of Betta fish.  I really enjoyed his little wiggly presence in my kitchen.  It all started out so innocently.... Someone mentioned how soothing the sound of an aquarium was so I thought perhaps I would get a little one and put Gil in it (I was calling him \"Gil\" by then) and let him live in Casey's room.  But, I didn't want to have Gil so far away, so I reasoned that Casey needed his own Betta in an aquarium, so along came Woody, so named by Casey in honor of his favorite movie character of late. He's a beautiful specimen as well and this photo which was very hard to get just doesn't do him justice.  He is gorgeous and his color reminds me of the dress Scarlett O' Hara wore when she had been caught with Ashley and Rhett made her go to Melanie's party anyway!....  Yes, you can see where the sickness is starting to take shape. So, I find myself at a local pet store buying kitty litter, when I just happen to make my way over to the fish department.  I don't know why, oh yeah, I wanted to get a plant for Gilbert (he didn't have one at the time).  I happened upon the little section where they so coldly keep the Betta's in little plastic jars in gross blue water, separated from all the other fish (sorta like special ed sometimes-whoops I didn't say that).  Lo and behold, I found this guy! An orange Betta?  I never knew such a thing existed!  \"He must be a lucky Betta!\" I thought to myself!  He could be a good friend to Gil!  Well, not really because Betta's are also known as Fighting Fish, and they don't really like, well, anyone.  But still, he's orange!  I'll take him!  And thus, Paco found his place in our home, right near Gil, but not too close.  Parallel play if you will! So, I had 3 Bettas.  No biggie.   But then I found myself going to the pet store, under the guise that I was buying my cat Simba special food that I could only get there, and instead making my way over to the fish section again the next week (and by the way, Simba isn't suffering, I already had some of the food at home). On this trip, I found this fabulous fella! He looks like a pearl, and he seemed to have some personality as you can see clearly in the photo, seriously.  So, feeling a little weird and guilty, I went up to the register with my new fishy acquisition.  Part of the fun is naming, and he sorta reminded me of this Albino musician, Edgar Winter, who we just saw perform with Ringo Starr.  So, Edgar it was. Four bettas....no biggie..... So mom was coming to visit the next week.  Wouldn't it be cute to have a fish in her room where she slept, especially after she specifically asked that there not be.  Oh, I suppose I could have put Edgar, or Paco in there.  But what fun was that?  Off to the  pet store again..... This is Freddie, so named by Bill.  I gave him this responsibility thinking it would make him like the fish more, feel more connected.  It hasn't...but isn't he cute?  All green and red and perty!  He's very active.  My mom actually liked him and found his presence calming by her bedside. Ok, after Edgar, my friends were even commenting that perhaps I had a problem.  Our friend Don came up with a rather humorous scenario that I would eventually be on the news when it's discovered that over 300 fish were found in my home.  Bill's only comment to the reporter would be \"I only thought she had 5!\". I was back at the pet shop again getting more litter (cats poop a lot) and some cat food that was really needed this time.  I told myself ENOUGH!  I wasn't going to do it but, I strolled over anyway, just to have a look, and I found this beauty! So purple, and just the cutest little fish face ever!  I chose white rocks and a white plant to put in his container to accentuate his beauty.(This should have been a sign that things were going terribly wrong)  His name is Basil.  I was feeling British that day.  He is really bright colored in person. That was a week ago, and since then.....since then, I did buy another but I haven't revealed it to Bill yet because, well, I think he will probably institutionalize me and run away with Casey, after giving all the fish away.  But he was yellow and white and blue, and he looked at me like \"Take me home!\" and I named him Javier.....I don't have a picture right now, as I am trying not to draw to much attention to the fact that I bought a seventh. I fear that by revealing my Betta obsession like this, some may stop reading, and any of my close friends who do might stop calling.  But I just enjoy them so much!  Can't I have a hobby other than Autism, and Autism blogging?  Is it so wrong to have 7 fish in separate little bowls?  They're well cared for and they don't make noise or disturb the neighbors.  They don't bite, and well, they smell a little if I don't change their water frequently!  Whatever, call me crazy Betta lady, I don't care! All I have to say is  BETTA FISH ROCK!

It was a half day so he got home around 12:15pm, all smiles off the bus.   The CF (I'm sorry, I'm gonna cuss for a minute because I am a huge potty mouth and use the term \"cluster fuck\" meaning stupid mixed up situation  ALOT  so in the future, I'll just use CF so an not to offend) of the day was the stupid bus pick up situation and forgive me if I already mentioned this somewhere else.  His pick-up time was to be 7:47am.  Why is that a CF?  Well, first, we live 2 minutes from school, and secondly, school starts at 8:35, with children needing to be there by 8:30.  So, should I go nuts trying to get him out of bed at a good time, rushing him to eat, rushing to get him dressed without pulling my hair out and letting my potty mouth run wild, or, should I just cancel the bus and take him myself?  Well, after yesterday, the first day, I did do all those things.  And guess what, I canceled today, and life was already much smoother. Anyhoot, he came home (he'll still be riding home, so many advantages there, and he likes it) and told me several things they did, which surprised me in the short amount of time that he was there.  Lo and behold, on his teacher note, she sited all the things they did and he was correct!  Pretty cool. His teacher also provided an very extensive note talking about her teaching history as well as that of the her 2 parapros that will be working in a room with  4 kids!  One is even an Occupational Therapist!  Again,  pretty cool .  She also made note that he would start to do his general ed. part of the day starting Monday, which is great considering last year, it took a month for them to start that whole procedure, which sucked. Mrs. Muwway (Murray, but Muwway is how Casey so cutely pronounces it) also mentioned many field trips that they would be going on to teach lifeskills.  That whole concept sorta bums me out in a way, because I don't want to think of him of as a kid that needs that, but he is, and I'm sure that they will teach him better than I do in everyday life.  He was very excited about this prospect, asking me this morning when they would be going on the first one.  Note to self, don't tell Casey about any event that you don't have a date for!   I'm not jumping to conclusions on this the second and first full day of school but I like the situation already.  It all remains to be seen I guess.  I'm gonna stay positive, I have to, for his sake, and my sanity!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/first-day-of-school-follow-up.html", "title": "\nFirst Day of School Follow -Up\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 5, 2008", "body": "\n First day of school photo 2008 Well, what a week it's been, and it's over almost.   As I reported  here  and  here , school started off with it's bad and good points. Yesterday, his second full day, seemed to go off without a hitch, especially since I canceled bussing in the morning, makes like so much easier. It was even reported that he ate his lunch at school!  Chicken nuggets, a hash brown and juice!  A breakthrough! Today was a little rockier apparantly.  His teacher emailed me that he ate one bite lunch today and then commenced to tell everyone how gross it was.  I had promised him that if he ate lunch, he would get a little surprise, and I guess long story short, he thought taking a bite would warrant the promised surprise.  When his teacher disagreed with him on this matter, he laid an F bomb down as naturally as one at 9 years old shouldn't.  He got a time out, what a surprise.  His teacher did call and we talked at length about the situation, deciding that I would come up ,with his help, a list of alternative words he could use instead of f%^&.  This is something we did not too many months ago, and I really thought we nipped this problem in the butt but apparantly not.  Mrs. Murray was extremely understanding and even said she felt bad for him at the instance that he did it, because he was so frustrated about the whole lunch thing.  We talked strategies concerning other matters.  It made me feel great that she cared enough to call on a Friday afternoon, the first week of school.  She rocks so far. It's funny, but I think my whole attitude has changed over the years and I am not feeling as bewildered and worried and terrified, and freaked out as I used to at the beginning of school.  I of course want him to do well most of all and I worry about that more than anything, but there's a little comfort in having done this for so many years and knowing what to expect.  I kinda figured he would cuss at school at some point, I kinda figured he wouldn't eat his lunch, I kinda figured he'd eat the erasers off his pencils like she reported to me as well over the phone tonight.  I am not surprised anymore at the \"odd\" or \"bad\" things that can and do happen.  But what I am surprised at was the report that he really wanted recess, that's a new one.  I was surprised at him talking about a kid he knew at his other school from regular ed and how he saw him at his new school, and he seemed glad about it.  I was surprised when he mentioned out of the blue that they had a \"sembly\" (that's an assembly to you and me) today.  Couldn't get out of him what it was about, but he told me he had one.  These are the things that surprise me and thrill me to no end.   Now, ask me how things are in a couple of months!!!...........\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/bbdavis6469/DSC02625-1.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/09/week-in-review.html", "title": "\nWeek in Review\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, August 30, 2008", "body": "\n School starts Wednesday, and every night at some point, I lay and do my yearly worry session until it starts.  I wonder if we've chosen the right situation for him (probably not this year), will he be safe, will he behave, will he decide to leave school and walk home and no one will know.....  The list goes on and on. Early last week we went to 5th grade orientation.  He was excited to go in.  It was for the whole school and when we got there a presentation was already in progress about the school rules, pick-up, etc..  Figuring he wouldn't sit for 2 minutes and listen, I decided to take him over by where I knew his classroom would be.  Right away he spotted his new teachers sign and ran over.  Luckily, his teacher Mrs. Murray was there that night, even though teachers were not required to be there.  She greeted Casey warmly and allowed us to come in her room and have a look around.  She was still in the process of getting things ready.  He was so excited about being in there and did several \"commercials\" about his school year starting.   I asked her how many students she would have this year and she said just 4!  I inquired as to who they were and when she told me, my heart sank a bit.  They were kiddos I knew from Casey's other school, and without trying to sound snobby or too proud, all lower functioning and way less verbal than he.  I suddenly recalled something my friend had told me Dr. Rick Solomon had said to her when she asked about her son's program and if it was good.  He said as long as your happy with what your child is getting out of it and your child is not the highest functioning child, your doing well.  Casey will be the highest functioning child in this room. We have his IEP set up so that he gets time with regular ed too.  But I still can't help but think this whole small class will not be beneficial for him.  I guess it remains to be seen.  We chose for him to be in the AI (Autistically Impaired) program, and what students are in it, are who are in it, no getting around that.  I am just regretting now not taking that point into consideration while doing the IEP and rethinking things. I guess at this point I just have to have a \"glass half full\" attitude and be glad that there are only 4, which may lend to more one on one attention.  Also, maybe Case will enjoy being the big man on campus for a change.  He is starting at a whole new school, so maybe this smaller class will lend to a little bit more \"calmness\" for the transition.  Plus his new teacher is also a speech therapist and the same lady who defended us against his general ed. teacher at the time of our IEP and she didn't even know she was our teacher yet!  So, it may turn out ok. I'm certain there will be more to follow!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SLlXXzNDDrI/AAAAAAAAAJE/mhDHLoHN_NA/s1600-h/DSC00453.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/08/school-startingyippee.html", "title": "\nSchool Starting!...yippee..........\n"},

{"date": "Friday, August 15, 2008", "body": "\nToday was Casey's last day at his first summer at day camp.  Camp A.B.L.E. is a summer day camp for kids 9 to 15 years of age with any kind of disability.  We decided this summer he needed more interaction with kids and other adults, and, secondly, we needed daycare since I started full-time with my job. Things started out good and in June, he seemed to like it.  I was a little worried as the majority of the counselors, I discovered at the open house they had prior to the start, were reeeeeally young.  They were in their very early twenties at the most.   How could self centered twenty somethings ever be responsible enough to take care of such a group?  I was a little skeptical.  Luckily one of the counselors was a middle aged woman who had been a para in the school system for years.  That had made me feel a little better. But, my worries were for not.  Other than the occasional missing towel, nothing seemed amiss and Casey seemed to want to go, and told me a little everyday afterwards about what they did.  He always seemed pretty happy to see me when I got there.  Probably because a)he never eats in such situations (ie school, camp, field trips) so he knows we'll go get him something, and b) I think sensory wise, the day is a lot for him, but in good way, like excercise is for the body. They went on a lot of great field trips and on Tuesdays and Thursdays would stay at camp usually doing theme days such as \"Birthday Day\" and \"Halloween Day\" for example.  And on those days they would travel to a nearby rec center to swim or play at the splash pad. Needless to say, Casey was always pretty tired when he got home. Today was the last day of the session, so the celebrated with a family picnic.  It was really a treat to finally get to  talk to all those young counselors.  It was difficult to do so when dropping off and picking up because they were always busy with the kids.  I learned that many of them, and not surprisingly so, are going to school for education, usually special ed, one social work, and another marketing (go figure, he gives up his whole summer for this).  They all shared little tales about Casey which was cool and asked me why he didn't eat.  I gave my usual schpeel and they seemed to understand although they had worried since he never ate what I sent.  Casey moved about the crowd, high fiving some kids, actually giving an impromptu hug to another, and just having a good old time eating pizza and having his way with the dessert table. We finally decided it was time to get going as I had a ton to do before our trip up North tomorrow.  We said our goodbyes, gave our thanks and got in the car. Before we even left the parking lot, Casey asked \"Where's my dvd?\" alluding to the dvd they made for everyone of photos from all the things they did.  I assured I had it, and then he sorta sat and had a strange expression on his face.  I asked what was wrong and he said \"I'm feeling a little bit sad about leaving Camp A.B.L.E.\". I was floored, literally floored.  Not only was he expressing his feelings, but he was doing it so very appropriately!  I asked him if he wanted to go back and say goodbye again, and before I knew it, he bolted out his door and ran towards the group.   Everyone looked curiously at us, and I explained what he wanted to do.  He ran up and gave four of the counselors hugs on his own.  Once again, I was floored.   A bit of a tear came to my eye, seeing my boy having such emotion and showing it.  Once he was done hugging them, he turned around satisfied and got back in the car.   I followed him and did a last wave to the smiling group, and felt silly that I had ever doubted these great young adults...... Back in the car, Casey announced in his best announcer voice \"Goodbye Camp A.B.L.E.!  We'll see you next year!\".  Guess Summer '09 is planned!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/08/camp-able-enables-emotion.html", "title": "\nCamp A.B.L.E. Enables Emotion\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 22, 2008", "body": "\n I have scads of stuff to write about don't feel like I have had adequate time enough to write one of my adequately written entries.  But this same subject matter came up today whilst out and about and I thought I would write a \"quickie\". We were at a popular fast food establishment today, when Casey of course announced he had to use the bathroom right as we situated ourselves at the table, food in hand.  This wouldn't be frustrating if I had a typical 9 year old boy, I'd tell him \"Go, and don't talk to strangers in there\" having a feeling of confidence that he would go in, do what males do at the urinal, do what males do after they use the urinal, and return to lunch. BUT, Casey is not a typical boy of 9, and there are many reasons that I can't let him go by himself, and especially not into a men's restroom.  I will state them now in numercial order but not necessarily in order of importance: 1.  Sometimes, he forgets to shut the door and lock it after he goes into the stall, and just starts using the toilet.  That can be disturbing to walk in on. 2.  If he were in a boy's room, and he would use a urinal, he would pull his pants down all the way, as he has yet to master the art of just letting what matters at the time hang out inconspiculously, or as inconspiculously as a guy should when he's peeing. 3.  He lingers in the bathroom, sometimes touching things he shouldn't, talking to himself, doing toilet paper commercials.  He needs prompting for sure to finish up and get out. 4.  If for some reason he has to do more than no. 1, he needs help there to, there's just no getting around it right now, so I can't imagine what would occur if he did, and not one was there. 5.  I don't even need to go into all the weirdos that could be in there. Ok, now having said all this, I have to admit that  the little bit of inconvenience it causes is really not a big problem when we're alone.  My biggest problem with having to take him into the woman's room are the glares and looks that range from shock, to horror, to irritatingly so, surprise from the broads in the bathroom.  They act as if a grown man walked in.  They act offended, put off somehow. That happened today as we were going in, and some little old gal was scooting out.  She literally huffed as we came in, despite the fact that she was done with her business in the bathroom.  What did she care? I get it ladies, I know, it's the  Ladies Room.   He's tall, he looks older, he looks like traditionally, he shouldn't be in a woman's bathroom.  But, he also displays odd behaviour as I've gone over in past posts.  He has a funny gate, he usually is holding his hands in a squeeze or by his ears, or by his junk if in fact he has to pee really bad.  Doesn't that just give some women a clue that he might be someone who needs assistance? And other than just that weird imaginary barrier that all of us have set up in our minds that boys don't go in the girls room and girls don't go in the boys room or we'll die, what is the big deal over me bringing him in?  I have yet to spot nudity out in the open in the bathroom.  I haven't had to cover his eyes as a woman comes out of a stall with pants still down or anything like that!  I haven't caught him peeking under the partitions, and if I did, it would be stopped right then and there.  He doesn't walk in on anyone, their doors are always tightly locked.   Could they be threatened while he is washing his hands and they are applying their liptsick, or fluffing their hair?  Are they afraid that he might discover some secret privy only to the girl's room that must never get out to the male population?  If so, I'm in the dark too on that one, which isn't unusual in general for me.  I'm completely at a loss of acceptance for this behavior by my fellow women.  I don't get it, and if I put myself in their place, I could honestly say that I would be much more understanding than many have been.  I wanna scream out \"He's not looking at you!!!!  He needs help going to the bathroom!  Get over yourself!\". So, other than bringing his dad along everywhere we go or adopting a big brother, I'm not sure this phenomenon will end as long as I have to take him to the john.  I guess I have to give my self a time table for when I think it will be ok for him to go into the men's room on his own.   Ok, when he is at least 5'10, 150 lbs, and able to keep his butt in his pants while using the urinal.  Whatever comes first. (Hopefully the butt thing!)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SK8Ihu7Ep8I/AAAAAAAAAIc/AvUFYVzRE-0/s1600-h/396135307.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/08/i-have-scads-of-stuff-to-write-about.html", "title": "\nWhat's the Big Deal Ladies?\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, August 7, 2008", "body": "\nIf you are one of the 5 readers of my blog, then you know that Casey is a big fan of television stations.  He even got to tour one in Indy when he visited.  Now he has his sites set on a tour of one of our local stations.  I won't go into it, but we have a connection and think it could happen, but not until September.  If I were smart, I would never have told Casey this, because he has been asking me for a set date of when we are going to the station for days now, and I can't give him one yet! Anyway, I promised him we would go down to this station which is in downtown Detroit and at least walk around.  He of course took it as going in, but I kept telling him this would be a preview for his real tour.  We made our way down easily, found a spot to park right in front and proceeded to explore the outside, and take some snapshots of him in front of the stations sign.   Suddenly, he sort of sprinted away and made his way to the front entrance, despite my cries not to, and went into the front doors.  I was sprinting too at this point and followed suit.  Inside a confused receptionist stared at us as Casey began making his way through the lobby which had an awards case, and various posters of the shows that are on that network.  He was thrilled.  As I was trying to explain to the kind lady what we were doing, we could see through the security glass the room where the weather forecasters work.  Suddenly, much to Casey's delight, the afternoon weather guy walked out and Casey shouted \"There's Eric so-in-so!\".  Luckily, I think the glass was sound proof or else I am certain security would have been called simply on the basis of the crime of yelling that had just occured.   Fearing that our \"connection\" would come out and think we were stalking him, I thanked the receptionist and swept Casey out of the building.  As you can imagine, more yelling ensued, and not the happy sort.  We got outside, and I settled him with a walk around the building. He let me know how unhappy he was about not touring the studio TODAY and he wanted to know when were we going to go in September, blah blah blah.  As we returned to the front of the building, we noted a group of college age kids sitting there.  I checked the parking meter and with 40 minutes still available, decided we could sit out in front too for a little while and talk about the studio.  Suddenly, these kids got up and started forming a line, and the \"leader\" began shouting \"Say not to foreclosure!\".  Everyone followed suit and began walking in a giant circle in front of the studio.   Casey and I had suddenly become witnesses to an out and out protest march!  It was very exciting for Casey, who saw it more as a big group of people walking around cheering rhytmically.  He was sort of \"stim\" danceing along.  I told him that this could be breaking news and maybe a reporter and camera crew would come out and talk to the people.  Sadly, this never happened.  But, one of the marchers, noting Casey's enthusiasm, asked if he would like to join the march!  I sorta felt weird about letting him do it, but before I could say no, he was up and walking, arms swinging, shouting \"Say no to foreclosure\".  He had a great time walking up and down the street with everyone.  He had no idea what the hell it was all about, and frankly, I never really found out either, but he was really enjoying himself.  \n \n \n \n \n   I figured this was a good way to let Casey learn what a protest was, especially since he got to participate.  Sort of like having all the states memorized at 2 years old, it may not help him now, but perhaps having it in his memory bank will benefit him in some civics or history class, someday!  And if nothing else, it was fun, weird fun, but fun!  I guess it made up for no tour!

{"date": "Sunday, August 10, 2008", "body": "\n We had a beautiful night at the ballpark last night.  The Tigers were playing the \"A's\" and it was \"Fiesta de Tigre's\" night, a night to celebrate all the Tiger players from Latin America.   I had heard about it on TV and thought what a great night to take Casey, considering his high interest in Spanish at this point in time.  Bill got online, got some tickets, and were good to go. It rained of course on the way, hailing even, but I had a good feeling about the night.   When we got there, a Mariachi band was playing and they handed out Venezuelan flags.  The tarp was on the field but we had high hopes that it would be pulled off soon.  Thankfully, I had purchased 3 umbrellas at the dollar store prior to going, just in case. We walked the concourse 3 times since it wasn't time for the game to start, Mom and Dad enjoying an adult beverage while Case walked in front of us, oblivious to our watchful eye, arms swinging, taking it all in.  I finally put his Ipod on him, so people might think he was walking to the music, not that I cared too much.  I had to give it to him, it was a lot of stimuli, people passing, loud music, vendors calling out to passerbys.  But he took it all in, and even seemed to enjoy it. We finally got to our seats, pizza, pretzel and nachos in tow, only to find out there was a rain delay for half an hour.  I had an inner panic attack, purely based on past experiences of bringing Case to games and his lack of patience and attention at them then.  I used to bring a huge bag with a hand-held game, books, suckers, whatever it took to make him happy, and whatever it took for us not to have to get up a million times and make others in row get up to let us by, scowling all the while.  But my panic was for not, as we were sitting pretty close to the huge score board which became an infinite realm of distraction for Casey.   There are advertisements galore on it, changing constantly, and of course photos of the players as each come up to bat, accompanied by lots of dancey music!  Usually this sort of stuff is not condoned at our house, but here, it seemed unavoidable and perfectly alright, lending itself to making every one's night enjoyable.  I think the Ipod helped a lot too (used to be mine, but somehow I like it some much more on him).  Best of all, we were at the end of the row, making the three trips to the bathroom and breaks much easier. The game ended with a fireworks display.  I couldn't help but think back years ago when we were at a similar situation and I spent the entire time in the bathroom with a terrified, screaming boy while everyone else enjoyed the fireworks.  Now he sat, holding his ears a little but mostly bouncing up and down with excitement, gazing up at the beautiful colors, me gazing at the those colors shining off his sweet face.  Life was good, living in and enjoying that moment.  How the years do change things, and sometimes for the better. And, the Tigers won!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SJ8FjFf-HvI/AAAAAAAAAH8/9T5aMljd8R8/s1600-h/DSC00439.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SJ8Fs3An14I/AAAAAAAAAIE/bRe5wZ5uDvE/s1600-h/DSC00435.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SJ8F2v79YbI/AAAAAAAAAIM/soV0Be44UNE/s1600-h/DSC00437.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/08/we-had-beautiful-night-at-ballpark-last.html", "title": "\nFiesta de Tigres!\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, August 3, 2008", "body": "\n I would like to suggest to anyone who has an Autistic boy child who is an only child, to find a friend who happens to have a number of boys of her own, and hang out. Case in point for me is my dear friend who I've known ever since our early Intervention Days with our sons at a shared preschool.  She has 3 boys, one Aspie, quite intelligent and funny, and way too clever, 1 guy a year old than Casey, about the same level as Casey although much more advanced educationally speaking(but who is comparing), and her rough and tumble youngest who is cute as a  button, and always full of fun. She invited us over yesterday to swim in her lovely pool and we had a great time.  Usually, everyone seems to be on their own as far as activities go, her eldest and youngest interacting the most, while Casey and her middle boy like to do their own thing.  I have to confess we never tend to use these times together as a social skills excercise because we're usually too busy catching up and laughing.  But yesterday was different. First of all, there were a myriad of floating devices in the pool with us, one being a childs \"Star Wars\" theme float.  There were several others that I could have used but were being dominated by various children.  Trying not to disturb the masses, I decided that this little float could somehow support my butt, but getting on it was quite a feat.  Everytime I tried, I flipped off in some manner, much to the delight of the whole crowd, including Casey, who rarely notices things like that.  My friend's youngest offered that maybe I was too big to be on that float, which just added to the humor of the whole thing.  Casey thought that was funny too.   After several failed attempts, I was simply holding on to the float once again engrossed in conversation when Casey came up and said \"Get on that float again!\".  When I asked him why he said something to the effect that he wanted me to fall off so everyone could laugh again!  I was stunned at his request and of course indulged him just because I was so happy he even asked.  Once again I fell off, and he said \"Mommy, I think you're too big for that float!\".  I was elated! Later, when we were beginning the leaving ritual (he wanted to go, having computer on his mind), my friend's youngest and oldest blocked the ladder, making Casey give them a password to get by.  He would come to me and I would whisper something to him, and he would swim back over to the \"guards\" and say it.  He was of course never right, and would come back to get another password idea.  This went on for quite some time until my friend got the password out of them and slyly passed it on.  This lasted through 3 more password sessions. It was really cool.  Casey seemed frustrated, but at the same time, he enjoyed the game of it I think.  And for me, I enjoyed it because he was simply interacting with the guys.  It all made me briefly rethink and sort of condemn our decision to only have the one child.  My friends middle boy gets this interaction all the time and for free!  But like anything else, hindsight is 20/20, and luckily I have a short attention span and this thought didn't bother me for too long.  We rode home, he listening to Spanish radio, and me basking in the glow of a socially somewhat appropriate afternoon for me AND him! PS:  the above photo in no way depicts yesterday's activities, but it was the only photo I could quickly find of Casey swimming.  The dog is pretty cute too....

{"date": "Thursday, July 31, 2008", "body": "\nThe staring is getting worse!  I have posted about this subject in the past but it has really been bothering me again lately again.  I have noticed that people are getting worse and worse about staring a Casey as he is getting taller and older. I recall Autism Vox speaking in one of her blogs about Autism ribbons, and how she really doesn't like to bring more attention to her son with such items than he already brings himself.   I somewhat agree, but at the same time, I really want to make people feel silly, and a little ashamed for staring.  One of my closest friends told me about these little cards that some people hand out when their child might be having a tantrum or some odd behavior that migt compell people to stare.  That's an ok idea but I have begun to have my own and I'd like to throw this out to the general public and see what others think.   I would like to make Casey a t-shirt (and please, let me know if this is already in production, and where I can get one, then I won't have to even question myself if someone else thought of it) that reads-\"I'M AUTISTIC..YOU CAN STOP STARING NOW!\"  I think that is straight to the point.  And if you weren't staring and read it, then you won't be offended, but I think if you were staring and you read it, you'd feel pretty dumb, but a wee bit educated at the same time. I just get really frustrated at the way grown-ups imparticular stare, as if he doesn't notice, or I don't.  It's almost as if they have a license to stare since he might look so strange sometimes.  You'd think they'd know better.  I have come to terms with children staring, and if they are in close enough proximity, I might even ask them if they know Casey.  When they say no, I usually reply something to the effect of \"Oh, well you were staring at him so much I thought you might!\".  That usually gets them to come up with some excuse or they quickly leave the scene. But I believe a t-shirt with the afore mentioned saying might just do the trick!  I agree with Kristina Chew that I don't want to bring more attention than he is already bringing, but at the same time, I want people to feel dumb and realize why he is the way he is at the same time.  Bill, my husband thinks it's obnoxious.  I disagree.  I know I should just get over it but, but, but...I can't! Any thoughts?......\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/07/t-shirt-ideagood-or-obnoxious.html", "title": "\nT-shirt Idea..Good or Obnoxious?\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 29, 2008", "body": "\nSummer day camp has been a new experience for Casey this year.  So far so good, he seems to like it and no fighting me in the morning to not go is always a good sign.    He's even begun to give me quite detailed replays of each day when he gets in the car after I pick him up.  That is extremely exciting coming from a kid who rarely conversates. After I picked him up yesterday, we hadn't event reached the car before he started on this tyrade about what his day had been like.  It was more of a short play rather than a conversation, and I was apparantly one of the characters in it, played by Casey, who was also playing himself! \"So\" he started, as me, I'm assuming, \"how was your day at Camp Able Casey?\". \"Well,\" he answered \"It was, well, it was an ok day, but it was a rough day!\" Before the real me could ask he inquired, as me \"Why was it a rough day?\". \"Well,\"  he, as himself said again \"I pushed the emergency button in the room!\".   I finally got to chime in, as myself, and asked \"What happened?\" \"Well,\"  he answered, \"it made a sound like whoo whoo whoo!\". \"Hhhhmm,\" I replied.  \"Did you get in trouble?\" \"No.\" he answered and then proceeded on as me \"Well, did you have fun today Casey?\" \"I don't want to say it was a fun day, but I do want to say it was a little bit of a fun day!  Can I say that?  It was a little bit fun, but it wasn't  really  fun.\"  he said, clearly working out a lot of wordage in his brain. Stunned by so much detail and deep thought on his part, I let him know how proud I was of him for using his words so well. \"But I'm not going to say it was a  really  fun day!  It was a little bit of a fun day!\" he repeated, seeming quite emphatic that he wanted me to understand his point! \"Ok,\" I answered \"Got it, and that's ok, everyday can't be really fun, but as long as you had some fun and no one hurt you or talked meanly to you, that's good too.\"  Boy, the conversation was rolling now! \"Can we get pizza?\" he asked as he turned up his favorite Spanish station......

{"date": "Tuesday, July 15, 2008", "body": "\nThis past weekend I went to Indiana to retrieve my child who we missed very much.   It was interesting as I was driving up to my sister's house.  I saw this boy who looked to be around 12 walking back and forth across their drive-way, and I thought that it was perhaps a neighbor boy.  As I got closer, I realized it was my own son!  He had gotten his hair cut very short and had a whole new outfit that one of the loving ladies in his life bought him.  And I think he grew another inch or two while he was away.  DUH! He was extremely happy to see me as was I him. Running up to the car,  he opened the passenger door right away,not to see me however but to see what I had brought as a surprise.  Oops, didn't know he expected one, especially since he recieved a cavalcade of new clothing, trinkets, and videos the past week, again from loving aunties and grandma.  He didn't seem too sad to see I hadn't gotten him anything and turned his attention towards me. I got lots of hugs and kisses and noticed right away he was really talking up a storm.  He had even told everyone before I got there \"Get in your places everyone, mommy is coming!\".  His Aunt Cheryl, the occupational therapist I have mentioned in  past posts, pretty much kept him off the computer and internet the entire week.  She kept him extremely busy and it showed.   At home it's been really hard, he is loooooooves the computer.  And he loooooves the internet particularly.  I have to confess that I do let him play a lot on it even though I know it's not good.  It's just hard to keep him busy when we're home with no friends in the 'hood, and having to take care of the house and things.  Yes, he could do other things one would probably tell me.  Yes, I know.  And I also know it's affecting his attention and focus, and making his brain into poop basically. Staying with this Aunt was really a rehab of sorts, almost like getting an addict away from drugs for awhile.  The computer being his drug of choice just wasn't an option as my sister planned for the week to be busy with him.  She knew she wouldn't have much time to clean, she's off the for the summer.  It was the perfect set-up for her to get him away.  Wish I had the same...  Excuses aside, I really wanted to keep it up. So, since being home, back to his \"routine\" he's been a little troubled and depressed that I haven't allowed him on the computer.  I just don't want to screw up the good work that his Aunt has done.  He seems so much more \"on\", with a little less self-talking which is always good.   Much of our conversation at the pool last night was how he wanted to play, and how I didn't want him to for various reasons, and his arguing my points.  I finally came up with a funny game that involved his saying \"Charmin\" and my tickling him and the computer was forgotten (for anyone who doesn't know, he is infatuated with Charmin TP right now, I'm sure you understand).  Guess you had to be there. I am hoping I can carry through with this ban on computer.  It's hard when he tells me before anything  we do that if he does whatever well he can have computer time!  It takes a lot for him to put those thoughts together, only to be shot down, but it must be done.  I am hoping at some point I can let him play educational games once in awhile, but he can even find a way to perseverate on those it seems, as I've witnessed in the past. It's nice to have the craziness back though, not wasting my anxiety on nothing like I did last week!  Hopefully, life without computer will continue and get more bearable.  Now if I could just get him off the tv.....Aunt Cheryl!!!!!!!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/07/casey-is-back-in-town.html", "title": "\nCasey is Back in Town\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 11, 2008", "body": "\nThe week has come and just about gone.  Tomorrow I will be traveling back to Indy to get my boy and bring him back into my loving care.  It's been a peaceful, but weird week.   I have to say for lack of a better word, I felt \"disconbobulated\".  I'm spelling that phonetically of course and don't plan on using the spell check to change it, just so you get how I felt this week when you read it.   It is really strange going from being on guard 24/7, wondering what one is doing at all times when not in view, from not having anyone to worry about except the cats, fish, and a hubby who blissfully expects little most of the time.   Going to grocery was odd too, I am usually hurrying, trying to get dinner stuff and various snacks in time to pick him up.  It was sorta nice going and shopping without having to hurry.  I enjoyed that.  I considered it a treat for the week. Other \"treats\" of being childless included a lot of unscheduled, unpressured time that I got to do anything I wanted.  I think that was what made me feel most \"disconbobulated\" because I am a terrible time manager.  When Casey is around, we know what we are doing and when for the most part.  Without him, I had planned on painting his room (in the style of Andy's room from \"Toy Story\" as promised before he left).  Did I?  Of course not, because it would entail a great amount of organizing of time that I suddenly had, and I didn't organize!   Instead, I did laundry (not fun but much needed), I worked out (which was really fun when I don't feel like it's taking time away from Casey especially), I watched tv more, which, is such a huge waste of time and something I don't do much of when he's around.  But that was sort of a treat.  I even sat last night and don't ask me why, but watched the whole movie of \"Hell Boy\".  There's a \"Hell Boy 2\" coming out, so now I'm all set....sigh........ I think the biggest treat from being childless this week was quality time spent with the hubby.  Not to sound corny, but it is really sad how much of that time disappears when you have a child.  Dates are almost non existant for us due to lack of babysitters.  We never really feel deprived though, it's just life.  But this week made me stop and think of how nice it is to be alone with Bill, and just enjoy a tv show without having to get up and do a bath, get the boy ready for bed.  We sat on our deck the other night and ate Chinese and shared a forgotten bottle of champagne I had in the frig.  We enjoyed the beautiful night while listening to the 60's on 6 on the XM, discussing the music, the weather, our yard that we are proud of.  It was nice having a chance to do this with no little interruptions.  We fully appreciated it.   Tonight we get to go to Caesars Palace in Windsor Ontario to see RIngo Starr and his band!  We are going with our dear, dear friends and it should be a total blast, especially since we don't have to pay for a babysitter, or worry about what time we have to be home.  Our last \"hoorah\" if you will! But, I think we're both ready for our little guy to come back.  I've had enough \"me\" time for awhile.  While I like to think I add structure to his life, I've learned that he adds structure to our's as well. He also adds fun, sweetness, chaos, and silliness!  We are ready to have all that back!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp2.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHdWQx069qI/AAAAAAAAAGg/zzRSw2FHSBc/s1600-h/thumb.60d7ffec65fe46378003c10ca0a1e380.film_review_hellboy_ii__the_golden_army_nyet162.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHdZlhHVdEI/AAAAAAAAAGo/DjqLwlRacto/s1600-h/m_672a2447feb5d3346011c428bbdbf60b.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHdZ4XCUJpI/AAAAAAAAAGw/-n51XZ-rreA/s1600-h/1275760978_m.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/07/reflections-on-childless-week.html", "title": "\nReflections on a Childless Week\n"},
{"date": "Monday, July 7, 2008", "body": "\nMay I preface this entry by saying that I had started it days ago, but hadn't finished it yet till today because I HAVE TIME! (See Separation Anxiety entry).  This not by any means the foremost thing on my mind.... Recently, I purchased a betta fish.  Here he is pictured here, not well I'm afraid (I can't download my photos from my digital camera at this time so all the photos I use are from my phone camera!) and this photo just doesn't do him justice.   Initially, I got him because I had been wanting to  make a betta fish planter,    similar to this.  Others I know have done so, and it always looked cool, and it was explained to me that the fish could live off the roots of the plant that hung in the water in which it lived!  A twofer, a fish aquarium and planter in one! So, long story long, I got the fish, got the container, fish food, water purifier, a plant.  I wasn't certain on the whole construction and began researching online as to the proper procedure for creating my spectacular betta fish planter!   But amidst the websites that popped up on making one, others popped up.  Disturbing sites talking of the inhumaneness of betta planters!  Inhumaness?  It's a fish in a thing of water!? Come to find out, the fish eat the roots because people don't feed the fish in these planters the proper betta fish diet of dried up blood worms and shrimp or something like that.  They're forced to eat the roots, which aren't good for them!  Then, one activist threw out \"Would you buy a cat or dog and keep them in a cage not much bigger than themselves to stay in permanently?\".  I guess this alluded to the small vase that one would use to make a fabulous betta fish planter.\" So, being the former vegetarian and avid animal lover that I am, I threw the idea of the betta fish planter to the wayside.  I put the fish, who had been named Gilbert by Casey, in the vase that I had bought for this whole dibacle, sans plant which would have most certainly cemented the fishie torture chamber that those activists so disdainfully advised against!  My bamboo stick did make it's way in eventually, but only because it only took up a little room, and it seemed like it made his new home seem more, natural I guess. After this I became concerned with my fishes accomodations, and whether he did in fact have enough room, leading me to make a trip to IKEA to find an inexpensive, larger, glass container that he could call home.  Returning with the same sort of jar I  use for cookies, I placed rocks and a cool plastic plant in the bottom, poured some water in, dumped Gilbert in, much to his chagrin and placed him amongst the plants I would like to think he sees from inside the jar, I mean bowl, and thusly, feels like he is in his rice patty home.  Yes, I do believe I am nuts.... To further support this, I find myself standing for a few minutes at a time (which any busy mom knows is complete time wasting) watching him swim around, and finding great joy in dropping a food pellet in and seeing him gulp it down.  I excercise him by placing a mirror next to his jar, bowl, so he thinks that another fish is in there, and he swims around with his little face flaps outstretched, like he's ready to kick some fish butt.  I find great entertainment in that.  Yes, I am a geek. Bill says he has no interest in Gilbert which I find very sad and I hope to somehow, spark a new found love for my betta in him like he's never known before.  I doubt it will happen though. In the grand scheme of all this, I have to ask myself why I like this fish so much, why I find him so interesting, why I almost tried to find a fish sitter this past weekend when we went away.  I believe that his simplicity and beauty in some ways makes me forgot about the stress and busyness of everyday living.  He doesn't make a sound, as everyother creature in my life does, and loudly.  He is easy to take care of, unlike the other creatures that I take care of.  And he asks for very little, quite the opposite of, again, those other creatures in my life.   I figure if I can find peaceful moments throughout the day in something as simple as my little betta fish, then I don't need much.  And that has to be a good thing...... Those other creatures........... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SGwrz6GCMKI/AAAAAAAAAEw/oa_2cObXtzg/s1600-h/DSC00405.JPG", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SGwthrsIB4I/AAAAAAAAAFQ/e-lo6QI4g4I/s1600-h/3399276288.jpeg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SGwsQOnqfZI/AAAAAAAAAFI/e8C1kFLTZrA/s1600-h/DSC00407.JPG", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SGwsJzsROeI/AAAAAAAAAFA/JzIvI4o_un8/s1600-h/DSC00011.JPG", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SGwr8E7JLPI/AAAAAAAAAE4/PMdSi37Opr8/s1600-h/DSC00399.JPG", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHJ8MueYFnI/AAAAAAAAAFg/IdxUpb5pw-M/s1600-h/DSC00136.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/07/joy-in-smallest-things.html", "title": "\nJoy in the Smallest Things\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 8, 2008", "body": "\n This woman to the left is my new excercise hero.  Her name is Chalene Johnson and she is the creator of Turbo Jam which has quickly become my favorite workout of all time.  And in the spirt of the \"me time\" I'm supposed to be enjoying since my boy is out of town for the week, I thought I would blog a little about my new found excercise infatuation! I am by no means an athlete, but over the years I've always really enjoyed working out, especially to home workout videos.   It all started with the Reebok Step in the early 90's (my hubby still does this one occasionally when he doesn't want to go to the gym, so it must stand the test of time!).  I did that one amongst some forgotten others for several years.   Then came marriage, and then came baby, and then came a local rec center that was buil by our homes with a wonderful gym.  We joined that and I utilized those facilities for a long time during my Weight Watchers stint where I lost 46lbs.  (I summarily have put some of that back on, but I'm working on it).  But the gym became boring, repetative. Thanks to the world of infomercials I came upon another weight loss system called The Firm that came with this giant step, and 4 workout videos.  It really kicked my butt, and unfortunately my knees as well, making it not very enjoyable to do after awhile, despite giving me great results. And so, I languished, and gained back weight.  I was totally unmotivated.  During this downtime, my oldest sis kept touting this new workout her daughter loaned her called Turbo Jam.  I believe I had seen the informercial, but was not as beguiled by it as The Firm, feeling it was too young, too difficult. My sis Cheryl kept going on and on about it, saying how fun yet tough it was, that you could really feel it in your abs, etc..  Yeah yeah, me and my next sis up Sue were always the ones discovering new and exciting excercise videos, we didn't need big sis chimin' in!  But of course our interest was peaked and Sue ordered the whole set.  She called from Indy the first time she tried them and said she couldn't believe how fun the first one she did was, and how challenging.  She promised she would make copies for me and send them, she felt so strongly about it! And so she did.  Now let's get something straight here, I am completely uncoordinated.  I can't dance to save my life.  And I gotta say, the first couple of times I tried Turbo Jam lead by that very enthusiastic woman at the top of the page, I got mad, and frustrated.  I believe I even called Sue and said \"Yeah, I don't think I'll be doing that anymore, thanks for sending them though.\".  Oddly though, something made me come back to it and try again.  And each time it got a little easier.  Turbo Jam is sort of a mix of hip hop dance and kick boxing.  Of course kick boxing involves well, yes, various kicks, and lots of punches.  Chalene also integrates some form of South American martial arts that I won't even begin to try to spell, but is interesting and fun as well.  The music they play is way dancey and fun and fast and really gets my energy up.  I am just happy and sweaty and in pain after I'm done.  I love her enthusiasm as she leads the class as well as the other people behind her doing it (who you get to meet in one of the extras on the dvd, kinda fun).   I think the best part of it is the moves are aggressive, especially the punching, and I like to pretend I am punching out what ever irritated me that day, a great stress reliever. I am in no way associated with this excercise program other than that I do it, and I'm not trying to sell it.  It's just one of those things that you find that you get excited about, and want the whole world to get hooked on too!  So there ya go, my newest excercise obsession. Casey Update: He is having a marvelous time with his Aunts and spent the day today at the Indianapolis Children's museum (awesome if you ever get a chance to go with your kiddie).  At this time, he is swimming, and his tired Aunt is hoping she can wear him down so he'll soon drift off!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHP4F2EUU4I/AAAAAAAAAFo/cUaxUSToM6g/s1600-h/tj2-mr_homepage_chalene.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHP5qJfGf6I/AAAAAAAAAFw/K3IOok6U2T8/s1600-h/tj2-mr_homepage_grouppic.jpg", "http://bp2.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHP8Ov7XPZI/AAAAAAAAAF4/ykrLFh4KGo0/s1600-h/tj2-mr_homepage_tjlogo.png"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/07/something-for-me.html", "title": "\nSomething for Me!\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 6, 2008", "body": "\n Well, our little boy is spending a week in Indiana with his surrogate mothers, Aunt Sue and Aunt Cheryl.  We live in Michigan but I'm originally from Indiana, and my family all lives there.  My sister has often said she would like to keep Casey for a week some summer.   Since he's 9 now and I have to work full-time, it seemed the perfect opportunity to take her up on her offer.  After much planning and discussion, Bill and I took advantage of the 4th of July weekend to spend some time with family, get away, and drop the boy off for his week with the loving Aunties. I tried to prepare him a bit, trying to explain to him about how we would be leaving Sunday to go back to Michigan, but he would be staying with his Aunt Sue.  I asked him several times if he would miss me, not really sure if he understood what missing someone means, and telling him that I would miss him a lot.  I was sorta dredding the whole thing despite the fact that I would have a week of time to get my work done and a lot of other things, and having \"time to myself\" as everyone kept telling me, while he was safe and having fun basking in the attention of several mothering type relatives. I never really feel put out by Casey.  I never really think about having time to myself.  I enjoy him so much, I enjoy taking care of him, I enjoy being there for him and his needs.  The whole concept of having \"time to myself\" seems almost selfish.   So, we began packing up our stuff this afternoon, a bit of a dark cloud hanging over my head, not looking forward to our goodbye.  Aunt Sue made him a schedule of things they were going to do after we left which he was quite satisfied with, and started his  Wii game time before we left.  I had to force him to come and see us off, giving him a big hug and kiss, Bill doing the same.   My last site of him was standing on the step behind Sue, arms draped around her neck, and Sue bragging on how she was going to get the loving now that I was out of the picture!  I felt better...clearly he was secure in our leaving and his being with Aunt Sue, but clearly, he wasn't overly upset at our leaving.   He did shout  as we were walking out the door \"Bye, see you next Saturday\" which is exactly what I told him would happen.  Knowledge is power for Casey, and it makes him feel secure, just like the schedules.  I guess when you know what's going to happen, there's no need for dramatics, at least in his world. As for me, it was strange and surreal not having him in the car with us on the way back.  I was able to read and nap which I don't usually do, and sit in the front, which I never do on trips.  When we got home, it was really sad going by his little room and not seeing him in there.  Dad has mentioned twice how very weird it is not having him here.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 9, 2008", "body": "\nWell, Casey's ultimate dream came true today, without his mother present unfortunately!  Case has been wanting to visit a television news studio for over a year now and today he finally got to do it.   I had been trying for awhile contacting our local stations, telling them about him and getting the same reply.  It was always something to the effect of you had to schedule a tour with a group.  They would never just let a little guy come for half an hour on his own.  We went so far last summer as to drive to the various stations, hoping if nothing else we could get in the lobby of the building and maybe put in a good word with the receptionist while Casey could look at in awe the logo for the station that would more than likely be on the wall!  But when we got to the the stations, they were set up like a fortress, high fencing around the buildings with a guard station that I didn't even attempt to try to get through, despite Casey's demands to do so.   So, my big sister who he is visiting promised him awhile back that if he stayed, she would set up a tour with one of the Indiana stations.  She had started early emailing various stations and anchors and even went so far as to call them and leave messages.  But she never got any replies. Yesterday, she and Casey spent the day at the Children's Museum as mentioned in my previous post.  It's centrally located in the Indianapolis downtown area, so she took advantage of their location and went to a couple of the local stations that were nearby, just so he could see them. Clearly, the stations in Indy aren't nearly as difficult as the ones here in the Detroit area to access, as is evident by this photo.  They visited the local NBC, ABC, and CBS affiliate, where they actually went into the lobby with no issue.  My sister talked to the receptionist about a tour, but was pretty much told the same thing I was, you had to have a group.  Casey was thrilled to get some sort of business card from there pertaining to the station. He was sad that the tour hadn't taken place at any of the stations but still aglow from getting his picture taken in front of the sign and getting the business card. Miraculously, my sister Cheryl recieved a call this morning from a guy at the CBS station who said he had recieved her email and wanted to let her know that he had some free time this morning to let them have a private tour!  He asked if she was available and trying not to fall over, she said yes, whenever!  So, they made their way back down to the CBS station for the big tour! Casey was beside himself from all reports.  They got a special badge to wear and he got to sign in, which was pretty cool.  He got to see the actual newsroom and meet one of the afternoon anchors.  Then he got to see the studio itself!  The tour guide let him stand in front of the green screen where they put the weather maps up.  He even got to meet the weatherman and watch him taping a forecast for a local radio station!   Best of all, Casey got to actually sit at the news desk itself!  He even got to read some news script from the teleprompter!  My sister said he did really well!  Perhaps his future career? It was totally awesome and my sis said she was really proud of how good he was.  He was of course giddy and over the moon with the excitement of it all, but contained himself and really enjoyed the tour!  I am so glad he got to finally go, even though I wasn't there to see him get to do it (makes me want to try that much more to get a tour here!).   My sis is so wonderful and really went out of her way to make his wish come true.  I am lucky to have her and my other wonderful sisters who love him so much.  She was so pleased with it all, she had fulfilled her promise despite lots of obstacles.. and in the car, still giddy with excitement, he said \"And tomorrow we'll tour ABC!\"......you go sista!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHVvIAHWnPI/AAAAAAAAAGI/FH4s5RdTLZU/s1600-h/0708081327-00.jpg", "http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHVwAL9hyCI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/XAh8bjgKQEU/s1600-h/0708081631-00.jpg", "http://bp3.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SHVyB42pCLI/AAAAAAAAAGY/L0DCrmifNiY/s1600-h/0709081043-01.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/07/missing-his-mommynot.html", "title": "\nSweet Dreams are made of....the Local News!\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 28, 2008", "body": "\nWell, it was Spree time in dear old Livonia, MI this past week and weekend.  The Spree is always highly anticipated by Bill and I, we've had a lot of fun there over the years.  He being a Livonia native, grew up with the Spree, so it brings out his little boy side a bit.  The Spree is a large festival basically that celebrates the city of Livonia's birthday every year.  They have a midway full of rides for the young, and young at heart.  Games and food of course are part of it too.  Casey has a great time every year as well.  He especially enjoys the musical acts they have on the \"main\" stage at night.  Mom and Dad can sit back with a cold beverage while Casey dances. The dancing usually looks something like this (note:  Casey is the white shirted fellow who walks \"rhythmically, and then suddenly boogies)     \n \n \n \n \n   He has no fear about getting out there in front a great deal of people and tripping the light fantastic.  Most of his moves haven't changed for a long time. It's great excercise for him, and he comes back often to refresh himself.  This year, something hit me during our time at the Spree.  Our little boy is still a little boy in so many ways, but it seems his physicality is beginning to draw so much more attention to his Autism. Casey is tall for his age, about 5ft, 100 plus lbs.  His gait is unusual, always has been but seems to be more pronounced since he's hit the 5ft mark.  He still stims as he walks, arms bent, stretched in front of him, moving to some internal beat.  He claps a  lot still, usually out of excitement over something he sees or is thinking about.  He still holds his ears, sometimes to block out sounds he doesn't care for, but mostly so he can hear himself talk, which is something he does, alot, to himself. He's done all these things for years, but I notice people staring a lot more now, which is something I wrote a whole blog entry about.  But I can't say that I blame them, they're probably wondering why this big kid is doing what he is doing.  And his dancing in front of the people is becoming something I've considered stopping in the years ahead.  I really don't want people wondering why this giant kid is up there (who knows how old they think he is ) dancing like he is, holding his ears.  Worse yet, are they looking at him going \"Oh, he must be mentally challenged, God bless him!\".  Doubt it.   The \"screw you\" side of me says who cares, he's not hurting anyone, and he clearly doesn't care what people think (ah, what a freedom he's blessed with).  On the other hand I want people to not think of him as \"challenged\" or \"disabled\" either, or simply \"weird\". Maybe, short of putting him in a straight jacket when we go out, and roping him to a chair if there is any music to be danced to, I should just throw caution to the wind, let people have their thoughts, and as long as Casey isn't hurting anyone, and no one is hurting him that we know of, enjoy the show.  As for the walking, well geeze, who knows!  Guys gotta walk right?  Maybe Bill and I will take on his style!  There's power in numbers. Now for all the rides that say they are only for kids that are 54 inches, well, that's another story!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["rtsp://v7.cache8.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQll-3sWJKmqHxMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SGcAx0gpG6I/AAAAAAAAAEA/p62QP4M-psQ/s1600-h/DSC00391.JPG", "http://bp1.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SGcA3Y4HbmI/AAAAAAAAAEI/yxlbpxqT2GI/s1600-h/DSC00392.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/06/free-to-be-me-at-spree.html", "title": "\nFree to be Me, at the Spree\n"},

I picked up a red cheeked and clearly tired boy, overwhelmed I'm sure, cognitiviely and physically from all the newness of the people, the space, the activities, the routine change.   When we got home that afternoon, he couldn't even finish his dinner, so tired was he, and retired to the quiet of his room and proceeded to take a 3 hour nap.  Completely out of the norm for Casey.  It even knocked me for a loop, I almost didn't know what to do with myself (although I used the time no problem! :0)  ) The next day, we arrived again at the little historical one room schoolhouse his camp is stationed in.  He bounded into the room, doing his regular circling of the permiter of the room.  I jokingly asked one of the counselors \"What did you do to that kid?  He died when he got home last night.  He slept for 3 hours!\".  She laughed and said she did the same. Later that afternoon, I once again picked him up.  Settled in the car, he began to beg for me to get him some fast food.  Teasingly, I said \"I don't know, you couldn't even stay up long enough last night to eat!\".  He thought for a minute and then responded \"But I didn't die last night!  I want fast food!\".  It took me about 20 seconds to get over my shock of the comment and recall  the use of the metaphor I used that morning pertaining to his exhaustion.  I hadn't a clue he had heard me, and really taken aback at his apparant misunderstanding of it.  I felt bad and explained as best I could what a metaphor was.  I remember someone mentioning that metaphorical speaking is very difficult for naturally literal Autistics to wrap their brains around (there I go again).  He seemed to understand after I gave him some examples. I guess despite my explanations, I need to need to me more careful about my terminology that I use with him, or anyone he's within earshot of hearing me talk to! .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SGVXMlz_4LI/AAAAAAAAADo/ruNRylm-92g/s1600-h/DSC00368.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/06/metaphorically-speaking.html", "title": "\nMetaphorically Speaking\n"},

Every time I attempt to get him to read, he says that it's for school and he doesn't have to.  So much for the summer reading program at the library. Last night I was cleaning up, listening to his television playing \"Toy Story\" Extras for the 800th time when an idea hit me.  I wondered if the script from \"Toy Story\" would interest him.  Thank God for the internet, for lo and behold, a search directed me to the full on script.  Ninety pages later and and an ink cartridge and a half, we had a copy.  I hole punched it, placed it in a binder, printed out a \"Toy Story\" picture to put on the front and the rest was magic.  I handed it to him and explained what it was.  When he opened it and started reading, he couldn't stop.  He placed it carefully on the floor under a light and began reading outloud each page, giving the correct intonation to each characters line the he's heard in the movie.  I set up all his characters in front of him so he could \"read\" to them.   He continued in this manner, taking breaks to recite some  \"Toy Story\" creation background, for over an hour, and I finally had to make him take a shower and go to bed, promising he could return to the script tomorrow.  He slept well after that, his brain probably being exhausted from all the reading/acting.   Case woke this morning asking for the computer, but when reminded about his script, returned to his bed, cozied in and started reading.

It was bittersweet.  Yet again he is moving to another school, another situation.  It should be interesting next year, I was happy to hear that his new teacher is a very experienced speech therapist, that can't be all bad. Other things are happening that are kinda interesting that I can't talk about because I am not sure who reads this and unfortunately, I really don't want to reveal certain aspects of the excitement.  So if you really wanna know, contact me privately.  It's Casey related by the way. We've been trying to work and get in time with Case and all that that entails for the past few weeks until he goes to camp which starts next week.  It's a day camp for kids with all sorts of disabilities and I think he's going to have fun.  I debated whether it was a good thing for him to be at such a camp but honestly, I don't know how much he would get out of a typie camp and it seems the program is centered around kids like him.  Just fun, not too complex, not too sporty, lots of field trips.  So, hoping that goes well and I can get rid of some of my guilty about him not being with any kids this summer so far. He might got for a week in July to stay with the Indy Aunties.  I am  a little nervous about being at home without him for a full week, but I think if I keep busy, the time should fly, and I know he'll have fun.  His one aunt is an OT!  Free camp!

{"date": "Sunday, June 8, 2008", "body": "\n We ventured out today to see the latest installment in what I feel is a very mediocre line of children's feature films as of late.  In fact, I feel everything since Nemo has been s&*#, but that's just my adult opinion.  So, we saw \"Kung Fu Panda\" starring Jack Black.  Casey showed mild interest in seeing so it was a must, even with mild interest. And is most of our experiences at the cinema lately, he talked too loud to himself during boring parts, and asked to go to the bathroom twice in the first 40 minutes. Oh, and then there was the M&M debacle where I forgot to smuggle in a  second bag I bought prior to arriving at the theater along with the first that he finished in the first 5 minutes.  He was not happy that I had forgotten it in the car, and made it known, quite loudly.... As the film progressed, I found myself being mildly entertained, and quite impressed by the animation, they've come so far with it.  What really struck me though was the storyline itself, which was predictable, but interesting in a certain way.   SPOILER ALERT!!!!  Don't read on if you are 10 years old or you really don't want to know what happens in the movie. Basic premise, a big fat panda loves kung fu, in a twist of fate, becomes the chosen  one to become the Dragon Master, or something like that (my details are so sketchy that this might not even be considered a \"spoiler\"), and has to study under a master who has trained the elite 5 kung fu characters.  The panda is a cute slob who loves food, and  is sorta lazy and not at all experienced in Kung Fu.  He is looked down upon by the Kung Fu experts and his master, but the master must train him.  The master can't figure how to teach him, until he realizes that he must use the panda's high interest to train him, and he uses food, since he likes to eat a lot.  And lo and behold,by  integrating food into the pandas training he becomes a kung fu expert and of course fulfills his destiny and saves the day and blah blah blah..... So, in other words, using a person's or in this case panda's high interest, one can be successfully taught a skill!   Gee, wish Casey's regular ed teacher who gave us a lousy report about how he just didn't seem to want to particpate with the class and said she wasn't sure he even got what she was teaching went to see \"Kung Fu Panda\".

{"date": "Monday, June 2, 2008", "body": "\n One of the big \"symptoms\" of Autism is lack of eye contact.  I've heard this one since Case was a tiny Autistic being.  It drives my hubby crazy when his son won't look him in the eye (I think Case knows that).  I personally can relate to not giving eye contact although I don't believe I'm on the spectrum (if you know me and think otherwise, leave me a comment).  I almost get hypnotized when having a conversation with someone while trying to stare them directly in the eye simply so they think I'm listening.  I often feel that if I could just look down or away, I would get so much more out of what is being said, but this is socially unacceptable. I have to wonder if lack of eye contact is really bad, if one isn't looking at it from social perspective.  And, I have to wonder if people with Autism are better listeners on some level because they don't make eye contact.   Oddly, I have really never had an eye contact issue with Casey.  Tonight was a great example of this.  We were at the pool, and usually he is in his own little world moving through the water, self-talking, and just loving the aquatic life.  Fortunately for me, it seems he is much easier to engage in the pool, perhaps because of the movement, his relaxation level, who knows.  Tonight, he took it upon himself to engage me.   For some reason, he suddenly wanted me to go under the water.  Usually, we are at the pool at the end of the day, and I still have my makeup on so I don't want racoon eyes, and I don't want my hair all wet and goofy.  So, I never go under, and usually he doesn't mind, but tonight, he was quite certain this was something I had to do.   We moved about the pool, debating on why I should and shouldn't go under, he saying \"It will change your life!\" (who knows where he got that one), and me saying \"No, I don't want to look gross!\".  All the while, he stared directly into my eyes, so much so that it was almost uncomfortable, I wasn't used to it.  But I suppose he felt so strongly about what he wanted, that in his mind, eye contact lent to the seriousness of his request.  It was bizarre and awesome at the same time, almost like having a wild animal that would never come near a human take a piece of food out of your hand.  I felt sorta privaleged to get so much eye contact, I savored it, and I tried to stretch out getting it as long as possible.  Finally, I returned the gift with allowing him to \"dunk\" me.  Mission accomplished, he was happy.   I was happy too, because I have to start believing lack of eye contact isn't a symptom of Autism, but the choice of an Autistic person.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SESqWox5BBI/AAAAAAAAACQ/pvY89LLDoJ4/s1600-h/DSC00360.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/06/is-eye-contact-really-painful-just.html", "title": "\nIs Eye Contact Really Painful or Just an Unexpected Treat?\n"},

I don't often but today was that way for me, so I'm allowing one entry specifically about myself! The day started early in preparation for my working with a muckity muck from my company who I was supposed to meet up with.  It was a gorgeous sunny day by the way.  After getting Case on the bus, I quickly drove off, knowing I would be late meeting the guy.  I was dredding the \"work with\" a bit.  I call on gas stations and small drug stores as part of my job, and I work alone, so when you have someone \"tagging\" along as it were, watching your every move, it can be a bit exhausting on so many levels.  It's stressful as well, wondering if the person might go back to your boss and tell them they weren't happy with this or that.  Anyhoot, my cell rang and it was this person.  I quickly answered \"Hi, I'm sorry, I'm almost there!\"  Traffic was horrendous, of course.  \"Hey, don't rush, I'm not there,\" he replied  \"something came up and I'm going to have to cancel!\".  Feigning disappointment, I wished him a good day and said I looked forward to working with him in the future.  The sun got a little brighter! Soon, I was rolling with my work, getting a lot done in each account and was given a granola bar that I tried to purchase by one of my store owners, and later, offered a free bottle of whatever (damn, no booze though) for doing so much for another.  Gee, that just saved me a couple of bucks! As the afternoon progressed, one of my best girlfriends called, and the conversation turned to her birthday, which had eluded me for some reason.  After much discussion concerning what wasn't going on for her birthday, I decided it would be fun to have her and her family over to celebrate at our home, with the bonus of having the Stanley Cup Playoff game on that very Saturday night for the boys to watch!  Yay, plans for the weekend and we don't even have to leave home! Later, I called on one of my bigger accounts, ok, I'll say it, Walmart.  Feeling like my free and much appreciated granola bar wasn't holding me over any longer, I cruised over to the Subway in the store for a quick lunch.  Low and behold, who was there to ring me up but a guy who used to work in one of my other accounts and now managed the Subway!  He greeted me and said \"Don't worry about!\"  as I handed him my credit card (what's cash?).  Declining politely, he insisted, I accepted, and off I went with my happy free little lunch! A huge store next door full of all kinds of gardening junk, furniture, home goods and what not was my next destination, strictly for pleasure.  I had nothing big in mind to purchase but it's one of those stores you just have to go into if you're near it.  After walking it's labyrinthlike aisles, I came upon tiki torches which we needed for  summer festivities in our backyard.  And guess what!?  They were buy one, get one 50% OFF!  And were only 2.99 to start with!  Could it get much better?  Yes because then I found part of a gift for my aforementioned friends' birthday, and she is not easy to buy for!  Yet, another couple of lucky breaks. I better not jinx myself wondering what else good could happen today, but ya never know.

So now, he's finally at the breakfast bar, breakfast in front of him, legs bent on barstool, gazing at Good Morning America.  \"Case, take your probiotic and eat.\"  I instruct.  2 minutes later \"Bathroom!\".  Off he goes, goes, then I see him head back into his room.  \"Case come back and eat your breakfast!\".  Here he comes again, back in position.  He finally swallows the tiny probiotic, and takes a bit of bacon, becoming entranced in the tv.  \"Eat please\".  It's now 7:50, the bus comes at 8:20, that leaves us one half hour to finish eating, dress, hygiene, and whatever else we forgot.  \"Casey, eat!\".  This is said at least 5 times a morning, all the while, finding myself poking bites into his mouth.  He's 9 years old!  Ugh. Breakfast is finally done and the chase begins to keep him from laying back in bed to watch tv.  He literally lays down like it's Saturday and is ready to settle in for a lazy morn.   \"Come on Case, the bus is coming, let's get dressed.\"  Bill gets frustrated with me that I don't let him dress himself in the morning but oh my, thats another whole blog entry, and I choose to pick my battles when they fit my schedule!  I finally get him out of bed after much prodding, and help him dress, making him at least put his  own socks on.  Good for me, good for him. Two to three times I urge him to come to the bathroom to brush hair and teeth.  Finally loping in, I help him brush.  He's almost 10 but  heightwise we are just about face to face, making it awkward to help him brush, reminding me that I really need to work to make that an independent activity and soon.  I wet and mousse the crazy mass of hair that he didn't get from my genes.  He needs a haircut... Finally, we plop down on the couch, 5 minutes till the bus.   We did it again, we got through it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SD1cPIx5A_I/AAAAAAAAACA/_T_DT6zM8AY/s1600-h/Casey+Sleeping.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/05/morning-rituals.html", "title": "\nMorning Rituals\n"},

Much of the report focused on kids and parents commenting on \"how could this happen\", \"where were the hall monitors?\"...as they wrapped up the report, the reporter covering closed by saying something to the effect of \"it should be known that the 2 students involved are in some special education classes.  Mike Whoever, Local 7 News.\" Hhhhmmmm, I thought, did he just say what I think he did?  Did he just say that the students were involved in special education classes?  What the hell?  What could that possibly have to do with the matter at hand, one student raped another student!  That reporter would never say \"and it should be known that the 2 students involved were African American.\" or \"Hindu\" or Puerto Rican.  I just couldn't imagine what his point was in saying this! I mean, are we supposed to surmise from know this that it was a totally unusual situation?  Were we supposed to think \"Oh, they must have been mentally retarded, they didn't know the difference!\".  I can't say enough that I don't get why he would make a point of relaying that information. I emailed the studio I felt so strongly about this.  I noted that in the 7pm newscast they replayed the story, but that part was left out.  Coincidence?  Maybe others were offended as well.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 27, 2008", "body": "\n Not many people think about taking their kids to \"bars\" but we do, we can.  Here in Michigan, kids can dine with their family up until 9pm in places that others would think kids could never step foot in.  We took Casey to such an establishment the other night.   We enjoy taking him to these places because they almost always have lots of tvs, and video games.  This is perfect for him, a sensory overload that he loves and lends to everyone involved having a  great time out together.  The bar we went to fit the bill, 10 televisions encircling us, a wall of video games aglow.  This idilic mecca however, became somewhat of an impediment it seems, as our son is becoming more acutely aware of the details of his obsessions. Three very important sporting events were on that night, one less important than the other 2, but taking up a couple of tv screens nontheless.  One of the events was supposed to be on at 7pm (time is becoming quite important to Casey) and it was on channel 7 (his favorite channel at the moment) and not one television had it on.  This was a playoff game for our Detroit Pistons so we were suprised it wasn't on either, and Casey was well, mortified.  He even went so far as to gather the attention of a few of the waitresses before we knew what he was doing, to demand (there are no requests with Casey) that someone turn one of the tvs to channel 7!  They were befuddled, we were a little embarressed and no changes in the matter were accomplished.  This lead to a series of laps around the bar to each televison not in his view to see if his beloved channel 7 was on one of them.  Needless to say, it was busy there, waitresses dodging back and forth, Casey dodging in between them, in between tables, in between customers.  Bill and me, chasing him, trying to make him sit down and get out of the way.   He finally found one console that had channel 7 on it.  Of course, it was out of sight of our table, facing the pool tables and dart boards, where, you guessed it, people were in fact playing pool and darts.  Just where you want a giant 9 year old standing in the middle of your line of shot jumping in excitement at the channel 7 emblem in the corner of the tv!  Needless to say, we had to make him sit several times, and we were just plum exhausted.  Casey finally settled down to eat his fries, but suddenly broke into crocodile tears as if pinched quite violently.  \"What is wrong?!\"  I inquired impatiently, really wanting to enjoy my meal finally.  \"I can't watch channel 7 while I eat!\" he cried sadly.  Ugh. After things were finally cleared, I used the 9pm time limit to excuse ourselves from the establishment, leaving Bill with some friends to watch in peace.  Riding home, I felt beat down and a little bummed that our bar idea wasn't fun at all this time, and that once again Casey's Autism got the best of things.   We had the radio on  and the Who's \"Who are You?\" came on, causing Casey to start moving furiously in his dancey, stemmy way.  Disgusted with the whole evening, I said more to myself than him \"See, I shouldn't have let you drink Sprite.  Now you're all jazzed up!\".   \"I'm not jazzed up on Sprite mom, I'm jazzed on the music!\" he jauntily replied doing his Casey moves even more energetically.   A sentence like that doesn't often come easily for Casey, and somehow, in that simple little sweet and funny reply, the angst of the evening suddenly left my mind, and I savored the silliness and clarity of his thought.....I took a deep breath, and let the nights events get pushed out the window in the new summer's breeze.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SDwIAIx5A-I/AAAAAAAAAB0/YyD5dximxgo/s1600-h/DSC00318.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/05/just-another-night-in-autismville.html", "title": "\nJust another night in Autismville....\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 30, 2008", "body": "\nLately as discussed in a previous blog, I have found myself being more and more a supporter and member of a movement known in certain circles as Autism Acceptance.  I was led by the Autism DIva herself to the Autism Hub after I had commented on her Youtube contributions, and explained my feelings on how it always seems I'm on a mission to change Casey's Autism.  The Autism Hub has featured bloggers whose subject matter pertains mostly to their children or themselves if they are an Autistic adult, and their day to day triumphs, disappointments, funny stories, opinions, and the latest news pertaining to Autism and their thoughts on that news.  You rarely find reference in these blogs to what sort of diet they live to have their kid on (although some do various well-known diets because they help with their child's health, not because they are trying to \"cure\" them).  You will not find someone discussing how a certain supplement made their child speak suddenly in paragraphs.  Quite the opposite, some of them will mention their past experiences with such supplements, and how nothing really happened. It seems what they are all about is accepting their children and themselves for who they are, working with them to make them the best they can be, and most importantly I think, enjoying their children, taking each day as it comes.  Which brings me to something I've thinking about for the last couple of days after running into someone. This lady that I run into often mostly due to the locale of our homes and sharing a school, has 3 children, triplets, 2 Autistic, one not.  The 2 that are, for lack of a better way of saying it, are pretty Autistic.  They have been in the same program that Case is in, and he has even been in a classroom with one of them.  Needless, to say, this woman always looks frazzled, a little on edge, and nervous.  From all accounts, her life is excruciatingly busy with three 9 year olds.  The child who is not Autistic goes to a different school than her siblings.  I have listened to this woman's stories over the years, and they've always made me appreciate the fact that Casey is pretty good for the most part as far as Autistic kids go, and the fact that we only have 1 child in general.  Stories of long nights of one of them always being awake, endless attempts at various biomed interventions that emptied their already almost empty pockets and never really worked, constant behaviours that would drive a lesser person crazy, maybe it already has and she's just holding it together.  It's from all outward appearances a challenging existence with these children. This brings me back then to the whole Autism Acceptance Movement.  For me, reading about the different families that have supported this movement has given me a new piece of mind,  has sort lifted a load off my psyche if you will.  It also helps because it has made me appreciate more all the wonderful things about Casey while pushing his Autistic stuff under the doormat so to speak.  Now, that Autistic stuff isn't huge, it's everyday irritations that we deal with and hope go away.  But for someone like this mom of triplets, I would have to wonder how she could ever be one to tout the benefits of Acceptance, or benefit from being in a frame of mind such as this.  When your life is turned topsy turvy and it's not your own anymore, how can you go \"Hey, I'm accepting my child as she/he is and sod it all!\". Which has lead me to reading more blogs on the Autism Hub, and lo and behold, there are parents with children, sometimes multiple children on the spectrum, on the lower end of it, equally as busy as this woman's children.  The more challenging kids.  But they seem to sort of think\"to hell with it, to hell with trying to cure them.  They are who they are.\".  And for this, I give them lots of credit.  These parents seem to laugh in the face of pain, heartbreak, challenge, difficulty.  Perhaps for them, that is life, they've never known anything different, which is sort of our case, never having other children and especially ones that are typical.  Maybe for them, like me, it's easier to live day to day, and try to get the best out of things, no matter what level that \"best\" is , and not think about what could have been and what could be if we did this or that, or gave this vitamin or did this diet.  We are all on a spectrum of some sort. So, having said all this, I don't think this mom of 3 knows of the Autism Acceptance Movement, or would really appreciate it.  And that's ok, everyone is different.  But I can't help but wonder if her life might be a little different, a little more bearable,  if someone put a bug in her ear and lead her to, perhaps Autism Hub.  Now what was her email address again, I know I had it somewhere....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/05/does-acceptance-make-life-more.html", "title": "\nDoes Acceptance Make Life More Tolerable?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 23, 2008", "body": "\nIt's been awhile since I blogged, but it seems these last weeks of school and a few other activities Casey is involved, plus work, has taken up a lot of time.  I find myself reading others thinking \"Gee, I need to blog\" and then get distracted. Not that there isn't lots to talk about, so many things changing for Case.  So many things in the works, summer, camp, Indy visits. I guess the biggest issue is considering and then acting upon changing what we sorta established last week as his educational plan for next year in his IEP. Ever since I went to visit his new school next year, I have had trepedations about moving him into the same situation he's in now- part of the day in the Autism program, part in regular ed.  But, after seeing the room that I thought that he would be in for AI (this is the term they use for the Autism program), I basically shed tears, thinking I was sorta setting him up for the rest of his career in school to be obtaining lifeskills and not a lot of emphasis on being \"diploma bound\" if you will.  I am not putting down a lifeskills curriculum for some kids, it's reality, it's what will work for them, and hopefully make their adult lives tolerable and happy.  But I want to find out if Case could do more than that, I want to see if maybe, just maybe, he could go to college, he could have a career.  Who knows.  But I know deep down, if I keep him in the AI program, I probably won't see that happen if it is possible. We had the IEP though, and we basically signed off on another year of the same, I think more out of familiarity, uncertainty, security.  THis will be a new school, 5th graders are bigger, more mature.  Did I want him around them all day had I done things differently on the IEP.  We left feeling ok about things, but I still have an itch that I can't scratch.  One that is telling me that we didnt' make the right move for Casey, considering what we want for him. I had avoided my dear friend who is an activist in the field of inclusion in our school district.  Her son is a year older than Casey, incredibly intelligent, but still having some issues, and his verbals skills are still a work in progress.  But she's had him in full on regular ed for the past 3 years, and doing fine.  She has always encouraged me to do the same.  But I have so much fear about it, would he get services if he wasn't in a special program, would he have to ride the regular bus with regular kids who picked on him?  WOuld have a good paraprofessional that would work with him, not for him, but still make sure he wasnt' getting beat up in the bathroom or on the playground.  All these thoughts have held me back, despite the fact that my friend has never reported such issues about her son's situation.  I hadn't spoken to her about much of anything, for fear she would lull me into wanting to change things for him. Stupid me called her the other day, and of course being the awesome, on top of things person that she is, knew I had had our IEP.  I told her the whole story, and of course, she started on me:   \"So, you are going to put him in a program that left you in tears after you saw it?\".   Stunned silence...... \"yeah\" I replied, in a stupid child to her mother after doing something dumb and having to answer to it. \"Hhhmmm\" she replied without really saying anything but everything. The conversation continued, and in short, she has offered to be an advocate if we wanted to get him in regular ed and do it right.   I can't stop thinking about it now, and will continue this train of thought later......\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/05/where-does-this-child-belong.html", "title": "\nWhere does this child belong?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 9, 2008", "body": "\n Last night they had an Art Show at my son's school.  I like to take him to things like that because a) he loves to peruse the hallways when he's not expected to do anything or be anywhere at the time and b)  the kids in his regular ed class always make a point of saying \"Hi\" to him and slapping him a high five!  I want him to feel like he has connections, even if they are briefly supported in this way.  And thusly, he had this occur several times last night. But I got a little bit of an uplifting surprise when we were out on the playground with a number of other kids taking adavantage of the play structures.  Case was climbing around on the large playscape when he started getting really excited, and I noticed he was staring at a particular kid.  He was giving this kid full eye contact, and saying \"Geico!' in such a way as if he was illiciting a response from the other guy, whose back was to me.  I didn't hear the other boy say anything, but Case jumped up and down as if he saw the Geico Gecko walking boy and continued this back and forth a little more.  I didn't think the kid had responded, which is par for the course and started speaking to another child I knew.  Suddenly, I lost track of Casey, and quickly turned towards the parking lot to see him sort of chasing a car and waving, shouting \"Good by Jason, Goodbye, see you tomorrow!\"  I shouted at him to get out of the parking lot and he commenced to sort of follow the path of the car waving and shouting still till it was out of sight.  He then stopped, dropped his arms, and said quietly \"See you tomorrow Jason...\"  Ugh, broke my heart.   After prodding him for information, I went through my memory bank and recalled being at a school swimming event where several kids came and said hi to Case, and then he asked me if a Jason S. was there.  I had no idea and asked some of the kids and they said he wasn't.  I thought it was interesting then that he had set his sights on one particular friend.  Over the past several months, he has mentioned Jason's name in passing, saying \"Jason eats wafers too at lunch!\" (still not sure what sort of wafers). And of course, he will not give me any more info on Jason. I have decided to make a point of gathering info on this elusive Jason and seeing if somehow we could buddy up with him over the summer.  I think it's big haps when Case connects with someone, and more than likely Jason has no clue what this all means to Casey, or me.  But it means the world!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SCResvrM2DI/AAAAAAAAABs/Yu2QYUGl3Rc/s1600-h/DSC00330.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/05/surprising-social-situation.html", "title": "\nSurprising social situation!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 23, 2008", "body": "\n If your are the parent of a child with Autism, then you are all well too aware of the unusual and unpopular (usually) fixations your child might have.  For us, there have been many.  It started young with license plates and abc's (popular I've later discovered among the Autistic set), moved on to a USA map puzzle at 3, then a talking globe, and on and on, and on.   Lately, Casey has been incredibly interested in television news programs.  This fascination has lasted quite awhile now because I recall late last summer indulging him by driving here and there to look at the various local news stations per his request (He desperately wants to go in one).  So yeah, he's been on this for awhile.  He loves watching and listening, and noting which  newcaster is on that day and when they aren't there and replaced by another anchor, watch out.  I often worry about him seeing the bad news stories (we live in the suburbs surrounding Detroit, and there seems to be a lot of bad news stories, it's just fact).  But honestly, I don't even think he picks up on any of it.  He just loves the cadence of the anchors, the remote control that the weather men usually hold to change the weather screen they are describing, he loves it all.  We found an old video tape that we accidentally taped a news cast on after the principle taping subject, and he has been really watching it for the last couple of days now.   This morning after requesting this tape for the upteenth time, I asked him \"Why do you want to watch that tape again?\", and he answered \"Because they have a great news broadcast, good announcers, and a great logo that goes around and around!\".  Hhhm, couldn't argue with that.  I wanted to add something else he might be subconsciously thinking \"and I can rewind it over and over again, and it never changes, and that makes me happy!\".  I know all his secrets. This love of all things television news, odd as it is, has really brought quite a bit of interaction potential along with it.  By interaction, I mean interaction with his father, me, and whoever else will indulge in one his favorite past times \"dubbing\".  \"Dubbing\" occurs when you put the mute on the news, and you fill in the words yourself!  Sounds fun huh? It brings out great joy and happiness, especially when Dad \"dubs\".  \"Dubbing\" began when he discovered voiced over tv shows and commercials on YouTube.  He started small, having me film him talking over commercials and putting them on Youtube.  Now, he enjoys huge blocks of time \"dubbing\" to the news.   If one is lucky enough to be invited to participate, the guest dubber might find that they become the most entertaining person on the planet for those few short minutes, especially if  body humor is used in the \"dub\", and I won't go any farther than that (in other words, throw the word butt or fart in a couple of times, and you're golden). I'm sure like all of Casey's other \"loves\", this too shall pass.  Secretly though, I can't help but hope it could make him one of the best anchors in the business when he grows up!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SA93_UHznGI/AAAAAAAAABU/eXF3P528eRA/s1600-h/Casey+and+the+team.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/whats-in-news.html", "title": "\nWhat's in the News?\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 28, 2008", "body": "\n Everyone knows that verbalizing and putting thoughts together is tough for a lot of kids people with Autism.  This is probably why my Occupational Therapist sister tried to deter me from signing Casey up for a beginners Spanish Class! And rightly so.  Casey, at almost 10 years old, still has difficulty expressing his thoughts into words, still has outbursts because he can't express himself the way he would like, and often to this day refers to himself in third person.  However, Spanish became a huge interest for Casey just recently.  It all started when he discovered that his dvd's had a Spanish language option.  He must have watched the old Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer in Spanish at least 100 times, with English sub captions.  He began picking out words that he connected from the captions and hearing them, and began asking me things like \"How do you say toys in Spanish?\".  Feigning ignorance, despite having had this same question asked of me several times, I would answer \"I don't know, how?\".  \"Juegetes\" he would say proudly.   Senor Casey then began to ask me how you said all kinds of things in Spanish, that he didn't know the answer to, forcing us to consult the free translation websites on the Internet, or more conveniently, an English to Spanish dicitonary.  Having  taken French in high school (French I 2 years in a row as a matter of fact), I really wasn't much help but found that we were learning together.   Pretty soon, I was fielding reports from school that his teacher had to tell him to answer questions in English, and not the contrived Spanish he started using, which was Spanish sounding gibberish mixed with real words he knew.  He was turning down the TV and and dubbing in whoever was on speaking with his own Spanish.  The kid was obsessed! It seemed only natural then that when I saw that our Community Ed Catalog offered a beginners Spanish class, we would join up!  It was a bit risky since it wasn't really set up for kids with Autism, but I figured it was just for fun, and if he couldn't do it, then at least he would be out and about  experiencing something. The first class was met with great excitement on Casey's part.  He was giddy all day about it and mentioned that we would be going several times throughout the day!  His teacher, who I had discussed Casey with beforehand, greeted him warmly, and he answered back with an \"Ola\" (Sp?).  The class went swimmingly despite the confused looks from the other kids, wondering why this kid's mom was sitting behind him helping him, and the kid himself was talking a little oddly, and didn't quite seem to know all the basics of being a student.   But Casey participated a lot and even threw out a few words that the teacher hadn't even taught yet.  She seemed quite impressed and amazed and asked me if he took Spanish at school.  I being amazed myself, answered no, and smiled proudly.   All the classes have gone well since, despite a few fights about going (computer seperation anxiety), and he has caught on extremely well.  For a kid who won't finish a task at school without extreme prompting and reminders, he certainly can do all the worksheets (ie crosswords, search a words, and matching items) in minutes and on his own, and correctly!  He even got upset this last week because the class didn't play Spanish Bingo.  This from the kid who you literally have to threaten no computer for a year to get him to play a game at home! So, for once, my OT sister was wrong and I was right for signing him up.  I love that he is learning Spanish, but more than that, I am just happy to see him behaving in such a \"typical\" kid manner.  Even if he can't speak it fluently, or more than likely  will lose interest, at least I have the knowledge that he can learn, and can be appropriate, even if it is when it works for him. *I am adding this a few days after I posted the original, but my wonderful friend reminded me that I forgot to share a cute story.  At Casey's Spanish class last week they were doing a \"quiz\" where the teacher was holding up index cards with the words they had learned in the past weeks and had the kids put up their hands to say what each was.  At one point, she held up one that read \"lampara\".  No hands went up because was not a word that had been taught.  The instructor had accidentally put it in the pile.  Suddenly Casey's hand went up, and to his teacher's surprise he blurted out \"lamp\".  She looked over her glasses at me and said \"Mom, did you know he knew this?\".  \"Uh, no!\"  I said amazed.  I don't know if the look of the word itself gave the English translation to him, or something he'd heard but doggonit everyone was impressed!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp1.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SBYM1kHznHI/AAAAAAAAABc/3ymzpdLBml0/s1600-h/2.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/muy-cool.html", "title": "\nMuy Cool\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 1, 2008", "body": "\n I'm a member of a couple message boards for parents with kids with Autism.  I'm a member on a county wide board, a southeastern Michigan board, and  a board visited by people worldwide that focuses on biomedical information concerning Autism.   I peruse this board daily, along with the others, looking for post topics that tickle my fancy.  Often times, those topics are so complicated, I don't even begin to delve into the mysteries of the post itself!  For instance, here's one\"  kinase P13 in: Autism can be treated - by Carolyn Dean, MD, ND and E\".  Wow, what the heck?  I tried to read on, and not being the sharpest knife in the drawer, I became bored and lost, with the chemistry discussion that ensued, and confused.  \"Kinase P13\"? Sometimes on this very board, some topics do tickle my fancy, and almost could have been written by me!  Usually these are inquiries.   Case in point: Subj:  Concentration and Focus Issues > My son has come such a far way, but his ability to focus and > concentrate in class is a huge problem for him. He fails miserably > with pen/paper tasks. > > Can anyone recommend any treatments they found useful? Interesting.  Like I said, I could have asked about the same thing easily.  In fact, attention and foucus, or lack there of , is probably one of our biggest issues right now with Casey.  So of course I was anxious to see what people had to offer in response.   The responses ranged from suggestions of Occupational Therapy intervention,  to some prescription drug suggestions (odd on a biomed board).  But one really jumped out at me, short, simple, and extremely weird.... Re:  Concentration and Focus Issues >Adrenal Cortex Extract!! >Julie Well, thanks Julie!  That is really informative!  That's certainly not like writing \"Tylenol\" if someone might ask what is good for a headache!  Adrenal Cortex Extract?!  What the hell?  I guess Julie thought that perhaps everyone who really needed to know about this ADE as I like to call it would simply get their google on!  And so I did.  I googled it, and of course scores of websites came up about ADE.  Wow, sounds like another \"Magic Bullet\".  Oh, how I wished I had 3 hours to sit and read everything I could.  Not!  After reading the first webpage devoted to this ADE, I  got weirded out: > Adrenal extracts are derived from the adrenal glands of bovine (beef) sources. Commercially available adrenal extracts are made using the whole gland (whole or total adrenal extracts) or just the cortex or outer portion of the gland (adrenal cortex extracts). The adrenal glands are a pair of small glands that lie just above the kidneys. Bovine?  Ick...It didn't tell me much and further investigation forced me to go back to my search bar and add \"and Autism\" to my ADE query.  Pretty much everything that had popped up previously did again.  All the sites mentioned ADE helped with such conditions as Hypoglycemia, inflammation, drug and alcohol withdrawal, stress management, trauma, allergies and Addison's Disease.  Ok, but how does it help with focus and attention in children with Autism JULIE? So, being the investigative reporter that I am, I decided to go to the source of the statement and see how she, Juile, the orginal poster of this cryptic message, could enlighten me more than any of the websites.   I emailed her a short and polite request for info on her experience and recieved this: >Bonnie, I have been reading up on adrenal function lately. I think this is a  major key to the puzzle. When the body is under stress, oxidative from the inside or pressures  from the outside world, the adrenals work come into play. They excrete  cortisol to cope with this stress. They stimulate the sympathetic  nerves  to jump into action, otherwise known as the 'fright or flight'  response.  Outward indications are sweating, dilated pupils, lots of energy  (running around) and decreased digestion. This is just temporary but if   stress becomes chronic,  then the body constantly pumps out cortisol  and  the adrenals over time start to exhaust themselves. Less cortisol is  pumped out....symptoms of low cortisol/ fatigue are inability to combat   inflammation, constipation, sleep problems and I have a feeling that  these strange sensory sensations (eg strange reaction to hair brushing  as if it hurts) the children have are also due to low cortisol.... .....For the best explanation of adrenal issues, go to  www.adrenalfatigue.org We have been supporting the adrenals here with adrenal cortex extract  and niacin and have been seeing excellent progress...more mental energy   and altogether more with it. Vitamin C given several times daily seems  toplay an mportant role. After 6 years of being on these lists, I am beginning to think that  whatever triggered the autism/ASD, created such a shock and in turned  overchallenged the adrenals. I think if you can get the adrenal glands  back into action, then half the battle is won. Sorry, in haste as I have a deadline tomorrow. Julie :-)) Well, ok.  So, you've been poppin' some stuff into your kid pulled out of bovine adrenal glands because you \"think\" adrenal function may be a major key to the puzzle.  You're basing this on your readings and have decided this would be a good idea. I'm sorry, did I miss in this email about her doctor or DAN practioner supporting this?  Don't apologize for your hasty response Julie, I got all I needed from your email (and the happy face by your signature helps too!). Sorry if I sound cynical.  I am really glad her kid is benefiting from Adrenal Cortex Extract, I am.   But, I have found that I have benefited from years of experience.  I have seen this sort of response on boards over and over, a parent offering up the Magic Bullet that helped their kid!  I have to confess, had I read this about 4 years ago, I probably would have already ordered some of this ADE from one of the many supplement websites on the internet.  I would have waited in anticipation for it to arrive, gotten it, waited a few days because my conscience would be asking me \"Do you really want to give this to him?\", and then I would, and there wouldn't be a change....nothing.  I did this so many times, wasted so much money, so much money, and hope. I guess I decided to write about this whole message board exprience not to pout about my own mistakes, but to let anyone who might read this who is new to the whole Autism thing know that you should be leery, oh so leery of Magic Bullets.  And boy are there a lot of them.  I probably still have 12 half empty bottles of them in my cabinet.  It's bad enough when companies sorta play on the innocence and naitivite of parents who are looking to help their child.  But I think it's even worse when a parent throws out something so irresponsibly like Julie did.  You don't just post one term and not offer up any info.  So, people read Julie's post, they have a 3 year old whose in preschool and they get daily reports that their kid can't focus, and they order this stuff without research.  I'm telling you, it can happen.  And then their kid has some sort of bad reaction because they gave too much or too little and no one was policing this from a medical stand point.   We fortunately didn't have any really bad reactions to the \"Magic Bullets\" we tried.  Oh, there was the \"I hear Teletubbies\" Debacle of 2002 when tried DMG, but that's another story.   I just hope no one else does either.   BEWARE THE JULIES AND ADRENAL CORTEX EXTRACTS OF THE WORLD!!!!!!  There is no Magic Bullet, and if there is, please tell me more about it than it's name!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SBnFfUHznII/AAAAAAAAABk/NkIPNgRuPrQ/s1600-h/1966857509.jpeg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/05/magic-bullets.html", "title": "\nMagic Bullets\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 17, 2008", "body": "\n I just wanted to do a brief commentary on staring.  I think of all the reprucussions of Casey's Autism, staring from the general public is my biggest pet peeve, and irritation.  And I tell ya right now, I don't care if people are just \"curious\", I don't care if his actions warrant a stare or two, I don't care if children stare at everything, I don't care.  This is my blog, and I am going to rant to the point of political incorrectness and disregard for general humaness if I want to! The reason that prompted me to write this was because last night at the pool, Case was talking, to himself mind you,  but talking non the less.  The pool action kinda brings that out in him.  He likes doing it, it's fun for him, and will be something we will try to stifle as he gets to be 6'4 and is trying to do the newscast to himself.  Yes, I know it's weird to the outsider, I know.  But ok, when one is 10 or 11 years old, and especially a girl, who is naturally socially ept, don't ya think that would trigger something in your brain that maybe this boy might be different?  Maybe, just maybe, I shouldnt' stare?  Did my parents teach me that it is RUDE to stare in general, and especially if someone is displaying an odd behaviour?  And isn't it especially rude to stare and then look at one's friend and do a \"that kid is a freak\" expression?  That's what happened last night.  We get a lot of stares at the pool, probably because of the close quarters, excessive lighting, extreme goofiness that the swimming brings out in him.   Casey has a funny gait when he walks, he bounces a bit, usually holding out his arms oddly, sometimes not.  And we get stares, and not just from children, but from adults who most certainly know better!  Clearly, the kid has something going!  Oh the stare stories I could tell...and I will! One evening stands out clearly in my mind, speaking of a adults and their staring habits.  A woman who was sitting on the sidelines of the pool (the pool again) was literally having a stare fest at the expense of Case.  Ok, he was loping back and forth in the shallow end oddly, getting used to the water, holding his ears and talking in reaction to the overabundance of auditory stimuli in the place.  He looked funny, I know he did, but it's his thing to get used to the pool, and this routine makes for a happier time.  This woman knew he looked funny too, and thus, she was staring.   But everytime I glanced over after I became  aware of her glare,  I found that she was still glaring, and staring, and glaring!  She had surpassed her staring alottment.  I give people about one or two good stares, but after that, I need to say something!  And so, I approached her and said \"Do you know us?\".  Stunned, she looked blankly and said in a rather offended voice \"No!\".  I said in my most pleasant and condescending manner \"Oh, because you keep staring at him as if you know him!\"..ha ha....She got her back up (why seem pissed one when is not guilty?)  and responded \"I wasn't staring!\".  \"Yeah, you were, alot, so I thought maybe you knew him or us.\"I says.  Well, the staring stopped and she looked away without responding.  Maybe I was out of line, but I felt so much better. Anyway, I have no point or purpose to this post other to vent, and hope that someone can relate.  I hate staring!  I think it should be taught at school that it is inappropriate, especially if you even get the littlest inkling that the subject you are staring at might be a bit different.   Maybe I'm giving folks too much credit!  Perhaps, people are just stupid as a whole.  Don't defend human kind in the comments section, it won't help my outlook, and it makes me feel better if I just think that.  I suppose if I was a better person, I would offer people explanations for my son's behaviour that causes them to stare.  But then, I shouldn't have to......\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SAdMvLUizdI/AAAAAAAAABE/pSZJYvAdxNU/s1600-h/DSC01791.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/staring.html", "title": "\nStaring\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 21, 2008", "body": "\nEver since Casey has been in the education system, he's been in what is considered \"special ed\".  He began around 1 in a small program geared specifically for toddlers with Autism.  We loved it, it was a Godsend, and he thrived. He then moved on to a preschool in our district that housed one of the largest programs for Autistic children around.  He was there for 3 years, and he thrived in this program as well. That whole program too seemed like a Godsend, and I say \"seemed\" because, in a way, it set him up to be what he is today.  Still in special ed. We got brave and decided to move him into what is called a \"cross-categorical\" (a room with mixed disabilities, not Autism specific) classroom in a regular grade school for first grade.  In hindsight, our first mistake here was that he was of age to go into first grade, but maturity wise, wasn't even close to going into first grade.   We should have put him in half day kindergarten (cross-cat) and given him more time to adjust.  As a result, even this special classroom (which by the way housed 1st and 2nd graders and was overstaffed, but also too student heavy, couldn't fulfill his needs and he couldn't keep up with the pace.  We would get notes daily telling us he wasn't focused, couldn't attend, couldn't stay on task.  It didn't help that his teacher was a relic and needed to retire.  And so, long story long, we moved him into a totally Autistic program at another grade school. It was really a relief at the time, he saw many friends that he knew from preschool, and the pace and size of the classrooms helped immensely.  He's had a good run there, even being included in the regular ed classrooms for part of the day.  He's had his rough spots, but we've seen him grow intelligence wise.  Not so much socially, but that could still come. Now, we are faced with changing schools next year, which will be a 5-6 grade building and it scares the bejeezus out of me.  A dear, dear friend of mine has put her son, who is on Casey's level in regular ed full time with an aide for the last 3 years now, and often  tries to get me to do the same with Casey.  That whole concept scares me to death, there is so much work in doing it, for the kids and the parents.  And you know how you get the gut feeling about something?  Well, my gut is that it wouldn't work for my child. He does ok in regular ed when he's there, he follows along somewhat, but is stiff not focused a lot of the time.  He still hasn't picked up on cues such as getting his book out when the other kids do, things like that.  And he does quite well when he is back in the AI (Autistically Impaired) room with smaller groups and one on one instruction.  Too much is going on in a regular ed room.  I truly believe it's overwhelming. At the same time, I have mixed feelings moving him into the same situation again at another school.  By all accounts, it doesn't seem like he'll be mainstreamed this year into regular ed...\"Have you ever been in a typical 5 grade classroom Mrs. Davis?  We don't know how Casey would manage!\".  Part of says, that's ok.  5th and 6th graders can be tough, and he doesn't need that.  And there are so many issues that I could go into but won't now.  But then, I don't like him being around kids with behavioural issues all day, who are also mostly not always verbal, and who have the same social level as he, if not lower. I think my intentions for writing this blog is to get other peoples opinions about this and let me know what they have done and what works for them.  This is definitely a subject that I am going to touch on again soon!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/special-ed-vs-mainstreaming.html", "title": "\nSpecial Ed vs. Mainstreaming\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 12, 2008", "body": "\n I think I am going to have a feature section in my blog called \"Casey's Oddities\"  where I will feature a funny story about something that Casey feels strongly about and may seem a bit odd to the rest of the world, but non the less important, to him.  I was telling my sister this story on the phone today and felt it was worthwhile to share. During Casey's spring break, we received copies of the publication that had a story I had written about him in.  The magazine is a good one, and it's geared towards supplying information to parents of 0 to 3 year olds.  My story concentrated on the time that we were finding out about Casey having Autism and what we did Early intervention wise.  It features 3 really cute pictures of him too.  My mom was visiting at the time and of course demanded a copy, and even asked Casey to autograph one (not me the writer).  He started glancing through it, and when he realized it was about babies and toddlers, that was it.   A little background, short but sweet, the image of the Gerber baby scares the hell out of him, he can't stand the sound of baby dolls in the toy section if they talk, and the infant care department might as well be a haunted house.  So, for some reason, babies and all that go with them are taboo.  We don't know why, and we're not sure if we ever will, despite our attempts at remembering a situation that would have instilled this dislike/fear of all things baby. So, to be part of a story in a \"baby\" magazine as he called it was out of the question.  Luckily, he didn't see the other 9 copies and only took the one my mom had, took it out to the outdoor trash can, and commenced to take it down to the curb despite it not being trash day.  He wanted NO part of that magazine. We of course fished it out, hid it away, and wondered what the hell would lead him to make such an effort.  Funny and strange at the same time, like the Autistic brain can often be!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SADS4yQzOFI/AAAAAAAAAAw/RI2e06Xiin0/s1600-h/Baby%2520Casey.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/caseys-oddities.html", "title": "\nCasey's Oddities\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 13, 2008", "body": "\n I often find in everyday life with my lovely little boy, that I am  put into situations that simply kick me in the ass, wake me up from a self-pitying stupor, or make me go \"Gosh I'm lucky!\".   Case in point was a birthday party we attended yesterday.  It was for a boy who Casey attends school with in his Autistic class.  I gotta be honest, I didn't want to take him.  This in itself is a sin, because Case really isn't invited to too many birthday parties, so I should have been thanking God that he had the opportunity to do something that most kids get to do practically every weekend.  I was being selfish, I didn't want to have to associate with a lot of parents who would inevitably be there because there would be kids with Autism there, and ya just don't leave one poor mother with such a group.  I didn't want to make small talk, I didn't want to deal with other's kids (I admit it, I am not a big kid person, seriously), I didn't want to have to chase Casey out of bedrooms and away from computers.  The whole thought of the event put me in a bad mood, not to mention I still had to go get the kid a gift, the party was at 4pm, and it was 3:30.  But, after much angst and whining (from me), I decided we would go. So, being in the mood I was in didn't help my reactions to Casey holding his ears through Target, saying he heard \"babies\" (that's another blog, and oh, it will be written soon).  I forgot his headphones that eliminate noise, and he was being especially obnoxious.  I was feeling irritated at him, irritated that we were going to this party, irritated that I couldn't find the 99 cent birthday cards.  I yelled at him in the car about his acting so silly, aren't I a good mom?  I started my woe is me state of mind, why my kid, why does he do this crap. We got to the party, and it was cold, and damp, and everyone was out in the backyard.  Luckily, I think getting there 1/2 hour late was a good thing!  We hopped out and was greeted by the mom having the party, and Casey immediately recognized a friend from his class sitting on a porch swing, and he plopped down next to him.  They began having a little conversation about what Casey wanted on his pretend pizza the other kid was ordering on a little playphone he had found.  My heart swelled, social stuff doesn't come easy for him, duh.  He proceeded to jump right on the tractor ride the dad was supplying, participating in a race with all the other boys, and seemingly enjoying himself.  We retreated to the basement for the rest of the festivities.  The basement, being in the home of 3 boys, had a tremendous amount of toys.  He had a blast playing with all the stuff he doesn't have (and if he did,he wouldn't play with).  He was so well behaved especially compared to some of the other Autistic kids there ( and I'm not just saying that, I know my kid can be a brat).  One of the children did this constant screech that could make a mummy jump, over and over.  One kid was trying to pour his fruit punch into one of the Thomas the Tank Engine water tours on the little railroad track.  My kid wanted to know when the birthday boy was going to open presents!  And I yelled at him in the car..... I say there is a reason for every situation because in this instance, Case got a great chance to socialize, as much as he could, and his insensitive, stupid mother got to see many examples of other kids behaviour that made her realize what a great little boy she has despite his foibles due to his Autism.  I was glad we went, I know Case was glad we went, and I'm glad my selfish side didn't get the best of me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp3.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/SAJ10bUizbI/AAAAAAAAAA4/K6-eAPRdDkg/s1600-h/DSC02381.JPG"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/there-truly-is-reason-for-everything.html", "title": "\nThere Truly is a Reason for Everything (and Every Situation)\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 11, 2008", "body": "\n Well, here's my 2nd installment.  I have been checking out many blogs on Autism Hub, and finding so much wonderful information and stories, that I feel a little silly even attempting a blog.  But, I guess I find other's entries interesting because it's their life, and something that I haven't fully experienced so it's new.  So, perhaps sharing my experiences will be the same for others.  I find that I have a story in my head daily about Casey, or Bill and Casey, or Casey and me.  I gotta use them I've decided, to fulfill my secret desire to be a writer.  So, having said that, I am now going to commit to myself that I am going to write at least daily, or at least once a week.  Who knows.  But I'm going to write. So, Melatonin.  It's a supplement, it's an antioxidant according to some of the sites I've researched.  But for us, it's sorta been a real cool thing!  I really did research a lot about it, because Casey has never been a good sleeper, and in fact will tell you that he doesn't need to sleep (especially when he wants to watch the 11pm news, but that's another entry.).  However, Bill and I do.  So, after brushing and massaging and doing the whole hot bath, oooh oohh comfy, tuck in routine, and still not having any luck, I started looking into Melatonin.  I had tried it once, 3 mg, thinking that wasn't much!  It was almost frightening how quickly he fell asleep after taking it.  So fast in fact that it spooked me and I announced to the world that it he wouldn't ever take that again!  I felt terrible for some reason.  I had been going through the whole biomed phase of his life, and tried supplements here and there, and non of them had any huge effect that I could see immediately.  But this one did, and it scared the shit out of me.   Let's shoot up today, because that was about a year or so ago.  I recently went back to the idea of Melatonin because the damn kid just won't sleep through the night.  We can take him swimming and have him do 30 laps after a day of school.  He will fall asleep and be up by 2am.  I know, this could be something with his gut, or whatever.  I think though, after doing my research, that he doesn't produce enough Melatonin, which has been proven in some kids with Autism.  So, I found a site that suggested how much to give a kid his age and size, and I can tell ya it wasn't 3mgs.  It was 1mg.  Yes, dumbass!  1mg.  Anyway, long story long, we've been giving it to him about 1/2 hour before we want him to go to sleep.  And oh, does he go to sleep.  It's nice, for him and us.  I mean, I lay with him at night until he goes to sleep, watching tv usually, and I have found myself waking up at midnight, with him laying next to me wide awake still watching!  So, to go in and do and few dishes and come in to lay with him, and find him asleep is well, marvelous!  Melatonin apparantly is extremely safe, and we have had no side effects, at least non that we have seen. The best part is, he is having great days at school.  Getting more sleep certainly can do this for a person.  But I read somewhere, and don't ask me to quote it, but apparantly, Melatonin has other effects, aside from the sleep, that causes better behavior and stuff in some kids.  We're seeing it, and it's nice.  It's nice to have good reports come home.   The worst part?  He wakes up at 4am and starts watching tv.  So, you know, he gets 6 or 7 hours, and he's completely refresehd apparantly.  The good thing about this is, he never comes and wakes us anymore.  The bad thing is if my super sensitive ears are sleeping as well as I am, then I don't know how long he's been watching, and that's bad.  But he sometimes goes back to sleep, so it sorta works out.  A friend suggested he might need a little more Melatonin, and this might be remedied.  Maybe I need some so his tv won't wake me!.....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_kaLyRPjUgN4/R_-vHCQzOCI/AAAAAAAAAAY/z32LQbyzW88/s1600-h/th_CaseySpringPhoto.jpg"], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/melatonin-is-awesome.html", "title": "\nMelatonin is Awesome\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 10, 2008", "body": "\nWell, here is yet another attempt at a blog concerning our son Casey.  He's nine years old, handsome, tall, funny, and Autistic.  My previous blog about him centered around our attempts at trying the gluten free casein free diet on him (gf/cf is what I'll refer to it from now on for those who don't know the acronym).  I went back to it a few days ago and read my various installments and had a feeling of sadness at my perceived failure of it all, relief that we weren't doing it anymore, and curiosity at what if I had done it longer, would it have made a difference?   Then, I discovered something else by reading it, I'm not a bad writer.  A dear friend of mine recently gave me the opportunity to write a column in a publication she works on concerning Early Intervention, and our experience with it.  It was sorta, for a lack of a cornier word, exhilarating.  I was able to write about something that happened to me, and it seemed readable, and oddly enough, informative.  Perhaps, it will help others who read it, that would be awesome!  But selfishly, I have to admit, it's quite exciting to be in print, and to be able to have others read my work.  I even got paid!  But best of all, and this is going to sound realllly selfish, they feature 3 of my favorite pictures of Casey in it, and I am just so proud to be able to share his shining smiling face in an article about Autism.   This thought brings me to why I am starting this blog.  Recently, I have found myself starting to free my being from what almost seems like a cult of Autism curers, for lack of a better title.  A little background, I began attending various biomedical conferences back when Casey was probably around 4 or 5.  In these conferences, I began learning about all the \"horrors' Autism reeks on the bodies of \"these\" children, the digestive issues, that lead to the brain issues and behaviours, that lead to the self injurious behaviours and odd behaviours.  I was scared out of my mind!  I immediately started taking small steps at \"curing\" our son-epsom salt baths, that was a good and easy start!  Supplements!!!  YES, supplements, those will make all the difference, I must teach him to swallow pills!  And, he did, and he took them, and, he's still Autistic.  WE MUST TAKE HIM TO A DAN PRACTITIONER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   We did, and we started all the supplements he suggested (and by the way, awesome guy, I'm not belittling him or any other good DAN doc).  But something in me never did the follow up.  Fear of taking him to get blood drawn (an absolute nightmare)?  Fear of what I would find out.  Fear of what I would find out are things that I couldn't help anyway?  Was he going to have me chelate him?  I don't want to chelate him!  I just don't!   I have spent hours online, reading the biomed boards, struggling with the \"diets\" which I am not even going to get into (see my other blog, the gf/cf chronicles).  And I am still struggling to this day.  I am not so much trying to find that silver bullet anymore, because there isn't one.  I don't go out and buy every new supplement I read about anymore, heck I forgot to give him the basics that I give him now.   I have found myself suddenly leaning to a more freeing, if you will, movement.  For all intents and purposes, once could call it the \"Autism Acceptance\" movement.  I think I began looking at this movement when the whole Jenny McCarthy shit started playing out!  For some reason, it bothered me that this person who used to pose nude, do really stupid sickening comedies, and seemed like a box of rocks, was suddenly the spokesperson for those of us trying to help our children.  I hated it from the get go, but found so many others praising her name, putting her on a pedestal, buying her stupid book in droves.  What the hell?  I think what I found so offensive was the way she was on soooo many talk shows all at once, as if she were on a press junket for a new movie (well, she was I guess on a press junket for her new book).  What a hero, getting on every show possible, pontificating about she \"cured\" her son!  \"Cured\" her son of this horrible Autism!  What a saint......Take a deep breath Bon! She's not the only, although most notable, one.  I started getting on a message board that pertained to parents doing the gf/cf diet, and some of the members claimed their children were \"cured\".  I don't know why, and I still don't, but I found that so offensive.  It's not like, and I'm only speaking about my son, he has leprosy, or cancer.  And know that I am coming from a place of having a child with Autism, who at this point does not have horrid behaviours, does not have gut issues (as far as we know), who is verbal, who can read, and whose biggest issue at school is attention and focus.  What was I trying to cure?  His funny gate when he walks, his perseverations(although irritating, make up his personality in some ways), his nasty sleep habits (more my fault than the Autism)?  What was I trying to cure, or really, change?...... So, having said all that, I have decided, in honor of the Autism Acceptance Movement that I have now embraced after reading numerous blogs and watched several wonderful videos pertaining to, I am going to share stories about my son, on a daily basis, in the hopes of helping others accept their child with Autism.  I am going to share strategies and ideas that I have learned and will learn on dealing with issues.  I have a saint in my life who is an OT, and my sister.  I get thousands of dollars in free advice, and I am going to share that.  I want people to stop trying to \"cure\" their child, but embrace them, enjoy them, better them.  And most importantly, accept them.  I was thrilled to be able to have a brief back and forth with the Autism Diva, and her words still ring true to me.  They pertained to my questioning her on biomed.  I am not quoting, but summing up that she feels that if a child has valid health issues due to Autism, by all means, they should be helped, and I agree 100%.  But don't think there's a magic bullet out there, because there isn't.  If ya find one. let me know! Oh, and I am also starting this blog to continue the fulfillment I feel as a novice writer.  I may not get paid, but just putting my thoughts down is reward enough.  And what could be better than writing about my son?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://letitbeautism.blogspot.com/2008/03/my-first-installement.html", "title": "\nMy first installement\n"}
