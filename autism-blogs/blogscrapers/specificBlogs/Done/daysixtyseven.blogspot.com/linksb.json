When I need to be on the computer, I usually require that the kids stay upstairs until I'm done. My computer sits in a small, open area in the hallway of the second floor of our home and I figure that from here I at least have a  chance  of hearing them get into trouble if they are on the same level. But before I was finished Oliver started down the steps and the following conversation took place: \"Stay upstairs, please.\" \"No,\" he said looking right at me. \"Upstairs, please. I'm almost done.\" \"No.\" \"Oliver. Upstairs, please.\" \"No. I want the blocks.\" This last was said with an impish grin on his face. And soon he was joined by Sami, who shouted out: \"No, Mom!\" while literally raising his fist in the air. He was so delighted by Oliver instigating a bit of anarchy. So what else could I do? I let them go downstairs. It took me a minute to realize what happened. Oliver has always been able to say \"No.\" But this time was much different. He wasn't upset. I wasn't asking a yes/no question. He was asserting himself -- standing up to me -- in a calm way that was so very different from the \"No, no, no, no, no\" way that usually happens when I'm trying to get him to do something that he doesn't want to do. There has been lots of language lately. Most of it has been instrumental -- Oliver expressing his wants and desires (I want to go inside. I want to go outside. I want to go down the slide. I want to run. I want in the bathtub) but I can't help but feel that little by little the doors to communication are opening. And in the meantime, what household can't benefit from a bit of anarchy now and then?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/04/no.html", "title": "\nNo.\n"},

Because, try as I might to not get overly optimistic about each new little thing, I just can't help it.

It is all about different kinds of vehicles. \"Book!\" he said emphatically. Then,  when I turned my back and tried to ignore him: \"Read the book!\" Then over and over again until I had to hang up the phone and comply. So picture this: the two of us on the couch looking at a mostly picture book --me, pointing and naming vehicles with lots of pauses in between -- Oliver repeating every word after me and then taking my finger to various pictures and asking: \"What's this?\" What's this?!! Isn't that a WH question? MY boy? Asking Wh- questions?? Is this some kind of dream?

{"date": "October 02, 2007", "body": "\nHmmm. There's lots of stuff going on in my life just now -- some of it so dreary I'd rather not think about it -- but plenty of it good and worthy of comment. And yet, I can't seem to rub two words together to make a sentence happen. So, as much as I hate doing it: a list. On something like it. 1. Nik and I actually had a date. Well, sort of. The occasion: our wedding anniversary. We dropped the little ones off at a friends house at 5:20, arrived at the restaurant at 5:45, sat in the bar and had a glass of wine for 15 minutes and then moved to a table for our meal. At 7pm we asked for the check then race-walked home to pick up the car and RT who was waiting impatiently to be taken to the football game and loudly complained that he was now going to be late and had tried to call us 5 times to hurry us along. By 7:45 we had the little ones back in the car and were headed home and I said to Nik: \"You know that kind of nice alcohol buzz that you get from drinking a bit of wine? Well, I don't really enjoy it anymore. It makes me feel a bit impatient with myself.\" All residents of the house, save the teenager, were soundly asleep by 9:30.  2. A few years ago when we first tried to teach Oliver to pedal a bike I thought I had encountered the zenith of frustrating experiences. Now I know that he WAS working hard. But the hard work of trying to get his legs and feet to move in a coordinated fashion as dictated by his brain was mostly invisible to those looking on. To us it looked like he was just sitting there. I also now understand that teaching a child to pedal is nowhere near as frustrating and downright frightening as teaching him to BRAKE! I also now understand that neither Nik or I are as fast as we would like to think we are and that a 50lb boy on a bike can gather quite some speed on the slightest of inclines. And I understand that this whole experience is exhilarating enough that a 5 year old boy would want to repeat it again and again.   3. Understanding Oliver and how his autism affects him is like peeling the layers from an onion. I think I have something figured out and then I peel another layer back to reveal something even more basic and fundamental to his experience. To his  personhood . For instance: I knew that Oliver's speech problems weren't just to do with the actual production of sound. Or his understanding of the meaning of words. I knew that it had to do with communication. Oliver does not understand the nature of communication. He cannot answer yes/no questions. He has been responding out of habit all along. If someone says something to him that sounds like a question he will say \"yes\". He has no concept of answering \"no\". Imagine how powerless that must leave a person feeling. But we're working on it.  4. I joined a book club. The first book, the one we are meeting tonight to discuss, was the Kite Runner. What a beautifully written book. Too bad I'm only on about page 45. I tried. I really did. The book is great and I want to read it, I do, but I didn't have time and now I feel like I did in graduate school when I never had time to do all the readings before class. I knew this would happen but I so want to believe that my life is different than it actually is.  5. I will take my boys in the dirt today. We will plant 100 daffodil bulbs. And then we'll have a picnic on the front porch with our special juice and waffles in the shape of barn yard animals and smothered with peanut butter and jam.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/10/totally-random.html", "title": "\nTotally Random\n"},
{"date": "April 20, 2008", "body": "\nI'm not sure but I think Oliver told me a lie today! We didn't have a very good night of sleep last night so by 2pm  Nik  and  Sami  were both napping in the boy's bedroom. I took Oliver in our bed to read to him a bit in hopes that he would soon fall asleep as well. After a few pages he turned to me and said: \"I want potty.\" \"OK,\" I told him, \"go and then come right back.\" But he didn't even pretend to go to the bathroom. Instead he went to the toy bin in the hallway. So I called him back. Then, a few minutes later he tried it again: \"I want potty.\" Curious now, I said the same thing -- go and come right back. And for the second time Oliver used the opportunity to make a grab for the blocks that were stacked in the corner of my room instead of actually heading in the direction of the bathroom. I was pretty amused at both his lie, his following lack of pretense, and my own secret thrill that my little sunshine boy Oliver was USING WORDS to LIE to me!!! I'm trying very hard not to be overly optimistic about Oliver's sudden willingness to try and use words to communicate. There are still plenty of times when words fail us. For instance, there are still lots of times when I ask: \"What do you want?\" and he replies: \"Want. Yes.\"  But yesterday, after we went to the track he told  Nik : \"That was fun!\" And when I asked him how his food was he surprised me by replying that it was good. He has also been very assertive when reclaiming things that his little stinker bother has taken from him: \"That's my cookie!\" or \"That's my toy!\" He has even started to make a little joke by asking for his brother, RT, every time we get into the car. \"He's in school,\" I tell him. Then he asks again and again, laughing like it is the funniest joke ever. I still really wish I knew how to help him understand language more easily. There are times when I am trying to communicate something to him, even something very simple, and no matter how I try I cannot help him to understand. But there are an equal number of times these days when I am surprised and thrilled by just how much he DOES understand. I fell into a several-day funk last week over an instance where I just couldn't make Oliver understand something. He had two items and I wanted him to bring them both to me. He kept putting one down and picking the other one up. Poor guy. He was really working hard to understand me and I was getting more and more agitated. It is hard sometimes for me to remember to celebrate what Oliver is ABLE to do rather than focus so much on what he can't. Luckily though, when I get down  Nik  is usually able to knock some sense in to me and then it isn't all that hard to appreciate just how amazing our little liar really is!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/04/sweet-little-lies.html", "title": "\nSweet little lies\n"},

{"date": "August 14, 2008", "body": "\nOne of the most incredibly wonderful things about Switzerland is the Ludotech (I hope I spelled that right), or toy lending library. Virtually every town has a Ludotech and for a small yearly membership fee you can borrow toys for your kids much like you would books at a library. Imagine how thrilled I was when we discovered that our local toy library had a small assortment of  gliding bikes .  I had seen these in action during our last trip to Switzerland two years ago and was amazed that even young toddlers seemed to get the hang of balancing on two wheels when they started out without the trouble of peddles. I don't know why they aren't popular in the US but I've never seen one here. Oliver took to the thing immediately and within seconds he had figured out how to maneuver the it quite gracefully by running while astride. Within the first hour he was gliding short distances and after that we could barely get him off the thing. Here is a short video clip that was taken on the first day -- check out the smile on that boy's face!! \n \n \n \n \n When we got home I was anxious to see if success on the gliding bike would translate to success on a two-wheeler with peddles. So on Tuesday I removed the training wheels from his bike and handed him over to Nik -- I'm far too nervous to be the primary parent on this one. But I didn't have to worry: without a moment of hesitation, Oliver hopped on the bike, feet to peddles and took off.  So now we have balance, we have propulsion, we have steering -- but what we don't have is stopping. But we're working on it. And until then, our bicycling adventures are confined to the track with all of its soft, cushy grass on each side. But boy, the ease of this particular learning adventure feels like a small gift from heaven!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.puky.de/homepage/produkte/laufraeder/index.htm", "rtsp://v6.cache2.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQkxo7pEn6begBMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/08/one-of-most-incredibly-wonderful-things.html", "title": "\nBalance is a very good thing\n"},
{"date": "August 15, 2008", "body": "\nWhy are we always in such a rush? This is a question I ask myself all the time.  Why does a minute feel like forever when you are waiting for someone to make up his mind? And especially with Oliver, I wonder, why am I always in such a rush to help him? I've learned to slow things waaay, waaay down for Oliver's sake, and still, I have a long way to go. I'm impatient, I'll tell you that. But I'm also in the habit of underestimating my son. I jump in to \"help him out\" far too often. What I know to be true is this: when Oliver understands what is being said, he is very likely to do exactly what you tell him. Put your shoes on. Put your plate there. Get dressed. Clean up. Get in the car. Problem solving and making inferences, however, are hard for my boy. So helping Oliver to figure out what to do is where I put most of my efforts during the day. I don't tell him what to do but rather focus on giving him the information he needs to make a decision and take action. For me the work is in the waiting; for Oliver, the work is in the processing. I think both of us are equally challenged. It's hard, I tell you! Today, for example, we went to visit my mother who is recovering from surgery. When it was time to leave I said to Oliver: \"You're the only one not wearing shoes!\" Then we waited. After he put on his shoes and we walked to the car I opened the door and got Sami buckled into his seat. Oliver was dancing around the sidewalk next to the car as my Mom stood in the doorway watching. It is her habit to stand at the door and wave as we drive off. But Oliver didn't show any signs of getting in the car so I went 'round to the driver's side, got in and started the car. When the car started Oliver jumped in and got in his chair but made no move to close the door or put on his seatbelt. So I waited. And then I said, \"I guess I'd better buckle up so we can go.\" Oliver took the hint, reached over, closed his door then fastened his seat belt.  Then I mentioned that it was really hot inside the car but that the air outside was cool from the rain we'd just had. \"I wonder if we could let some cool air inside?\" I asked. And then I waited. And I waited some more. Oliver wasn't getting it so I hinted: \"Maybe it is so hot in here because all of the windows are closed.\" Then I waited some more. Not a long time, mind you -- seconds,  really. I was watching the clock and felt the impatience rising and yet not even a minute had ticked by. And then? Oliver opened his window, I mentioned how good the fresh air felt, put it in gear and off we drove. When I got home the phone was ringing and I rushed in to get it. On the other end was my mother wanting to know if something was wrong. \"You took so long pulling out!\" I thought back over the scenario and wondered how long it all took. Five minutes? Seven minutes? Surely not ten minutes. And yet, it made both of us -- my mother and I -- so  uncomfortable.  Funny, isn't it? I remember back to the early days when I was in such a rush to get Oliver everything he needed -- so many hours of this and that. I wish someone would have told me then the value of seven minutes spent patiently waiting.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/08/time-it-takes.html", "title": "\nThe Time it Takes\n"},

Can you believe, in fact, that I could check my e-mail just twice in 26 days?  The place where my husband grew up was given the honorary title of \"City\" because of its historical relevance, not its size. Last year the little \"City\" celebrated its 800th year. No, that's not a typo -- Eight Hundred years! So I guess the 1800 citizens think \"So what if we don't have an internet cafe!\" And who am I to argue? Oliver was a superstar on this trip. For the first time, he began getting my attention and showing me what he found interesting and making sure I saw him doing things that made him proud. The first time it happened, when I let myself be led to the rain barrel and his hand pulled my neck down close to the water's surface so that I could see our reflection, it took me a moment to take in the enormity of what had just happened and my heart nearly burst. He also started routinely calling out my name to get my attention to ask for the things he wanted. He also learned to ride a two wheel bike without training wheels. He was a tireless hiker, an enthusiastic adventurer, a singer, a swimmer, and a good sleeper. It was all so wonderful, in fact, that for the last week of our vacation I began every conversation with Nik by saying: \"If we moved to Switzerland. ...\"  I know, it would be different if we lived there, but the last three and a half weeks were like magic for me. I feel renewed and you can't blame a gal for wanting to hold onto that. Nik and I also took Tango lessons!!! We were miserably awful. Truly. We were the only couple to keep colliding with other pairs on the dance floor. It was like bumper cars. But it was fun and I haven't laughed so hard in ages. We went out walking nearly every evening, usually ending in some small restaurant for a glass of wine and lovely conversation that didn't have anything to do with kids or autism!!! And nearly everyday we managed to steal away for a bike ride along the Rhine, just the two of us. It wasn't ALL good, of course. Try as I might, I just could not resist all the chocolate and cakes that were passed my way. By about day ten, I abandoned any notion of resisting at all and gave in completely. Also, Sami became possessed by some evil spirit that must have been lurking around one of those castles we visited. Or maybe that's just what happens when a kid eats his weight in chocolate, ice cream and cake every day. His behavior was mostly atrocious. (Although everyone agreed that he was cute enough to get away with it. I'm sure they said other things but that's what was mostly translated to me. His mother.) On one particularly bad evening, I pulled him aside and hissed at him that he had better shape up and he actually said to me: \"I don't have to listen to you because you smell bad. You're a pig. I'm going to push you down in the pig hole.\"  Those were his exact words. I know it because they are forever etched in my mind. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. I mean: Where did he learn to say things like that? We don't have a TV so he didn't pick it up that way and I'm usually with him when he plays with friends and I've never heard  any other mother's child  talk that way. Well, not to end on a sour note, I will leave you with a few photos -- with more to come as I digest and download: Oliver getting comfortable at the airport before we boarded the plane. Rooftops of the old city. Taken from the remains of the last castle tower left standing. That's the Rhine river there and Germany on the other side. The view from the top of the castle.

Take a walk in the countryside or relax on my mother-in-law's porch at dusk and the only sound you hear is the distant melody created by their movement. I find it charming but I understand that city folk, upon moving to the country, often complain about the background music. I don't know why, but for some reason the sounds of a place always stick with me as much as the visuals and the people I meet, and when I think of Switzerland the sound of cow bells in the early evening always comes to mind. We had just one chance to get to the  mountains  on this trip and unfortunately the day was quite cloudy up on the mountain -- although brilliantly sunny below. We went all the way to the top anyway because the getting there is so much fun. We took an inclined train (actually, the world's steepest funicular railway) to the half-way point and then a cable car to the very top. The kids were in heaven and so was I. Walking around on the top of a very tall mountain (This one was about 1922 meters -- small by Swiss standards) surrounded by clouds and beautiful alpine flowers is quite remarkable. Occasionally the clouds would skirt around the sun giving us a breathtaking view of the world below and those glimpses of Lake Lucerne below and the distant peaks of snow covered mountains were like little treasures. On this particular trip, as we skirted around the top of the mountain looking for the trail to the town below, I took a video of sound.

{"date": "August 14, 2008", "body": "\nI'm not sure who came up with the original refrigerator mother theory -- the idea that autism was caused by unloving mothers -- but according to Wikipedia, Bettelheim was instrumental in the widespread acceptance of the idea. Now, so many years later, we all scoff and are indignant at the idea. Especially us mothers. But am I the only one who looks around and wonders how we got to the other extreme end? No, our inability to love our children didn't cause them to become autistic, but maybe, just maybe, if we have the right extraordinary combination of love, diligence and resources, we can \"recover\" our children. And by we, I mostly mean mothers (although I know there are lots of dads out there, too).  Since we began this journey three years ago, I can't tell you how many books and articles that have been given to me, the well-meaning presenter telling me how inspiring I might find it. Invariably the story involves supermom and a child that makes great progress. Am I the only one who feels the sickening weight of this pressure? Am I the only one who wonders if I couldn't be doing more and loving better?  Every single day ? It's not healthy, I tell you. I'm just musing about this tonight. We're coming off of the vacation high -- a vacation where I spent a great deal of time focusing on the R of RDI (Relationship Development Intervention), a vacation where Oliver made some very important discoveries. RDI is where we hang our hat in this house, of course, and it is all about helping parents to help their kids make these discoveries. So yes, I really do believe that parents are an integral part of how kids learn. Especially so for kids on the spectrum. But you know? I don't take the credit for the discoveries that Oliver makes or for all the hard work that goes into the learning that he does everyday. I help him out as best as I can but really, all the credit goes to him. It is his brain making those connections, after all. It's all him. So why, then, do I feel the need to beat myself up during the in-between periods when the learning and growth isn't so obvious? So I'm just curious: on one end we have Bettelheim and on the other Supermom. ...

{"date": "August 18, 2008", "body": "\nLast year about this time, Oliver stopped receiving services through the school district and my sentiment was: good riddance. I remember very clearly when and where the battle lines were drawn in that particular fight and also the lesson it taught me about going with my gut. At issue was something commonly used as an aid for kids on the spectrum -- the visual schedule. Every day, a large part of the work that the in-home therapists did with Oliver revolved around getting him to use the (*%^&^!) visual schedule. Oliver, for his part, couldn't. Or wouldn't. That was the debate. Time after time I looked on as the therapists had to use full physical prompts to get Oliver to correctly use the schedule. It was awful and I regret to this day allowing it to happen in my very own home. Because, as I would say to anyone who would listen, Oliver never really had a problem with transitions so it seemed like a totally unnecessary compensation. Besides, I remember saying to our lead therapist, maybe he just doesn't WANT to do it and was simply being stubborn like any other four year old boy might if you asked them to repeatedly do something that is pretty much meaningless. That's when the therapist infamously told me: \"There is  nothing  normal about your son. Any other four year old would have complied by now.\" Naturally, this is when I knew it was over between us. (It is also when I refused to allow any professional to use the word compliance in relation to my son. I don't want my kid to comply, I want him to cooperate!!) But I also remember that she went on to say that the schedule was also about sequencing and knowing what to expect. ... some people make lists, others have planners, kids with autism benefit from visual schedules, blah, blah, blah. But, um, hey: four year olds don't make lists. Or use day planners. And my kid doesn't have a problem transitioning. I mean, yeah, he insists on putting the last piece of the puzzle in before moving on, but that's about it. Also: why can't we talk about teaching Oliver how to pick up cues from the environment so that he can figure out what is going to happen by watching what every one else is doing? Huh? Why can't we talk about that? Because that's what I'm really interested in. Let's teach him the actual skills that he needs to be successful rather than the compensations. Huh? How about that? So, the school district sided with the therapist and I sided with Oliver and we all called it quits. I wish it had happened much sooner than it did but it took me awhile to grow a backbone. Anyway, fast forward a year and let me tell you I never look back. Oliver takes his cues from the environment. He understands what is going on  as the day unfolds .  I don't prepare him more or less than I do Sami. We go on adventures -- some planned, some unplanned. Sometimes we change plans and sometimes our plans don't work out and all that is OK, too. Because that's the way life is. Oliver gets that. Today, for example, we went to Grandma's house. There is no place and no thing on this great earth that makes Oliver more happy than to spend time at Grandma's house. Trouble was, she wasn't home. We knocked on the door. We waited a couple of minutes and I braced for some tears as I said: \"Guess she isn't here. We'll have to come back.\" \"Come back,\" he replied. Then to my astonishment he turned and walked back to the car. So, to that therapist I'd like to say: Put THAT on your schedule!

{"date": "September 28, 2008", "body": "\nOur days are getting better. Whew! It was rough there for a few. It was a visceral reminder of the days when life felt so  limited . Of a time when my first thoughts were always of the accommodations that we needed to make when we went anywhere or did anything. Of a time when it felt safer to just stay home. And of a time when I felt utterly incompetent. In fact, part of what made this past week so emotionally draining is that we had come to place where those days seemed so far behind, so over. What a smack in the face to find ourselves right back there. I don't believe in regressions. I believe that all behavior (good and bad) and growth is the result of what is going on in a child's environment. My desk sits in a lovely corner of our hallway, framed on two sides by large windows. On one window I have written a quote (I'll have to look for the author and put it in a  ps ) that I read daily. It says: \"The way that adults interact with children is the greatest influence on the development of neural relationships in the brain because they directly influence how the child learns to think about and perceive the world.\" Quite a weighty responsibility, no? So when Oliver finds himself so completely overwhelmed by life -- as he obviously has been -- I turn the lens on myself. Am I helping him to grow and learn or am I challenging him unproductively? When we first started  RDI  I remember that I couldn't get Oliver to participate in anything with me. Not even for a minute. If you let go of him he took off. That's when a good friend said to me: just focus on building it up second by second. So that's what we did. And it didn't take long. Ten seconds, then 15, then 30, then a minute, and within a few weeks we had ten or fifteen minutes, sometimes longer. Over the past year or so I stopped keeping track of how long our activities were. There was a satisfying beginning, middle and end, and that's all that really mattered. For the first time in a long while we had achieved symbiosis. This past week has been hard and it caused me to think a great deal about what I might do to help both of us from feeling so angry and frustrated with each other -- because yes, it goes both ways. After a couple of especially difficult moments I realized that I wasn't reading Oliver's cues. I wasn't stopping before he got upset and angry and frustrated  because I expected him to perform at a certain level . I expected that he would face new challenges the same way he had been facing other challenges. He put up with it for a couple of days. And then? Mutiny. So what did I do? I went back to the beginning. I invited Oliver to participate with me for the briefest moments and then let him go off to the sand box or the play  doh  (although we have gotten rid of the TV for good). My only goal was to say \"here, let's do this thing together for one second and we'll both feel good about it.\" The first day was impossible. Every invitation was met with screaming and  aggression . The second day was better. And now I feel like we are almost back to normal. Today we made puzzles and block towers, peeled apples, made dinner. ... all of it  punctuated  with only a few  moments . But each of those moments were bracketed with laughter so it all evened out a bit. Along the way something very interesting happened. Oliver started reaching out to me in a way that he never has before. He started bringing me to what he was doing, inviting me in to his sphere. He brought me to the new  leggo  bin (a huge treasure trove of old  leggos  amassed by RT when he was younger and recently rescued from the attic) and said: \"I want play.\", meaning \"I want you to play with me.\"  Are we out of the woods? Not entirely. I'll be sure when I get my  smiley  boy back. But I have a hypothesis and a strategy (or is that a tactic?) and at least two willing participants.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/09/still-spinning.html", "title": "\nStill Spinning\n"},

We will have him for the next 20 years but you will have him for the rest of your lives. We want to make sure he is a success.\" That was how the Director of Special Education Services for our city concluded the IEP meeting yesterday after approving my request for additional hours of in-home therapy for Oliver. \"You made an educated, informed request and I want to validate everything you said. We are here to support the parents. At this point money is not an object.\" That was what she said after I made my presentation and it was discussed around the table. I know that a lot of parents have had a different experience with the IEP process and so I feel incredibly fortunate. I went to sleep at peace last night. Also, for those other autism bloggers out there, if you haven't watched  this video  (which I found courtesy of Autism Diva's site) you may find it interesting. I don't hold out much hope for getting the rest of the world to want to see things through Oliver's eyes but this reminded me of my own obligation to do so. In my struggle to make sure he is getting everything he needs I tend to forget how important this is.

{"date": "October 28, 2005", "body": "\nToday was a two therapist day. Actually, two therapists and one in-training. Jennifer, the newest member of Team Oliver, came to observe the first two hours of the morning session. Lindsey, the therapist on duty-- and the person who has been working with Oliver the longest -- gave her lots of helpful hints: what kind of things he likes, how to motivate him, things to watch for; etc. I took some mental notes myself. Shortly after Oliver was diagnosed I was reminded to always remember that I am the expert on Oliver. That has been good advice sometimes but there is no doubt that I have learned a great deal about Oliver by listening, watching, and talking with his therapists. Last Friday when Oliver had an absolute melt-down brought on by unexpected visitors I looked to Lindsey for advice about how to help him cope. She was right on the money when she suggested that a video might help him focus and calm down. With visitors in the house and my aversion to TV it was probably the last thing I would have tried. But it worked like a charm and I was glad he could find some peace. It is times like this when I see how valuable the in-home program is for us as a family because the truth is, I don't always understand my boy and it helps to have fresh insights and creativity. To break up a long day of therapy I try to have small, fun activites built into the day. Since Halloween is approaching I hauled the big pumpkin in from the porch and got Oliver to help me carve it and light the candle I had put inside. He was delighted but mostly interested in taking off the lid and putting it back on again like a giant puzzle piece. He also had trouble understanding that the candle, which was roughly muffin shaped, was not actually a cake. Prior to this the only time he had seen a candle was when it sat upon a birthday cake so he was a bit disappointed that this activity didn't involve any eating! By the time the therapists had come and gone Oliver and I were both exhausted and in need of some fresh air. He has developed a new love for riding in the car -- I know this because he will often bring me my shoes and lead me to the door saying \"car.\" So, to indulge his desire for a ride and need for fresh air Nik took him along to a soccer game with a tupperware dinner of cucumbers, raisins and roasted chicken. He came home with cheeks blushed red with the October air and with the good kind of tired that comes from playing outdoors. Before bed Oliver was entertained by older brother and his friends who were gearing up to go to a corn maze. They had a scary mask that would have frightened Oliver a year ago but now gave him a thrill. After they tired of chasing him around the downstairs with the mask on Oliver kept retrieving it and handing it to his brother, not wanting the fun to end. He even jumped up one kid's lap (whom he had never met before!) and peered into they eyes of the mask giggling the whole time. It made me smile to see him interact with the big kids that way. Afterwards he fell into an easy sleep and I took the time to sit by his bed, admire him, and be thankful for another Friday at home with my boy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/tgif.html", "title": "\nTGIF\n"},
{"date": "October 03, 2005", "body": "\nToday is day sixty seven. Sixty seven days since Oliver has had autism. He has had it longer than that, of course, but its been sixty seven days since we sat in that room full of strangers  whose attention was mostly taken up with the sheaths of paper in front of them. Strangers who suddenly had  information  about our son. Important information. They told us what they thought and we left and drove home without many words between us. So it has been sixty seven days of waking each morning to that thunderously heavy word: Autism. In the beginning I couldn't say it. It was a betrayal to even think it. My son was perfect. He was brilliant. His first word, even before ball, was squirrel. But it has been a long time since I've heard him say squirrel and sixty seven days since I learned to say Autism. Autism is a scary word, really. It's one of those words that makes you thankful that your kid is healthy and that its someone else's child that you're talking about. We didn't even know what Autism was. Autistic kids sit in the corner and rock, right? The first time someone suggested that Oliver might be autistic I immediately ran to the computer to read up on the subject even though I was sure she was crazy. Obsessive-compulsive behaviors, frequent tantrums, language delays, inability to pay attention. Whew, well, that wasn't Oliver. Sure, he had some of those behaviors but what two and a half year old doesn't? But then several evaluations later and a room full of people reading aloud from reports and yes, even I have to see: Oliver has Autism. Sixty seven days after Autism and we've learned some things about our son. No, he isn't just being stubborn. He isn't just ignoring us. No, he doesn't have a discipline problem. His lack of development isn't because we do everything for him. And No, he won't suddenly start talking at the age of four like Einstein supposedly did. But there are other things that sixty seven days won't yeild up. Sixty seven days of Autism isn't enough to tell us what his future holds. Sixty seven days won't even tell us the plot. And so we are filled with questions and fear but also with optimism and most of all with hope. That last is a conscious decision and a sustained effort. We are lucky enough to have access to a lot of skilled professionals who are helping us find our way with Oliver. He has pre-school for socialization,  and then there is the speech therapy, occupational therapy, sensory integration therapy, applied behavior analysis therapy with some floortime thrown in. He is learning to communicate using the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and his days are tracked using a visual schedule so he knows what to expect. At one time Nik and I used to congratulate ourselves that we weren't tied up in a lifestyle of shuttling children between engagements like so many of our friends. So it is ironic that our life is so scheduled at the moment  that I have to consult my calendar to schedule a coffee date. But sixty seven days have passed. And sixty seven more will pass exponentially. And Oliver will still have autism. But the part that we still congratulate ourselves on before closing our eyes at night is that Oliver is the same wonderful, amazing, perfect, brilliant little boy that he was sixty eight days ago.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P10101601.JPG", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P1010160.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P10101602.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/learning-to-say-autism.html", "title": "\nLearning to Say Autism\n"},
{"date": "March 12, 2006", "body": "\nOliver is under the weather. I noticed it first when he climbed into bed next to me in the early morning. He wouldn't tolerate the thermometer for long but the digital readout already displayed 99.7 when I could no longer hold it in place. After some tylenol and a leisurely breakfast we chanced a short excursion to the arboretum for our Sunday walk and then returned when Oliver said \"take a nap.\" I can't remember the last time Oliver voluntarily took a nap and so when he woke two hours later we lounged together on the couch watching Elmo. He was in fine spirits but unusually sedate. After my last entry in which I confessed to feeling pretty lousy over the past week I find myself today feeling pretty good. Yes, it was 70 beautiful degrees today and yes, Nik did come home finally from his trip to California but I was startled to realize that there is another reason for the shift: Today, I was needed. Oliver, of course, needs me everyday -- but today was different. I was the classic mom in action, today. I soothed and stroked him. I murmered softly. I kissed warm forehead, nose, and hands. I gave \"magic pills\" for fever and let him sip my tea. I made sure he drank plenty of water, drew him a warm bath and watched over him while he slept. All this is in sharp contrast to how I was feeling a day ago, a week ago, when I started to notice old behaviors resurfacing.  I believe that many of these behaviors are Oliver's way of reacting to stress, frustration, anxiety, anger and even boredom. But too often I am slow at making the connection. And sometimes I never make it at all and am left to draw from my big bad of mom tricks feeling entirely inadequate. If only a little fever were the only test. Sometimes I catch myself thinking that if only Oliver could  tell  me if he were hungry, tired, cold, hurt, bored, etc. then my job would be a lot easier. But I know that's not really true --  he  is  communicating with me if I really pay attention. Language isn't all it's cracked up to be: after all, how many times do I expect others to know what I am thinking by how I am acting or the look on my face. Oliver didn't tell me what he needed today in so many words but by curling up in my lap and pulling the blanket up to his chin he let me know loud and clear. So maybe the trick isn't so much knowing how to mother, but knowing how to listen.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/03/under-weather.html", "title": "\nUnder the Weather\n"},

I'm sick to death of this internal conflict of mine so why belabor it here? Because the fact is that autism is a part of our lives and so I might as well get on with the accepting. I know for certain that Oliver and I are the only casualties of my little war and that scares me 100 times more than the unknowns of autism. Thankfully, I have the wisdom of my fellow travellers to read that so often helps me find the way. Messages like  this one  and  this one  inspire me everyday to make my peace. They remind me of what it takes to win the war. So instead of what I was going to write I'll share a few highlights from the past few days: Oliver crawled in bed next to me on Sunday morning and said: \"ABCDEFG\" just like that. Then later when I was counting his fingers to make sure that they were all there after the long night of sleep, I got to five and he continued: \"six, seven, eight, nine.\" All ten fingers were actually there but my guess is that he wanted to leave a bit of dramatic tension in the air. He's got quite a sense of humor, my boy. Also, yesterday, there were no clean pants for my boy to wear, as we hadn't finished the laundry yet, and so he spent most of the day running around the house in his underwear. Mid-afternoon I saw him dragging the bin of dirty clothes to the playroom but thought little of it -- Oliver likes to dump things and it seemed a harmless way for him to occupy himself as I cooked dinner. About 10 minutes later he came walking into the kitchen wearing RT's (Resident Teenager's) sweatpants. He was struggling to hold up the waist while attempting to walk without tripping on the too long legs. It was the first time he independantly found an article of clothing and put it on. He looked so delicious standing there that I wanted to eat him. We had a good 4 day run of no toileting accidents. We've spent a LOT of time in the bathroom since November and it's been a long road.

Just when I thought I had a handle on things I'm back to crying just about everyday. I'm back to feeling that it all seems too terribly hard and I'm sure I'm just not up to it. There are so many times when I think to myself that Oliver deserves a better mother and I can't even begin to listen to my own exhortations to then just BE a better mother. Normally, you see, I can talk myself out of these things. Or write myself out of it. But these days, to use Oliver-speak, I seem to be  stuck . Oliver is his usual wonderful self but has been a bundle of behaviors lately. Is it the changing of the seasons? The fact that his Poppi has been out of town on a business trip? Is he responding to his mother's out-of-whack emotions? Or is it something else that I haven't yet identified? (Will there ever be a time when I feel like I know what I'm doing??) At any rate, some of Oliver's more difficult to deal with behaviors had all but disappeared over the last several months and now seem to be reappearing. It feels like two steps forward and one step back. I guess I am in strong need of spring. I need to see things blossom and grow. I need to feel that the long hard work of winter is over and to be reminded that life is full of cycles that must be completed in order for there to be change and growth. So, c'mon Mother Nature!

{"date": "February 01, 2006", "body": "\nParenting is harder, and requires more personal endurance than any other contact sport I know of. I'm sure of it. I don't mean hard in the manner of sustaining the body blow I received two days ago when I routinely emptied Oliver's backpack, eager to read what was written in the communication log so I could know a little bit more about how my guy spent his day only to find instead his first \"progress report\". The progress report, covered with a cheery little note from his teacher, listed each of the goals in his IEP followed by a code, \"ES\", describing his progress mid-way through the year. I scanned the page eagerly for the key to tell me what ES meant. ES, it turns out means \"Emerging Skill\", and that furthermore it is unlikely that he will meet this goal in the current school year. I sat down limply on the floor feeling as though the wind had been knocked right out of me. Later, after Nik had extended his hand to mine helping me off the floor and after I had gotten the kids in bed, I marveled to myself that I could keep breathing at all when everything inside felt so damaged and broken up. But having kids to parent isn't for those without emotional stamina. So we DO keep on breathing, and smiling, and laughing. At first it is just for their sake, but then pretty soon the breathing and smiling and laughing take over and you get so caught up in playing the airplane game -- you know, the one where you lie on your back, balancing your child on your feet high above you and then, on the count of three, eject him into the air so that he lands, bouncing on the bed, giddy and red-faced with laughter -- that you aren't that terrible mess who wanted to just sob into her shoes two hours earlier. In fact, you become that other mother who knows that all the wonderful achievements your child has made in the past few months can't be measured by some shitty piece of paper. No, when I say that Parenting is a contact sport I mean that in the most physical way. This thought occurred to me yesterday when I again found myself wrestling with a surprisingly strong 10-month old in some vain hope of getting the diaper on straight and secured tightly enough so that it won't fall off 5 mintues later. Satisfied that I had done a reasonable job I watched him crawl away in the vague direction of the one electrical outlet in the house that remains uncovered as I calculated how many more seconds I could sit and rest before having to grab him. During this 3-second lull, Oliver, who has taken a fancy to climbing up on the coffee table and launching himself on me with the complete trust that I will catch him,  whether I am looking at him or not,  does just that. 40lbs of boy hit me from the side, hurtling me to the ground which luckily enables me to grab Sammy's ankle and drag him backwards just as his little wet fingers are zeroing in on that ever-so-enchanting electrical socket. And that is just a five minute snap-shot of the game. It goes on and on and on. I haven't completely figured out the rules yet. I keep asking the two little guys but all they've told me is that we haven't even reached half-time yet.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/02/parenting-is-contact-sport.html", "title": "\nParenting Is A Contact Sport\n"},
{"date": "May 04, 2006", "body": "\nWe have had a very different experience with our school district than many other parents of children with autism. The director of special education has been a great advocate, right from the start, of making sure that Oliver gets what he needs. She really believes in early intervention and she really believes in the IEP process. And, more importantly, she listens to what I have to say about Oliver and what the autism professionals have to say about the needs of autistic kids. The school district has engaged the services of a regional service provider to work with the kids in our area. Oliver was the first child to receive these services, starting late last September. Now, I've heard, there are 6 or 7 others, all of whom were diagnosed after Oliver. Initially, Oliver was enrolled in the peer-model pre-school three mornings a week and was assigned an aide. He was also given 15 hours of in-home therapy. Later, at my request, that was increased to 21 hours, totalling 30 hours of programming altogether. And we've been cruising along like this, fairly happy, since September. But then the director of special ed. approached the autism coordinator and asked her to assess the programming. And Mary, the shining, wonderful, star that she is, told her that it was OK. But that it could be better. It could be better? Yes. It would be better if Oliver didn't have to go to the pre-school where he has to fit into whatever they have planned whether it is appropriate for him or not. There are too many lost teaching opportunities each day, she told the director. And it would be better if Oliver had social times that were engineered  specifically   for him  rather than seizing whatever opportunities  happened  to come up throughout the day.  OK she said. Whatever Oliver and these other children need. Let's do it. So, one by one, each of the children in our district with autism have been pulled out of the classroom by their parents. More of their needs are being met on an individual level in the home environment. And special arrangements are being made for each child to get appropriate socialization experiences within the community. The school district is working on building relationships with the local children's museum, the library, the community recreation center and local community pre-schools. Last week Oliver said good-bye to his teacher and his classroom. I suspect that he wasn't bothered by it a bit, although I do think that he will miss his 5 minute bus commute each morning. Martha and Lindsey, his classroom aides, have instead greeted him at our front door each morning this week and he has responded with a wry smile and a look in his eyes that clearly said: \"What are you doing  here ?\" And a quick review of his data sheets at the end of two days showed that he had two of his best days ever. When I got home yesterday Oliver was sitting on the couch with Lindsey singing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, each word clear as a bell. And later last evening I took him with me to the supermarket to get some ice cream and there he was, standing up in our cart at the register belting out the words to the song, in his outside voice no less, and strangers turned around to look at him and smile. You couldn't have measured my happiness. Could things be even better? Probably. As Mary tells me: Oliver is always growing and changing and so are his needs. But it sure is nice to know that we have the right people on our team along the way.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/05/home-team.html", "title": "\nThe Home Team\n"},

Sammy started walking at nine months and one week of age!  When he was 18 months  old, Oliver could name all of his body parts in both English and German! My boys never cease to amaze me and I can't tell them often enough how proud they make me. But sometimes I feel uneasy when I relate some achievement of Oliver's to my friends. Like when Oliver  rode his tricycle  after months and months of effort. Or when he actually engages his younger brother by looking him fully in the face for even just a minute. Or when he sings Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. Or, like last night when, upon request, he told his father \"It's time to eat!\" for the first time in over a year. These are the  Golden  moments of parenting a child with autism. Like any other mother, I want to share with the people in my life just how amazing I think Oliver is. But it is not lost on me how my golden moments might seem, well, pathetic to some. I can only imagine how I might respond to similar tales if both of my children were neuro-typical and I had no other frame of reference. I imagine that it is hard for people to understand how much work goes into any small achievement for our children with autism. And parents of children with autism know what goes into supporting our children so that they  can  achieve. The logistics. The scheduling. The finances. The emotional strain. The love. The fear. But all of this is within the context of hope. We hope the very best for our children and so would do no less than everything in our power. Every accomplishment then, no matter how small, nourishes the closely-held flame of hope that we carry with us as we make our way day-in and day-out. Other than this blog, I don't share our challenges and triumphs with many. The line between  pity and piety  is not one that I wish to walk and so I mostly share the dirt and the gold of raising a child with autism with the many, wonderful autism professionals in our life. I have often considered what an isolating factor autism has been in our lives, which is especially ironic given the root of the word. These are the thoughts I had after viewing the 13-minute documentary  Autism Every Day  and then reading many of the commentaries that have been written about it, mostly critical in nature. This is a film that shows all of the dirt but none of the gold. Is that wrong? Well maybe. But it is a start. Perhaps it will help people to understand why Oliver sits on the sidewalk in front of our house shrieking when he can't go for a car ride. Perhaps it will help people understand why it is cause for celebration when he  doesn't . And so while I am disappointed in things about the documentary I am interested in seeing where it will take us. There is another tale to be told. Let's hope that the next 13 minutes of film devoted to autism shines like gold. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/02/dirt_and_gold_2.html", "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/05/between-pity-and-piety.html", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/sponsoredevents/autism_every_day.php", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/sponsoredevents/autism_every_day.php"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/05/bragging-rights.html", "title": "\nBragging Rights\n"},

For example, I was frequently asked, \"Does he line objects up?\" and \"Does he like to spin?\" Well, the answer to both of those questions was \"Yes\" but I always qualified my answer by saying that I didn't feel he was doing so inappropriately. Still, when we got the reports, each evaluator wrote that Oliver liked to line things up and spin. So that has always bugged me. Also, the idea that Oliver \"lacks imaginative play\" has also bugged me because let's face it: we don't know what is going on inside his head and who's to say that it isn't imaginative. Anyway, here are some pictures of Oliver at play. The little people wait in a line for the bus, then they all get on the bus until there is just one left. The one little girl is always the last to get on, there are no seats left on the bus, and Oliver spends a good bit of time regarding her, engaging her with Oliver-speak. Is he convincing her to get on the bus anyway? Is she lost? Is she afraid? Is she just non-compliant? But after awhile she too, gets on board. The bus then drives back and forth across the table a dozen times afterwhich everyone disembarks and gets ready for another ride. So that's me, his loving mother, describing Oliver's play activities. And here are the pictures:     \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/05/thats-my-story-and-im-sticking-to-it.html", "title": "\nThat's My Story and I'm Sticking To It!\n"},
{"date": "May 02, 2006", "body": "\nThe patter of little feet roused me again last night at 12:30. I had been sleeping deeply enough that I guessed we were much closer to morning than we were. So I was a bit startled to see the time after lurching down the hall the bathroom where I collected a benedryl tablet and a glass of water to help with Oliver's stuffy nose. He was asleep moments later and I carefully repositioned myself between my two boys only to have Sam make himself even more comfy by propping his feet on my chin. No matter, I was tired and fell back into a deep sleep. 4:30 am, I was awakened again by the sound of Oliver's voice crying out: \"I want in the bathtub!\" over and over again. I did my best to calm him by holding my hands over his ears and singing softly to him but as soon as his sobs subsided it was as if he remembered again what had upset him and he began crying anew. Sammy slept through the whole thing until Oliver's cries built to loud, startling shrieks, at which point I had two crying babes, one on each side of me. Eventually, Nik got up with Sam and I stayed in bed with Oliver where he finally managed to drift off into sleep, and where he happily remained when I left home at 7:45. There are three phrases that Oliver uses to tell us that something is just not right with him; that something is causing him enough anxiety that he wakes up sobbing in the middle of the night, unable to be calmed. \"I want in the bathtub,\" \"I want T.V.,\" and \"I want in the car.\" The first two are activities that have, in the past, been difficult for Oliver to transition from. The end of bathtime, in particular, used to be the cause of almost nightly tantrums. The last activity: car rides, have lately served to soothe Oliver when he has trouble focusing. When I absolutely can't think of another thing to do I load the kids in the car and drive somewhere. But when Oliver wakes up in the middle of the night sobbing that he wants in the bathtub I have to wonder if it isn't a symptom of some larger frustration; of him wanting something but feeling utterly unable to obtain it. I took one last look at Oliver's handsome face resting on my pillow before I left for work this morning. I wondered how he would be when his father woke him and got him dressed for the day. I wondered how he would greet Martha, his in-home ABA therapist, when she arrived at 8:30. I wondered how he would respond to the demands I knew she would put on him throughout the morning. Since I left my full-time job in January my work day lasts just three and a half hours, but wondering how Oliver is doing after such a hard night makes those hours seem a lot longer. I anxiously look at the clock about a dozen times and find an excuse to leave fifteen minutes early. On the drive home I tried to pinpoint anything that might have triggered the upset and came up short. Was it because I had been ill-tempered the day before? Was it because Martha showed up at the house instead of Lindsey that morning? Or was it nothing in particular? The rest of the day went fine. Oliver's morning ABA session went well, although he was unusually sedate. He happily visited with his \"Gram\" when she came to watch him for an hour. He showered her with hugs and kisses and did not melt-down when she left. He requested riding on the swing and climbing the ladder in the back yard, rode his bike around the block and ate a dinner of salmon cakes, green beans and pineapple without prompting or help. Little by little I see that Oliver is growing and maturing in ways that remind me of all his potential. There are set-backs along the way, nights that harken back to the bad ole days of no sleep at all -- when almost EVERY night was punctuated by Oliver screaming for the bathtub -- but two bad nights in a month isn't much to complain about. And maybe it even means that he is mostly getting what he needs; that we are all learning and growing together in the right direction. And maybe nights like that are even helpful, somewhat, because it reminds me to refocus on the big picture (which is suprisingly easy to lose sight of): Who cares if he picks his nose? Who cares if he runs around the perimeter of the room a million times before bed? Who cares if he doesn't play appropriately with his toys? The most important thing is that we find a way to give him the tools he needs so that he won't have to feel so frustrated all the time. And that little lesson, I suppose, is worth losing a night of sleep over every now and then.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/05/bathtub-blues.html", "title": "\nThe Bathtub Blues\n"},
{"date": "November 01, 2005", "body": "\n\"Oliver?\" \"Oliver! Look over here. O-li-ver. ... Oliver!\" \"Oliver, leave the hat on and look over here for one second so I can take your picture and I'll let you eat every single piece of candy in that bucket!\" I didn't worry too much about making good on that last promise because the chances of Oliver actually looking at me when I call his name are slim to none. I did manage to get a couple of photos of him in his make-shift costume (whirly hat and suspenders) but only because I was very persistant. As we walked from house to house last night with Oliver, who had been thoroughly coached on the nuances of trick-or-treating, I reflected a little bit on motherhood. Oliver, you see, wasn't too interested in this particular ritual of childhood and I had to really talk myself out of being disappointed. Before we even approached the first house he started a chorus of \"no, no, no, no,\" tried to break free and return home. I persisted though thinking that once he got the concept he would become a little less resistant and maybe even enjoy himself. I partially got my wish -- he did become a  little  less resistant but I'm not sure he ever really enjoyed himself. So much of my concept of motherhood involves wanting to give and to teach my children the things that I think are meaningful and important; sharing with them a way of looking at and thinking about the world. Helping your child discover the world is one of the rewards of motherhood, after all. With Oliver the process of discovery is very subtle and comes with the extra challenge of persistance. A few weeks ago I sat on the front porch in the early October sunshine while Oliver stomped back and forth making loud noises and generally entertaining himself. A hummingbird happened by the remains of the garden close to the porch and I quickly tried to get his attention so that I could point out the bird. This became an exercise in frustration because it is nearly impossible to get Oliver's attention by shouting or calling and because he is not able to follow the path between fingertip and object. By the time I physically positioned Oliver in a location by the rail where he might be likely to spot the fast moving bird on his own, it had gone. I released Oliver back to his stomping and tried to quell my own sense of disappointment at not being able to share the excitemnt with my son. A few minutes later a grasshopper landed on the step next to me and I didn't bother going through the whole routine again. And I felt guilty for not trying. When we arrived home last night after our short excursion into the night I tried mightily to get a picture of the boy with his costume and then to interest him in a piece of chocolate. As he pulled away, not interested in either the picture or the chocolate, I reminded myself that my growing sense of sadness at the way the evening had turned out was only due to my own notions about what motherhood and childhood should be -- the mistaken belief that the context of being a mother and of being a child is what matters. The evening ended on a high note when Oliver came to me and said: \"I want to go to sleep.\" This is the second night out of four when he has told us that he was tired and wanted to go to bed. Coming from a kid who normally has to be wrestled into bed this is progress indeed. So I took him to his bed, pulled the covers all the way up to his ears, kissed him good-night. Then I headed downstairs to count my chocolate!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/11/happy-halloween.html", "title": "\nHappy Halloween\n"},

I'm usually not disciplined or organized enough to follow through. But this time I swear I will do a better job. And with more at stake than an extra ten pounds I believe I will. We've decided to go on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet which eliminates certain carbohydrates and all those containing gluten. An order of almond flour (at 6.50/lb thankyouverymuch), which will replace all of our grains, arrived at our doorstep yesterday and I spent a few hours last evening learning the art of cooking with this mysterious (but surprisingly tasty) substance. I made bread that was the consistency of pound cake and cinnamon cookies for Oliver's lunch. For breakfast I toasted it and for lunch I peanut buttered and honeyed it. And since I don't feel like cooking much tonight I will probably grill-cheese it! I also spent some hours trolling the internet for Dry Curd Cottage Cheese, bought the starter for homemade yogurt and some fennel for making sausage! I am on my way. I am motivated. I am exhausted! But the important thing is that Oliver likes it so far and it makes me feel like I am contributing to his wellness.

{"date": "November 06, 2005", "body": "\nThe sleeping silence of our home was broken last night at about 1:30am -- earlier than usual -- by the sound of Oliver screaming. It was the kind of scream that every parent is familiar with, it is the scream that usually means \"I've fallen off the couch and broken my arm.\" Or, \"I fell down the stairs and now I probably have a concussion.\" But with Oliver the scream comes in the dead of the night, usually around 3am, and we have grown accustomed to bolting out of bed, rushing to comfort him. So at 1:30 last night I sat rocking my boy while sitting on the edge of his toddler bear-bed, making soothing sounds, while also trying to restrain flailing arms and legs that hit out at me and escape his lunging bite. It is hard not to be upset by these episodes because it is both difficult to witness and because emotion comes more quickly to the surface when you are jarred from the deepest part of sleep. Nik and I feel as though we are night-time veterans. Oliver never slept through the night until he was 2.5 years old, often waking two, three, or more times in the night. For awhile we went through these particularly intense screaming episodes almost every night. But then he started sleeping; miraculously sleeping. As week after week went by we allowed ourselves to relax a little bit more into a full night of sleep. This week, however, he has awoken in screams four nights out of six. Is it a coincidence that we changed his diet at the same time he started waking in the night again? What else has changed? I can't think of a single thing. But last week also saw a few wonderful \"firsts\" -- on Wednesday at school Oliver initiatied play with other children 5 different times. On Thursday night Oliver initiated and sustained play with his baby brother for the first time ever. For more than seven months we had waited for him to acknowledge Sam and on Thursday suddenly there he was cooing at the baby and lavishing him with hugs and tickles. That same night he seemed to focus on his play activities and at one point he looked up from his building blocks and said: \"I'm happy.\" I wasn't certain I heard right but then I asked him \"What?\" and he repeated himself: \"I'm happy.\" So I told him, \"I'm happy, too, Oliver.\" And I'm not sure I ever uttered a statement that was more true. This whole theraputic program -- the ABA, the diet, the bio-medical approaches -- feels like a giant experiment. We add a little of this, a little of that and then watch for changes, good and bad. But unlike a proper scientific study nothing with our children happens in isolation. Oliver wakes up screaming or has a burst of language and there is no way to know for sure if it is related, and how, to any other event. Maybe it is all just coincidence. After the incident in the night, Oliver slept soundly until 7am and then went on to have a fantastic day. We played and laughed, spent a lot of time outdoors in the unseasonably warm weather and even went swimming. Oliver also did many PECs exchanges, all of the independant and most of them without a fuss. And at meal times I marveled at what a good eater he is. I know that many parents of children like Oliver struggle to get their children to eat a variety of foods but that has never been the case with him and it makes implementing this diet much more bearable. As the evening fell I could tell our little one was exhausted by his rosey cheeks and red ears. Around 7:00 Oliver led the way, \"I want to go to sleep.\" My attempt to read Green Eggs and Ham was unceremoniously halted when the boy closed the book saying: \"The End!\" and rolled over to face the wall. And he was asleep before the lights were out.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/PA210215.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/11/not-quite-science.html", "title": "\nNot Quite Science\n"},
{"date": "November 07, 2005", "body": "\nToday was another two therapist day. Monday and Friday are the days on which Oliver has two ABA sessions, one from 9-12 and the other from 1-4. Six hours in all. This is a lot for a three year old and we still fall a few hours short of the recommended 40 hours per week. This is something I struggle with because, well, he's only three and 40 hours of therapy seems like a lot even if they do try to make it fun. On the other hand I've read that theraputic programs are most significant before the age of 6 so in terms of implementing interventions there is no time like the present. When I ask the people at the school and his lead therapist their opinions about adding more time to his schedule they turn the question back on me: \"Yes, 40 hours is what the research says. But what can he  handle ?\" What can he handle? Is this the kind of question that other mothers can answer? Because I just don't know. I have been reflecting a lot on the perplexing nature of autism and how it is expressing itself with Oliver. His speech pathologist and his lead therapist concur that Oliver's lack of speech is not an issue of processing but rather of motivation. He is not motivated to speak. He has not made the connection between verbalization and getting what he wants and so teaching him this is our task at present. Oliver's lack of speech and my own crash course on the vocabulary of autism have me thinking a great deal lately about language, writing, expression, thought and of where words fall short. Linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf wrote that  \"the categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to be organised by our minds - and this means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. We cut nature up, organise it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language.\"  Or, the words we have available to us, or that we use, influence how we think about a thing. I am keenly aware of this power of language in my own life and when I am feeling tired or sad I try to remember to respond outwardly by using positive words. I've found that it is almost impossible to feel badly when you are using words of hope. Writing, for me, has a similar effect which is why I started this blog. Writing about my son, our family, and autism helps me to frame the experience and so I have chosen to write mostly of positive experiences and the hope that I feel for our future. Because without internalizing hope I cannot be the mother Oliver deserves. The ability of language to influence thought is likewise evident within the public perceptions of autism as demonstrated by the vocabulary used to describe autism. Everywhere I read of the \"tragedy\" of autism, of \"desparate\" parents willing to do anything, and of the \"grief\" one feels upon receiving a diagnosis for a child. But my son is not a tragic hero; he is a joyous one. I am not \"desparate\"; I am hopeful. And while I may occassionally feel grief, I also feel gratitude that Oliver is being helped. Giving voice to these alternative expressions of Autism is so important because it will influence how people think about our children. Whorf's hypothesis also has me wondering about how Oliver, with his lack of language, thinks about and experiences the world. Without the super-structure of language does he truely experience a \"kaleidoscopic flux of impressions?\" What must that be like? Temple Grandin writes of \"thinking in pictures\" -- is this what thought without the benefit of language is like? And what of abstract concepts like love, fear, anger and joy? What would they look like to Oliver? Since I began this blog a few weeks ago I've learned that this language of ours can be grossly inadequate at times. I am not skilled enough to find the words to describe the nexus between sorrow and hope and love and anger where I come to rest many times throughout each day. Nor can it portray the complex emotions I feel when I see Oliver mastering a skill that brings him developmentally closer to his typical peers who learned the same without benefit of hours of therapy. So, upon reflection of language and autism, it seems ironic to me that this \"kaleidoscopic flux\" of emotion doesn't fit into any neatly arranged construct of language. But Oliver and I will keep looking for our words and I hope one day he can tell me what his look like.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/11/on-kaleidoscopic-flux.html", "title": "\nOn Kaleidoscopic Flux\n"},
{"date": "November 12, 2005", "body": "\nOliver is just pretty damn impressive. On Friday, Lindsey told me that he has been he has been initiating play with other children fairly regularly at school. He has also graduated to Phase II of PECs. He has worked through his trouble using the visual schedule and now mostly complies without needing to be wrestled to the thing. He is taking more and more interest in his little brother. The phrase we hear him most often repeating is: \"It's a baby!\" His tantrums have become rather infrequent (although we had a doozy on Friday night but I will attribute that to one over-tired little boy) . A certain disturbing behavior involving a bodily function hasn't occurred in a week. And tonight he ate baked fish and zuchinni creole for dinner! Every last bite of it. And then after his bath he said, \"I want to go to sleep, \" took my hand and led me to the stairs. Mid-afternoon we went to the park to help a dear friend of mine celebrate the birthday of her daughter. Her little girl was born just a few months after Oliver and we had enjoyed our pregnancies together. When our kids were both a few months old we used to spread a blanket close-by to the kids castle playground and watch the children run and play while our own infants chewed and drooled on everything in sight. Those were in the days before I could imagine that a thing like autism could change everything about the present and the future. Oliver did great at the playground but due to the unseasonably warm weather there were a lot of kids climbing around and so while I tried to interest him in playing his only thoughts were on escaping. Time after time I caught him and pulled him back to a slide or swing. Finally, we compromised and I let him play in the pea gravel off to one side. I was feeling pretty bad about things as I watched him repeatedly bury his hand in the rocks against the soundtrack of the shouts and laughter of the other kids. I never see his disability as acutely as I do when there are typical kids around. But fairly soon the other kids came to rest next to Oliver and they played in the rocks side-by-side. Of course they were all playing  together  and Oliver was in his own little world -- but at least he didn't  seem  so all alone. When we got home from the park Nik asked how it went and I reported that Oliver did great. And he really did. Even though he tried repeatedly to escape he was easily redirected. He transitioned well from place to place. And he smiled that killer smile that melts my heart. So Oliver did great. It's just his mom that has a little trouble from time to time. After the kids went to sleep we settled on the couch to watch the documentary, \"Autism is a World\" about 26-year old Sue Rubin, a completely non-verbal autistic woman. This impressive woman was thought to be mentally retarded until the age of 13 when she began to communicate using a keyboard.  Now she is a Junior in college and has an IQ of 140. The documentary was very good and the tale it told about this young woman was inspiring. But I couldn't help wonder what percentage of the autism population she represents. Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that every person presents differently -- the World of Autism for Sue Rubin is probably very different than the World of Autism for Oliver.  But today everything in our little World was good: Oliver is making incredible strides, we got a mid-November dose of fresh air, and the kids were both in bed and asleep by 7pm giving me a bit of time to write here and to read the other autism blogs that keep make me feel a part of the Constellation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/11/autism-is-world.html", "title": "\nAutism Is A World\n"},
{"date": "November 15, 2005", "body": "\nHave I said lately how impressive Oliver is? Well, all modesty aside, I believe he is one of the most impressive people I know. While he may have drawn the short stick in the genetic lottery of autism he clearly has inherited some pretty remarkable traits that I doubt came from my side of things. I am in awe of this little boy with his mischevious smile that goes all the way to his eyes. And I am humbled by his good nature. Everyday I am thoroughly impressed by our little Oliver. Yesterday, for example, L:indsey had just arrived and we were sitting in the kitchen and I was trying to feed Sam and peel an orange for Oliver. Mindful that I should be eliciting requests from Oliver whenever possible and that orange slices are highly motivating, I withheld a slice trying to get him to request it. \"I want Orange\" is a phrase that he has been using quite a bit these days so I reasonably expected that he would comply. Holding the slice out of reach I modeled the request. \"Do you want the orange, Oliver?\" then \"Yes, I want the Orange.\" But as is so often the case Oliver seemed to lose interest when a demand was placed on him and he raced into the next room while I continued my conversation with Lindsey about the day's therapy. Then, much to our shock and amazement, Oliver returned to the kitchen and placed a PECs icon in my hand indicating that he wanted the Orange. Now, for those who don't know about PECs, that is huge. He was motivated enough to get the orange that he left the room, found the icon and returned to give it to me! That means that he understands the concept of requesting items by using a picture to let us know what he wants. I noted in an earlier post that Oliver doesn't appear to have a processing problem with regard to speech but rather that he isn't  motivated  to use words. He hasn't figured out yet that communication can be rewarding. The first step in teaching this is to show that a request will be gratified. So when Oliver raced to find his icon he was demonstrating that he now understands that most basic of principles. I have often worried that we are teaching Oliver to communicate using pictures when what I really want is for him to speak. It has been found that verbal abilities increase by teaching a child the principles of communication using the picture system. But I still need constant reassurance from his therapists and I continually search the internet for documentation. It seems so counter-intuitive. But when Oliver presented me with that icon I knew that something had \"clicked\" with him and that one little act reminded me of his boundless potential. These are the things that keep us going. I sent my rather impressive little boy on the bus to school today wearing plaid pants and a striped shirt. Now you may wonder why I would want to do that to a little boy who clearly has some disadvantages in life already. Well, I did it because those are the clothes that Oliver  chose  to wear. For the last couple of months we have been working on dressing skills and now I'm pretty satisfied that Oliver can mostly dress himself as well as other three year olds. Now we are working on making choices. When presented with two things and asked to choose Oliver will normally just not do anything. He will stare off to one side and not move. So in the morning when it is time to dress I say: \"Oliver, let's go downstairs and have our Yummy Cake. But first let's get dressed.\" With the promise of his yummy-almond-flour-muffin ahead, he is motivated to get dressed in a hurry. On the floor in front of him will be two shirts and two pairs of pants. It is up to him which ones to wear. I'm pretty sure that he just grabs one or the other without giving a thought to choice, but this morning he changed his mind mid-shirt. He actually stopped putting on the first one, took it off and picked up the other saying, \"shirt.\" The aesthetic side of me groaned a little bit but as he scrambled down the stairs for his muffin I couldn't have been more proud. He just impresses the heck out of me. We'll save the lesson on color coordination for another day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/11/all-modesty-aside.html", "title": "\nAll Modesty Aside\n"},

I am constantly aware of the days passing that bring us closer to kindergarten. But I lean heavily on the advice of Oliver's teacher and his lead therapist who both have a lot of experience and are very caring. I also ask a lot of questions of all his therapists.

She had been observing Oliver for the past several weeks and she wanted to add an OT addendum to the IEP. She told me that her evaluation of Oliver put him at about 24 months for fine motor skills, that he was about a year behind and that she would really like to work with him. I participated in the conversation after that but my mind really got stuck on that last part. About a year behind. I had been thinking that all things physical were among Oliver's strengths. But apparently not. Further conversation with her informed me that OT is about more than fine motor skills. She will address issues of play and sensory stimulation and all that is well and good; I knew it was part of the autism package. But hearing that there is yet another area where he has fallen behind was depressing as hell. Add another member to Team Oliver. And some new words to the vocabulary.

I don't mean to say that it took me a long time to decide to become a mother (it did) or that I was pregnant for an extra long period of time (it only seemed that way) but that I didn't feel like a mother once I had my cute little warm bundle of joy in my arms. At least my version of motherhood didn't quite match what I'd read it would be. I once confided to an on-line group of friends that I didn't \"love\" the fetus that became Oliver when I was pregnant. I was really  interested  by it .  And I was  amazed  by it. But that isn't the same thing, is it? In the instant before I hit the submit button I felt sure that someone -- probably a bunch of people -- would reply and tell me that they felt the same way. Instead I got a lot of awkward cyber silence. Also, once he was born I wasn't quite sure what to think of him. Did I love him? Yes. I think so -- but I didn't really know him all that well. Oh sure, he was cute alright. And after I returned to work I couldn't wait to get home to him every night and then I was disappointed that he went to sleep so early. I doted on him and was a complete believer in attachment parenthood: co-sleeping, sling-wearing, extended breastfeeding, the works. But I would say that it took me a good 15 months before it really occurred to me that I would absolutely curl up and die if anything bad ever happened to him. So that's what I mean when I say that I came to motherhood slowly. Now some who are reading this might think that I had trouble bonding with the little guy because I intuitively knew that there was something amiss. Or maybe that something about Oliver prevented me from connecting with him -- there's that mistaken idea that children with autism can't show affection. But Oliver was as perfect and normal as can be; there was nothing wrong with  him . I just didn't instantaneously upon seeing him know that I would throw myself in front of a truck to save him. At least I was glad that wasn't part of the test because I really just didn't know. It took me about a year or so before I knew that I wouldn't even have to think about it. You see, it's not that I didn't love him or that we didn't share a bond but rather that the intensity of both things grew fantastically over the first year of his life. That's what I mean when I say that I came to motherhood slowly. I would say that I am one of the more self-absorbed, self-referential people I know. Especially lately (As evidenced by this post in a blog about Oliver that is all about ME). And so when Oliver was first born I had a lot of trouble adjusting to the fact that I just didn't come first anymore. Not even with myself. That first year of adjustment was hard. I even had trouble finding the time to brush my teeth. And then there was my job. I am lucky enough to have an exciting, challenging, interesting job that pays great and allows me to work with a fantastic group of people. But suddenly I couldn't devote myself to my career 100%. That was the biggest challenge of new motherhood for me: finding a balance between the time and energy I spent on Oliver and on my job. And sometimes, like when I had to turn down trips to exciting, far-flug places because I was still breastfeeding, I felt a little resentful and wondered if I was really cut out to be a mother. After Oliver, however, I went on to have Sam and that tells you that there were things about Motherhood that I wouldn't trade for all of the world. But it occurred to me the other day that until a point very recently, I always thought of them as  my  children. The emphasis was on their relationship to  me . I began to see that I had wanted children in much the same way as I wanted other  things  in my life. I wanted them because I wanted my life to be a certain way. When I grow old I had hoped to be surrounded by my children and grandchildren. Having a child with a disability never really entered the equation. The revelation about Oliver's individuality came to me after his diagnosis when I really began to see him for the rather remarkable little person that he is. The revelation also brought with it an element of sadness because it came with the knowledge that I don't understand how he experiences things. I read a lot and I can guess, but I will never really know. The fact that I had, until that time, thought of Oliver as almost an extension of myself, for good or bad, speaks to the depth of our bond. This shift in my perception of him has been seismic. One day last week I decided to quit my job after thinking about it for about, oh, five minutes. Pay, benefits, professional accomplishment -- all that I held to be so important up until August hardly factored into the decision. My son needs me more than I need all those things times ten. It isn't exactly the same as throwing myself into the path of an oncoming truck to save my son but it is something I thought to be unthinkable when I gave birth to him three years ago. Someone I know recently told me that she thinks of herself as a mother-in-progress and it helps me to view my own journey in such a light. Because, you see, I came to motherhood slowly and at times I didn't embrace it as much as I could have. But every day now I see that I have another opportunity. And luckily Oliver, my little guy who is so much a part of me but also so very much his own person, is supremely accepting.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/11/mother-in-progress.html", "title": "\nA Mother-in-Progress\n"},
{"date": "February 20, 2006", "body": "\nYesterday I was leafing through Oliver's communication log and was pleasantly reminded about what a lovely, good-tempered little guy I've got. Almost every entry goes like this: \"Oliver slept well last night, woke up at 6am and is in a good mood.\" Now here's the thing: aside from the fact that he wakes up a touch on the early side, this simple statement marks how far we've come in the past year. For the first two and a half years of Oliver's life, there was no such thing as a good night's sleep. There were bad nights and awful nights and some even worse than that. Most weeks were punctuated several times with episodic night terrors that left me a limp and soggy puddle by morning. Now there are occassional bad nights but they seem few and far between. Mostly he sleeps. And the good mood part? Given everything our little guy has to deal with -- all the demands we place on him daily --  he seems to be remarkably easy-going. This is no doubt a testament to his father's genes. And it is true that he is virtually always smiling, quick to laugh and displays his own, quiet brand of humor. But once upon a time there was the little matter of those tantrums. Those really blow-out, nuclear melt-downs that seemed to fuel themselves and leave the whole sorry house sagging in their wake. Those have all but disappeared, too. Having more good days than bad make you almost forget what it used to be like -- which made the writhing, sobbing mess that I held in my arms on Saturday evening all the more wrenching. The issue at hand was Oliver's insistance that he be allowed to wear his banana smoothie soiled shirt to bed. Nine times out of ten changing clothes is no problem at all and if it is then I can sucessfully divert his attention. But on this particular night it started with: \"I want shirt!\" and ended with a nuclear explosion. Most ironic was that I had just remarked at dinner time about how it had been a great day with lots of successful outings: first bowling, then the library and finally to the livestock auction (it's purely a spectator's sport for us. Oh, and the animals are interesting, too). After Oliver was at last in bed he fell asleep almost instantly leaving Nik and I to finally exhale. Since the diagnosis last August we've gotten pretty good at reading, predicting, forecasting, compensating, adjusting, and well, just parenting. We haven't had a tantrum since early November. But I didn't see this one coming and once I could see that it was getting ugly I just wasn't flexible enough to change strategies. After a long day of successfully dealing with all kinds of stimuli I should have just let him wear the shirt or anything else his little heart desired. Parenting Oliver, I've learned, isn't so different from parenting any other child. And navigating this mother-son relationship isn't that different from navigating any other relationship. We all have good days and bad days, we all have silly days and sad days. And we all get tired from time to time and just want what we want. Nobody keeps a communication log charting my daily moods and cycles, but if they did I am fairly confident the majority of the entries wouldn't mirror Oliver's. Yes, it is true that sometimes Oliver's autism makes things a bit ugly. Once in awhile we have a bad day. But mostly they are pretty darn good.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/02/mostly-good-bad-and-sometimes-ugly.html", "title": "\nThe (Mostly) Good, The Bad, and the (Sometimes) Ugly\n"},
{"date": "February 13, 2006", "body": "\nIn another lifetime I lived for several years in a bamboo hut overlooking the sea surrounding a small island that I called home. When I moved there I thought I was beginning a career in community development but what I mostly did was get sick. Dengue Fever, Typhoid, Amoebiasis and myriad other tropical bugs plauged my immune system. In my native habitat I am a relatively healthy speciman but when I plopped myself down in the middle of paradise I also, apparently, put out the welcome mat for every germ on the island looking for a bloodstream. When I first arrived it was suggested to me that I hire a housekeeper who would do my cooking, cleaning and laundry. Being the sort who imagines herself relatively self-suffcient, I demured, thinking that it was hardly necessary. After providing the locals with a week's worth of amusement over my attempts to do laundry (in the creek) and to haul my drinking and cooking water up the mountainside (now I understood why that particular hut with the stunning view was made available to me), Baby was dispatched by them to be my \"assistant\". It was understood that, being American, I had strange ideals about civil equality and, while I wouldn't feel right about having a housekeeper, I could definately use, um, help. Baby turned out to be a very useful and welcome addition to my household. She helped me navigate and negotiate. And, while I'm not a real girly-girl, there was the matter of those big-ass,  jumping  spiders that even the cat didn't want to go near. She also took care of me when I was sick. Which was often. One particular illness struck me at the end of a long and unhealthy year. On the third day I became alarmed that my fever was so high and unremitting and I set out for the hospital in a nearby city -- over an hour away by boat and then taxi. The doctors there told me that it was a virus and that the only thing to do was go home and wait it out. Two days later things had not changed I was hallucinating and spent a lot of time in a deep, fever-induced, sleep. I told Baby in earnest that I just wanted to die. Two hours later my fever was completely gone and I was, for the first time in five days, asking for food. What happened in that two hour interval is something that I find quite interesting. After telling Baby that I wanted to die she shushed me, told me to put on some fresh clothes, that she would change my bed and that I would feel much better soon. Unbeknownst to me she then took my sweat-soaked shirt to the local healer's house to ask for a \"cure\". After performing a ceremony the healer gave Baby coconut oil to burn beneath the house so that I would inhale the vapors and a medicinal ointment that she used to give me a sponge bath. I only found out about Baby's trip to the healer a few weeks later when I found what remained of my shirt, which had been shredded to burn the coconut oil, in her room. When I asked her about it she reluctantly told me what she had done. She hadn't wanted to tell me because she thought I might not understand. \"Baby,\" I told her, \"the only thing I don't understand is why you waited five days!\" I can't explain why some things happen in this world. A lot of it is just beyond our knowing. Perhaps my fever had already ran its course and would have receeded without the healer's intervention. Or maybe I was truely \"healed\". Maybe Baby's belief in what she was doing was powerful enough to tip the scales in my favor. Estee, from  My Son's Autism , writes: \"There is not one person with autism who hasn\u2019t told me that there was someone believing and pushing them to succeed (and that success is different for everyone). \" Above all, it is my role to be that person for Oliver; to tip the scales in his direction as much as possible, and to remember the  incredible impact  that we have on one another-- not just by what we say and do, but by what we  believe . And to help me remember how counter-productive fear can be, I have this monkey. As you can see, a crack right down the middle threatens to break him in half but for the strength of his arms holding his head together. The Worry Monkey has made the rounds among a group of my friends; each of us claiming him in time of need, heaping our own worries on top of his. A few months ago I called up the monkey-keeper and said that it was time for him to come home. I really need this monkey now so I can't go around lending him out anymore. But if you are in need of a place to put your worries, I invite you cast them on him from afar. Go ahead.

{"date": "November 29, 2005", "body": "\nOne thing I have trouble determining is the extent to which Oliver's behaviors are a manifestation of his autism or if they are just a normal part of being a three-year old boy. At the same time I know I shouldn't try to dissect him. He is a whole person. And he has autism. He is simply Oliver being Oliver. And yet none of those who have evaluated him to date have given me any indication of where he falls on the spectrum. And I haven't had the courage to ask. Knowing the answer to this would probably give me the false impression that I have some idea of what to expect for the future. None of us can know this but that doesn't stop me from wishing I had a crystal ball. When we were first going through the diagnosis process each new specialist asked the same range of questions and I always found it difficult to answer accurately. \"Does he like to line up objects?\" \"Yes. But he also likes to stack, throw, and hide things.\" \"Does he like to spin?\" \"Yes. But he most loves it when his older brother spins him. Then he gets dizzy and falls down, laughing. He hasn't used his sit-and-spin in a long time. So the answer to both of these questions went down as \"Yes\" even though I'm pretty sure that he doesn't spin or line things up more or less than any other three year old. One of his therapists once remarked to me that she was surprised that Oliver didn't have any stereotypical autistic behaviors. And, while it is true that he doesn't hand-flap or walk on his toes, I don't think it would be hard for someone who is familiar with autism to pick him out of a crowd of other kids. In fact, in a crowd it would be especially easy. The reason I bring this up is because I sometimes have trouble knowing what to overlook and what needs attention. For example: Oliver has been eating with utensils since he was 11 months old but over the last 3-4 months he has stopped using his fork and prefers now to eat with his fingers. Is he losing a skill? Should I insist that he use the fork? In the evenings, sometimes, he will run aroud and around the play room until I catch him and tickle him. Is he using this activity to get his bearings when he is too tired to focus on anything or does he like the game of being caught and tickled? In bed at night he loves making shapes with his hand when it is back-lit by the hall light. Are these the same hand puppets that I made as a kid? It is hard to say, and I'm not even really sure it matters, except that I wish I had a better sense of the challenges that he will face. I don't know if the picture will ever be clear or that I'll ever stop wishing I had a crystal ball. For the moment, though I suppost the important thing is to concentrate on helping him have the best today that he can have -- which, when you come right down to it, is about one part work and three parts pleasure. Which doesn't sound so bad in the scheme of things.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/11/what-is-what.html", "title": "\nWhat is What\n"},
{"date": "February 21, 2006", "body": "\nThere is nothing so lovely as the ABC song as sung by Oliver. Or Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. At first he just said the words in a haltingly staccato voice, but now he manages a more sing-song delivery and I take such joy in listening to him. Oliver learned both of these songs, and how to count to 10, from watching videos. I used to feel bad about parking Oliver in front of the TV when I needed a break -- or when  he  needed a break -- but now it appears that so much of his recent language acquisition has come from the TV and so I have been looking for videos that will enhance this. (Curiously though if he was first exposed to an image in the trailer at the end of another video it takes some work on my part to get him to agree to sit through the actual video.) The whole series of Dr. Seuss beginning reader videos have been great because we have also purchased the books that go along with them and one seems to reinforce the other. Since we introduced the ABC book and video Oliver has taken a great interest in the alphabet and can now recite all the way to \"V\". Some time ago my mother tried to teach Oliver his ABCs by association: T is for Truck, M is for Mom, etc. So now that he has developed this new interest in letters I hear him calling out random words from time to time:  \"Truck!\" or \"Egg!\" or \"Bear!\"  For example, if he sees the word \"Start\" he will call out \"Truck! Truck!\" It was only after a few days that I realized he was calling out these words when he saw the letters that he recognized. I'm not sure where this interest in letters will lead us but I believe it is a sure sign of abstract thinking. Also, a fun new development at our house is Oliver's new interest in having his picture taken. In the past it was quite a challenge to get a good picture of our little guy because of his refusal to look at the camera. Last time we tried to get a family photo the photographer nearly gave up and we had to settle for the only one in which Oliver was looking in the general direction of the camera. But last night I pulled out the camera and Oliver actually began  posing  for photos. Not only that but when I put the camera down he grabbed my hand and shoved it at the camera wanting me to continue taking pictures. I was only too happy to oblige.  I will try to post some of the pictures from our photo shoot as soon as I can figure out how to download them!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/02/abcs-of-oliver.html", "title": "\nThe ABCs of Oliver\n"},
{"date": "March 25, 2006", "body": "\nI heard the rather heavy patter of Oliver's feet coming down the hallway before I saw him rounding the corner into my bedroom at 6:15 this morning. Sam was sleeping cozily beside me and Nik was, thankfully, already awake and making coffee. I gently shifted Sammy from the middle to the side of the bed and made room for Oliver. He quietly climbed up, adjusted the pillow just so, and pulled the covers up to his chin. I was still groggy from sleep but Oliver was wide awake and ready to start the day with all sorts of growls and chirps. Anxious that he not wake Sammy -- for then my day would really begin -- I put my finger to his lips a couple of times: Shhhhh. To which he responded by imitating me Oliver fashion, placing his whole hand on the tip of his nose and: Shhhh. Then more giggles, growls and chirps. A few minutes later Sam was awake, I had a steaming cup of coffee in my hands and watched with my head still on the pillow as my boys started to explore the new day. It took us a long time to get Oliver to sleep in his own bed, in his own room and an even longer time to get him to sleep through the night. Then, about the time when Sam was born, one year ago this week, whatever we had been trying to do to help Oliver through the night suddenly took hold and he began to sleep. Of course having a new baby in the house meant that we weren't getting any extra sleep, but with one less kid to worry about in the night I certainly felt a little more rested. About the same time that Oliver started sleeping through the night, at two and a half years of age, he also took to staying in his bed upon waking in the morning. Peeking in on him in the morning, I was often pleasantly surprised to find him awake and in bed with a book or a toy or just laying there watching the sunlight creep in. It took me awhile to realize how much I missed hearing the solid, sure, thump of his feet running down the hall to my room in the morning (or what might pass for morning to him). So, while 6:15 is a bit on the early side, the soft curl of his hair as his head finds a place just under my chin on the pillow next to me more than makes up for a few minutes of lost sleep. Mid-morning we loaded the kids into the car and drove to an auditorium where a local children's musician had scheduled an appearance. We found a couple of seats on the end of a row towards the exit, not sure how Oliver would do once the performance began. Unable to sit while the seats around us were filling up, Nik took him into the adjacent hallway were he could run around and work out any nervous energy he might have. And when the singer/songwriter finally took up the guitar they made their way back in. Midway through the second song, however, it became obvious that it wasn't going to work out. But rather than leaving we went back into the hallway and sat down on the floor directly outside the propped open doors to the auditorium where we could still listen to the music and see the stage. When Oliver needed to he ran a few laps up and down the hallway then settled back into my lap for another song. To help Oliver relax and enjoy the music -- which he clearly liked -- I held him tightly and alternated between massaging his hands, applying pressure to his jaw and swaying with him in my lap while cupping my hands firmly over his ears. It occured to me at one point that, while keeping Oliver where he could enjoy the show was a lot of work for both of us, we probably looked like any other mother and son to the uninitiated. In fact, three or four people just inside the doors offered us their seats, to which I simply stated that it was better for us to be where we were. And later we were joined by at least a half dozen other kids and parents. A short time after we went to sit in the hallway I happened to see one of Oliver's classmates and his father exiting the auditorium from another door. The child, who also has autism, was visibly upset. The father slowly and gently helped his son into his coat but wore a sad, familiar look on his face and the two of them walked out to the parking lot. As they left I turned my attention back to the darkened auditorium. There were probably 150 kids in there and 2 of them had autism. Now one had left and we were sitting in the hall. Were there others, I wondered? Maybe. But given our own experiences in the past, and what I had just witnessed, I know that it is sometimes easier to just stay home. And therein lies the rub: our kids need to be out and about and experiencing all that the world has to offer, but out and about can so often overwhelm their senses. How many times have we geared up and gone someplace only to either leave five minutes into an activity or wish that we had? And how many times have we stayed home althogether? Too often I get caught up in thinking about Oliver's \"deficits\". The list of skills that he has to learn -- things that other kids easily absorb -- is long and depressing. But this is a journey that we are on together and today, sitting cross-legged with Oliver on my lap, my hands cupped tightly over his ears and the both of us swaying to the music, I realized that it is a learning adventure for both of us. Sometimes we stumble and end up with bloody knees, but then there are the times when I can close my eyes and hear the solid, sure, thump of our feet taking us a bit further in the right direction.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/03/on-down-road.html", "title": "\nOn Down the Road\n"},
{"date": "March 16, 2006", "body": "\nUpon waking this morning, Oliver decided to mix things up a bit. Of late we have had trouble getting him to change his shirt. It takes a lot of coercing, cajolling and distracting but we always press on because, after all, one can't go around wearing the same shirt day after day. But this morning it was the pants that he refused to change. He had me going for a moment; I thought we were going to slide easily into the day. Since Oliver has mastered the task of dressing and undressing himself (except for the socks, which I'm not pushing because he is only 3!) I have started getting him to take it one step further and take the clothes that he will wear from the closet. First one article from the pile of shirts, then one from the stack of pants. I was pretty happy that he seemed to get the concept after the first time and now notice that he will even demonstrate a preference for one shirt or pair of pants over another, pulling one from the middle of the pile or putting one back and choosing another. Of course his sense of color coordination has occassionally left me wincing but I figure he gets that from his father's side of things. I don't know why he gets stuck on changing an article of clothing. And why now? It isn't a problem if the shirt is dirty or if it is time for a bath, but otherwise, lately, it has been a struggle. And sometimes if we do manage to change the shirt with a minimum of tears then even one glimpse of it -- even ten minutes later -- will cause another fit of tears. After experiencing this the hard way a couple of days in a row I now immediately hide the shirt when it comes off. With Oliver, though, I notice that he maintains these sort of behaviors for a few weeks and then suddenly discards them and just as suddenly something new will take his interest for good or bad. So usually just when I have figured out how to handle one situation we are on to the next. My boy certainly knows how to keep me on my toes! This morning, though I didn't even bother dealing with the pajama pants. A teacher in-service day meant no school and so Nik and I were splitting the day at work. I left the house at 7am and returned by 11:30 so that Nik could work all afternoon. But when I returned home I found Oliver laying lethargically in front of the TV. Since Sunday when Oliver first developed a fever he hasn't been back to normal. Although his fever left him Monday morning he has not yet recovered. Watching TV has always been a sport for Oliver. He isn't one to simply watch a video -- he engages with it. Our television screen is fully of nose prints, finger prints, hand prints -- and lately, for some reason, knee prints! Oliver imitates the characters of his favorite videos, he narrates along, he presses his nose to the noses of the children and other characters, and in general is just very, very animated. There is no  sitting  to watch TV. And certainly no  laying down  with his head on a pillow, which is why I observed him so fretfully this afternoon. I almost would have felt better if he had a fever because then there would be a clear explanation for his lethergy. Having your child not be able to tell you what hurts is hard. As I have written before, the main focus of Oliver's ABA program is PECs and I have, at different times questioned this strategy. The whole idea of teaching him to communicate using pictures when what I really just want him to do is speak seems counter-intuitive. My instinct is to encourage and reward speech and so if Oliver can say \"apple\" or \"water\" I haven't always felt confident that reinforcing the use of an icon rather than the word itself was, in fact, beneficial. But communication is about so much more than being able to demand objects that are visible, as Mary, our lead therapist always reminds me. And PECS is more about teaching communication than vocabulary. This hit home to me as I tried to get Oliver to eat a few slices of banana at lunch time and wished that he could tell me: \"My tummy hurts and I'm not hungry.\" The leap between what he can say: \"I want banana.\" and what he can't: \"I don't want banana.\" is much more vast than one word would indicate. Oliver spent twenty minutes eating a muffin, crumb by crumb, and then I laid down with him in his little toddler bear bed and soon he was fast asleep. An hour later I woke him and he returned to the couch and laid there looking at the box to his favorite video. I relented and let him watch it. While he was laying there looking so miserable I stole the opportunity to run to the neighbors house and borrow a video rewinding machine. Our VCR has simply stopped going backwards and by the end of each day our choices have grown more limited and by this afternoon we had only two left. When I returned about three minutes later Oliver hadn't moved an inch but was wearing a scared look on his face. Even before I looked I knew what happened: the smell was a little offending. And all I can say is: Thank God for my new handy, dandy Bissell carpet and upholstery cleaner!! Two pairs of clothes and two baths later Oliver seemed to recover a bit. He playfully bounced on my bed and ran back and forth to the window as we kept watch on the street below for Poppi's red car to turn the corner and park at the curb in front of the house. When Nik did finally arrive with RT in tow the usual chaos of early evening ensued: fussy children just this side of bedtime, broken bits of conversation, me cooking dinner -- all punctuated by the frequent ring of the telephone and a decidedly female voice on the other end asking for an almost-13 RT. Oliver went right to bed at 7pm and was asleep within moments. He has already stirred once declaring loudly: \"I want in the bathtub!\" -- a mantra of his that has nothing to do with getting in the tub -- and I soothed him back to sleep with only one refrain of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, a kiss on the forehead and a wish for sweet dreams and sweeter tomorrows.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/03/on-my-toes.html", "title": "\nOn My Toes\n"},
{"date": "March 29, 2006", "body": "\nToday the glass was most certainly half full. This isn't the case on many days: I'm too often a battler of pessimism. But when it comes to Oliver I definately lean towards the positive interpretation of things. He makes it easy. I look at him with his bright smile that goes all the way to his eyes and his easy-going nature and all I see is potential. There is not a half-empty glass in sight when it comes to him. So, on to the glass of water, the one that is half-full. Nap time in our little green house is the hardest time of day for me because it also happens to be the pooping hour. Really. Oliver schedules his poops around Sammy's nap. I could (and often do) sit him on the potty every fifteen minutes for two hours leading up to nap time and he will wait until I go off to put Sam in bed and then immediately poop his pants. He and I both know it is going to happen and it doesn't matter how many threats or wild promises I make. It's like he thinks those are the rules of the game or something. I always know when it is happening, too, because the house becomes unusually quiet. It's like I have this sixth, pooping sense or something. So when I think Oliver might be pooping I have to decide to a) either stop mid-spell with Sam and go check or b) wait until he is fully asleep and risk having a big mess to clean up. Because here is the other thing: once Oliver has soiled his pants, the mess usually doesn't stay  in  his pants. It used to be much worse, especially when Sam was younger because if I chose option A then I had an over-tired infant wailing as I cleaned up poopy boy and poopy room. And if I chose option B, which happened a couple of times, then I had more than a passing thought of just moving out and getting a new home. \"Oh,\" I imagined saying to Nik when he would come home to find our bags packed and on the porch, \"Let's get a new house. This one's been pooped.\" Most of that is over now. But those days, the poop days, were dark. I couldn't write about it. I couldn't talk about it. All I could do was get though it, stock up on carpet cleaner, and trade grim, poop jokes with Nik. So anyway -- and yes, I am getting to the glass of water -- at nap time today I ushered Oliver into his room and asked him to lay down with a book while I put Sam in bed. Then I went to my bedroom with Sam keeping one ear perked towards the hall. Then it got quiet and I looked down at Sam, whose eyelashes were fluttering softly near sleep. Another five minutes, even just three minutes, was all I needed. But a lot can happen in three minutes. And then I heard a new sound: water rushing in the bathroom. What was this new twist? I gathered Sam up higher in my arms and walked towards the bathroom. And there was Oliver filling a glass full of water at the sink, which surprised me because 1) I didn't even know he knew how to turn on the water, 2) he's never even attempted that before and 3) normally he has the endearing habit of just sitting wherever he is and yelling \"Water!\" at the top of his lungs to indicate his thirst. So there I stood, with a huge, stupid grin on my face watching Oliver drink down a big glass of water, totally not careing that Sam was now wide awake. And when he was done, Oliver walked over to me, handed me the glass of water and happily exclaimed: \"I did it!\" Before going back in his bedroom and climbing back in bed with a self-satisfied look on his face. \"Yes, Oliver. You did it!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/03/half-glass-of-water.html", "title": "\nHalf a Glass of Water\n"},

The usual demands of family and household coupled with the extra lovely weather have kept me from taking up my usual end-of-the-day-too-tired-to-do-anything-else post in front of the computer. Also, I am trying to take a break from autism. Because around my house -- or at least around my head -- it is all autism all the time. Since Oliver's diagnosis on August 4, 2005, I have barely thought of anything else. So now I'm practicing taking time off. And by that I don't mean that I'm taking time off from Oliver, but just from the autism. I want to regain some of what I lost when the word autism came to rest with us. I want to remember what it was like to look at Oliver as a whole little boy and not a list of behaviors and characteristics. He deserves that. And so do I. Last Thursday we took Oliver to a medical center in a nearby city so that he could be evaluated by a developmental pediatrician. I had been putting it off because we already had two evaluations, one through the school district and another through a local university. But a friend, who is a neuropsychologist, urged me to take him to see a specialist so that we could rule out any other conditions that might present autism-like characteristics. I didn't believe that to be the case but figured that we might as well check the box anyway. In some ways I wish we hadn't. But I'm also glad that I waited until this point in our journey to check the box because I felt empowered by having 8 months of experience and knowledge under my belt. I didn't doubt for one second that I was the expert in the room when it came to Oliver. It also became clear to me how one-dimensional these assessments are and I made up my mind on the drive home that I will never have him evaluated or assessed in this way again. What is the point? Why should I keep measuring him when I see before me a child who loves, laughs, and is full of potential?  I asked the specialist at the end of the evaluation about her practice. She follows more than 2,000 children in our state. She sees an average of 20 new children each week. She was very kind and wonderful with Oliver but I left feeling as though I contributed to the statistics she will use in her next paper but that we got very little out of it. She said she wants to see us again in six months but I doubt we will keep the appointment. Oliver did pee on the potty in the public rest room though. He'd never done that before so we were thrilled. And at the end of the three-plus hours in a small room with 5 adults he started hitting himself in the head with the mega-blocks. He'd never done that before, either, and we weren't so thrilled. Actually, after three-plus hours, he wasn't the only one who felt like hitting himself in the head. Autism rules my life at the moment, and probably will for a long time to come. And that's OK, I guess, because even though  I came to motherhood slowly , I'm still the mom after all. But the trick, and the test, is not letting it rule Oliver's life. And If I do, just hit me in the head with a mega-block, OK?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/05/all-autism-all-time.html", "title": "\nAll Autism All The Time\n"},
{"date": "January 03, 2006", "body": "\nI've been on a bit of a hiatus over the past couple of weeks, dealing with all the fun stuff that comes with the season. It was by turns busy, relaxing, trying and rewarding. With no school for Oliver and no work for me, Team Oliver switched into high gear and we began implementing phase III of PECs. This phase requires Oliver to discriminate between pictures of items in order to make a request. Previously he had one picture available and that was for the desired object. Now he must choose between multiple pictures and only gets the object if he uses the correct image. Much to the surprise of our lead therapist, who had warned me that Oliver might have a hard time with the change, he picked it up almost immediately. Watching him figure it out -- and figure it out quickly -- was such a boost. I had braced myself for lots of crying and tantrums but his complaints were relatively mild and I think mostly to let us know that, boo-hoo, we were intruding on his neatly organized life. In addition to Phase III, we spent a great deal of time on potty-training which has been met with mostly success, we completed the Assessment ofBasic Language and Learning Skills that will help us develop priorties for the ABA portion of his therapy, and in general spent a lot of time reinforceing the things that Oliver does well. I saw a boost in his use of language -- much of it echolalic or scripted but speech nonetheless -- and he seemed generally well-focused and happy. One of the biggest changes that I've noted over the last month is that he has become very, very affectionate, demanding hugs, kisses and cuddles from everyone -- even people he doesn't know all that well. He has always been a cuddly guy but even his therapists agree that it has stepped up a notch. On New Year's Eve we spent a few hours at the home of a neighbor where some families from our street had gathered for a meal. I had been apprehensive about it because Oliver typically doesn't do very well when there is a lot of commotion but there were no tantrums and he only started trying to escape to remote areas of the house after about 90 minutes, which was then our cue to head home. I couldn't believe how well he managed despite all the noise and commotion. Present at the gathering was another child who is only two weeks older than Oliver. The differences between them are dramatic and I tried hard not to compare. When I allow myself to make comparisons, even for a minute, I still feel the tide of grief lapping at my ankles. There are days when I can quite clearly see where the road ahead of me becomes paved with acceptance. There are fewer and fewer days when I feel overwhelmed by the all-encompassing \"autism\". It is simply our new normal. I have such great expectations for 2006. It will be a year full of new challenges and I feel ready to embrace them. I still have the feeling of being slightly adrift, without  roadmap or chart , but I have also learned that I must take Oliver's hand and let him be the guide. To those of you who have come along for the ride, who have given me support, advice, wisdom and hope over the past few months: thank you. And may the winds of 2006 show you favor.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/01/navigation-in-new-year.html", "title": "\nNavigation in the New Year\n"},

None. Zero. Zilch. Sometimes, when I'm having an especially bad day, Oliver looks up at me with a kind of questioning look as if to say: \"Are you my Mother?\" and just like in the book I want to reply to him: \"No. I am the Dog.\" Or, \"No. I am the mommy that you got. But you were really meant to have a much more patient, understanding mommy. Your real mommy wouldn't mind sitting with you while you are on the potty for the millionth time today only to clean up an accident 5 minutes after we get up. And your real mommy wouldn't be impatient with you when you absolutely object to wearing THAT shirt for no apparent reason. Or when you insist on always playing with Percy the train in just that way. I mull this kind of thing over when I go into the kitchen at night after my dear, wonderful, amazing husband has just cleaned up from dinner and I put away random items where they really belong because there are just certain ways that things are done because that is the way it has always been and the way it always should be. He doesn't know this because he is a man. I think this to myself as I carry the laundry that he has done to the top of the stairs and un-fold, then re-fold properly all of the towels because that is the way they should be stored in the closet. Then, before climbing into bed I straighten the sheet and put the comforter on the  right  way: with the dark green border at the top. I sleep better if the sheets aren't all wrinkled up and the border just goes at the top. Aesthetically, I mean. It's better that way. I used to try to explain these things to dear husband. He would always listen patiently to me explain why something should be done a certain way and then go ahead and continue doing it his way thereafter. I stopped explaining and now just concentrate on being happy to have a true domestic partner. Lucky for me, Oliver has exactly the right Poppi.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/01/are-you-my-mother.html", "title": "\nAre You My Mother?\n"},
{"date": "January 11, 2006", "body": "\nMy mom has always told me that I need to get safety features for our house -- special knobs for the gas stove, special locks for the doors, etc. She has done this since Oliver was a baby, even before we received his diagnosis. But I never needed them. Oliver has never attempted to touch the stove or to open doors. All that is changing and I'm not sure I like it. Yesterday when I wasn't looking Oliver opened the refridgerator and retrieved an egg. Holding it aloft he looked at me and said: \"I break the egg.\" \"Oh no you don't,\" I replied and tried to grab the egg from him before he dropped it onto the hard kitchen floor. Now the other thing about Oliver is that he is fast. And he knows how to evade capture, this boy. I dart to the right and he skirts around me to the left. He fakes me out and runs past me in the other direction. He would do great on the basketball court if he could ever figure out the dribbling thing. So for the next couple of minutes chaos ensued as I chased my boy around the house while he held the egg precariously between two fingers, laughing and repeating: \"I break the egg!\" When I finally managed to catch him and avert any slimy, sticky disasters, I figured he had earned the prize. So with supervision I took him back to the kitchen, took out a bowl and watched as he broke the egg, looking triumphantly up at me as he did so. Whew. That was fun. Now where's Sammy? I had momentarily forgotten about the other little guy. A quick survey of the area and I found him -- half way up the stairs! Two firsts in one day!

{"date": "December 02, 2005", "body": "\nI got the following in an e-mail from Oliver's aide today: \"I just had a great day with Oliver and wanted to tell you this: Oliver was at the table with the doll house and a friend was playing beside him with a helper. The other little boy was in a hugging mood, he walked up behind Oliver and reached to give him a hug, Oliver then turned to return the hug. They stood there hugging for about 30 sec. The little boy started to walk away and Oliver continued to follow him around trying to \"talk\" to him (i'm not to sure what he was saying). Oliver kept reaching his arms out to give him another hug, and of course by this point all the teachers are watching so the little boy is pretending not to care. This went on for like 2 min then Oliver decided he was done and walked away. I think this was the most emotional I have been about a kid in a long time; it really touched me that he wanted to interact but was unsure until another student came and showed him how. I love moments like that. It will stay with me forever. \" Last fall we were really amused by Oliver whenever we took him to a place where there were other kids because he went around hugging everyone. I apologized to more than one parent after he had gripped their child in a bear hug so stong that both kids ended up tumbling to the ground. \"He just really likes to hug people,\" I remember saying. And I felt kind of happy inside that he was such an affectionate kid. Fast forward to the beginning of the summer this year and another picture that springs to mind is of Oliver playing in the kiddie pool in our back yard with one of the other children from our play group. The little girl spent a lot of time dumping water on Oliver's head to which he responded with such glee. He wanted to return the favor for her but she didn't really like water over her head so he was happy to let her do the dumping. It was about this same time that we were beginning to suspect that Oliver might have a speech delay and I had taken him to the school district for observation. There was no diagnosis yet. Fast forward again to the end of the summer and another kiddie pool. Oliver wouldn't go near the other kids and I spent the whole time trying to keep him from escaping the yard. By now I had the diagnosis and was determined to get him to interact with the other kids. It didn't work and I ended up quietly devastated. It was almost unbelieveable to me how much he had changed in less than a year. How had it happened without it being so obvious? So we have had the diagnosis for almost exactly 4 months, he has had a program going for 8 weeks and I already see glimmers of the things to come. A little hug can go a long way.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/12/then-and-now.html", "title": "\nThen and Now\n"},

{"date": "December 05, 2005", "body": "\nI'm a little behind on my Christmas shopping. OK, if truth be told, I haven't even started yet. The problem is that I've got a little bit of the Humbug! So I'm waffeling between wanting to just forget the whole thing this year and hoping that if I just start going through the motions my attitude will get the adjustment that it needs. I'll probably just throw myself into it and see what happens. Here is the dilemna: I'm one of those perfect gift type of people. I don't go all-out and stuff everything imaginable under the Christmas tree, but small or large, I try to find the perfect gift for everyone. But with Oliver this is particulary hard. There have been plenty of times that I've come home with an item that I would have just loved as a kid, only to have him show not a second of interest. I mean not even  look  at the the thing. Or, if I'm lucky he might play with it for five minutes and  then  walk away. As a Mom who would really like to give my kids the moon, this can be a little disappointing. Also, one thing you should know if you don't already, is that a lot of kids with Autism lack the ability to engage in imaginative play. This is the case with Oliver but I'm happy to report that just lately we've been seeing some improvements. Within the last month he has started moving cars around and making motor noises and having them crash into one another. And I showed him how to make his toy dinosaurs ride on the cars and motorcycles and to my surprise this has become a favored activity. Having to teach Oliver how to play is one of the oddest things about this new world of Autism. I'd always imagined myself as one of those anything-goes parents, not someone who feels compelled to to say there is a right and wrong way to play -- but that is exactly what I find myself doing. \"No, we don't stack the pretend food in a tower, we make little sandwhiches and then pretend to eat them.\" \"No, you don't put the pants on the bear's head, you put it on his legs.\" When we were initially going through the diagnosis process I joked to Nik that the specialists were going to tell us that all of Oliver's problems could be traced to the fact that he didn't have enough toys. And, while Oliver certainly has more toys than some, he definately has far fewer than any of the kids in his playgroup. The reason for this is that I could never really identify things that I thought he would hold his interest. Buying toys was a big waste of money and, once we received the diagnosis, just plain painful. But here we are at Christmas time and the really hopeful part of me thinks that I might be able to find something that he will like. I will put the tree up and try to get him to help with the decorations. I'll play Christmas music and talk about Santa Claus. But I'm pretty sure that none of it will make much of an impact on him. Except possibly for the tree in the middle of the living room. I wonder what he will make of that?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/12/red-green-and-blue.html", "title": "\nRed, Green and Blue\n"},
{"date": "December 07, 2005", "body": "\nOne of the biggest challenges we have right now is finding ways to keep Oliver engaged. There are few things that will really hold his attention. On a good day we can keep him focused on an activity for about five minutes. Left to his own devices Oliver will cruise around the house, moving from place to place and not really focusing on anything for more than a minute. It gets worse when he is really tired. Knowing that this is a problem, each of us takes a turn at playing with him during the day and evening. Sometimes this means one minute of puzzle-making and 30 seconds of catching him and trying to re-engage him to put in another piece. I feel bad sometimes because I catch myself thinking what a lot of work it can be and then I have to redirect  myself  to remember that it must be a whole lot more work for the little guy. And then there are the self-stimulating activities. I mentioned before that one of Oliver's stims is to interact with his own reflection. Another one is to run around the perimeter of the playroom, or between two rooms, while shaking his head from side to side as if he were vehemently saying no to something the rest of us aren't privy to. Another are what I call hand puppets -- when he puts his hands right up to his face and watches very intently as he moves his fingers into shapes. I have to admit that the stims drive me crazy. It isn't that they bother anyone, particularly, but rather that I can't help but think that he just shouldn't be doing it. He should be doing something constructive. Something social. Something developmentally appropriate. I see him doing these things and I think that I'm not working hard enough to engage him so that he won't need to. But lately I've come to realize that to completely cut Oliver off from his stims will both drive me to exhaustion and will send him the wrong message. Although I don't completely understand it, I know that he enjoys these activities, takes comfort in them, because he needs the sensory input that they provide. One day, perhaps, we will find a way for him to get the same experience in a more appropriate way but until then I suppose I have to find a way to think about them in a positive way more often. Another thought I had was to see if I could make the stims into a social activity. At first this might sound peculiar, but I thought that it would at least be a way to meet him in the middle. The first one I tackled was the reflection-gazing. Last night I hung a large carnival mirror in the playroom hoping that we can all spend time being silly in front of the mirror  with  Oliver. He showed about 30 seconds of interest last night but today I saw him start to make the mirror a stop on his cruising rounds of the house. It always takes him a while to warm up to new things so it is too soon to tell if my plan will be effective. At the very least, Sam seems to like it and the bottom corner of it is now adorned with his slobber. Now about the head shaking and the hand puppets I don't know. One thing at a time, I guess.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/12/engaging-oliver.html", "title": "\nEngaging Oliver\n"},
{"date": "December 09, 2005", "body": "\nAll I could think of when I heard the radio announce that the schools were closed was: \"Ugh! Stuck at home with both children.\" I know that isn't a great thing to admit but let's face it: they are a lot of work. And I'm not the kind of mom who bundles them up and goes outdoors to enjoy the fresh air and new fallen snow. I don't like it cold. Fresh air in the cold weather is their father's job. But, determined to make the best of it, I rallied the children into the playroom after sending Nik off to work and cleaning up the Yummy Cake crumbs from breakfast. First thing Oliver wanted to do was run around and around between the two rooms and the hall while shaking his head in his favorite stim. OK, I thought. It's going to be a long day. So I grabbed him around the waist and said, in my most enthusiastic voice: \"Let's build a tower, Oliver!!\" Then I stationed Sammy in front of his new Fisher Price ball-eating-catepiller on one side of me and dumped out the bag of mega blocks on the other. I handed Oliver a block and started putting some randomly together hoping that he would join in easily. \"Wow, this is going to be a great tower, Oliver!\" He responded un-enthusiastically but heaving a block at the small construction and then tried to resume his running. Meanwhile, Sammy saw the tower and wouldn't content himself with just mouthing the few blocks I put in his lap but rather kept trying to cross over my legs to get at the tower. So there I was, trying desparately to keep Sam away from the tower while simultaneously repeatedly catching Oliver in some stage of escape and motivating him to help me build. He humored me until Sam distracted me and then he would again try to bolt and the whole comedy started all over again. After the blocks the whole episode was repeated with the cars, trucks, dinosaurs, bubbles and musical instruments. I donn't remember a time when it was so hard to get Oliver to focus. And Sam, it appears has become suddenly stubbornly interested in  only  what his brother has and, apparently, doesn't want. About 40 mintues into this I realized that Oliver had to go to the bathroom. So, I then moved the party into the small, downstairs bathroom: two children, one adult, a couple of books for Oliver and some toys for Sam. With Sam somewhat occupied I turned my attention to Oliver and alternately encouraged, soothed and distracted. After only one biting episode (yesterday I nearly lost my right ear when I leaned into his embrace thinking he only meant to hug me!) and 10 minutes we emerged from the bathroom victorious -- the second day in a row!! I was so proud and happy that I told him he could run around until his little legs couldn't carry him anymore. Curiously, though he didn't seem to need to. So instead I rewarded him with a video. Sam took a nap and I sat on the couch and rubbed Oliver's feet in just the way he likes me to. Our afternoon therapist was able to make it to our house despite the snow. She had somewhat better luck than I did engaging Oliver. We brought some toys out of \"retirement\" and that seemed to help. And then the day seemed to pass without as much effort as the morning. Tag-teaming Oliver is the way to go. Solo is hard. We also received word yesterday that our request for additional hours of service through the school district is being positively considered. So knowing that we don't have to do this all alone is an incredible boost. I am also feeling very fortunate that we haven't had to battle for the funding for his program. Oliver is the first child in our city to receive these services and so they consider him a \"test case\". I don't mind as long as it keeps working in our favor. Both kids fell into a hard sleep at 7pm and I had the delight of being able to curl up with each of them for the last few moments before their breathing became heavy with sleep. When I crawled into Oliver's bear bed he put my hand over his and laid his cheek cool against mine. He was asleep within moments.

What a year it has been in our small green house! 2005 will probably always be known to us as the year of Autism, which is particularly sad because it was also the year that our Sammy was born. Sam was born at home, after only 3 hours of mostly easy labor and was welcomed into the arms of each family member in turn. It was the one shining moment of the year. I haven't been the best mother to baby Sam. All the kisses and hugs and tickles that were lavished on Oliver as a baby have been almost an after-thought with Sam. I know that all mothers of two children feel that the infancy of their second slips by faster than it did for the first -- but Sam has been almost completely overshadowed by autism. I haven't enjoyed the moments I've spent putting him to sleep because I am just desperate for him to  be  asleep. The minutes I spend walking and rocking him are minutes when Oliver is wandering aimlessly around the house or posted in front of the TV. The times when I should be oohing and aahing over his developmental milestones are times I have been focusing on trying to figure out how to get Oliver to milestones that he has missed. New Year's Resolution #1: Spend more time enjoying Sammy. He is a gift of love and laughter and he needs us as much as we need him. 2005 was also the year that two neighbors, women I barely knew, offered me solace, hope, strong embraces, and ice cream in the middle of the afternoon. It was the year that people started referring to their own children as normal. As in: \"Well, my kid is normal but . ...\" And it was the year that a perfect stranger turned to me and said: \"Did you ever think he might have autism?\" And it was the year I lost faith in the medical establishment. 2005 was the year I quit my job. And the year I learned what it really means to be a mother. It was the year that old friends and some family members have disappeared -- or perhaps, not knowing what to say, they have remained silent. Same difference. And it was the year that some friendships blossomed and nurtured me when I needed it most. It was the year of the diet. And the year of the poop. And it was the year that I learned that when you just don't know whether to laugh or cry you should always choose laughter.

{"date": "December 20, 2005", "body": "\nIt's not like you think. Autism, that is. And that's what I want people to know. I have been thinking lately about disclosure. How open should I be about Oliver? At what point do I tell people that my son has autism? What do I want people to know about life with Oliver? What goal do I have in mind when I share this important fact of our life with people? Shortly after we were given the diagnosis in early August of this year, I took Oliver to his pediatrician's office for his 3-year check-up. In the examination room a nurse sat down with us, Oliver's file in front of her, and asked if there was anything specific that we wanted to talk to the doctor about. \"Well, Oliver was just a few weeks ago diagnosed with autism and so I guess I have some questions about that.\" I remember that my face turned red because I still wasn't used to saying these things out loud. No reaction from the nurse but she made a note on the file and then, without looking up, started reading questions to me from the standard child development checklist. Does he do this. Does he do that. Can he do X, Y, and Z. As the questioning proceeded I squared my shoulders, straightened my back, firmed my jaw a bit more and willed myself not to cry. I looked directly at her and answered \"no\" every time. I couldn't believe she was putting me through this drill. After I had answered all but one question negatively I could see that the nurse's face had grown alarmed. She flipped through some pages in the file until she found the check-list presented at Oliver's two-year appointment. \"But he was right on track last year at this time.\" \"I told you, he has Autism. He started to lose all those skills around the age of two. In retrospect I think he started regressing around 18 months.\" The nurse left, looking shocked, and the doctor came in, pronounced Oliver fit as a fiddle and looked blankly at me when I questioned him about autism as an autoimmune disease and about the root of Oliver's GI problems. I felt completely adrift -- and slightly assaulted -- as I dressed Oliver and gathered our things to go. When I approached the business desk to get my receipt all of the nurses and receptionists were noticeably quiet. No one looked at us and I felt as though I were intruding on a private conversation. The nurse who had been with us earlier was standing to one side looking at her feet. \"Oh,\" I thought. \"She told them all and now they feel sorry for me.\" My guess was confirmed when the receptionist looked up at me with the unmistakeable look of pity on her face. I squared my shoulders once again, looked into my son's beautiful face, looked back at the woman and thought: \"I will NOT accept your pity.\" I took my son, whom they knew nothing about except for that goddamn awful word 'Autism', and left. The shame and hurt and fury that I felt that day -- and everytime someone refuses to look me in the eye because they feel embarrassment or pity for me -- has stayed with me. It is burned into my psyche. But the truth is that I was very fragile at that point. The diagnosis was still so new. And I, like so many people, knew of autism mostly from what I had picked up in the media over the years -- and that picture is, indeed, scary. But what I was having trouble sorting out, even in those early stages of grief, was that the picture that the media gives us about Autism has very little to do with our Oliver. If the people who look at me with pity -- or who can't look at me at all -- knew Oliver, they would know why I count myself so lucky in life. I haven't gone around telling people about Oliver. People who know us well know that Oliver has autism. But I hardly ever talk about it with anyone other than Nik, Oliver's teachers and therapists. And then of course, there is this blog, which is a very public chronicle of our lives with Oliver and the subject of autism. The more I learn about autism and the more I live and grow with Oliver, the greater my urge to educate people. I am so proud of our boy and I find myself telling more and more people. \"My son has autism.\" And it's not like they think. It's not like I thought. My son Oliver has autism.

Hope is something that I hold to very tightly. I protect it; I nurture it.

The line between being disappointed in not being able to share something, like  halloween , about which I have some preconceived idea, and being disappointed  in   Oliver , is just too devastatingly close. Oliver has been thrilling me lately with little explosions of speech that are so clear and in context that when I hear him from another part of the house I have a hard time grasping that it is actually him. The feeling of hearing his voice so strong and clear is pure and utter joy. It renews me. When I picked him up from pre-school yesterday his aide, the teacher and the OT excitedly told me that they had introduced a game similar to Duck, Duck, Goose only this one was about Snowmen. Without prompting Oliver got up and tapped each kid on the head and said, \"Snowman\". He also sat in circle time for 25 minutes, which is a record for him. Hearing these little anecdotes and reading the daily communication notes and progress reports keeps me going and I think, energizes the rest of Team Oliver. It is six months now since Autism has come to occupy me. Having left my job to focus on Oliver, it is now my predominant occupation. I wake up thinking about it, fall asleep at night having just closed the cover on the latest book, and turn the word over in my head a million times in between. I am getting good at sifting through the theories and hypotheses; separating the wheat from the chaffe. I have learned to use Oliver as my guidepost, weighing and measuring the advice of the \"experts\" against what I know to be true of Oliver. Learning to trust myself, to trust my intuition has been a hard won achievement. So much of that was wiped out when we received the diagnosis. Why didn't I catch it earlier? How could I have let him slip so quietly away from us without even really noticing? Why had my instincts failed me? In one of my very  first entries  in this blog, I wrote about how I felt that I had found myself in a liminal state of motherhood. This is true less and less. I am finding my footing and feel much less vulnerable. I still have a ways to go but holding on to hope and learning to be thankful for where we are today is giving me a good solid place to move on from.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/01/on-motherhood-instincts-and-hope.html", "title": "\nOn Motherhood, Instincts and Hope\n"},
{"date": "January 25, 2006", "body": "\nThe diet that is. When I first started researching autism after Oliver was diagnosed I read about the gastrointestinal problems that affect many kids on the spectrum. I recalled a concern that I had a year earlier when Oliver's digestive system never seemed to recover from his one and only bout with ill health (which occurred, incidentally, almost immediately after receiving his last round of vaccinations -- but that is neither here nor there). I mentioned it to the pediatrician once over the course of that summer and again brought it up at his 2 year well-baby appointment 6 months later. My concerns were dismissed both times and since he seemed otherwise healthy I didn't think anything more about it. A year later things had changed: Oliver had autism. The pediatrician was still dismissive of my concerns but I needed to feel like I was doing something -- anything -- that might help. After reading and reviewing what was available on the internet, and talking with people who had advice to offer, we decided to embark on a trial of the  Specific Carbohydrate Diet . The SCD is pretty restrictive: no grains of  any  kind. No sweetners but honey. No soy. No a lot of things. It sounds daunting and it was. But we chose the SCD over the more standard GFCF diet because of it's promise to  heal  the intestinal tract by removing what is causing the trouble and allowing healthy bacteria to flourish so that the body can repair itself. After a year without symptoms the foods that have been restricted can be slowly re-introduced. So in the short term the diet can seem overwhelming but in the long-term it seems worth a chance if it promotes healing and will allow Oliver to have a somewhat \"normal\" diet therafter. We have been on the diet now for almost 3 months and have truely seen changes. Without going into too much detail I can say that we have seen about 75% improvement. I expect that will improve even more now that we have found a way to get him to eat the yogurt that is an integral part of the diet. I've also found ways to make the cooking and food preparation easier for me, thanks to experience and a wonderful food advisor. I am also lucky in that Oliver is a good eater. He always has been. From the time we first introduced solid foods at 7 months he has loved food. On the SCD  everything  is natural, whole, healthy, and mommy-made. And it isn't a problem to get him to eat it. (Unlike the resident teen-ager in our house!!) But Oliver's love of food is also the reason I hate the diet (and maybe hate is too strong a word). Like any other kid in America Oliver loves pizza and candy and ice cream and these are among the things that he can't have. When we are at home it is no problem because he just naturally reaches for fruit when he wants a treat. But today, for example, his pre-school program has a fieldtrip to the pizza parlor where each kid will make their pizza and then gets to eat it. Everyone, that is, except for Oliver. And did I mention that he LOVES pizza? So I feel mean. Denying Oliver, who asks for so little in life, does not come easily to me. I know it is for his health. I know it is (theoretically) just for a year. And I know it is tied up with my own warped ice-cream-as-emotional-salve coping mechanisms. But still. I sent him to school today with every yummy treat I could think of packed in his little back pack. Three months down. Nine to go.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.com/gettingstarted/science.html"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/01/love-it-hate-it.html", "title": "\nLove it. ...

I have no idea what was so funny but it must have been really something considering the gales of squeals and giggles coming from his room. I've only recently read that \"inappropriate\" laughter is an indicator of autism and I'm sure that is well-documented and said with good reason. But I don't care; I like it. No, I love it when he does that. It is not, in my mind, a sign of pathology. It is a sign of Spring, of Hopefulness, of Character, of Light, and that there are good things that have happened to my boy in his short years with us. That there are good things to come. With any other kid I might have gone into his room and, considering the hour, demanded: \"What's so funny?\" But with Oliver I didn't need to do that. Maybe, just maybe, the laughter  is  the message.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/01/whats-so-funny-anyway.html", "title": "\nWhat's So Funny, Anyway?\n"},

He was standing in front of me in his bedroom in the early afternoon and I was quizzing him about his body parts: \"What's this?\" I asked him, first in English and then in German. He could name every part in both languages -- even unusual parts like lips, cheek, tongue, elbow, neck. ... Now the only two body parts I know he can say are 'nose' and 'eye' and neither one would he say in response to a question. The word 'nose' is used only as part of a script from Bob the Builder and the word 'eye' only to say: \"I have something in my eye.\" At one time Oliver could also tell me the names of all the shapes and a few colors. He could tell me what sounds the animals make. He could also name about a dozen differnt kinds of vehicles: mail truck, milk truck, tow truck, bulldozer, tanker, tractor, bicycle, motorcycle. ... now he can say truck, car and occassionally bicycle. So where did all of that stuff go? Is it still in there where he can access it? What happened that made it so hard to say those words when it seemed effortless before? I'm not really asking for answers because I don't believe anyone knows.

{"date": "January 23, 2006", "body": "\nSo what is pretend play anyway? And would I know it if I saw it? One of the deficit areas identified as a trait of autism is the lack of imaginative play. But for kids who are mostly non-verbal, like my Oliver, how do we know what is going on in their minds and that it doesn't qualify as \"imaginative\"? Since he can't tell us what he is thinking we watch his actions and draw conclusions. My conclusions sometimes differ from those of the others and I am only just learning to trust my intuition (and my own eyes!). But in the past, conversations with his lead therapist (whom I have grown to trust a lot) went something like me describing an action of Oliver's and then posing the question: \"So, does that qualify as pretend play?\" or \"Does that count as an initiation?\" Oliver loves Thomas the Train -- or any train, really -- but with the TtT franchise and parents and grandparents who are willing to fork over, say, $19.99 for a train because finally there is something that captures his interest, he tends to have a lot of these items: books, videos and a growing collection of trains. Thomas videos are responsible for a lot of the repeated speech that we hear around the house. He doesn't repeat the narrative that George Carlin provides but his own spontaneous narrative that emerged the first few times he watched the videos and now repeats even when the video isn't on. But there is another thing that I have noticed lately that has me intrigued. Oliver will act out scenes from his favorite videos -- which right now happen to be TtT and Frosty the Snowman. Using play doh and his toy trains Oliver will stage scenes from the TtT video. Likewise he will use an old hat when he is reinacting scenes from Frosty. I haven't yet asked the therapist about it and I don't think I will. Okay, so it is scripted and repetitive, but  still . He is using everyday items to represent the pictures that are captured by his mind and that symbolic thinking has got to be at least a building block for the imagination, wouldn't you say? After coming to understand the playdoh dynamic I have been carefully observing Oliver for other signs of imaginative play and the conclusion I have come to is that it is  impossible  for me to know what is going on in that little mind of his. Just because he doesn't often play with toys in the same manner that other kids do does not mean that he doesn't have a rich imaginative life playing out in his head. (And even if he doesn't -- so what? I work with plenty of people who don't have an ounce of imagination!) I know that we all use lables and categories and types to understand our experiences, to navigate through life, and to communicate and share these things with others. But I suppose I am only starting to understand that these categories are fluid, dynamic, shifting and contextual. And most of all that they are created by people who have an imperfect understanding of the complexities that they are describing. I was looking for a picture to add to this because I haven't posted one in awhile and I came across a series of photos that I took this fall when we went to a corn maze. Oliver loved the makeshift \"drums\" and it took me about 15 minutes to realize that he was acting out a scene from a bert and ernie video where ernie keeps bert awake by playing the drums. We tried to get him interested in some other activities but the last photo shows tells you how successful we were.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/01/is-it-my-imagination-or.html", "title": "\nIs it my imagination, or. ...?\n"},

So, call me an ostrich if you must but this is one decision that, for the moment, is being made by default. Today I am taking him- one month late because I couldn't face it a month ago - to the peds office for his \"well baby\" visit. My  last visit  there left me feeling slightly bruised and I almost decided to quit going altogether. Really, the \"visits\" are just an exercise of me forking over $35 for the jab of the needle. Without the needle do I really need to spend $35 for them to tell me that he is growing and gaining as he should be? But I don't want to go to the place where bad mothers go when they die so I will take him and pay the $35 and consider myself lucky that I get  some  benefit out of our insurance.

Then I would check and re-check to make sure there was no mistake. Only then I would jump up and down, hoot and holler and then call my husband to share the news. \"Call me back as soon as you get this message,\" was what I said to the voice mail system at his office last Friday. Then I waited 10 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore and called him back. This time he answered the phone. \"You'll never believe what your incredibly wonderful, amazing, middle child just did,\" I teased. Normally, in a conversation like this we would spend the next five minutes ruling out a wide variety of feats that might include walking on the moon and deep sea diving with Bert and Ernie. But this time, Nik threw out the correct answer on the third try: \"Oliver rode his bike.\" Yes. Oliver rode his bike. We are a family that spends a lot of time on our bikes. But now that Oliver is too big to ride in his bike seat (he weighs over 40lbs!) we have been working hard to help him get the hang of peddling his tricycle. Last fall we spent many back-breaking hours walking, stooped-over, next to him showing him how to make the peddles work. But the moment we let go he stopped moving. So this spring we bought him a new bike, without the pedal-breaks, and changed tactics a bit. Using raisins as a reinforcer, we rewarded him any time he got the pedals to make the slightest bit of movement. Still, he couldn't seem to figure out that he needed to push his feet, first one, then the other, to get the pedals to work. To the outsider it might have looked like he wasn't even trying, but I kept thinking about all the complicated electrical impulses involved in peddling a bike and reminded myself that lack of movement didn't necessarily mean lack of effort. And then, for whatever reason, he just did it. He peddled the bike all the way across the front porch, followed by the sound of stunned disbelief, thunderous applause and exuberant hoots and hollers! Then he got off the bike, without any acknowledgement that he had done anything extra special, and went on to the next thing. Jennifer, the ABA therapist who was there that afternoon, just laughed and said, \"I guess he just decided it was time to ride the bike.\" There have been many moments like this in our life with Oliver, but few of them as astounding as the bike incident. We -- Oliver's parents, his therapists and teachers -- work everyday towards helping him achieve certain goals. Sometimes progress is gradual and we can track it over time; but sometimes it is like a light goes on and there! He's done it. We spent a lot of time with Oliver and his new tricycle on the sidewalk in front of our little green house this weekend. Oliver peddled in fits and starts without a raisin in sight. And Nik and I both walked around feeling like we'd just won the lottery.

{"date": "January 30, 2006", "body": "\nA series of schedule changes (early release, in-service day, field trip, sick therapists, etc.) has left Oliver a little \"off\" lately. His emotional volitility reminds me of those pre-diagnosis days when we all walked on egg-shells, not knowing what would trigger a tantrum. I often think back to a recurring, pre-diagnosis conversation that I had with RT (Resident Teenager): \"RT!\" I would yell into the next room from the kitchen, \"What are you doing?\" \"Nothing!\" \"Well then why is Oliver screaming like that?\" \"I don't know. All I did was X,Y, and Z.\" \"Well, just stop it, would you?\" Somewhere along the line, RT mostly stopped interacting with Oliver because just about every time he did it ended with a version of this conversation. And I, of course, was ever on red alert trying to head off these emotional exercises before they got started or, failing that, to distract Oliver from letting small upsets escalate into full-blown tantrums. The problem in those days, however, was that we were never really sure what would cause the breakdowns. Consequently there were a lot of things we didn't do. We didn't leave Oliver with a babysitter. We didn't visit friends. We didn't take him shopping. We didn't invite people to our home. Life came down to avoiding things that were likely to cause trouble -- which was potentially everything. But since Oliver started receiving services in late September I can probably count his tantrums on one hand and each of those were mostly attibutable to his being overly tired. Our ability to help Oliver deal with his frustrations better has stemmed from our new understanding of what lead to the tantrums and how to prepare him for the small changes that life throws at us. And the upsets these days are a far cry from those pre-diagnosis that left me clutching him in despair, both of us sobbing, exhausted and covered in vomit. His upsets now seem almost fleeting in comparison. The fact that four \"off\" days are so remarkable to me means that we are having days that are more \"on\" than \"off\" and reminds me of how far we've come in the last six months. On Sunday evening we followed through on plans we had made to invite the neighbors to our house for a get-together. After a LONG day with Oliver I had briefly thought of cancelling but didn't. I am gradually coming to see that maintaining a social environment at home is important -- and theraputic -- for  all  of us. And so for two hours that night we entertained our friends and, much to my surprise, were entertained  by  Oliver. There was no escaping to another part of the house. There was no crying or hiding or hitting or biting. Instead there was my wonderfully silly little boy who grinned and giggled and who climbed on laps and just in general had a great time. Our neighbors have seen Oliver at his worst and so I felt truely delighted to share this little boy with them. Tuesday is a school day and hopefully we are back to our normal schedule this week and the coming days will be more \"on\" than \"off\".\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/01/on-again-off-again.html", "title": "\nOn Again, Off Again\n"},
{"date": "April 07, 2006", "body": "\nSlowly but surely Oliver is becoming more tuned into his surroundings. I first noticed it in a concrete sense two weeks ago. Suddenly free one afternoon, I loaded the kids in the car and took them to a nearby hiking trail. It's not much of a trail but it does cross over a small stream and Oliver likes to stand on the weedy bank and throw stones into the water. Normally, we go as a family and so, one parent to one child, it works out. This time it was just me and the kids and I was overjoyed to find that Oliver actually responded to my request that he stop and wait for me when he got too far ahead on the trail. The first time he did it I thought it must be some sort of fluke but sure enough he responded two or three more times when I had to call out to him. Since then I've noticed that he also responds more frequently to other requests throughout the day. Curiously, this \"progress\" is coming on the heels of my own epiphany that Oliver does things in his own time. I used to think that his lack of immediate action following a request was  non -compliance, but gradually I've come to understand that I just need to be more patient. And so I wonder how many times in his short lifetime I've mis-judged his understanding and abilities because I simply haven't given him the time he needs. So, in this symbiotic family unit of ours, I find that what many (including myself) would see as progress on his part, is directly tied to progress of my own! I wonder how much these new awarenesses are tied into the change of the seasons? Spring is a time for awakenings and I certainly see signs of it everywhere I look. And in our little green house we are all walking around with a bounce in our step -- figuratively as well as literally as I spent the greater part of last Thursday evening assembling  this . Oliver has taken an occasional interest in it -- especially when he is supposed to be sleeping -- and Sam LOVES it. We also recently purchased our tickets for Switzerland, where we will vacation this summer at the home of Nik's mother. We skipped our annual trip last year because of everything going on with Oliver and the new baby. The last time we were there Oliver was just 18 months old and still hitting all of his milestones as far as we were aware. We are taking one of Oliver's favorite therapists with us (She will be newly graduated and has agreed to stay on with us for a year before heading to graduate school to formally study ABA. ) and so I am hoping that the trip will be relaxing and enjoyable for all of us. It is certainly well-deserved!

{"date": "October 05, 2005", "body": "\n\"I'm Stuck\" says Oliver appropriately anytime he is kept from doing what he really wants to do, like leap out of the car and run up the stairs to Grandma's house. He says this to let me know that I should help him out of his seatbelt and quick! Or, he says, \"I'm stuck in the muck\" if he really wants to do something and is being restrained from  ever  doing it. Like jumping into the brackish, spoiled water of the creek that runs by a few blocks from our house. And I've got to hand it to Oliver. He has only a few words but they are well chosen. Even the sound of the word 'stuck' makes it seem an unfortunate place to be. Over the last so many days since Autism, I often find myself wondering how much each of us has become stuck. I find that we are in a true liminal state both as a family and as individuals. We're not quite the family we were and we haven't yet found how all of these pieces will fit together to create the family that will see us through. And as individuals: mother, father, brother, we  haven't yet learned how to fill those roles in this new context. For my own part in all of this I have had to stand up straight, look myself in the mirror and give my self a good talking to more than once. I am not the Reader's Digest mom who will overcome great adversity through some heroic sense of inner strength. I would like to be that mom but I'm just not. Shortly after Oliver's diagnosis I found myself struggling mightly with self-pity, frustration and anger. This is not the life I signed up for. But this is the life I was given and I was entrusted with Oliver for which I am profoundly thankful. And so I have come to understand that my job as a mother is to have love and faith and hope and humor. With those four things practiced daily I hope I will emerge from my state of becoming as the kind of mother that Oliver needs and deserves. The verdict is most definately still out. If our life were a movie of the week, however, Oliver would most certainly be the hero. I can't  imagine the daily struggles that he faces and yet he manages to spend a good part of each day smiling and, we believe, happy. Since Oliver's language is so limited it is hard to know many things about him. Parenting isn't an exact science even with typical children, but when your child is autistic and largely non-verbal you find yourself making a lot of guesses and assumptions. When Oliver was first diagnosed we comforted ourselves that at least he was physically very healthy and, we assumed, fairly happy. Upon hearing this from us, however, one of Oliver's therapists drew our attention to the writings of those who are able to describe how tormenting it is to be \"trapped\" within oneself by autism. This conversation has lingered in the back of my mind and each day I realize a little bit more that I don't really have a good understanding of how Oliver experiences the world or just how stuck he really feels. That realization has been hard. But I continue to believe that he is, overall, a fairly happy little boy and have hope that one day he will be able to tell us for himself. I decided to start this blog as a way of recording and sharing Oliver's progress. The Baby's Book of Milestones that my mother gave me when I was expecting Oliver is sitting on a shelf gathering dust. I realized the other day that it had gotten shuffled to the back about the same time that Oliver stopped having milestones to record. I'm afraid to take the book out now to look at it and realize all of the things that Olver used to do and doesn't anymore. The change in him over the last year, and the loss of so many skills, has been tremendous. I think I will burn that book! Instead I will try to capture here the milestones of our family as we grow into what we will be and of our heroic little boy who it seems is stuck from time to time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P9040138.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P8230114.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P82301141.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/im-stuck.html", "title": "\n\"I'm Stuck!\"\n"},

I didn't see it because I had stepped away for a minute to help another child on a swing so I wasn't sure how badly he was hurt. Oliver has a high tolerance for pain and rarely cries over minor injuries. But when I heard that shrill panic-hurt cry my heart did flip-flops. My frantic \"Where does it hurt?\" refrain went unanswered and I searched him up and down for what might be a broken limb. Sickness, injury, pain, fear. These are things that are really hard to mother when you aren't sure about the diagnosis. Two minutes later he was fine and stealing someone's strawberries. The scene of the slide incident was a birthday party at the home of one of the children from our playgroup. I was very hesitant to attend with Oliver because he doesn't do particularly well in that kind of environment and also because I wasn't sure I was up to spending a lot of time with a group of typical three-year olds. It is too easy to compare. But Oliver did really well: no tantrums, no non-compliance, no retreating to a remote corner of the yard. In fact, he was right in there playing on the playset with the rest of the kids. Oh, and I also realized again that three-year olds are just weird, autism or no. I shouldn't have been so worried. In fact it was good for me because I tend to now pathologize just about everything the poor kid does. And what is normal afterall?

{"date": "October 09, 2005", "body": "\nI've learned a lot about autism in the past few months and even more about Oliver during that time. Autism has come crashing into our home and at times it is difficult to think of anything else. But there is more to Oliver than autism. He is still my sweet little three-year old boy with his own likes and dislikes and a tremendously loveable personality. I know this and I hope that others see it as well. I don't want Oliver to be defined by his autism and so I have been cautious about revealing his diagnosis to many. But his behavior is at its worst when he is around people he doesn't know well or in new surroundings, and it is getting easier to distinguish him from his typically developing peers. So I wonder if it is hard for others to see him as I do. Some might wonder how it took us so long to figure out that there was something \"wrong\" with Oliver. Most cases of autism are diagnosed between the ages of eighteen months and three years. Prior to that time parents will report that their child was developing normally. Oliver is no exception. He hit all of his milestones at or ahead of schedule until about the age of two. But then I started to notice that his language skills were lagging behind that of his peers. We had been raising Oliver to be bi-lingual; Nik speaking to Oliver only in his native Swiss German, and I in English. In the beginning we thought he was just taking extra long to make sense of the two languages. There were other clues though. Oliver never really tried to put on his shoes or to take his clothes on and off as other kids his age did. If I wanted him to do something I usually had to physically get him to do it. And then at about age two and a half I started to notice that he would not respond to me if I called his name or said something to him. He was unusually focused on whatever he was doing. He also started to gravitate away from people when there was a lot of commotion. At Christmas last year he famously told my sister and her family \"It's time to go home now!\" when he had had enough from their rowdy crew of three children. When we went to the playground he always wanted to roam the nearby woods and I spent the entire time dragging him back, trying to get him interested in what the other kids were doing. And sure, there were tantrums but nothing that didn't match what the other parents in our play-group were experiencing with their toddlers. Every time I mentioned my concerns to someone they gave me reasons to feel better. There was the bi-lingual thing. And some kids are just slower to develop than others. I wanted to believe there was nothing wrong. Even after he was diagnosed I had the daily recurring thought, hope, that maybe they were wrong. If a stranger were to sit in a room with Oliver he or she might not be able to detect anything out of the ordinary -- except for that persistent gibberish of his that takes the place of understandable language. I mentioned in my first post that Oliver has quite a program in place and we have been so impressed with what I like to think of as Team Oliver. Besides the crew of people at his school, Oliver has four therapists who regularly visit our home to work with him either 1:1 or 2:1. The therapists, Oliver and our family and make a strong team. Lindsey, one of our favorite therapists, works both in the classroom and the in-home program. She is incredibly positive and has been particularly adept at integrating herself into our household three days a week. On Friday mornings when I am home with the boys our schedule involves taking an excursion to a local bagel shop. Oliver and I had been doing this regularly for a year and I saw no reason to stop. Last Friday as we settled into our regular booth with the boys, Oliver was already in deep conversation with his bagel and Lindsey told me how much fun she has working with Oliver. \"He has an amazing personality. He is such a pleasure to work with.\" At first I thought that Lindsey was a skilled therapist for all ages since she seemed to be speaking directly to my concerns of late. When your child is first diagnosed with autism many things come into focus; you see habits and behaviors with a new understanding and you wonder if anyone will ever be able to see past the autism to the boy. Lindsey's comment was much more powerful and healing than she probably realized. And yes, she is a very good therapist. Oliver is an amazing boy. And Team Oliver is strong.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P4110016.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/seeing-boy.html", "title": "\nSeeing the Boy\n"},
{"date": "October 17, 2005", "body": "\nThere's more to humor than telling a joke and since Oliver is mostly non-verbal he tends to express his funny side using the tricks of physical comedy. But he does have one joke that I'd like to share: Our favorite bedtime story is Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss. On almost every page there is a picture of Sam-I-Am holding a plate of, what else? Green eggs and ham. With every turn of the page Oliver takes great delight in drawing his hand back to his chest and then, with finger outstreatched, land arrow-like on the picture of the ham and say: \"That's a fish!\" with laughing eyes but a straight face. To this I respond in an outraged voice: \"No! That's a HAM!\" Sometimes we repeat this two or three times per page, growing increasingly loud and fast as we near the end of the book. Then finally, when the story is over and we turn to the inside back-cover, Oliver's finger poised over the picture, he says: \"That's a. ...\" then he lets his finger fly, stabbing the page and triumphantly calls out: \"HAM!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P9040130.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/thats-no-fish.html", "title": "\nThat's no Fish!\n"},
{"date": "October 12, 2005", "body": "\nToday was the kind of day that makes you think that if you can have one like this every now and then that you will be able to get through the other kind just fine. It was A Very Good Day from start to just about finish. Oliver awoke with smiles to spare and we were early enough waking that we could actually spend an extra ten minutes in bed playing under the covers. The smell of a sleepy three year old boy in the morning is one of those things I wish I could bottle. After playing awhile he took my hand and pulled me towards the bedroom door indicating that he was ready to eat. So we played our little game on the stairs where I pretend that I  don't want him to jump from the top step into my waiting arms three steps down. Oliver weighs about thirty five pounds now and one of these days I'm sure I won't be pretending -- but for now it is part of our morning ritual. Once in the kitchen we sat at his table and chairs, each with our \"Yummy Cake\", and sang along to our favorite Roger Day CD and Oliver snorted with laughter, as he does everytime, at the song about kissing a Rhino. Afterwards, I found his toy bus that reminds him that today is a bus day, then I wrote in his communication book -- \"PM: Oliver played with Luke, took a bath and went to bed in a good mood at 8pm. AM: Woke at 6:30 smiling and happy.\" We then waited for the bus together sitting on the porch step in the brisk morning air. When it arrived he got on without hesitation and just a short look back at me from the top step. His look was neither fearful nor happy and as the doors closed and he took his seat I couldn't help but wonder what riding the bus is like for him. He is only on the bus for about five minutes -- you can practically see the school from our house -- but he has always liked buses (\"That's a bus!\" is one of his few phrases) so we thought it would be a positive way to start each day. Seeing that look though made me wonder; It's troubling to me when I can't read him. Nik typically picks Oliver up from school at noon but I had some extra time today so I went to watch him on the playground. Lindsey was there and she has a real talent for drawing Oliver out. Today he was running with some of his classmates around the castle, up the ladder and down the slide. After coming down, the kids stood looking up inside the bright yellow tube covering the slide and laughing as the next child whooshed out. It has been so long since Oliver even acknowledged other children that I kept squinting to make sure that it was really him. And it was! There was the boy with the killer smile  playing  on the playground. As we were leaving Lindsey reported that Oliver was \"Mr. Verbal\" today and that he had no trouble transitioning from the bus to the classroom. I was particularly happy about this last thing because a walk that should take 5 minutes has sometimes taken Oliver forty-five. And finally, when we got home this evening, after Oliver had spent the afternoon at his \"Gram's House\", he came right in, sat down, took off his shoes and socks and then went off to play as if it were nothing. Now I don't know why some days seem so good and full of progress and other days are, well. ... not. But we've had our string of Very Bad Days lately -- days when strangers have looked at me and I'm sure they were thinking: \"Lady, can't you do something about your kid!\" And days that I can't even write about because I can't find the humor in them yet -- so I think we were about due to have this one Very Good Day. And I feel sure that it will carry us through until the next one, which can't be long to follow.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/PIC00005.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/very-good-day.html", "title": "\nA Very Good Day\n"},
{"date": "October 14, 2005", "body": "\nOliver's speech is extremely limited, consisting of about eighty or so words and phrases that he uses often throughout the day to communicate his most basic needs. Most of what he says is clear and understandable to anyone. Some of  what he says is understandable only to those of us who know him well enough to understand the context. But a lot of Oliver's vocalizations are just gibberish; what we think of as his own private l anguage. I like to imagine that Oliver has a lot to say about the world but that he hasn't yet mastered the complicated steps involved in expressive speech -- turning his thoughts into words that mean something to the rest of us. Sometimes Oliver will cock his head to the side at a certain angle, look me in the eye and deliver a short soliloquey two or three \"sentences\" in length. Usually if I don't respond the way he wants me to -- and I rarely do -- he will repeat, syllable for syllable what he just said. Now I'm pretty sure that there is no wordlike meaning to the sounds that he is making but everything about it sounds like it ought to be some language somewhere. In fact, I often feel that if I just listened carefully enough, or if he repeated it often enough, that I would eventually get what he is saying. One other thing about Oliver: he loves his reflection. I'm not sure when that started really, but as long as I can remember he has enjoyed interacting with his own reflection. This strikes me now as ironic because autism is characterized by a lack of ability to interact socially. Children like Oliver become so stressed in social situations that they withdrawl inward to dramatic degrees. So for pleasure, and for relief from the daily demands of life, Oliver will seek out reflective surfaces. Once he finds his own face looking back at him he dances and makes silly faces and talks up a storm using Oliver-speak. I enjoy watching him at these times because somehow I think it gives me a little window into his world. Lately Oliver has been repeating the same phrase throughout the day. I noticed it yesterday in particular when he was talking to his reflection in the oven door: \"That's a woo-wee!\" he would say with apparent delight. \"That's a woo-wee!\" The he would go tearing around the bottom half of the house until he wound up in front of the oven again. This was one of those times when I really thought I ought to understand what he was saying but it was like a puzzle with a piece missing. This has happened before and I have been so pleased when I discovered that indeed the utterance  had  meaning. Like the time he repeated, \"Beongs seeyu\" over and over again when we were playing. For weeks he would say this phrase, usually when he handed something to me. Then one day I happened to be with him at his \"Gram's House\" when she gave him a quick lesson about something she didn't want him to touch: \"See Oliver,\" she said, \"this belongs to me.\" Then she handed him some play object and said, \"This belongs to you.\" Or \"Beongs seeyou\" in Oliver-speak. When I was pregnant with Oliver, and even during his babyhood, I remarked often to Nik that I would have liked to fast forward to a time when Oliver was talking so that I could hear what he had to say. \"Beongs seeyou\" and \"That's a woo-wee\" aren't exactly what I had in mind. But I'll take them because knowing how much Oliver struggles to find his words, I believe they sound like poetry. Even if most of his \"words\" don't have meaning in the way that the rest of understand vocabulary, I think he  is  trying to communicate something to us. And with a little luck, and if we pay close attention, we might eventually get it. During the bustle of trying to get two fussy kids into bed and asleep tonight I was completely absorbed by the tasks at hand: bathing, dressing, brushing teeth and telling Oliver that his head belongs on the pillow for the one millonth time. He was up and out of bed time and again, stomping around his room with the now familiar refrain: \"That's a woo-wee!\" I was about to groan and pull the door shut behind me when I heard the train, passing a few blocks from our house, sound out the missing piece of the puzzle. \"Yes, Honey, that's a train. Now will you  please  put your head on the pillow!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/PA1602041.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/thats-woo-wee.html", "title": "\n\"That's a Woo-Wee\"\n"},
{"date": "October 20, 2005", "body": "\nNo pre-school today meant that Oliver and I were able to adventure together-- just the two of us. We haven't had much opportunity to do that since Sam was born. I had a bunch of errands and missions to accomplish for work and thought (hoped) Oliver would do fine if I brought him along. First on our list was a trip to Costco to buy some food for a reception tonight. Normally Oliver likes going to Costco, likes going to any store, until it comes time to check out. The check-out line has been the scene of many a tantrum so taking him to a store is ususally a two person job. One person pays while the other distracts him or takes him outside. The problem comes when we put things on the conveyor belt. Usually no matter how I prep him he cannot see ahead to when he will get the things back. They are simply being taken from him. Today I arrived at Costco and started loading up my cart when suddenly a cold fear crept into my heart. I alone would have to get Oliver through the check out line. I walked through the aisles loading things into my cart all the while thinking how I might get through this situation with a minimum of tears and stares from strangers. Autism forces many a creative approach to parenting. But I was coming up short; my bag of tricks was empty.  I walked around aimlessly for a bit wondering if I should just abandon my cart and come back another time. But I was reluctant to do that because it doesn't help Oliver and I would just have to make another trip. So instead I started the trek to the front of the store, all the while leaning over the cart and saying, \"Oliver? We are going to give these things to the lady but she will give them back. I don't want any crying. We will get everything back. Then we will go to 'Gram's House.\" Over and over again I repeated this like a mantra. When we arrived at the front of the store I deliberately chose a long-ish line and pointed out to Oliver how everyone got their things back after paying. And I braced myself. Oliver cried out once when I put the things on the conveyor belt but I held him and repeated the mantra to him the whole time. I'm sure the sales clerks thought I was a bit whacky but it was working so I kept it up until Oliver was safely back in the cart with all our newly acquired goods.

{"date": "October 24, 2005", "body": "\nWe have a new at-home therapist who will round out Oliver's service program. He now receives therapy for various amounts of time six days a week from five different therapists. This is in addition to the specialists at school: his teacher, the OT, the speech pathologist, etc. As we have been filling in the blanks of his program I've had an on-going dialogue with his lead therapist: How do we know if he is being too taxed? How do we know if he can handle more? Research indicates that a 40 hour/week program of behavioral therapy yeilds the best results. What family can sustain that kind of program? What else can we do to create the on-going learning environment that he needs? It is something to get used to: inviting people into our home on an almost daily basis and integrating them into our daily life. Most of the therapists are young, college-aged women, each with their own strenghts and abilities, but all of whom have a love for working with children like Oliver. They also know more about autism than I do as they have each worked with children who are variously affected with ASD. So far I have been impressed with their enthusiasm, energy and inventiveness -- all of which are valuable assests in teaching children who need to be constantly motivated and reinforced. Oliver has adjusted well to the new routine at home and seems to enjoy working with each of the therapists. I have also come to realize how important it is to, as much as possible, make every moment count as a learning experience for Oliver. There is so much that typical children learn from their environment and through imitation that he just doesn't pick up. The best way to teach new skills has so far been the \"hand over hand\" technique in which we sit behind him and physically get his hands to do what they need to in order to accomplish whatever task: using utensils, turning on faucets, coloring, etc. It doesn't take many repetitions before Oliver has picked up new skills and the sense of reward it gives us -- and him -- is golden. It is a different life than I had imagined for Oliver. I always believed I would provide for him the unstructured full-of-fun childhood that I remembered --a far cry from the one that is taking shape. Because he is so young, the teaching methods are mostly play-based but they still require him to work at accomplishing certain goals. During therapy sessions I keep busy in the next room -- out of sight but not earshot -- and I often hear the now familiar phrase: \"First work, then play!\" It is a strange that it is my three year old son to whom they are talking. But with the right therapists the work turns out to be fun and this is hopefully what will keep motivating Oliver, and us, to move forward.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/moving-forward.html", "title": "\nMoving forward\n"},
{"date": "September 10, 2008", "body": "\nWe're starting off slowly with the homeschooling. Mostly because I didn't do enough planning so I only have a very fuzzy sketch of what I want to accomplish this year. I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how to adapt the  Enki  materials to accommodate Oliver's developmental needs. I'm hoping all will be a little more clear if we just dive in. Today we spent some time reading books of Oliver's choosing. He tends to gravitate to the same books all the time so I put most of his preferred reading materials out of sight and had him choose from books that are familiar but not often read. I'm hoping that this will help when I start to introduce completely new materials because traditionally he is very resistant to new books. This was somewhat successful, although we had to get through a bit of crying at the start when Oliver kept insisting that he only wanted to watch TV. At least he did eventually focus on the books. I read and he turned the pages. When my finger rested on pictures he labeled a few of them spontaneously so I was very happy with that. Also, once I made an excuse to set the book down and when I picked it up again I held it upside down, Oliver took the book from me and turned it the right way and then waited for me to begin reading again. Instead of our adventure walk I incorporated some vigorous dancing. Oliver loves music and loves to dance so that seemed to work well. I know that movement helps all of us to focus a bit more during the day. I read somewhere that the effects of exercise last up to seven hours on the brain so I hope to do this as early in the day as possible. Part of the  Enki  approach is to incorporate movements that require the child to cross the mid-line to help get the two hemispheres of the brain working together. I didn't manage to do that but I have some ideas percolating for next time. Then we segued into some work on rhythm. One of the foundational objectives in  RDI  is that a child should be able to repeat a rhythm of three beats so I was testing that a little bit. He can do two with no problem but I'm not sure about three beats. But he had some fun with the musical instruments so I think we will make that a regular feature of our mornings. When we were cleaning up the play area I happened to pull out the Mr. Potato Head. Oliver has never really shown an interest in this kind of toy but at least today he didn't run away. I was also pleased to see that he put the potato head together to actually look like a face rather than just a jumble of parts. At one point he put an arm where the nose should go and I teased him that it looked like he was building an elephant. He smiled and then replaced the arm with a nose. Then when I pulled each part of the face off to put it away I asked him to name the part and he was mostly able to, which again, really surprised me. Then we built a train track together and I only gave him a limited number of pieces. We worked together, assembly line fashion, but at the end it was obvious that the last two pieces weren't placed so it would create a loop. I used this as an opportunity to work on our  RDI  objective, which is basically that Oliver will learn to study elements of uncertainty and to use social referencing as a means get more information: yes, that's right; no, not quite, etc. -- the referencing becomes more of a monitoring tool rather than a solution. Oliver is great at referencing for information but in moments of uncertainty he tends to look to us for all the information and not try to figure things out for himself. So I was pleased that he actually took the time to try and figure out the problem rather than either running away or insisting that I fix it. He still didn't look at me to monitor my reaction but I was thrilled to see the \"studying\" part, anyway. And lastly, we worked on our alphabet letter sounds. I'm planning to take one letter per week and work on the sound that it makes and associate it with various words. I devised a little rhythmic song about the sound of the letter A and together we hopped down the stairs singing the song. I've learned that Oliver responds to things really well if I put them to a rhythm so I'm curious to see if this is effective. When we were hopping I would sometimes stop singing at the end of the verse and he would have no trouble filling in the last word or two so I'm hopeful. Oh, and on the way to pick up  Sami  at  pre -school we drove by a nearby train yard and Oliver and I walked a bit on the tracks and checked out the cars that weren't in use. So, maybe that counts as our first 'field trip'? Its nice to start seeing how all the things that we would do ordinarily can have a greater value once I start drawing connections between them. Altogether, it was a pretty nice day and despite my fuzzy map I'm feeling optimistic.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/09/homeschooling-notes.html", "title": "\nHomeschooling Notes\n"},
{"date": "October 18, 2005", "body": "\nThese are the odds. According to a number of sources one out of every 166 children will develop an Autism Spectrum Disorder. That number increases to something like one in every 100 for male children who are more likely to become afflicted. If one child in a family develops ASD, other children born to that family are fifty percent more likely to develop autism. Ask any six knowledgeable people what causes autism and you are likely to get at least as many answers. There are no known genetic markers that can predict if a child will develop autism and it is not something that can be detected at birth. But most people agree that those who will develop autism are genetically predisposed to do so and that something environmental triggers the condition. Some argue that the environmental trigger occurs during gestation and others point to events shortly after birth and during a child's infancy. No one has the answers and emotions run high at every corner of the debate. For parents who seek answers and reliable treatment options there are far more questions than answers. These things I can say with certainty: Oliver seemed to be developing typically until sometime during his second year. He has been a remarkably healthy child since birth with nary a cold or an ear-infection but became seriously ill within 24 hours of receiving his scheduled vaccinations at eighteen months. His intestinal tract never fully recovered. At his two year well-baby visit the doctor said that I shouldn't worry about it. When I repeated my concerns at his three-year visit and pressed him about autism as an auto-immune disease his eyes glazed over: \"There is no science to support the vaccine-autism hypothesis,\" he said. But then I would guess that he has to believe that. I am not a medical professional, an epidemiologist or a  scientist but I do try to read what I can on all sides of the debate with an open mind. I wish I had more conviction about the causes of autism as so many other parents seem to have; but I don't. I am, however, a mother of a child with autism and so I have a first hand frame of reference. My experiences, my observations and my instinct inform the many decisions we've had to make in the days since autism. Sometimes it would be nice to have something more to go on. A roadmap or chart of this strange new territory would be helpful. I have another son, Sam, who is now 6 months old. He was born at home and so did not receive his first vaccination shortly after birth. That choice was made by circumstance but the rest will have to be decided. With the odds that are facing us and a world of unknowns this becomes a struggle. When Oliver was a baby I used to watch him for signs of brilliance. I entertained myself by dreaming up silly and wonderful futures for him. \"Oh,\" I would say, \"Look at the way he moves his hands like that. Maybe he will grow up to be a street mime working the sidewalks of Paris. It will be a hard life but he will be happy making so many people smile and besides, it will give us a reason to vacation in Paris!\" Now I look back and wonder if those hand gestures were a sign of his more immediate future. I feel robbed of my memories. With Sam I don't look for signs of brilliance and just pray for average. But watchful and concerned I am robbed too of his babyhood. So I find myself playing the odds these days in ways I am not always comfortable with. But science and statistics are changing and evolving over time based on new knowledge. And I have come to see that there are many things in life for which the odds aren't defined. Love, hope, faith and the serendipity of friendship to name a few. These are things we are lucky enough to have in abundance and so even without roadmap or chart, at least we have our heading and for now it feels, the winds are in our favor.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/PA160188.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/166-100-50.html", "title": "\n166.         100.           50.\n"},

Oliver is naked, having just returned from the river with Poppi and the other boys, and he is eating cold pizza. Oliver finishes eating the pizza and heads over to the back door, hesitating for a moment before opening it. Once the door is open he looks over to his mother, probably knowing what she will say. Mom: \"Oliver, you need to put some pants on before you go outside.\" Oliver looks out the door. Mom: \"I think I see some behind you.\" Oliver turns and looks at the ground of the laundry room. Mom: \"I think they are on the shelf with the clean clothes.\" Olive shifts his gaze from the floor to the shelf, scans the items and chooses a pair of shorts from the middle of the stack. He puts on the shorts and mom tells him what a great job he did finding his pants among all those other clothes. ****** Just an everyday moment, right?  Well, maybe in other houses. There was a time, not long ago, when Oliver's receptive language would not have been good enough to decipher what I was saying. Getting clothes from the shelf in the laundry room is not a common task for him. In fact, the shelf folds out and normally it is tucked away out of sight. And on top of it, Oliver actually scanned the shelf for a pair of pants --- all the clothes were folded but they were not sorted, so he really had to study the pile to find what he was looking for. Our RDI objective for the moment is to help Oliver develop a studying response when presented with an uncertainty -- that he will really try to figure things out for himself.

{"date": "September 09, 2008", "body": "\n I snapped at the kids today for no reason. I was tired. They were getting on my nerves. I wanted a nap. They didn't. And I said a few choice words with great emphasis. Afterwards the whole room was quiet and after a beat Sami said: \"I'm going to give you a couple of minutes to yourself to think about this. Then I think you owe us an apology.\" Sheesh! What kind of kid am I raising? Today the skies were gray in these parts but we managed to make a few shiny moments along the way. We visited a good friend and her kids and for the second time in three days I couldn't but marvel at my new ability to just sit and chat with another adult. Neither kid needs me all that much anymore, although Oliver still can use a bit of help to focus his attention, but he manages OK for short periods of time. I also got to enjoy chatting with my friend about her pregnancy and for the first time not feel a bit of envy. My load is starting to feel balanced for the first time in oh, so long and I guess that gives me a bit of perspective on the baby thing. When we got home I basically forced the kids to take a walk with me. I tried to entice them by calling it an adventure walk but really I had to resort to drill sargent tactics. (Happily, I refrained from yelling so as to not be further chastized.) To get the kids regulated I started off by singing a song about marching like soldiers in the army. Each kid gets a chance to march out in front and after a few feet I shout stop and then we do some exercises. I'm always surprised that Oliver follows along with this as well as he does. I just have to remember to keep each part of the activity short and not make the exercises too complex. We walked in the alley that runs behind our house -- most people have big trees or fences lining their property so it always feels like such a private place. But today I was amused that an older gentleman was sitting quietly in his grape arbor and so got to watch our whole routine! I can't imagine what he thought about this mother/drill sargent lady marching her kids down the alley and making them do calisthetics!  When we finished the marching I started making a big deal about all of nature's treasures that we could find, even in the alley, if we looked closely enough. I pointed out the tiny tiny flowers in the moss, the half-eaten nut on the ground and the blue bird. Sami pointed out a couple of things, too, but what most amazed me was that Oliver showed more interest than usual in joining us to examine each of these treasures. He even half-heartedly tried to locate the bluebird that was at some distance up in the tree. Oliver is pretty good now at using his gaze to follow in a line from a pointed finger but I'm still not sure if he knows he can follow it all the way to the horizon. He tends to stop somewhere in the middle ground. We ended our walk at the cat lady's house. More properly I suppose it should be called the cat house because no lady actually lives there. The owner lives a mile away and keeps two adjacent houses on our street just for her cats!! She is around 95 years old and comes to visit and care for the cats 3-4 times a day, all year 'round. The cats seem to be in good shape but this year there were so many litters born that the neighbors are starting to complain. But my kids love to chase the kittens around the empty field behind the house. I'm planning to make this adventure walk part of my homeschooling morning once I really get into the swing of things.It will be good for both of us to get some fresh air in the morning and I'd like to get physical enough that our heart rates actually increase, but it is hard for me to get Oliver to sustain that kind of exertion unless he is jumping.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SMcsC4ztLLI/AAAAAAAAALw/m8ixZXWk1oQ/s1600-h/cricket.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/09/who-needs-jiminy-cricket.html", "title": "\nWho needs Jiminy Cricket?\n"},
{"date": "October 26, 2005", "body": "\nSometimes I get so caught up in thinking about Oliver's deficits that I forget to take note here of the many small victories that we've had over the last few weeks. One gift, if you can call it that, of autism is that nothing, even the smallest stride forward, is taken for granted. A new word or skill, or the simple act of focused play, is cause for celebration and appreciation. Oliver has learned to dress and undress himself after only a few days of prompting. We still have to sit behind him and provide occassional direction but he manages to do it fairly well and that is tremendously heartening. After donning each article he is rewarded with cheers and hugs and \"Yeah, Oliver! You did it!! What a big boy. I'm so proud of you!\" and the smile he delivers tells us that he is proud of himself. Oliver's verbal skills have also been getting more exercise lately. \"I want dinosaur.\" \"I want whistle.\" \"I want balloon.\" All of these phrases were uttered in the same hour when unplanned guests came to visit and invaded Oliver's play room taking up to play with the various articles that he then requested. Oliver's language ability is something that I have puzzled over. He seems to have a vocabulary stored in his head that rarely gets used. I haven't heard him say dinosaur in over a year but then suddenly there it was. And occassionally he will come out with a sentence that is full and understandable and clearly of his own invention. One day I was pretending that a stuff cow could make all the other noises of the animal kingdom. When I made the sheep's sound he looked at me and said: \"That's not a sheep. That's a cow!\" I was dumfounded. One day I sneezed and he said: \"Gezhundheit!\" Some days Oliver will be full of verbals that are clearly understandable and other days all of the syllables of the same words will slide together and like a secret code I have to decipher what he means. And some days he says practically nothing at all; the gibberish reigns. Why these good days and bad days? What subtle things beyond my comprehension influence him? I wish there were a guidebook written by some wizened old expert like Dr. Sears that said: \"If your child is like this, then do this.\" But there isn't and we do what we can do to piece together the clues we are given. Starting on November the First we will begin experimenting with our diet to determine if there is a possible link between what he eats and his various behaviors. I am overwhelmed at the prospect of changing our eating habits but lucky enough to have a lovely, encouraging diet \"coach\" who will help us along the way. And I am excited to see if this experiment will yeild some new clues that will help us along the way. About a year ago Oliver would run to me saying in a breathless sort of way: \"I love me!\" (meaning \"you\") and throw his arms around me. I hold the memory of that simple phrase and the feeling of his warm breath on my neck very close to my heart. There are many days when I am tempted to mourn the loss of that phrase. But mostly I feel confident that if we give Oliver all that we can find it in ourselves to give then each day will bring new victories and cause for celebration.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/small-victories.html", "title": "\nSmall Victories\n"},

I totally see why sleep deprivation is an effective form of torture. Throw a three year old into the mix and it is enough to make you kind of wish you were living in Guantanamo Bay. After years and years we still don't know why this no-sleep stuff happens or what to do to make it better. That's hard, too. But I'm ready now for this bad run to be over. I NEED it to be over.

{"date": "September 11, 2008", "body": "\nWe're hearing more and more language around these parts from a certain little boy. I'm feeling cautiously optimistic. When your child is mostly non-verbal and you know that some percentage of the population of people with autism never learn to speak, you learn to be cautious in what you hope for. The line between unrealized hopes and disappointment is just too dangerously close. And yet, each time Oliver finds a way to use words to tell me something, my hope is renewed. Awhile back, I noted that Oliver has progressed from the \"I want\" construction for \"requesting\" an item to the question: \"Can I have that?\"  Now he is sometimes substituting the word \"that\" for an item even when it isn't present. And he is modifying it with the words \"some\" or \"more\". \"Can I have more candy.\" The curious part though is that he sometimes has great difficulty retrieving the words he wants. Occasionally he will still just randomly call out: \"Water!\" when he wants a drink, to which I always tell him that he can either get it himself or he can ask me in a nice way. If it seems that he is having trouble finding the words I will help him along by soundlessly holding my lips in the position of the starting letter for each word -- and the amazing part is that once I do this he can easily get the words out to ask the question. I go round and round in my head about this approach. Am I scaffolding language for him? Making it easier for him to get the words out? Or am I putting words in his mouth? Am I teaching him that he has to ask in the \"right\" way to get what he wants. One side of this is that, well, he can't just shout out a word and expect people to run and get what he wants for the rest of his life. I love him more than sunshine and even I tire of it now and then. So, in that sense, there IS a more appropriate way to ask for something. But on the other side of it, I don't want Oliver to NOT say something because he doesn't know exactly how to say it in the \"right\" way. Anyway, I'm not sure where I'm going with this tonight except to say that it can be so frustrating  to feel excited and hopeful over something as important as communication and yet to still not know if what I'm doing is one step forward, two steps back!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/09/language.html", "title": "\nLanguage\n"},
{"date": "September 20, 2008", "body": "\nThe absolute worst thing about my husband is his looks. Well, I mean, he is handsome enough for my taste but somehow, mysteriously, he just does not appear to be aging. This is a problem because I am not afflicted with this same malady. I am most certainly aging, as any sideways glance in a mirror tells me almost daily. Not that I mind. I kind of like growing older. It's just that I never imagined myself the older woman. The thought especially didn't enter my mind because I happened to marry someone eleven years older than myself. Nik turned fifty this week and doesn't look a day over 40. I turned 39 last week and I look, well. ... I look my age. So my question is: am I going to pass him up? Are people going to start looking at us and wondering why Nik married an  older  woman? And how long before he is holding my elbow to help me cross the street? I guess only time will tell. We don't really do birthdays around here but I didn't want to let #50 go by without some kind of marker. So I bought Nik a membership in a wine club and promised that at least once a month we would host a couple of friends for a glass of wine. After so many years it is time for us to reclaim our social life. I'm ready. We're both ready. ******** Oliver is going through something that I don't even pretend to understand. His receptive and expressive language is increasing daily. This morning I set a bowl of oatmeal down in front of him, he took one look at the steam rising from the bowl and said: \"It's too hot!\" Last night we were eating pasta and he said: \"More noodles, please.\"  Then he announced: \"I want a towel,\" and walked himself over to where I keep the kitchen towels, got one and wiped his hands. On Friday, I was upstairs cleaning something when our friends arrived and rang the bell. Oliver was downstairs so I shouted to him that he should open the door. You could have knocked me over with a stack of old IEPs when he actually went to the door and let our friends in. Also, his ability to make choices by scanning the relevant information and deliberately asserting a preference, is something I see growing by leaps and bounds. Today I held two books out to him and asked him which he wanted me to read. He spent a long time shifting his gaze between the two, he reached out and touched the picture on one, then shifted his gaze to the other, took it in his hands and then looked at me expectantly. An obvious, deliberate choice. He is also beginning to take just the teeny, tiniest bit of interest in other children, especially children younger than he is. As long as they do all the work of keeping the interaction going. But still! It's something. And I drink it up every single time it happens. But there have also been some really, really rough moments. Oliver isn't prone to meltdowns, but he used to be. And I am always attuned to his psychological and physiological landscape so in that way we avoid a lot of problems, I'm sure. But lately I haven't predicted or avoided some very distressing moments for Oliver. I've always looked at Oliver's meltdowns, when they happen, as neurological episodes because that is what I believe they are.  Yet these days they do sometimes seem more like the tantrum that a two or three year old might have. Particularly when he wants something and I tell him that he can't have it, like his third popsicle in 15 minutes. It makes me wonder if we have hit some kind of developmental milestone and that he really IS reacting like a two or three year old might. So in a weird kind of way I'm happy about that prospect. ************* Sami. What can I say about Sami these days! He is a real piece of work, that one. So delightful and so, incredibly, amazingly annoying!! His questions are endless.  Endless.  And yes, I know I should be happy that I've got such a curious little  guy on my hands. I should encourage his inquisitiveness. But Man, it's hard! He has also taken to incessantly trying to get my attention whenever I'm talking on the phone or to another adult and when I finally give it to him he'll say: \"Oh, nevermind. It was nothing.\" ************* RT is 15. Do I really have to say any more? We've recently had to restrict all electronic usage to one hour per day and then just for homework. It had become so bad that he didn't even want to drag himself away from the computer long enough to eat dinner. And more than once when I thought he was taking an extra long time in the bathroom I discovered that he had taken the laptop in there with him! He thinks he's an anarchist and is constantly trying to bait us into arguing about 9-11 conspiracy theories. He also believes I am repressive and unreasonable because I will not allow him to take a shower before bed  and  first thing in the morning  and  because I insist that 3 minutes is long enough to do the job no matter how long your hair is. Now I just wish he would take an interest in girls so I would have the complete teenage package to occupy myself with.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/09/men-in-my-life.html", "title": "\nThe men in my life\n"},

Don't bother to read any further if you aren't in the mood for my whine-fest, because  that's about all I can do with this. Usually I can find a positive spin for the stuff that isn't so great, but I just have no energy left to spin this. Oliver has always been so incredibly passive. Almost to a fault. He goes along with a lot and tries over and over again when I ask him to do something that for whatever reason he just isn't getting. He isn't SO passive that he doesn't have wants and desires, thank goodness, but his way of getting what he wants, of asserting himself, is to keep at it over and over and over again until he either wears me down or is able to get it when I'm not paying attention. I mean in both cases, he hangs in there. He's persistent. He works the system. But lately it is a different story altogether. When I tell Oliver \"no\" he has begun to go into a rage. He screams until I think it can't possibly go on much longer and then, well, it does. He's hitting and biting, both me and himself, and occasionally  Sami . And he looks at me with such anger that I just can't fathom where it is coming from. The only things he wants to do are static: rolling  playdoh  into balls and then squishing them, running his fingers through the sand or sitting on the couch watching TV. When I try to engage him in any other activity he flies into a fierce rage. But it isn't just about Oliver asserting himself. There is something at work in him that I just don't understand. I mean why now? Who flipped the switch? My normally happy,  smilely  little boy who is game for anything has been throwing himself on the ground and angrily sobbing within minutes of waking every day. The first couple days of this had me feeling pretty angry about it. Angry at him and angry at the situation. But after 4 hours straight of this behavior today I just feel shaken and sad. I called my neighbor who came over and gave me a hug and let me cry on her shoulder for awhile. I called my friend who called me back three times just to listen to me cry. I took  Sami  to the health department for his immunization and ended up sobbing in the exam room. The nurse, who had no idea what was going on, just handed me tissues and patted my hand. All I could offer her by way of explanation was: \"I'm just having a really bad day.\" Today I did everything I know how to do to help Oliver. I tried setting limits on his behavior. I tried giving him a role that would help him to feel competent and give him something to focus on. I tried soothing him. I tried going back to the most elementary push/pull activities. I tried getting out of the house. I tried staying in the house. Some of it worked for brief intervals. A couple of times I got him to regulate with me and even laugh a bit. But it was by far the smallest part of the day. By tomorrow whatever this is that is going on had better be over or I'm asking for my money back. This ride sucks. I thought the bumpy part was over. I thought I had a handle on things and that I understood the game plan. But this? No way. I don't want this. It is just too fucking hard. OK. That's it. I'm done now. Tomorrow will be better and I'll come up with a positive spin for all this in a few days. It will all become clear once the clouds lift and we see some sunlight. 'Cause tomorrow is going to be better, right?

I've been trying to get Oliver to turn up the volume on his voice for some time now. He will sit in the back seat of the car quietly saying, to no one in particular, \"I want music.\" He'll say it over and over again until someone notices and turns the music on. So I've been coaching him to say: \" MOM!!!  Turn the music on!\" And about 50% of the time he will, eventually call out to me in this way if I ignore him long enough. One day he even said: \"MOM!! I need the potty!\" Needless to say I found a bathroom tout  de  suite. So, before I finish telling this little tale I might as well admit to being a  yeller . I really try not to, but man, when you've told a kid one million times in a five minute period to get his grimy hands out of the sugar, flour, couscous (insert whatever messy substance you'd like) and you find him sneaking over to the pantry cupboard again, well, you might yell too. Or maybe not. Because if I thought you did then continuing to flagellate myself for being one of the all-time worst mothers on the face of the planet would just not be as much fun. A  yeller , god help me. I've become a  yeller .  But I'm really, really, really, really, really working on it. There. OK. So. .... Anyway, Oliver was at the back door today suspending himself gecko-like by holding onto the handle on either side of the door and griping each side of the door with his knees and feet. It is quite a feat and I wish I had a picture of it because you would be amazed. And while my pride in his gross motor skills swells every time I see him do this, my more practical side is also recalling that the storm door on the front door now needs to be replaced for this very reason. Storm doors are not made to carry an extra 55 pounds like that. So when I asked Oliver for the third time in a minute and a half to knock it off, only to be ignored, I did what any good  yeller  would do: I ratcheted it up a notch. \"Oliver,\" I yelled, \"get away from the door!\" And without missing a beat, Oliver turned to me and yelled back:  \"I want to go outside!\" Naturally, my anger faded away to amusement, then pride. I have a little  yeller  on my hands. A chip off the old block.

I don't know what is going on with Oliver. That is the hard part. But my intuition tells me that it has something to do with Sami starting pre-school, his growing awareness and interest in other children, and his increasing desire to communicate. He is struggling with all these things so it makes sense that he wants to retreat to more mindless activities because the dynamic world is becoming bigger and more complicated. He is tackling bigger and bigger challenges. What remains to be seen is how he will work it out. How WE will work it out. Anyway, there is one big thing that has most definitely changed for Oliver. The evidence is in the video below taken today. The second video is from our vacation over the summer and it just makes me smile.

{"date": "August 26, 2008", "body": "\n A few years back my mother gave me a big cardboard box containing all of the things from my childhood that she had saved. I was amazed at the stuff she kept, especially considering she had five kids, and especially considering the fact that I have not managed to save one single momento from my own kids' childhoods thus far. Well, except for Oliver's umbilical cord. And I didn't save that; Nik did. I came across it one day, amidst all of our important documents, looking all black and raisin-like in a sealed ziplock bag. I didn't know what it was but it's location alone made me wonder if it held some importance. So I called Nik into the room. \"Do you have any idea what this is?\" \"That's Oliver's umbilical cord.\" \"Why are we saving it?\" \"I'm not sure. It probably fell off one day when you were at work and I figured you might want to see it.\" \"That was five years ago.\" \"Well, there you have it!\" And the really funny thing is that after holding on to it for five years, I couldn't bring myself to throw it away. So I put it back on the shelf and there it sits. Holding on to things is like that. But I'm not sentimental at all so only the most important keepsakes manage to stay around for any real length of time. Well, actually, the umbilical cord is pretty much it at this point. Anyway, back to the box. My mom held on to these things for 25, 30 years and then dumped them on me. It took me a whole afternoon and a couple of hefty garbage bags, but I made my way through most of it and only a couple of items remained in the \"keep\" pile. My very favorite Raggedy Anne doll. One school photo from every year. And one report card. Then I put the things away and didn't look at them again until tonight. I was looking for my university diploma and tucked away inside the leather folder containing my graduate school diploma was this one saved progress report from 1979. I was ten. On this single, saved piece of paper, my homeroom teacher, Mrs. McAleer had compiled my Strengths and Weaknesses in four subject areas: Math, Science, Social Studies and Language Arts: Math, Strengths Likes to participate Volunteers in class Does neat work Math, Weaknesses Lack of complete concentration Tendency to bother others during a discussion Lacks confidence in math basics Tendency to do what she wants during a lesson Science, Strengths Average work but testing of knowledge of facts is above average Science, Weaknesses Daydreams in class Misses easy questions when called upon Social Studies, Strengths Interested Alert most of the time Social Studies, Weaknesses Acts absent-minded Talks a lot and disturbs others Doesn't follow directions Raises hand to answer simple questions and give inaccurate answers Constantly tries to go ahead on projects and gets confused Control problem Language Arts, Strengths Ability to arrange events and sequence Self-expression shows clarity and imagination Comprehension of reading assignments is high Language Arts, Weaknesses Previous inability to organize is progressing. I'm guessing I wasn't every teacher's favorite pupil. And I don't know why my mom didn't freak out about this. It certainly indicates that I was having some troubles. Maybe she was just tired -- a single mother raising five children. Or maybe she just believed in me. Maybe she saw things the teachers didn't. But what I do know is that this progress report never made a dent in my consciousness. I was never made to think I was just this bundle of strengths and weaknesses. When I showed this to Nik tonight he laughed and said: \"Yeah, that pretty much sums it up!\" And it's true! I still don't have confidence in my math basics!!! I still tend to do what I want. I still daydream, I'm still absent-minded and I still have difficulty organizing (but I'm progressing. Honest.).

{"date": "October 01, 2008", "body": "\nJudging by my last couple of posts you might be led to believe that Oliver still has tremendous challenges in self-regulation. And for the most part you would be right. But interestingly, this is an area where I also saw some growth this past week. On Friday (which was when we were just starting to resolve things) we had some friends drop in just as we were finishing dinner. These are good friends of ours -- the kind of friends who know it is OK to just come by if they are in the neighborhood; the kind of friends who help themselves to a taste of whatever is cooking on the stove. One of the reasons I love these friends is because they ask the questions that other people might be afraid to ask. They always address Oliver as they would any other kid, they don't pretend that he isn't in the room just because he doesn't talk to them. And the male part of this couple always makes a special effort with Oliver. On this particular day, however, it didn't work. Oliver became so  dysregulated  that he actually bit him. Lucky he is missing two of his bigger teeth at the moment :-) When I told Oliver to apologize, he did, but then completely melted down. So I took him upstairs and we sat together watching  YouTube  clips of sesame street. I kept saying to Oliver: \"Don't worry. We can stay here for as long as you want.\" Then, after each short video I would ask: \"Are you ready to go back downstairs?\" and Oliver would answer: \"No. Stay Here.\" Then, after the third or fourth clip I asked him: \"Are you ready yet to go downstairs?\" and he said: \"Yes!\"  Then he got off my lap, went downstairs and was fine for the rest of the visit. On Sunday a similar thing happened. We went to a seasonal park that we had gone to a few times last year. The place is fantastic. They have a giant, underground slide that you go down on burlap sacks, pots and pans strung up that you can hit with giant sticks to make music, a tractor pulling a mini cow-train, animals made out of corn stalks that you can \"ride\", goats to feed, mini corn mazes, giant catapults, a full scale merry-go-round -- well, you get the picture. Anyway, Oliver LOVES this place and when we pulled up he couldn't get out of his seat fast enough. But almost immediately he began to sob  intermittently .  Nik  kept shooting me quizzical looks: \"What gives?\" My theory is that he was so happy and so excited that he was just overwhelmed. So  I took him to a quiet swing and did just as I had two nights before. I told him that he could stay there as long as he liked, that I would stay with him and we would swing together. Off and on I would ask him if he was ready to move on and he always answered: \"No! Stay Here.\" Then, when he was ready, he said: \"Let's go!\"  He was completely fine for the rest of the time there. In fact, we stayed almost three hours and they didn't want to leave. So is this self-regulation? Oliver obviously understood that he just needed some time to get it together. He can also communicate a little bit better these days so that helped. Maybe in the past I hurried him back to joining the fray too quickly? Probably. Definitely. But what excited me was that Oliver now clearly understands when he is and is not emotionally regulated, and he understands what he needs to  get  regulated: time and space. After a week of mostly  dysregulation , it felt like a huge success.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/10/self-regulation.html", "title": "\nSelf-Regulation\n"},

Oliver has been awake for a good part of the last two nights, waking at 2am and unable to fall back asleep until 6am. The trouble is that when Oliver doesn't sleep he requires an adult to be with him or else no one else in the house would be able to sleep. He jumps on the bed and is just generally loud unless someone is there with him. Sometimes I get up with him and take him to the kitchen and we bake something. But sometimes I'm just not able to be wakeful and then it is a struggle between what we both need. So last night I tried something different. I laid next to him in the dark and told him over and over again that if he couldn't sleep he should turn on the light and get a book to read. Oliver isn't much into self-directed reading so I'm not sure this is the best strategy but I'm hopeful that we can help him find something quiet to do when he can't sleep. So around 5am he finally turned on the light, got a book and climbed back into bed, half- heartedly  paging through it.  When he closed the book I suggested he get another. Then another. After the third book he put his head back on the pillow and pulled the covers up to his nose. Then I told him that if he was ready to sleep he should turn off the light. He did this and was asleep within a few minutes. It is hard for me to imagine a time when Oliver will be able to find ways to occupy himself but I am hopeful. I see him spending more time on activities and he is willing to sit though more varied reading materials. And it isn't hard for me to also recall a time when I found it difficult to imagine that he would be able to dress himself, use the toilet, brush his own teeth or ride a bike -- but he can do all of that now and I've begun to take it for granted. And in the meantime, it is only sleep, right? And on the RDI-front, Oliver has probably mastered our current objective, which requires that he is able to adopt a studying response to uncertainty. Today I held out two hands, one of which had a surprise inside, and asked him to choose a hand. Very carefully he shifted his gaze from hand to hand, then he reached out and turned one of my hands over, looked at my closed fist for a second then touched the other hand to choose it instead and looked up at me to get my reaction. I remember trying to teach this to Oliver more than a year ago and being totally unsuccesful. He would always just randomly choose a hand, more to please me than out of any kind of consideration. After working on this for a couple of weeks I see that he is applying this new skill all over the place, trying to figure things out then looking at me for reassurance or more information. I added two mantras to my desk-side window today: \"Little by Little.\" and \"In Our Own Time.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/10/imagine-that.html", "title": "\nImagine That. ...\n"},

Nik is out of town and I was still up working on a deadline for my certification program at 12:20 when I heard small whoops and giggling coming from Oliver's room. I called to him a few times to go back to sleep, somehow thinking this might work. It didn't. By 12:40 I moved him into my room, gave him two benedryl tablets, shut down the computer and climbed into bed with him. Around 1:00 I heard his tummy rumbling so we moved into the kitchen where I made him a quick bowl of oatmeal. 3am, another dose of melatonin. 5:20, another dose of benedryl. 6am, sleep. 7am, Sami awakens, I beg him to go back to sleep. No dice. 7:45, I call my neighbor and am silently thankful  when she answers the phone cheerfully wide awake. 10:15, I wake up, call and cancel appointments for the day. 10:45, Oliver wakes up, we retrieve Sami from neighbors house and start our day.

I barely managed to make it to the shoulder of the interstate before she died and then I sat there wondering what in the heck I was supposed to do. Hang a white flag out the window? Or is it red? Either way, we had nothing suitable. We did, however, have a fresh stash of apples, which came in handy.  Nik  was out of town and I don't carry a cell phone. So I popped the hood and tried to look as perplexed and frazzled as I could at all the smoke coming from the engine (which wasn't hard, let me tell you). Then I climbed back into the car and waited. Mercifully someone called us in for emergency assistance. State Trooper arrived, tow-truck was called, and the kids loved every minute of the whole two and a half hour ordeal, especially riding in the tow-truck. 2. Car shopping sucks. We haven't found one yet and rather than rushing into a decision we are going to try and go car-less for a few weeks. This means I'll be riding both kids on my bike.  Sami  rides in  this . Oliver rides with  this . I've never managed both kids at once. I may be begging for a car by the end of the week. 3. I think I found an  SLP  who might actually have a clue. We met with her on Tuesday and I loved her instantly because she set both Oliver and myself at ease and asked all the right questions. I don't love the cost, which we can't afford. Our insurance doesn't cover speech therapy unless it is deemed  medically necessary . Makes me want to scream. 4. The State of Virginia, where I live, is considering legislation that would  require  insurance companies to cover the cost of certain therapies for people with autism, including speech and OT. This could pass early next year so we may be in luck. 5. I wish I knew what it was about our local pool that frightens Oliver so. Last year he couldn't even go inside the pool area after they enclosed it with a bubble for the winter season. This year we've actually been swimming a few times but he clings to me so tightly and I feel his little heart just pounding away. Last weekend he managed to swim a few feet between  Nik  and I about six times but then he was done and asked to go home. And yet, every day I ask him if he wants to go swimming and every day he says yes -- so even though he appears terrified of the actual pool, I am super, duper, impressed with his willingness to work through whatever is going on with him.  I suppose it is partly because he loves swimming so much. 6. Oliver is back on track with the sleeping since last Thursday night. What a relief! I'm thinking of investing in a weighted blanket. I'd love to hear from people who found this to be helpful with sleep issues.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.onestepahead.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=6212&cmSource=Search", "http://www.velorution.biz/?page_id=1322"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/10/some-stuff-in-no-particular-order.html", "title": "\nSome stuff in no particular order\n"},
{"date": "October 31, 2008", "body": "\n For the third year in a row we had picture perfect weather for Halloween. What a drag it is when the weather actually acts like late October and requires the kids to negotiate their costumes  and  a coat! But tonight was not a night like that and what fun it was to navigate the sidewalks on our street among all the costumed kids.   Sami  and Oliver were literally  bouncing  from house to house and at each door Oliver either said: \"Trick or Treat\"; \"Knock Knock\"; or \"Turn it off!\" (this last, I think, because of his desire to pull a phrase from his memory beginning with the T sound :-) The kids were so excited about Halloween this year that we ended up stopping at far more houses than we ever have managed before. In fact, I was marvelling to myself how different this year was from my last vivid memory of  the  halloween  that came soon after Oliver's diagnosis. I was sure then that we would never enjoy  halloween  together as a family in the same way that I had enjoyed it as a kid. Tonight I felt much differently. Oliver tolerated a costume this year and even seemed to enjoy it!! That is definitely a first. After trick or treating, we handed out candy for awhile then made our way to a community party -- think bonfires, pinatas, pumpkin carving and hot chicken soup for all! The best part though was the music. As soon as we arrived, Oliver stationed himself in front of the musicians with rapt attention and huge smiles. I wish I had gotten a picture. Here are some of the pictures I DID manage to take! Sami , examining his loot! Oliver, pretending that he is just checking out the nose on this guy before he gets down to business blowing out the candle! Oliver, all costumed up and ready to go!! We've been carving pumpkins here for more than a week. Every few nights we'd try a new one. Lots of scary stories were told on these steps in the evenings as we huddled under blankets and watched the candles flicker.

{"date": "October 26, 2008", "body": "\nHave you ever had a conversation with a friend or professional in which you discuss how you \"discipline\"? I've just thought about this again while filling out the questionnaire given to us by the speech pathologist I mentioned in my last post. You see, the fact is, we've never found a method of \"disciplining\" that works with Oliver. Time outs? They don't work. First, he doesn't seem to mind sitting in a quiet place for any length of time. And the minute we tell him he is free from this \"thinking space\" he goes directly back to doing whatever landed him there to begin with. Spanking? Well, I don't believe in it for starters and both times when we did spank Oliver, he laughed all the way through it, making us even angrier, which is not a fun place to be. We spoke sternly. We yelled. We had do-overs. None of it has worked. I remember buying Dr. Sears' Discipline Book and reading it from cover to cover before angrily throwing it across the room because nowhere between those covers did he suggest anything that I even  thought  might work. Sometimes I believed that Oliver just didn't make the consequences connection. And that may be partly true sometimes but I don't think that gives Oliver enough credit. Mostly I think it is rather a matter of desire. Oliver is just willing to put up with the consequences, no matter what they are (which is one reason why ABA never worked so well for us), so that he can do those things that have captured his interest -- whatever they may be. Usually this involves making some kind of outrageous mess or destroying something that belongs to someone else. Lately we are battling over: * the excitement that is Vaseline spread over every available surface. * eating the pool noodles that belong in my RDA kit * spraying Simple Green or Windex all over the place. (Yesterday I lost two fresh from the oven loaves of bread!) * dumping the box of  legos * eating vitamins by the handful Over the years I have wavered between the desire to hide all attractive items from view and insisting that we leave them where they belong so that Oliver can learn about decision making. The first option saves me lots of hassles but it just doesn't feel right. Especially now that Oliver is getting older. Still, when I climbed the stairs today to find Vaseline covering the windows, desk, computer, chair, carpet and boy. ... well, I only blamed myself for not putting it away after using it. The stuff is just too tempting for my sensory seeking guy. (and anyone with ideas about how to get  vaseline  out of my upholstered chair, please let me know.) All of this leaves me feeling like I have to constantly shadow the boy around the house. My only alternatives are to 1) require him to stay where I am, 2) move with him from room to room, or 3) accept that I will ultimately have some sort of mess to clean up if I don't do #1 or #2. Normally, I use a combination of the three throughout the day. But it is no way to live -- not for either of us. I remember last year when we spent so much time potty training. I tried everything until I finally hit upon the winning strategy: leaving it up to Oliver. I made it very clear to Oliver that he had a choice in the matter but that it was up to him. I turned the control over to him and that was all it took. Within a few days Oliver was potty trained and we never looked back. So I'm adopting this same strategy with all the items on my list above. I'm not moving them and I'm not making a big deal about it when he makes the wrong choice, except that he has to help clean up whatever mess he makes. When I see him reaching for the Simple Green I simply remind him that he has a choice to make. While I'm standing there he always makes the right choice and I thank him, but as soon as my back is turned he pretty much does what he wants. I make him help me clean up and tell him that I am disappointed about his choice. In between I give him lots of \"good\" sensory options to fill those needs. I don't know if this \"strategy\" is going to work or not. It is heavily reliant on Oliver's grasp of what I am trying to communicate with him. But I remember when we were at the height of the potty training saga and I found myself just totally resigned to the fact that ultimately it was his choice and that I could only support him through the process so much. That's the way I feel now. Resigned and accepting that with Oliver anyway, learning is not going to be so much about consequences (if you do this then X thing will be done to you -- what most people think of as discipline) as it is about making choices and learning to have the discipline to control his own behavior. Sure, I'm emphasizing the consequences of poor choices, but my disappointment, or pride, or  gratitude  are so much less tangible than being sent off to a \"thinking space.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/10/any-belief-that-i-am-in-control-is-pure.html", "title": "\nAny belief that I am in control is pure conceit\n"},

So, a list: 1. I have finally given myself permission to let go of the notion that I have to be incorporating academics into our homeschooling curriculum. The hard work of helping Oliver to make discoveries about how relate to the world around him IS our curriculum. I mean, who cares about the  ABCs  if Oliver can't relate to another living person on this planet in a meaningful way? There will be time for the  ABCs  later. 2. I'm making a point to spend extra one-on-one time with  Sami . I bought him a deck of cards: 52 cool tricks for kids.  It has become a focal point of our day. In the morning we lay out all the cards on the floor and then  Sami  takes his time deciding which one we will do that day. I gather the materials throughout the day and in the evening we perform for Oliver,  Nik , RT and anyone else that happens to be around. The look on  Sami's  face when he executes the trick is just simply priceless.  I will try to post a video if I remember. 3. Oliver is now able to tell me when he is hungry, which is an incredible, incredible relief. In the recent past I would say that 9/10 ths  of his meltdowns were because he was hungry. That boy can eat! I also think he suffers a bit from low blood sugar. Needless to say, when the boy tells me \"It's time to eat!\" we head immediately for the kitchen. 4. It looks like our local  FAPE  committee has just approved funding for  RDI . I'm still holding my breath, but if it turns out to be true I'm going to be positively giddy -- personally and professionally. 5. Oliver had a solid day of projectile  vomiting  on Friday. I'm always amused at my reaction during times like this: I'm simultaneously torn between wanting to hold him close and wanting to hold him at arms length. If you are a parent you know what I mean. The upside to the vomiting episode is that I rented a steam cleaner on Saturday and cleaned all of my carpets and upholstered furniture. 6. I made a radical decision about Thanksgiving that was heartily  embraced by the rest of the clan. I'm just not going to do it. Or at least I'm not going to do it the way we always have. Instead, we will join our neighbors. A local community organization makes and serves free meals once a week to anyone who needs or wants to eat. They are doing the same to celebrate Thanksgiving.  So we are donating our free-range, organic Turkey, I will go and help cook, then  Nik  and the kids will join me to eat. For the first time in years I am actually looking forward to the holiday. That is all. Hopefully I'll be back in a blogging state of mind soon.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/11/list-to-get-me-going.html", "title": "\nA list to get me going\n"},

And I certainly don't know how he can keep being so smiley and happy when his mother is not such a pleasure to be around sometimes. But here's the thing: Oliver makes lots of vocal noises. And sometimes he does it more than others. And sometimes it just feels so. very. extreme.  And I can't take it. So I tell him to knock it off even though I know that he is doing it for some sensory reason that is necessary at the moment. Even though I know telling him to knock it off won't really help because he  can't  knock it off. Still. It drives me crazy. There is no way of getting around it. I get impatient. And frustrated. Then angry. And then I just have to not be around him for awhile. I have sister who must have noise going on around her at all times. Seriously. The TV is always on at her house even if no one is watching it. She even  sleeps  with the TV on.  But I'm not like that. Noise gets to me. The first thing I do when I walk into my sister's house is turn the tv off. She waits till I turn around and turns it back on. We don't visit much. I need the quiet. Too much commotion, too much noise and I don't cope well. So here you have a woman who requires calm, peaceful, quiet to relax and she just happens to have son who cannot sit still most of the time. A son who balances precariously on the edge of furniture. And a son who is always on at a low hum, sometimes louder. I suspect that there is nothing to be done about this. Oliver and I will always have this struggle because what we need to feel at peace is at odds. And luckily, for me, the intensity of his sound track ebbs and flows. I used to think that my greatest challenge as Oliver's mother was patience. I am not a patient person. But one can learn patience.  I  am learning patience. This other thing though?

But imagine my glee when I discovered that for the cost of one ticket we could purchase enough miles for all five of us to travel! The only downside is that on the return trip, Nik and RT will depart a day early since those were the only seats available. That means that I will be flying alone with both kids, transferring once in Munich. I'm a bit apprehensive, but the thought of 26 days of real vacation makes me think I can handle anything!

{"date": "June 17, 2008", "body": "\nDid I tell you that Oliver is not sleeping again? I'm not sure when it happened exactly but it has been more than three weeks. Not every night, of course. Once in awhile we get a break. But Man!! this no sleeping thing is hard. I'm not working a regular job anymore so theoretically that should make it easier. But I'm doing all the planning and prep work for my certification program at night after the kids go to sleep -- so basically I park myself at the computer around 9pm and don't move until midnight or later. Sometimes  much  later. But I'm trying to maintain a good outlook about it. It helps that the RDI approach to things means that I'm already keeping things slow and steady. If I'm tired, if Oliver is tired, then we can spend the morning in our pjs playing silly face games together on the couch and I don't feel guilty.  (Yes, if he is awake I am awake -- he's just a little boy! I never get those people who tell me to let him cope in the night alone.) And yet, I do see such a difference in my boy and his ability to focus and cope when he isn't sleeping well. I just SO wish I knew what to do to help him -- us -- to get through these periods. Right now we are piggy-backing melatonin and benedryl, which is the only recommendation I got from the pediatrician, but it just seems like there should be a better solution. And sometimes even this doesn't work. I googled sleep clinics and found that there is one fairly close to where we live, but upon reading more I discovered that Oliver would need to go to sleep wearing sensors on his scalp and face and elastic bands around his chest. For a boy who can't even tolerate a band-aid, I can't even think about how a scenario like this would work. Still, I think I will call and see if there is an alternate method. So I haven't been blogging much. I'm tired a lot these days. And when I'm at the computer it usually involves working. But some good things have been happening: 1. Date nights. Nik and I recently discovered that -- hey! we have a very capable teenager living with us. So one night a week we put the kids in bed and when they are asleep we wave good-bye to the teenager and wish him luck. The first night we went out for a glass of wine at a nearby jazz bar that I had been wanting to visit. The second night we went to an incredibly awesome wedding and Nik and I danced until we dropped. (Klezmer music, which is funny because Nik can only swing dance and I can only salsa -- but we made it work :-) This week we just went for a long walk around town like we did in the old days before children. 2. Granola. You love it, right? Who doesn't! After much trial and error I think I've finally found the perfect granola recipe with the right combination of sweetness and crunchiness: rolled oats, raw wheat germ, flax meal, corn meal, almonds, sunflower seeds, coconut, buckwheat groats, brown sugar, salt, honey, cinnamon, vanilla and water.  All the fine parts glue-up the coarse parts and the result is better than yummy! I've got some in the oven now and my bowl of milk is standing at the ready even though it is 11:47 at night. There is never a wrong time to eat granola. 3. I am loving the work that goes along with my certification program. It is hard, I'll tell you that. But I'm learning a ton and the work, the education, well, it is all so motivating and rewarding. And that is a good thing because the more I learn the more I see that I have to learn!! 4. Oh, and one more month until we leave for vacation and I've already got lists everywhere! I'm really good at making lists but bad at checking things off until the very last minute.

{"date": "November 27, 2008", "body": "\nI took a two hour long nap today. Yes, I am thankful for that, something that rarely (never) happens. But mostly I am thinking of the wonderful Thanksgiving Day we had and how sometimes change is a very good and needed thing. Today I served mashed potatoes to about 150 of my neighbors.  As the noon hour approached, the seats around the long tables started to fill up. There were more volunteer workers than they could handle but I was happy to roll up my sleeves, tie my apron on and squeeze around the tightly packed dining room ladling out mashed potatoes. Others were moving around in pairs serving the stuffing, green beans, corn, gravy, bread, sweet potatoes, and of course Turkey!! What I liked best about our Thanksgiving was getting the chance to serve my neighbors. Many came because it was their only chance for a real Thanksgiving meal, but an equal number came to sit side by side and share a community meal that was about more than filling their plates up. Nik arrived with the boys while I was still serving mashed potatoes and had to wait awhile to find a place to sit. When seats finally started emptying, I sat with them as other volunteers filled our plates up and I felt truly, truly grateful for our family/community meal. One thing that I don't often hear other bloggers talking about is how the extended family dynamics change when you have a child with autism. Or is this just the case in  my  family? Family gatherings and family visits are sometimes very difficult because I find that they often just don't \"get\" Oliver. Or they don't \"get\" how parenting a child with autism means that the rules sometimes change. Discipline, understanding, expectations, even communication are all affected by the challenges that our kids face. So I haven't looked forward to family holidays for a few years now. Old traditions just don't seem to fit with our life at the moment. Sometimes I'm a bit sad about the whole thing, but today I realized that traditions are there to support us, not the other way around. Today was so successful for us, so wonderfully fulfilling, that it is easy to see that it was the start of a new S.

But before that moment, there were the 9.5 moments when I didn't know where Oliver was. There was the ONE SECOND when I looked from the boy next to me to the rack of shoes that I scanned for his size. When I looked back, he was gone. I raced to the end of the isle. I sprinted up and down the rest of the isles of the shoe department calling his name in what I hoped was not an hysterical voice. Then I sprinted back, grabbed Sami and raced for the customer service department where I promptly burst into tears. \"Please, help me find my son!\" Then, in a rush of words I described Oliver and told them that he had autism and that he can't talk and that he wouldn't respond if they called his name.\" I think back to those moments and wonder why I was so extremely upset. Obviously, Oliver had run away. I say this because he's been doing this lately when we go to stores -- especially to Target. I'm aware enough to know that it is his burgeoning desire for independence working against my extremely tight control over him. I give Sami far more freedom than Oliver and I know it is wrong but then again, impulse control is not something that I worry about with Sami. But here we were at Target. I was reasonably sure that he wasn't going to be carried off somewhere, that he wouldn't get hurt and that he would be returned to me. But there are lots of places we could be where I wouldn't be so sure of those same things and so I always keep an eagle eye on him. It is my worst fear. So Oliver had his little adventure. I learned a valuable lesson. And it all turned out OK. I'm pretty sure this won't be the last time for something like this. I just hope it doesn't happen again any time soon.

Later, I came home from an outing at the park to find a message from Nik saying that he had to work late and wouldn't be home until sometime after six. So what did I do? I came up with the idea of going to the MALL to have dinner with the kids. You know, one of those chain restaurants where everything kind of tastes the same. My reasoning was this: 1) I did not feel like cooking anything for dinner, especially if it was just going to be the three of us and 2) I want Oliver and Sami to get used to eating in restaurants. We hardly ever eat out -- maybe only three or four times a year; and 3) last time we picked RT up at the mall, both kids were very interested in this particular restaurant and it's colorful chandeliers. So off we went. Oliver was so excited to be sitting in our bouncy green booth with the fancy chandelier that he could barely sit still. I ordered both the kids a juice box and a lemonade for myself and you would have thought they had never had a drink of anything in their life. In fact, Oliver often insisted on drinking from his juice box and my lemonade at the same time. And did I mention how excited he was? He kept letting out these loud sort of whooping noises. I don't think anything of them anymore but we did get some kind of nervous looks from some of the wait staff.  But I really don't care. Especially now that we will never be going back there again. Shortly after we ordered our food Sami announced that he had to go to the bathroom. He is enthralled with public bathrooms so I regarded him a bit skeptically but gathered them both up and herded them towards the women's room. Sami spent some time using the potty and I hurried him along thinking that I didn't want to spend the entire time in the toilet. When we got back to the table both kids were so excited that they barely ate anything. Oliver kept trying to stand up and swing the chandelier back and forth and Sami just wanted to talk about the decorations on the wall. My food tasted like cardboard. It was about this time that I started to regret the whole adventure. Then Sami told me that he had to go to the potty again and I told him that we were almost finished and he would have to wait. Huge, fatal mistake. A minute later he got kind of an astonished look on his face and he told me that he had poop in his pants. I got up to get a better look and saw that there was, in fact, poop -- everywhere. I started grabbing napkins from all the nearby tables but it barely helped. The waitress brought me some towels but what we really needed was a hose. Oliver took advantage of my distraction to start banging wildly on the chandelier and in the process accidentally knocked over my lemonade. I cleaned up and bagged up as much as I could, threw some money down and made a bee line for the door. Lest you think it was all bad, though, a couple of good things: 1. I'm ready to try again. Different restaurant though. 2. Oliver loves going places and trying new things. He was so full of joy, sitting there in that booth. 3. Sami was a real sport through it all. 4. I was actually able to laugh and see the humor in it. 5. I am now re-thinking that cow-share that I was going to buy since I'm pretty sure it was all that yummy milk that threw his system out of whack.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/06/adventures-on-thursday.html", "title": "\nAdventures on a Thursday\n"},

{"date": "September 08, 2008", "body": "\nOK. Let's not talk about sleep tonight, shall we? (But thanks to those who commented or sent e-mails. I don't know why but somehow it helps to know that others have kept these kind of hours and survived. And thanks also for the advice. Yes, we use melatonin. And yes also to the Benedryl.  And during periods like this it just doesn't work. We haven't tried anything else but I think I'll look into Tryptophan as soon as I have two brain cells to rub together again.) What I really want to talk about is what happened this morning pre- Sami's first day of pre-school. It has been obvious for awhile now that having Sami around during our homeschooling and RDI time was less than ideal. Most of the time he jumps in and takes the challenge out of whatever I've set up for Oliver. So I spend a lot of time encouraging Oliver and discouraging Sami. It is quite exhausting. Our local rec center has a great program for three and four year olds, three mornings a week for two and a half hours. And the cost? Get this: it is $105. September to May. So I was first in line when they opened registration. And Sami? Well, he is way into it. From the first moment school buses entered his consciousness he has wanted to go to school. For some reason he thinks that everyone learns to juggle when they go to school?!? And of course we've been talking it up for the past four months. So this morning finally arrived and the kid looked like Chrismas morning when he woke up. Both boys came running into my room and jumped in bed, Sami was beaming and Oliver looked tired and sullen -- which is quite unusual for Oliver because he is generally a pretty happy guy first thing in the morning -- no matter how much sleep we didn't get. As we moved through our morning it became more and more obvious that Oliver was out of sorts. He wouldn't eat his favorite breakfast: baked oatmeal. He half-heartedly ate his gummi bear vitamins. He begged me for the playdoh and when I finally gave in he played with it briefly then broke down in sobs. After a half-hour or so of this I told him that he ought to go in his room and lay down until he felt better. I heard him sobbing louder and harder as I brushed Sami's teeth. Then, with only 10 minutes to go until we had to leave I thought: I had better turn this around unless I want the drop off to be a nightmare. So I sat down next to Oliver and told him that I wished he could try and tell me what was wrong. I say this to him often when he is upset. I know that he can't communicate well but I want him to know that I care but that I can't help if I don't know what is wrong. Normally I get no response. I don't really expect a response, I suppose. But this morning he turned to me and said: \"I want Sami. I want Sami.\" Incredulous I asked him, \"Are you sad because Sami is going to school?\" \"Sad. Yes!\" Now, I can't tell you on how many levels this affected me. He has never said Sami's name before without prompting (as in: I'm sorry I bit you Sami.). And mostly I just thought he put up with Sami. I didn't realize that he might miss the little guy. But also: it never occured to me that he was paying attention to all this talk about Sami going to school. Of course he was!! How angry I get when people discount how very aware Oliver is of everything that goes on around him and yet here I was surprised by that very fact. After that Sami gave Oliver lots of hugs and kisses, gently rubbing his back saying: \"I'll be back, Oliver. I'll be back. Don't be sad.\" And I told Oliver how it would be a morning of only fun things together with his old mom (and I woke up this morning another year older so I said that with some conviction!!). The drop-off went smoothly. Sami was only \"a little bit nervous but mostly excited.\" He was also a bit disappointed when he realized that I wasn't just going to drop him at the curb. He kept saying good-bye to me and tried to walk into the building by himself. Three going on thirteen, that boy. Oliver and I want to a local bakery and had coffee (me) and chocolate croissants (hi). Then we went to visit Grandma who was so very happy to do a little doting. After that we went home and I slyly worked in a couple of homeschooling activities (more on that later). But mostly I just spent time with my boy and felt happy that both boys seem to getting what they need for now. Oh, and just for kicks (or slaps), here's a little dance number that Sami's been working on lately: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["rtsp://v7.cache1.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQkGujC_nuF7UxMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/09/brotherly-love.html", "title": "\nBrotherly Love\n"},
{"date": "October 06, 2008", "body": "\nI think I've written here before about how much I love my neighborhood and our neighbors. It is so gratifying that all we need to do is step outside our door and we are right in the midst of a community of people who know and enjoy my children. Yesterday the girls who live in a group house across the street came to play with my boys in the backyard while I tidied up the garden. When they were leaving they asked me if they might arrange a time next week to go swimming with the kids. Two of them are swimming instructors and they promised to teach Sami to swim without his water wings and to do a flip in the water. He is thrilled and I know Oliver will be, too. I love how they always come and sit on our porch or hang out with the kids on the sidewalk when they are between classes or in the early evening. I will be so sad when May comes and they all graduate. Today the young man next door took the time to help both kids ride his skateboard. Afterwards he told me that he is an instructor in the adaptive skiing program at a nearby resort and wondered if I might bring Oliver there this winter to go skiing with him!! I was thrilled with this.  I think he is maybe 24 or so and he wears a prosthetic leg and maybe it is the experience of being \"different\" that draws him to Oliver. But he always takes the time to come and say hello to my boys when they are outside and he always asks such good questions about Oliver. Also, on a couple of occasions when Oliver has left the house more quickly than me when we were preparing to go somewhere they were immediately alert that Oliver was outside on his own and they always made sure that I knew he was out there and that he was safe. I can't tell you how comforting it is to me knowing that other people are watching out for him. Three doors down from us lives a family that has become very special to us. They have a daughter who is a year younger than Oliver who has down syndrome. There is nothing,  nothing , like having someone close by who totally gets what it is like to raise a special needs child while balancing the needs of the other children. Very frequently we call each other: \"I really need to get out of the house with these guys. Can I come and hang out?\" Or, if we know the other is struggling due to little patience or lack of sleep: \"Why don't you send the kids down for an hour so they can play together.\" Also, because we know that the other one \"gets\" it we offer and take support without feeling bad about it. \"Could you use a loaf of bread?\" is code for: \"Here, take this because then you don't have to make bread for a few more days.\" \"Can I borrow a cup of rice?\" means: \"I just can't face loading my kids into the car to go and get one thing at the supermarket.\" Then there is the guy who owns the eye glass shop on the corner. I've been in to see him so many times this year to get my glasses repaired. That's just the way parenting is for me: very physical. He has stopped being surprised to see me and invites me to bring the kids by to play in the kids corner whenever we want to. I've taken him up on a it a few times and I'm always rewarded by the extra big smile he gives to my boys when he sees us coming through the door. Knowing these people who make extra room in their hearts and their lives for my children is its own reward. I often think about the turns my life has taken. I couldn't have imagined this life six years ago. I thought I would always work outside the home. I never,  ever , would have considered homeschooling. But I probably wouldn't have taken the time or had the opportunity to know these people either. I'm not  glad  Oliver has the challenges that he has, but there is no denying that because of him my life is less superficial. And for that I feel entirely blessed.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/10/people-you-meet.html", "title": "\nThe people you meet\n"},

I have a six year old son with autism and I would never, in my darkest moments, want to convey to anyone that: \"Having a child like [Oliver] is. ... debilitating, dispiriting, demoralizing.\" Public misconceptions and fear of people with autism is perpetuated by the mass media that insists on characterizing life with autism as Shankar Vedantam did in this article. Furthermore, when a parent first learns his child has autism and searches the internet for information he will be bombarded by what is continually portrayed as a tragedy. In my mind, this is the real tragedy. My son is mostly non-verbal and he struggles with many things in life and probably always will. I can think of many, many words to describe him and our life together but the ones you chose are not among them. Dr. Hotez may be hoping for the day \"when the girl comes out of\" his daughter.

I'm not sure I understand why, but if you hold two items up in front of him and ask him to choose which he wants, there is no thought behind it, no real agency, he merely grabs one to please. I think this has a lot to do with why the whole Yes/No thing is so hard for Oliver. If you ask him a question like: Do you want this? He will normally answer yes. Not because he wants the item but because usually a yes answer works. This morning, however, I served Oliver up some of my favorite baked oatmeal for breakfast. Normally this is a winner with my boys -- think warm oatmeal cookies with milk!! But this morning Oliver just picked at the food. From my spot at the counter where I was making bread I kept reminding Oliver that he needed to eat before we could do anything else. After about the 10th time of urging him to eat, Oliver stood up, picked up his bowl in both hands, held it out to me and said: \"I don't want this!!\" \"Oh, um. Ok. What do you want?\" I asked him. \"Waffles.\" \"Waffles?\" \"Waffles. Yes!\" So waffles it was. On the one hand, I was thrilled. Talk about communication!

{"date": "July 08, 2008", "body": "\nWe're going through a pretty bad patch right now, sleep-wise, that is. I can't even imagine how I survived all those years of having to get up and go to work in the morning. Now that I'm at home all the time it's much easier. But it's still hard: Oliver doesn't function well, I get dramatically --  dramatically  -- pessimistic, none of us has any patience with the other and it feels like we are just putting in time until we can hit the hay again with hopes of a better night. We're leaving for Switzerland next week and that ought to cheer me up, except that I am reminded of the last time when Oliver only slept two full nights over the course of three weeks. I'm trying not to jinx myself by thinking this way, but if any one has ideas on how to ward off evil sleep spirits -- I'm willing to do just about anything at this point. Unless it involves chickens. I just finished taking care of my neighbor's chickens for a week and I think I'll take my clean brown eggs from the neat container in the refrigerated section of the supermarket from now on thank you very much. For one thing, I don't have the right kind of shoes. For another, well, that shoe thing really just about says it all in my opinion. And speaking of animals, will someone please,  please  tell me that it is not a very good idea -- that in fact it is a very big mistake that I will regret for years to come -- for us to adopt a dog for Oliver? Blame it on my lack-of-sleep addled brain, but somehow I got it into my head that it would be fun to start visiting the SPCA with the kids. On our very first visit I fell in love with a five month old beagle/ heeler  mix and spent more than an hour playing with him in a big field where he chased after both my kids and they fell down and rolled around with delight as he tackled them and licked them like my boys go after those coveted lime  Popsicles . My idea was that we would just go in there, pet the animals and go home. But something about seeing Oliver laugh and play and run with this dog opened a little door in my brain. Each time we leave there I think: no! We are not getting a dog. But somehow we keep heading back there and each time I check to see if the little guy has been adopted yet and when he isn't I feel slightly relieved. That's a bad sign, right? But isn't dog ownership for people with fewer responsibilities? Take the students who live in group houses directly across the street and to the left of us, for instance.  They  have dogs. And in the evenings when the kids are asleep and I'm at the computer I've taken to watching them as dusk approaches. From this house and that, they mix and mingle on the porches and sidewalks. They hold beer bottles by the neck and their cigarettes glow like fireflies. They laugh deeply in a way that's both familiar and forgotten to me. The sound of car doors punctuate the night long after I've shut down my computer and closed my books. Other neighbors are annoyed by the presence of the students and at times I have been, too.  But this summer I am grateful because they have stirred in me a really sweet sense of nostalgia for a time when I was more like them. For a time when summer nights were just wide open to possibilities and when I put off sleeping for another hour and then just another hour just because I could. I'm happy with this life but I'm also happy to be reminded of how full and rich my life has already been. So I wonder: when I'm really old (as opposed to now when I just FEEL really old) and I look back on another time of little sleep but lots of learning and growing, what will I be nostalgic for? Whatever it is, I hope I'm appreciating it now in a way that I never did those summer nights twenty years ago.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/07/chickens-dogs-and-long-summer-nights.html", "title": "\nChickens, Dogs and Long Summer Nights\n"},

I'm keenly aware of the passage of time this summer; I want to have all my ducks in a row to start our homeschooling adventure in the fall and that means lots of reading and internalizing. I also have one order of business to take care of that will formally take us out of the public school system. I'm required to notify the school district of our plans to homeschool. I'm sure nobody really looks at the letter. It probably just gets filed away somewhere and that is that. I'm just not sure how I feel about going so quietly. I want my voice to be heard. I came to the decision to homeschool out of necessity. Nothing the school could or would offer me is satisfactory and I want them to hear that. I want to tell them my thoughts about  this  experience when I visited the kindergarten classroom where they would have me place Oliver.  I want to tell them how it feels to have an SLP who has no understanding of autism working with my son. I want to tell them what I think of a school district that won't support a family systems model of remediation and yet commonly places middle-school aged children like my son in residential facilities. And yet. ... I have a good friend here in town who fights the good fight. She knows the law. She has educated herself on how to be a good advocate. If you look under mama bear in the dictionary you'll find her picture. But I also know how emotionally draining it is for her. And in the end, even if she gets everything her heart desires for her son, who is so much like my Oliver -- it wouldn't be anything I'm willing to fight over. An old tin can is still an old tin can, even if you knock all of the dents out of it and put a new label on it. I won't be happy with anything less than a paradigm shift. And one little letter from me telling the school district how I  feel  won't even take me a step closer. I've been mulling the idea of writing two letters, one formal, perfunctory letter telling them that we will be homeschooling and another -- sent directly to the superintendent and special ed director -- telling them, well, everything else.

Yet today I had reason to reflect on how far we have come in just a short, short period. What got me in this frame of mind? The Salvation Army, the pharmacy, the post office and the fabric store. You see, it wasn't too long ago that I dreaded -- dreaded -- running errands with my boys. I was often frantic and overly concerned with what other people thought. I was hyper aware of the \"need\" to control Oliver's behavior. And we experienced our fair share of public meltdowns. Can you say \"anxiety\"? Because all of those things together is a sure recipe for anxiety. And let's not forget that there was a period of time when I wouldn't even have considered taking my kids on all those errands, let alone in one morning.  But today, that's just what we did. And do you know what? My kids were super stars. The difference, I think, is that I have learned to slow my pace, relax a bit about both what I expect of my kids and about how much I care about what other people think, and to recognize that all of this is part of an important process. It really is about the journey, not the destination. So when we got to the fabric store and both kids wanted to roam the isles feeling all the fabrics and whatnots -- I let them do just that. It didn't really matter that I never got to look for just the right shade of orange trim for my curtains or that they both tried to make a nest out of a pile of remnants and the sales lady was giving us the evil eye. What mattered was that we stayed together, we laughed, we explored and we all left there feeling pretty good. Being out in the world feels pretty good. Watching both my boys learn to navigate all kinds of people and places just feels right. There was a time not long ago when Oliver absolutely could not tolerate the purchasing transaction. If we selected something to buy and carried it around with us, well, he was not happy to give it up and see it disappear into a bag. But yesterday at the bakery my boy actually pointed -- pointed!! -- to the cookie he wanted, handed the lady the cash, took the change and then greedily ate both his cookie and mine. Did he understand the fine points of the transaction, like how much the cookies cost and how much change he got back? Probably not. But I'm fairly confident that he knows what money is and that you need to pay for things and well, it's a start. One that we wouldn't have if we weren't out there in the world, unafraid to live our lives. Of course, we still have our moments -- like yesterday when Oliver made a grab for the stunned biker dude's bottled water. He nearly had the cap off before I got to him. But in the scheme of things those moments are so small really.  And anyway, the look on that biker dudes face made it totally worth it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/06/being-in-world.html", "title": "\nBeing in the world\n"},

I know it and yet I can't seem to help it. The problem is that Oliver can, at times, be a bit impulsive. He can just take off quickly and run towards something that catches his eye without a thought to this or that thing that feels like imminent danger to me. So tonight we walked the two blocks down to Main Street to check out our city's pathetic excuse for a 4th of July parade. OK, all cards on the table here: I have a pretty serious dislike for parades. But honestly, this parade really was about the worst parade I've ever seen. Don't believe me? What city puts their  garbage trucks  in a parade? Or the bookmobile? Or Joe Bob's roofing contractors? That last was just a beat up old Chevrolet with a hand-made sign on the side. And the sign was made with  magic markers  for pete's sake. OK, I'm a bit off topic here. And besides, the kids liked the parade. Mostly because they got gobs of candy but oh well. Anyway, after the parade we decided to walk the length of Main street to check out what else was going on. Our city has a really nice downtown area. The court house sits right in the middle and Main Street detours all the way around it to make a giant public square. There were lots of tents set up with vendors selling one thing or another and tons of people milling around. So Nik and I decided to try a little experiment with our boy. Without holding his hand or saying a word, we walked aimlessly around the festivities. Occasionally we would stop to look at something or talk to someone -- and all the while, Oliver coordinated his actions with ours. And really this shouldn't have surprised me too much -- that's what RDI is all about: teaching kids how to coordinate and synchronize their actions to those of others. Throughout our little experiment tonight we kept a careful watch on him but not once did we have to alert him that we were moving on or that we were changing course. He walked a few feet behind us and sometimes veered around something in the opposite direction, but he always found his way back to us. I was pretty darn impressed, I have to say -- and it also gave me some measure of peace to test how much he is really monitoring us even though it didn't always appear that he was. I'm still nervous anytime there are cars nearby, but little by little I'm glad to see that Oliver is able to take on a bit more independence.  And I'll have to remind myself to give him the freedom to exercise his skills.

{"date": "July 09, 2008", "body": "\nOur local movie house runs a series of free children's movies in the summer. Today they were showing The  Junglebook . I had been showing  Sami  clips from the movie on  YouTube  and so  Nik  thought it would fun if I took both boys there to see the movie. All 78 minutes of it. I wasn't so sure. Oliver doesn't have a long span of attention and he really isn't much into  tv  or movies lately. But, for  Sami , I thought I'd give it a try. Last night I laid awake wondering if maybe I should find someone to go along with us. I was worried that Oliver would want to leave and  Sami  would be really disappointed. But there really isn't anyone else here who I could get to sit with  Sami  while I walked around town with Oliver. So on the way to the theatre I explained to  Sami  that if we needed to leave I would find the movie at a store later and bring it home with him -- or download it from  Netflix . He seemed OK with that. Both boys were super excited to be in the theater and especially liked the big, comfy red chairs that rock a bit back and forth. Oliver sat all the way inside his chair and squished himself between the seat and the back. He also made occasional loud humming noises.  But he is really good now at checking himself when he sees me put my finger to my lips to gesture (Shhh). My other mistake was to seat him directly below the stream of projection -- he  desperately  wanted to touch the particles of light streaming above his head. Luckily he was distracted enough by the movie that he seemed to forget about it after awhile. But what really surprised me was how long Oliver lasted. We were in there more than 60 minutes and only missed the very end of the show. We went out to the concession stand one time for a little break and I think that helped. Throughout the movie I kept asking him if he wanted to go home and he always responded: \"No. Stay here.\" This alone tickled me to no end. But when he was ready to go he pretty much just stood up and bolted for the door. Actually, he tried to run down the isle but I pushed him for the door, instead -- so maybe he could have watched the whole thing. But the funny thing was that even though it went so well, I was still so stressed out the entire time with the anticipation of things not going well. So after an hour  I  was more than ready to leave! The other really nice thing to see was that Oliver really laughed at all the right places. There are some goofy, slapstick kind of things in the movie and he really thought they were funny. I don't think I've ever heard him laugh out loud at a movie before. Anyway, when we really did have to leave,  Sami  was fine, Oliver was happy, I felt successful and we still had half a  Hershey  bar to share in the atrium.  We had to wait outside until the film let out though because somehow Oliver managed to lose one of his shoes! I have no idea how that happened but another patron found it and brought it out for us. I'm so glad we decided to give the movie thing a try. If it weren't for Sami, I probably never would have considered taking Oliver. But I guess it is good to try things outside our comfort zone every now and then.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/07/expanding-our-comfort-zone.html", "title": "\nExpanding Our Comfort Zone\n"},

{"date": "June 30, 2008", "body": "\nI don't know. Your child has a bad reaction to a vaccination and then, you know, gets diagnosed with Autism and you tend to be a bit skittish about vaccinating after that. On the one hand, I don't think vaccines caused Oliver's autism, but I often wonder if maybe it exacerbated things. The illness that followed his 18 month vaccinations was just so dramatic and his decline afterwards so rapid that  it is hard not to feel there was some link between the two. And even if it was a coincidence, I won't ever feel bad for my caution with  Sami . Anyway, I finally decided that it was time to get off the fence and start immunizing  Sami . He is nearly three and a half and is becoming less and less sheltered and therefore more exposed to people and the germs they carry. And in the Fall I will send him to  pre -school three mornings a week and they require him to be up-to-date with all his shots. I know my pediatrician has given medical waivers to the siblings of other kids with autism in his practice but I don't feel completely right about going that route. Because, like I said, I'm pretty sure Oliver was born with autism and Sami was not. So I called the pediatrician's office and found out that he will need five shots altogether. Since I waited so long he actually needs cumulatively fewer shots than he would have if I'd gone according to schedule. But then I've also decided not to vaccinate for Hep. A and so that means he will actually have to get an  extra  shot. When I asked the nurse if I could tell her when we got there which vaccine we wanted on that day she said: \"You mean you're going to have them all done separately? That's going to take a long time!\" I considered this kind of funny because um, I'd already waited three and a half years! Also, what? Did she seriously think I was going to wait all this time and then go in there and surrender my kid up for a series of six shots? I'm feeling pretty good since I made the decision. At least I won't have to worry every time he gets a fever that it is something seriously contagious that I could have prevented. And in case anyone else who reads this struggles with the whole issue, I just wanted to recommend The Vaccine Book by Robert W. Sears. It is a very balanced and detailed look at the diseases that we  inoculate  against, prevalence rates and risks should you contract the disease, how different manufacturers produce the vaccines, the potential risks of each variety, travel considerations and options to consider when getting each vaccine.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/06/jumping-off-fence.html", "title": "\nJumping off the Fence\n"},
{"date": "July 12, 2008", "body": "\n A recent post  by Mom to JBG made me realize that I don't always write about the things that aren't so great or don't go so well.  Partly that's by design and partly it's because there just don't seem to be that many worth mentioning anymore. But just so you don't get the impression that everything around here is rosey all the time, we had a couple of moments today that completely and totally sucked. And do you know what? For about a half hour I was right back there. I was right back in that sad, sad place where I found myself that summer three years ago when we first started thinking about autism. I hate that place. I hate those moments when my son is just so friggin uncomfortable and unhappy, when I feel lost about what to do, and when everyone is looking at us -- even other  kids  his age and younger -- to figure out why he is crying and so agitated.  And I hate looking around and seeing how easy it is for all the other kids and how their parents can just stand back and watch and not have to navigate and intervene. From where I stand, it looks so effortless for them. We were invited to a lawn party at the church of a good friend. The invitation was extended because every year they put a giant piece of plastic (this thing was probably 20 feet wide and a hundred feet long) on a perfectly sloped piece of land, squirt it with some liquid soap and spray it with water to make one giant slip and slide and my friend thought Oliver would love it. And he did -- although he didn't quite get the idea and kept trying to get up and walk down --- but once at the top again he just could not accept the fact that he had to wait his turn. There were probably only 15 kids and for the most part they really zoomed down the slide so the wait wasn't long -- but he was having none of it.  It wasn't ugly. It wasn't a meltdown. It was just boy who was so extremely agitated that it overshadowed any moments of fun that he might have had. So we left. And it felt like such a huge failure. Yes, I know: Oliver is doing so incredibly well. It's true. And we did the right thing by recognizing that it wasn't working and getting the hell out. But it still sucks. It does.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://hoopdeedoo.blogspot.com/2008/07/staying-busy.html"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/07/other-side-of-it.html", "title": "\nThe other side of it.\n"},

Oh, and the other day, I also was able to teach him a couple of new phrases that seem to be taking hold. Now, instead of saying: \"I want juice!\", Oliver will ask: \"Can I have juice?\" or \"Can I have that?\" It is just a little thing, but it is so nice that he has a new way of asking for what he wants -- and the fact that it is a question and not a statement just totally makes my day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/07/progress-in-little-measures.html", "title": "\nProgress in Little Measures\n"},
{"date": "June 29, 2008", "body": "\nI'm slowly -- SLOWLY -- making my way through all of the Enki materials that came with our kindergarten package. I love the philosophical underpinnings -- they so closely mirror what we are doing with RDI. I hope to post more on that in the future but I'm not anywhere near knowledgeable enough yet to do so now. But one element of the Enki approach that really appeals to me is the idea of using song and rhythm as a guide to movement throughout the day. We've been kind of, sort of, doing this for a few months now and I find that the use of song, chanting, and rhythm has really made a big difference as we move from activity to activity. No more nagging, no more pushing and prodding, no more wrestling kids into clothes or teeth brushing. As I start thinking that it is time to go and get dressed for the day I just start singing the Start of Day Song. It's just a simple song that we made up with very unimpressive lyrics all rhyming with Day -- but the idea is that when I first start humming the song and then singing, the kids are mentally and emotionally preparing themselves for that transition. Then I move into the kids room and sit in front of the closet, they join me, gradually pick out their clothes and get dressed. Depending on what side of the bed they got out of, I may need to help one of them a bit more than usual, but in general I've been surprised with how really well it is working and how little prompting I end up doing. I also have a teeth-brushing song, an eating song and a rest time song. Sometimes I give both of the kids a drum and they play and march along as I sing. I'm not sure why it works, but for us, for right now, it really does. Somehow it gives us a unity of action. It isn't mom saying: OK, time to brush your teeth! It isn't directive at all. It is just a rhythm, a movement that is necessary but also reassuring and enjoyable. I also really like it because the transition from one activity to another then  becomes  an activity: we're singing, we're dancing, we're clapping, we're drumming. I feel less like I'm herding and more like I'm creating moments of warmth and growth. Now that we've been working for a few months to get our daily rhythm going, I'm anxious to see how I'll be able to work in the other elements of the curriculum. One very reassuring thing is that for kindergarten the emphasis is very much focused on experiential learning through play and not on academics. I feel like we've got a couple of years of grace before I start to focus on anything more than what I would already be teaching him through RDI.  It is also so nice that both Enki and RDI remind me to be mindful of what is developmentally appropriate for Oliver and not to try and rush him into some age-based model of learning that would surely make both of us hate the whole process.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/06/rhythm-of-movement.html", "title": "\nThe Rhythm of Movement\n"},
{"date": "May 02, 2008", "body": "\nOliver is the easy one. That's how we characterize our children at the moment. RT, of course, having just turned fifteen is in full teenager mode. He is sometimes sullen and withdrawn, he is occasionally argumentative, but mostly he is just on the go and we don't see him much except when he is asking for a ride somewhere. Or when he tells me at 8:30 pm on the way home from Karate that he needs to take guacamole in for a class the next day and we spend the next forty minutes driving to grocery stores looking for ripe avocados. And Sami? He just wants to argue, debate and TALK about everything. EVERYTHING. Here is an almost verbatim dialog that he had with our neighbor tonight: \"Excuse me, Hannah? Well, thank you so much for this radish that I'm going to take home and put water on and slice up and eat tomorrow because, well, I really like radishes a lot.\" \"You like radishes?\" \"Yes, I actually do like them a lot. And thank you for inviting us to come here and have dinner with you because you prolly didn't know this but I really also like those cheese crackers that you have over there. And, well, we have to go home now but we can come back tomorrow night if you have some more radishes for me to have.\" Lately I've been resorting to requesting five minutes of silence: \"Let's have five minutes of silence now because the trees are so pretty and we need to think about that a little bit. Without talking. OK?\" But Oliver? He is the easy one. He is usually very happy and full of life. He listens so well and is just happy to be doing what everyone else is doing. This is a real change from just a few years ago when everything was such a struggle, so we appreciate now how easy he is. Unfortunately though it isn't always this way with Oliver and the last couple of days -- today especially -- have been a test. Why are the moments of explosive growth always followed by days like this? Yesterday and today were definitely filled with  moments  that didn't feel anything like growth. Oh yeah, these moments remind me, Oliver has  autism . It's not that I forget, exactly, but  I mostly just think of Oliver as Oliver.  But yesterday, for example, he and I were in the front of the house enjoying the weather. I was pulling random weeds and Oliver was walking along the wall that runs along the sidewalk the length of three houses. Then, apropos of nothing, Oliver threw himself down on the sidewalk and started loudly crying. The neighbors were out on their stoops and all eyes were on us. Even though I love my neighborhood and know all of our neighbors, this made me a bit uncomfortable because I think we -- Oliver -- are sometimes the subject of talk amongst the old ladies on the block. I hate giving them more fodder. Anyway, when the crying began I moved in and sat down on the wall just a few feet from him and said softly: \"Come in my lap sweetie and I'll give you a hug.\" So he did and it was all fine. But it wasn't fine because the next day and a half were punctuated with similar moments. The most frustrating thing about Oliver's lack of language is that I have no idea what is bothering him at moments like this. All I can do is soothe him with whispers and kisses and feel totally inadequate. I know that children -- people, really -- can't be in a constant state of growth and development. They need time to internalize growth. But why does the swing of the pendulum have to be so dramatic? On a happier note, however, tonight I received an early Mother's day gift. RT and my brother gave me a three person glider (that converts into a bed!) for the yard. I couldn't have been more surprised when they showed up and started building this thing in the backyard. They finished about a half hour ago -- at 11pm -- and it was so dark that they were looking for all the pieces by flashlight! If I remember tomorrow I'll take a picture and post it here.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/05/easy-one.html", "title": "\nThe Easy One\n"},
{"date": "May 13, 2008", "body": "\nAt the end of a long day today I suggested to Nik that we take the kids to the pool. It has been cold and rainy here and I didn't find the time or energy to take them outside all day so a bit of time swimming for them and the jacuzzi for me felt like just the ticket. It was crowded when we got there but soon the place cleared out and we had the wonderfully warm therapy pool all to ourselves. The kids were having a blast jumping and diving and Oliver especially liked squirting water through the newly acquired space in his lower line of teeth (This time I found the tooth!). All in all, we were feeling pretty good about ourselves as we ushered the kids to the steps of the jacuzzi before going to the locker room. Sitting in the jacuzzi were familiar faces. The doctor with the heavy Vietnamese accent was someone Nik had consulted with before, plus his son and RT were on the same soccer team for many years. He is also a regular at the pool. Then there was another family -- two older kids and a Dad -- from Uruguay. Another lady, also a regular, from Brazil was there. When my Swiss husband sat down it felt a little festive even though we knew only the doctor by name.  But the good doctor knew everyone and started the introductions. When he got to our family he started off by saying that Nik was Swiss and that I was \"purely\" American. And then, in the next breath he said: \"And they have two children, the oldest one there has autism. You know autism? It's like he can't hear anything. And there is some trouble with the brain. ... It's like Rainman. You know Rainman?\" Everyone shook their head \"yes\", and probably decided to let it drop if they had half a brain and could judge by the look on my face. And here's the thing. I was upset but not as upset as I might have been. Yes, what this guy said was stupid. And very rude, considering that Oliver was sitting right there. But I honestly don't think Oliver was listening because the sensory experience of the jacuzzi is so great and because he really, really wanted to get back in the swimming pool. Also, the doctor was sitting a good 8 feet away from us. And I'm a cultural anthropologist for pete's sake. This guy has been in the US for quite some time and he is a doctor (well, a podiatrist), but his knowledge and understanding of autism (among other things) might have been formed in a cultural context so completely different from our own. And every other person in that jacuzzi probably knew and believed something different about autism. If they had all been Americans the very same thought would apply but I wonder if I would have been more outraged than I am. For some reason, after I caught my breath, I was more interested in thinking about the different levels of education, knowledge and varying belief systems and how this little bit of information, (yes, given in a really insensitive way) was being interpreted by them. But what really upset me, more even than feeling like we had just been 'outed', was that given the time, place, and my company -- it didn't make sense to say anything to try and set the record straight. I mean: where would I begin? And there was 8 feet of bubbling water between the two of us and my two little ones who were already up past their bedtimes and badly wanting popsicles. But more than that -- I felt bad because I have so many powerful words to describe Oliver and autism just isn't one of them. And because there is SO MUCH misinformation out there and when the subject of autism does come up, there is no way to neatly package what I have to say on the subject into sound bites and yet I so badly DO want to change the way people think about it. Just like this doctor -- I'm sure he is a good person and is fully capable of changing his perspective. Isn't it part of my job to try? (I know some people will say that this guy was just plain rude and lacking in social graces. But one time when I lived in Thailand a guy was trying to give me a compliment and told me that I had big, beautiful thighs. This was the same guy who told me that I got so many mosquito bites because my big, white body made such an easy target for them. So I know that many, many things in life are culturally realitive!) I guess the only thing I can really do is to talk when people are prepared to listen and to live a life that illustrates what I want people to know.

If we go for a hike Oliver walks right on the edge of the path, usually one foot on the path and one in the weeds. If we walk along a sidewalk next to a wall, one shoulder is usually touching the wall. If he is sitting in a chair he is usually half on, half off. The same with the couch. He usually sleeps with one leg hanging off the side of the bed. ... and all of this is only worthy of mention because, well, he falls a lot. Out of chairs, especially. You'd think after falling out of a chair so many times he would learn to sit with his butt securely planted -- but no! There is something to the feeling of being. ... precarious, I guess -- that appeals to him. So anytime we go someplace with a ledge or water nearby, I am always a nervous wreck, waiting for the fall. Of course, he doesn't usually fall in those places, but given his generally clumsy nature I often worry and wonder why he always needs to be so close to the edge.

It had become so obvious to me that, although I used to find great challenge and satisfaction in my job, things had changed and I needed to find a new direction. It became too difficult for me to split my devotions everyday between my job at home and my job at the office. Going to work became too much like an exercise in collecting a paycheck and I wasn't feeling very good about myself. SO, on the spur of the moment and with a healthy dose of optimism, I quit my job and decided to apply to the RDI certification program.  Yesterday I was accepted. Today I have been breathing deeply with a mixture of anxiety and excitement. I'm on the verge of making an immense change and there is no way to know how things will go unless I jump in with both feet. But jumping has never come all that easily to me. Oh, and did I mention that I will need to be away from home for nearly two weeks in December?  Two weeks ? Nevermind all of the intellectual, emotional and financial challenges that are sure to lie ahead, my mind is having trouble wrapping itself around that one little point and a single distressing thought keeps floating to the surface: \"What will they  eat ?!\"  But in the midst of that bit of angst, I can't help but feel a second bubble of excitement that is floating just  beneath  the surface. I'm doing this. I'm following my gut. I'm not taking the safe, static, route. I've even allowed myself to do a little bit of dreaming on an even larger scale. And here it is, I'll share it with you; my dream for the future: I want to start a local non-profit organization with the hope that I can raise most, or all, of the funds needed to cover RDI services for families who need it most. In my experience, RDI is a lot cheaper than ABA, but it is also a lot less likely to be covered by any kind of insurance or included in any public school supported services, thus putting it out of reach for so many families. I'm pretty good at grant writing and I think I can be pretty persuasive about RDI. So, I'm going to start off in that direction and see where I'm led. I mean, if I'm going to change my whole life then I might as well go for the whole enchilada, don't you think?

{"date": "October 08, 2007", "body": "\nWe're all party poopers at our house. In the most literal sense. I debated a bit about posting on this subject because even though I share a lot of our world, some of it will always, has to, remain private. And also because I hope that by sharing a bit of our world it will, in some small way, influence how others think about people with autism. And the poop thing? Well, yes, it's there for many of us. But is that really what I want to say about autism? About Oliver? In the scheme of things it just isn't that important. Except while you are going through it. Then, if you let it, it can become all-important.  We've been working on the toileting thing since Oliver was three with moderate success. I mean, for over two years now Oliver has known what to do but would not -- WOULD NOT -- do it independently. Then, this past summer, he suddenly would not even do what needed to be done when prompted. Some might have concluded that we'd had a \"regression\" -- but knowing Oliver, I figured out pretty quickly that it was something else entirely and I was, for awhile helpless, as a dynamic of struggle emerged between the two of us that eventually organized most of our day. That was mistake #1. The struggle, in turn, made life rather stressful for all of us and toileting suddenly found it's way to the top of the priority list. Mistake #2.  At the height of the toilet war I realized that Oliver and I were locked in a battle of wills. I knew it and he knew it and since we are from the same stubborn stock we found it impossible to extricate ourselves. Indeed, the hardest part was realizing that I had to be the adult in the situation; realizing that I had to yield. I try very hard to find ways throughout the day to give Oliver control over whatever makes sense -- to let him be independent as much as possible. But my first impulse is to make choices for him and to prompt him to do what I want him to do. It's wrong. I know it and yet too often find myself on auto-pilot. And so it was that Oliver made his stand over the toilet. After all, it is the one thing in life that he pretty much totally controls.  And so I set out to change things between us, to eliminate the struggle for control. And it worked. The first day. I told Oliver that it was up to him. He could use the toilet. Or not. Either one was OK with me. And I could only say that after truly convincing myself that it was so. And for a set period of time each day I planned to just concentrate on playing together within close proximity to the bathroom. I promised myself that I wasn't going to try to  get  anything from him. No pushing for language or to take turns or even for him to interact with me. I was just going to spend time with him and try to have fun. I was going to enjoy myself. And a remarkable thing happened: We enjoyed ourselves together. We spent some time running our fingers across the carpet and watching how the fibers moved. I was tired and lazy so after a minute or so it became strangely meditative. Then we moved to the bathtub and I didn't say \"No\" when Oliver splashed some water at me. Instead I looked surprised and said: \"I'm all wet!\" And do you know what Oliver did? He came over, peered at my face and said:\"You're all wet!\" Then gleefully repeated it a few times until I was more than a little wet, each time saying those same beautiful words that came of his own volition. That alone was worth the price. Sometime during all this I was aware that Oliver was in the process of making a decision. A few times he looked at or went close to the toilet, then slammed the lid down and turned away. But eventually, he just worked it all out for himself and, well, it all worked out.  That was about ten days ago and, although Oliver still needs me to encourage him to use the toilet, we haven't had a problem since. I adjusted my attitude, Oliver adjusted his response and together we are finding our way down this bumpy path. But what I find so instructive about this whole experience was that it secured for me the understanding that so much of what Oliver can do, or does, is wrapped up in his relationship with the people who are most important in his world. It isn't just about the autism. It is about me and about Nik and everyone else who loves Oliver.  In a strange way this whole thing taught me a lesson that I've learned many times over, a lesson that I will probably keep learning: Mothering Oliver isn't just about getting him to do what I want him to do; it is about giving him the ability to decide what should be done -- two very different things. And in a way I'm grateful for this lesson because every day now, for the past ten days, for at least an hour, Oliver and I -- and sometimes Sam -- have had a little party of sorts. And we wouldn't have had that if I hadn't been willing to yield a little bit and let Oliver lead the parade.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/10/party-poopers.html", "title": "\nParty Poopers\n"},

And yet, if there is one thing that I know for sure, if there is one single lesson that I have learned in the past two years of parenting Oliver, it's this: elementary school teachers and Hemingway aside, the sun never rises. And if I stand in one place hoping to get my bearings from something outside of myself then I will always and truly be lost. What Galileo and Columbus both knew is pretty remarkable, isn't it? What they proved is that none of us are really standing still even when it seems that we are. We are all making a journey through time and space that literally changes our perspectives and enables us to see the sun every morning. But the danger is in forgetting that it is we who are moving and not the sun. The danger is in waiting and watching the horizon for a time when things will be different. In the past few years since Oliver was diagnosed with autism I have struggled with acceptance. This was not the life I envisioned stretched out before me. And even while I came to understand and accept the nature of his challenges, I had a hard time looking too far down the road. The draft of our Will that we had revised upon  Sami's  birth and that we unknowingly retrieved from the lawyers office three days before Oliver's diagnosis still sits in an envelope in our important papers file  un -reviewed. Part of me still wants to believe that someday we will look back and laugh at how much we worried that Oliver would never learn to communicate. Or at how much we worried, period. Without even realizing it, a part of me has been waiting and hoping for a time when things will be different. A part of me was always looking towards the horizon. But the miracle of life is that time and movement, imperceptible though they may be, still change us. It's why the beautiful blossoms of daffodils, about to awaken in my garden, orient themselves to to the sun each day. It isn't the sun that is moving, it's the flower changing its perspective. And so it has been with my journey of acceptance. All this time and I haven't really understood that I've been moving even when it seemed that I wasn't going anywhere. Every day my perspective was changing so incrementally that I wasn't even aware of it. And then one day I woke up, saw that sun shining through my windows, reflected on the darkest nights past, my incredible joy at the morning, and realized that I am undertaking a journey that Columbus would envy. My journey is one full of adventure, risk-taking and discovery and is certainly not one I would have mapped out for myself. But everyday I am learning to embrace what I once feared and to find my own bearings. I've been lost on my travels and there are many times when I've looked searchingly towards the horizon. I have no doubt that I will many times again.  But there is a certain comfort for me in this revelation -- however fleeting -- that the sun never rises.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/03/sun-never-rises.html", "title": "\nThe Sun Never Rises\n"},
{"date": "October 31, 2007", "body": "\nSort of. Over the summer it suddenly occurred to me that Oliver couldn't answer yes/no questions. How could that have escaped me? Well, Oliver can say \"No, no, no, no, no!\" when he is asked to do something that he clearly doesn't want to do. And he can say \"Yes\" when you ask him if he wants a cookie. But if you ask him if he wants to wear the red shirt, he has no idea what you are looking for by way of an answer. It has been difficult for me to realize that Oliver didn't even have a grasp on this, most basic, form of communication. No wonder other, more advanced, concepts have proven so difficult for him. So for the past six weeks at our house everything has been about yes and no. And slowly, slowly, he is getting it and our lives are getting easier with his increasing mastery. Because as Oliver realizes that he can influence his environment with yes and no, he is also learning how to express his own preferences. We don't have complete mastery. There are still times when Oliver will answer No when I'm pretty sure he means Yes and vice versa. But we are so close that I can't stop myself from wondering what comes next. What else will this unlock for us?  I can't help but think of this in the context of an on-going conversation that I've been having with our SLP. She doesn't feel as though she is being particularly effective with Oliver. She thinks he needs to be in the classroom. She thinks he needs to be with his same-aged peers. She thinks he will learn more in that environment than with just 45 minutes of speech once a week.  What I said to her in response is this: Developmentally, Oliver is not ready to learn from his peers. Putting him in a classroom where he is only able to fully understand and participate in about 25% of the activities would be extremely stressful to him. And why is it assumed that Oliver will \"pick up\" speech and social behaviors from his peers when he isn't \"picking them up\" from his family and home environment? If Oliver is developmentally delayed -- if he is not functioning at the same level as other five year olds -- then why should any of us expect that he function in an atmosphere that is designed for a five year old? I don't care, at the moment, if Oliver can count or say his ABCs (although he can do both). I just want him to say Yes and No reliably. I want him to be able to communicate his needs and desires. Will they focus on these two things in the school as I am at home? All day, everyday? I doubt it.  I believe all of this. I do. But it is hard to remain confident in the face of so much skepticism. And it is terribly draining to have to constantly convince others (you know, the ones with initials after their names) that I know what I'm talking about and that I'm not doing a terrible dis-service to Oliver by not doing what conventional education theory recommends. And I have to admit that part of me would like nothing better than to hand over the reigns and responsibility to people who probably don't question themselves as much as I do. Apparently Oliver isn't the only one in our family who is learning to say Yes and No with confidence and conviction. Apparently I'm on my own developmental track as well!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/10/we-have-yes-no.html", "title": "\nWe Have Yes, No\n"},

She kept up our friendship even when I was just a limp rag prone to melting into uncontrollable sobs without notice.

She looks at Oliver and talks to him like she would any other little boy. There are only two people I feel safe leaving Oliver with and she is one of them. She confesses her mothering shortcomings to me and helps me to not feel like such a freak for my own. If I ever need to get out of the house with the boys she is always up for a trip to the park or the river. She drops by with her kids just to hang out if she sees my car parked out front and then lets me feed her kids crappy frozen pizza for lunch so we can hang out talking in the kitchen for another forty-five minutes. She always has a positive word and a smile for everyone. And most memorably -- and what has surely earned her a place in heaven if she didn't already have one -- she brought me Panera chicken soup and grilled cheese for the boys one day at lunch after we had a 4-night no-sleep bender and I was very close to the edge.

{"date": "March 16, 2008", "body": "\nMy Sami is really such an incredible joy to me. He is about to turn three and just about every other thing he does makes me want to draw him in to me and squeeze him in an effort to hold on to. ...  what? His spirit? His incredible cuteness? His larger-than-size-two personality? Well, something like that. Of course every  other  thing he does makes me want to ball my fists, clamp my eyes shut and scream! People always talk about the terrible two's, but I think three is much more interesting and difficult. Oh, and have I mentioned that this boy can talk? And manipulate? and Charm? Yesterday I told him that he was too big for me to piggy-back down the stairs and he looked up at me and said: \"But you said I would always be your baby, Mom.\" So naturally, you know, I gave in. This boy won't have any trouble in life but might keep me up a night or two. And he was right to remind me: he will always be my baby. And so, thinking these thoughts so close to his birthday I dug out the birth story that I wrote a few days after he was born three years ago. If I could have ten children I would hope every birth was as wonderful as his!   Sami's Birth Story: After deciding mid-way through my pregnancy that I would give birth at home, I set about making all of the necessary preparations. I found a midwife who would attend my birth and a doctor who would act as the back-up physician in case I needed to transfer to the hospital. I bought all of the supplies I would need and sat on a birth ball several hours a day determined that this baby would not be posterior as Oliver had been.       My pregnancy was smooth and easy and I was looking forward to giving birth. I had borrowed a copy of Ina May Gaskin\u2019s book on Childbirth and read and re-read it several times over. I found the birth stories to be very inspiring and the theoretical part of it made me even more determined to have the birth I wanted: free of intervention and on my own terms.       As my due date drew closer I started to have very regular contractions that became more insistent every evening around 7pm and continuing through the night not allowing me to rest well. Also, the fact that they were so regular made me wonder every night if this would be the night that they would build to meaningful contractions. But every morning I woke up disappointed and tired. Finally, I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and made an appointment for acupuncture on my due date. After receiving the treatment, the acupuncturist told me that his next open appointment was for eleven days later and that he would reserve it for me if I needed it. I remember laughing and telling him that if I was still pregnant 11 days later that he should just shoot me!       Unfortunately the acupuncture treatment didn\u2019t get my labor started but it did allow the contractions that had been keeping me from sleep to subside. I later joked with the doctor that he had given me the anti-induction!       The days came and went, and as anyone who has gone past their due date knows, those days are longer than any days that have come before. I was downright miserable. After seven days I went to my midwife\u2019s house for a non-stress test that showed the baby was doing just fine. On the tenth day past my due date she decided to strip my membranes to see if that would get things going. We left her house and headed straight for our favorite Indian food restaurant for a spicy meal, hoping that something would work!      That evening I started having regular contractions again around 7pm. I said to Nik that he should try and get some sleep because hopefully these would amount to something. Neither one of us were feeling hopeful though. I had said the same thing so many times before. I went to sleep around 10pm after reading a few more birth stories from Ina May\u2019s book. Then, around midnight I woke up knowing that it was time. I was still only having mild cramps but I somehow knew that this was really it. So I took a quick shower and then went downstairs to make some muffins so that the birth crew would have something to eat in the morning. I concentrated on making the muffins but had to stop a few times to brace myself on the counter for contractions that were a bit stronger. For some reason a phrase from Ina May\u2019s book popped into my head and I kept repeating it to myself: \u201cYou have the wisdom of ages in your body.\u201d I said this to myself with each contraction. Wondering how much longer I had I decided not to make the streusel topping that the recipe called for and just put them in to bake. I cleaned the kitchen and when the muffins were done 30 minutes later decided that I should wake Nik so he could shower while things were still under control. At this point my contractions still weren\u2019t very painful and I kept waiting for them to get worse although I could tell they were getting closer together. I also wanted to re-make the bed with the plastic sheets and organize all of the supplies I had gathered.       When I woke up Nik he immediately fell back asleep. I did what I could for the next 20 minutes or so and then pushed him towards the shower. When he was finished we timed the contractions so that we could determine if it was time to call the midwife. A really funny thing happened then: with Nik sitting nearby with a tablet and the stop watch he waited for me to tell him that it was time to start timing the contractions. But by this time the contractions were painful enough that I was kind of leaning over the bed and moaning to work through them. After the first two he waited politely until I was finished moaning and said: \u201cJust let me know when you have a contraction, okay?\u201d But eventually we timed them and found that my contractions were 3-5 minutes apart and about a minute long. I still wasn\u2019t worried because this is the way my first birth began and that one lasted 22 hours! Besides, the contractions just weren\u2019t that painful. At about 3:30 am we called the midwife and she sounded worried that we had waited so long to call her but I explained that they really didn\u2019t hurt that much and that they had only just started about an hour ago. Surely I had a long way to go. At any rate she had a forty-minute drive so she said she would leave immediately.       After we hung up my water broke and my contractions immediately became much more intense. I suddenly became worried that the baby really was coming fast and that Marla, the mid-wife, wouldn\u2019t be here for the delivery. Luckily, my friend Melaine had agreed to be the birth assistant and she lives very close by. I told Nik that he had better call her and tell her to come. We had hoped to wait to call her until a more reasonable hour but I was really feeling like I needed someone other than just Nik with me when the baby was born! Unfortunately Nik must not have realized that I began to think the baby was coming very fast and he told Melaine to take her time!! While we were waiting for the birth team to arrive I was doing my best to cope with the contractions and Nik helped my mother who had come to get Oliver, by carrying him to her car.  Marla arrived then and immediately checked me. I was already dilated to 8 cm! I couldn\u2019t believe it. Even with the intensity of these contractions I was still worried that I would have trouble progressing as I did with my first. I felt most comfortable laboring while kneeling at the foot of the bed and relaxing my upper body onto the mattress during contractions. I made loud moaning-chanting noises through each contraction and \u201cworried\u201d the beads given to me at my blessing way a few weeks earlier. I also kept mentally repeating my mantra: \u201cI have the wisdom of ages in my body.\u201d       The contractions were coming fast and strong now and I heard Marla wonder aloud where Melaine was. But she arrived moments later and I guess I was in transition because the contractions seemed to reach their peak and I found myself telling everyone that I just needed a break. It was all too much and I really just needed a break.  And then I got one. My next contraction was noticeably easier to manage and Marla explained that sometimes this happened with transition. \u201cTransition?\u201d I thought: \u201cHow can this be transition so soon?\u201d    And as soon as that thought occurred I felt the urge to push. \u201cWell, if you feel like pushing then push!\u201d Marla told me. And I did. Three pushes and there he was, my little Samuel. And one by one we welcomed him into the arms of our family. Then  all of us crowded together in my room and enjoyed a breakfast of fresh blueberry/peach muffins. Even the  struesel topping could not have made it more perfect!      Sammy was born at the foot of our bed at 5:26 am, after just three and a half hours of labor, and weighed 7lbs, 6oz.       Two hours later I called the acupuncturist and told him that I would not make my 8am appointment that morning for another try at induction! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/03/other-sam.html", "title": "\nThe Other Sam\n"},
{"date": "March 31, 2008", "body": "\n Spiderman ukulele boy is now three! And he goes everywhere with us. Yesterday he delivered birthday cake to all our friends and neighbors on the street. Today he went with us to the photography shop where we had our passport photos taken. He returned Sami to us at the critical moment but then morphed back into our favorite strumming superhero when we hit the sidewalk. He joined us at Lowe's where we hunted for seeds for our garden (more on that in a minute) and at the grocery store. He ate dinner with us and is now sleeping with his arms wrapped tightly around the ukulele. Oliver used to wear a one gallon potting container on his head every where he went. He even wore it to bed. That was at about the same time he was diagnosed so I thought it was a sign of pathology. Now I see it was the pathology of Three! Today, ukulele boy and the other one walked with me through the fine rain to measure the growth in our garden since yesterday. I love this time of year because every day looks a bit different out there. And this year we have a new gardening adventure on our horizon: vegetables. A neighbor up the block got permission to turn a vacant lot into a community garden and we all got to work this past weekend. As everyone was busy turning the lot into a garden, hauling topsoil, manure and mulch, my two boys joined right in. It was an amazing day. Oliver showed a great interest in the building of a rabbit hutch and our neighborhood bob the builder was such a fantastic and patient guide, helping him to saw and measure and hammer nails. I stood back some distance, trying not to intrude, but inside I was dancing. And it was all I could do not to give this guy a big slobbery kiss at the end of the day. It is so rare to find people who genuinely treat Oliver like just another five year old boy. A couple of times when I was working I looked over into the neighboring yard where all the kids were corralled and marveled. They were all dirty and digging, or walking around with sticks or buckets or whatever. A string of dark clothes was hanging between two trees, one of which housed the funkiest looking tree house you ever saw. Chickens wandered around at the feet of the kids. There was a giant ditch in the middle of the yard filled with muddy water. And Oliver was just part of the milieu. At one point I saw him chasing another little boy and, growing tense, I stopped to see what was going on. Later, the other boy explained that Oliver was trying to get his apple. He had tried to give Oliver an apple of his own but Oliver wanted the one that the boy was eating. Then, my good friend and neighbor explained to the boy that he needed to first take a bite out of the apple he was offering Oliver (for some reason Oliver cannot bring himself to take that first bite). Now, let me just say that this is kind of a strange thing about my boy. And I was too far away to navigate the situation for him, which always makes me feel uneasy. But watching all this transpire and hearing the boy tell me about it later, with a great deal of pride and humor, I felt immeasurably better. Somehow we have found ourselves in a community of people who are willing to help Oliver navigate without making us feel that he is so very strange or different. Sometimes, when I think of the school situation, I find myself thinking: there is just no place for my boy. But after this day of fresh air, blue skies and a couple of apples, I'm beginning to believe that might not be true after all and I am oh, so grateful. This is the vacant lot that will soon be our garden! And here it is underway! The start of a rabbit hutch (portable fertilizer!).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/R_b5nIGn1II/AAAAAAAAAII/uMW3VtBosNs/s1600-h/IMG_0643.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/R_b6WYGn1JI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/HEQyg0Pd2Q0/s1600-h/IMG_0618.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/R_b6WoGn1KI/AAAAAAAAAIY/VeYY8B6R_4I/s1600-h/IMG_0621.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/R_b6YIGn1LI/AAAAAAAAAIg/-rpfNCYS5kw/s1600-h/IMG_0630.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/03/good-stuff-all-way-around.html", "title": "\nGood stuff all the way around\n"},

{"date": "March 22, 2008", "body": "\nI'm not sure what is going on around here but I'll take more of it. Just like I said yes to a second bowl of ice cream tonight after the kids went to bed. (Shhh. Don't tell my butt!) First, Oliver is sleeping. Every night. All night long.  The only exceptions have been when one of the kids has had a nightmare or an accident. I guess I really should consider putting them in separate beds, but I love seeing them curled up around each other each morning when I peek in at them. Plus, they have been so separate for so long, you know? Watching them together now -- day and night -- is like a little gift. After a couple of weeks of prompting Sami to talk directly to Oliver he has now decided that it is his mission to communicate with his brother. He will stand patiently in doorway, shouting: \"C'mon Oliver! I want to play with you!\" until Oliver reluctantly goes to join him. Today, as the kids and I were at the counter making granola, Oliver reached out and tenderly hugged Sami twice and all three of us were standing there with drippy smiles on our faces. The other pretty remarkable thing is how communication seems to be happening. Today when Nik came home from swimming with the boys I was rushing around the kitchen heating up leftover chicken and rice for them -- they are always ravenous when they get home. Before dishing up I decided to ask Oliver if he wanted some. His reply: \"No! I want a bagel!\" Said just like that. Alrighty then, I said, you shall have a bagel! And when we go someplace, Oliver always walks around the car and opens the door for his brother, then waves his arm and says: \"C'mon, Sami!\"  He sometimes gets his words confused: he'll say tv instead of music, water instead of honey, candy instead of carrot (yes, my crazy kid really wants the carrot, not the candy), raisins instead of nuts. But he is still using words and gestures to communicate in a more meaningful way. And he is finally starting to be able to answer the question: What do you want? In the past he would always just repeat the question back to me, which doesn't help anyone.  Parallel to this -- which shouldn't surprise me -- is that his receptive language is skyrocketing. There are hardly any moments during the day when I wonder if he is really understanding me. I'm not sure exactly what all this amounts to, but there is a subtle shift going on inside of my boy. Or maybe the shift is inside our home. I started really noticing these things -- well, the sleep thing was hard to miss -- at almost the same time that I started staying home with the kids. For the last couple of months it has just been me, and Sami and Oliver -- all day, every day. And it has been wonderful. Honestly, I couldn't imagine that I would love being with them so much. So I can't help but wonder if one has something to do with the other.  Or maybe he is functioning better because he is sleeping better and he is sleeping better because he is now night-time potty trained. Sometimes life feels a little bit like alchemy to me: you mix together a bunch of ingredients and hope for gold.  I wish it were a more exact science. I wish the lines were straighter; that A=B. I wish I didn't still grind my teeth at night. I wish my husband wouldn't bring home ice cream on Friday nights, and that Bryers would quit offering those buy one get one free deals. But for now anyway, we all seem to be blossoming in new and unexpected ways (no cracks about my butt, please**). It seems we are really ready for a change of seasons in this house.

I didn't really have the intention of stopping her services when we began the conversation, but when she started telling me that all the ridiculous picture-based activities (Hand me the angry face -- said in that fake, soothing professional voice) were because she was trying to measure his receptive language ability and \"everything you read about autistics is that they are visual learners.\" I had a hard time keeping my temper. Then she held up a book and said that what she really wanted was to have a dialog with him about the pictures in a book but that he simply wouldn't attend to her enough to be able to do so, well, I knew what had to happen. I mean, why do people think that all those with autism are visual learners? Because Temple Grandin is? What about OLIVER ever made her think he was a visual learner? Why is OK to generalize about a whole population of people? And what? he won't pay attention to her stupid book so he suddenly has an inability to attend? What about her own ability to make it interesting or meaningful to him? Why isn't that ever questioned?! Maybe if I typed this in all caps you would get a better sense of my outrage. And my outrage isn't directed at her (well, she is a convenient target but actually, she is a nice person -- just incompetent).

I'm so sick of it I could just spit. In fact, I think I will. Wait a minute. Ok. I'm back now. I feel better. But only slightly. After she left that day I turned to my lovely boy and said: Oliver, can you get me the eggs? I think we should make some cookies. Without missing a beat, Oliver went to the fridge, got out the eggs and put them on the counter. Then he moved the stool over, climbed up and started reaching for the sugar. I mean, how's THAT for receptive language ability?

Like  Rooster's Mom  always says: I should be wary of the Gods. Oliver didn't sleep well. I didn't sleep well. I have a looming deadline for my certification and am dealing with an unexpected setback that made me feel startlingly vulnerable emotionally. The kids were needy. I was tired. Sami and Oliver were both ignoring me for different reasons. All of the progress that I saw in Oliver yesterday wasn't enough to outshine all the room for progress I saw today.  Nik literally did a song and dance to try and cheer me up and I wanted to smack him for not letting me have my black, black day in peace. I just really, really wanted everyone to go away and leave me alone. I think I may have even said some version of those words out loud. But I did consent to go to the track with my three guys for a couple of laps after dinner. We left the house and I smelled snow in the air, but Oliver had a wicked smile on his face, tempting me to chase him up the block towards the track. I gave in and felt something good and warming start to flood my body as we raced up the sidewalk. At the light we waited and when the walk sign appeared I nudged Oliver forward and then followed him at a jog across the intersection, his smile so bright and happy that I left my bad mood firmly behind. But then Oliver unexpectedly veered off the crosswalk and edged over into the lane of moving traffic. I stood, frozen. I screamed and the first car slowed and stopped just in time. But there were two lanes of traffic and I could see another car coming just as Oliver, confused now, crossed into that lane, directly into the path of the on-coming car.  I screamed again, that horrible sound that you can't believe comes from your own body. And somehow, the Gods that I thought had been cursing me all day, let my boy return safely to the sidewalk. So. Gods?

And this morning? 8:42 am and still counting. Or should I say that the only thing going on around here, for the younger generation, is sleep. Blissful sleep. Five nights and counting. And not only is Oliver sleeping but he is going to sleep easily. He is  asking  to turn the lights out and go to sleep. And he is doing it without melatonin. The funny part is that I only just came to the revelation that Oliver has a true sleep disorder and made an appointment with his pediatrician to talk about it. For a long time I believed that the sleeping -- or lack of it -- was just part of the autism. But then I thought about what I know about the core deficits of autism and realized that messed up sleep patterns weren't part of it. So why not look at the sleep thing as a true disorder, distinct from the autism? The last time we went to see the pediatrician about this she recommended melatonin -- and that has been a fantastic help to us. It used to be that it took me two hours or more to get Oliver settled into sleep. When he was an infant that meant laying in bed with him, completely immobile, in the dark, as he was latched on. For  two hours . When he finally drifted off to sleep I would come out of the bedroom like a mad woman, half asleep myself and angry and resentful that I was the only one who could nurse this boy and that Nik and RT had been helping themselves to the rest of the ice cream because \"who knows how long you'd be in there.\" I did that for more than two years. Two years! Now it seems like a herculean task beyond belief. But at the time it was just what I had to do, so I did it. The same has been true for the general lack of sleep that we've endured. Five years is a long time to live with broken and non-existent sleep. Especially when you have to get up and go to work every morning and manage to pretend that you aren't the coffee mainlining zombie that you really are.  Nik and I became like battle-hardened veterans. We traded in our coffee maker for an espresso machine and exchanged silent, amused looks whenever any of our friends or colleagues complained about how tired they were because of a sick child. Truly, we started to believe that no one, ever, in the history of mankind, was ever as tired as we were. But also, in a weird sort of way, we just got used to it. We learned how strong we were. So I'm not really sure what to think about these last five nights. They are a gift for sure. Part of a  trend ? One can only hope! But the perspective of a few nights of sleep also reminds me of how our life, in some ways, is so fundamentally different from those of just about everyone else we know. Parallel but different. And hard sometimes. But overall, I have to say, pretty good. And today? Five times better!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/02/five-and-counting.html", "title": "\nFive and Counting\n"},

{"date": "January 25, 2008", "body": "\nIt was surprising, I told my visiting friend and fellow RDI mom, how everything can change dramatically in a very short period of time. A few months ago I could not have lounged on the couch chatting with her, cup of coffee in hand, while Oliver played alone upstairs. A few months ago I would have kept almost constant visual contact with him, especially in the afternoon. Toilet training -- or lack of it -- had taken over our lives and I was hyper-fixated on the task. And now, I told her with a peaceful smile on my face, I don't have to be so watchful. I can relax. I don't worry at all. I didn't even worry or get up to check when I heard water running in the upstairs bathroom. Oliver often gets his own glass of water. And sometimes he likes to play with water in the sink or bathtub. And now that I reflect on it, it was surprising that I didn't go to check when I heard actual splashing coming from upstairs. Lately, I told my friend, Oliver has been asking for a bath in the late afternoon. He must be drawing himself a bath. I just hope he took his clothes off first, I said with a laugh. So when I said good-bye to my friend and finally went upstairs to check things out I was quite surprised to see a totally naked little boy running out of the bathroom. I was equally surprised to find that all the water splashing was, in fact, cup after cup of water drawn from the sink, hitting the bathroom floor. And let's just say there was quite a lot of water in there by the time I arrived. We live in an old house and the floor in the bathroom is a bit bowed -- which I hadn't noticed before now -- and the water had collected like a small indoor lake, lapping at the feet of the tub and toilet.  I was also surprised that it didn't even occur to me to yell at Oliver. \"You'd better get some towels, Mister,\" was about all I said. And he did.  \"And don't ever do this again.\" After we got all the water cleaned up and deposited nine soaking wet towels in the bathtub I turned my attention to getting Oliver dressed and we fell into a lively game of basketball, pretty much forgetting about the water incident. So then imagine my surprise when RT came home from school and said from the downstairs hall: \"So, did you see all this mess down here?\" \"Um. What mess?\" \"All the water pouring out of the light in the kitchen ceiling.\" \"Hmph.\" Upon closer inspection, water was actually coming from just about every nook and cranny in the kitchen. I had no idea we owned so many nooks and crannies. Six more soaking wet towels landed on the laundry room floor. And even more surprisingly, Oliver and I went back to our game of basketball and I again forgot about all the water.  When Nik got home some time later he asked me how my day went. \"I had a really nice visit with J.  Oliver and I had a lot of fun playing today. Actually, it was a really good day,\" I told him.  And do you know what? It really was. It's kind of surprising, but on days like this I kind of feel like I'm actually getting the hang of this parenting thing.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/01/surprising.html", "title": "\nSurprising\n"},
{"date": "February 14, 2008", "body": "\nI've been wanting to post. I even started a couple of times. There is a post brewing inside my head. It's bubbling, simmering, but not quite there yet. Each time I start to work it out there are lots of dots and dashes taking the place of finished thoughts, so I hit the 'save now' button, X out of blogger and think: \"Tomorrow I will finish\".  But when I review it the next day nothing is exactly right so I delete it and another day goes by without a word here. THIS isn't THAT post. But it's something. And the other? Well, if you see a post here in the next couple of weeks titled 'The Sun Never Rises', then you'll know I've succeeded. I mentally work things out by coaxing little germs of perceptions into words and if I'm lucky, sentences. And this? Well, there is something about it that just isn't ready yet. It's like a small animal living in the darkened recesses of my bedroom closet. I visit it a few times every day offering platefuls of food but so far no luck. We'll see. But in the meantime, there is lots of LIVING going on here, in this house, outside the closet door. Today we had an extra fantastic stupendous time at the dentist. I take Oliver in every three months, alternating cleaning appointments with \"happy\" visits, hoping to get him used to the place and the experience of rubber-gloved hands reaching into his mouth with sharp, metal instruments. And today we had some luck. Without much to-do, Oliver sat through an entire cleaning. I couldn't stop telling him how proud I was -- because I was absolutely bursting. And the hygenist told me that he has one loose front tooth and two six year molars poking through. My boy. Isn't he too young to lose a tooth? Or is it just that I'm not ready for this particular rite of passage? And then there is the playdoh. And the homeschooling. I ordered my Enki kindergarten package a few weeks ago thinking that I had better get a jump on things for the fall and also that *I* needed to come up with some kind of structure for our days before my head simply started spinning from too many days without the inertia to do much of anything. I LOVE being at home with the kids. LOVE IT. Love it. But sometimes the days they do stretch on, ya know? So when the curriculum materials arrived and I started to read through them I was pretty impressed but also daunted. OK, I thought: circle time? ADVENTURE circle time? Outside? I can just really see myself outside with a big stick poking and herding my kids up and down the sidewalks and alleys with the other neighborhood moms shaking their heads and clucking at me from their kitchen windows, watching as their own kids play quietly with dolls and farm animals in the next room.  I so love the ideas, the foundations, upon which this curriculum is based, but I just so do NOT love having to be the one to get my kids to do it. Especially Oliver, I thought. Even the most basic parts of this, like story-time, are going to require lots and lots of scaffolding. But then, I broke out the playdoh. We haven't used playdoh here in over a year, I'm sure. Sami was immediately enthralled and declared that he was going to make a \"whole forest full of bears\". It took Oliver a little bit of persuasion, but not all that much as I think of it now. And then, there they were: both boys at the kitchen table experimenting and exploring with the materials. A half hour passed. An hour.  Ninety  minutes. And they were still at it. As I watched them from my position at the kitchen counter, leafing through the vast curriculum notebooks, I found myself daring to think: maybe this won't be as hard as I fear. Later, when I moved the boys upstairs to my bed for family quiet time, in which we all lay together and each pretend to read a book, I also pretended not to watch as I saw something begin to blossom between my boys. Laying together with their head on the same pillow they touch their foreheads together and couldn't get over each other. Really. Their smiles and giggles at each other were beyond priceless to me. The two of them pretty much ignore each other during most of the day, but since we started these quiet times I see, finally, a brotherhood emerging between them. I can't wait to see where this leads. It occurs to me that if I had chose a different path -- to keep working, to send the kids off to school -- that I wouldn't have the luxury of allowing them this time together. I feel so incredibly blessed to have this time and space to watch and allow things to unfold. Happy Valentine's Day my friends.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/02/outside-closet-door.html", "title": "\nOutside the closet door.\n"},
{"date": "February 28, 2008", "body": "\nThe good sleep continues. I'm not sure what we did to deserve it but our luck is holding out. I've even stopped counting the nights. Just like with the toileting, our reality has changed seemingly overnight and the further we get down the road in this new land where nothing actually happens in the middle of the night, the harder it is to believe that things used to be so dramatically different. We've had good spells before though so I'm not optimistic enough to actually start looking for real estate in the land of nod or anything. But I'm growing my herd of sheep nightly. And it is a good thing, too, because our recent appointment with the pediatrician when I was anxious to talk about sleep disorders was a complete bust. Really, I don't know what I was thinking. How many times do I have to see that blank look reflected back at me before I really get it? Educators and members of the medical establishment almost universally seem hold low expectations for my son and his quality of life. When I described Oliver's sleep patterns the pediatrician literally sighed and, while looking bored, said: \"We see this a lot in kids with autism.\" He might as well have just said: \"Suck it up.\"  Nik thinks we should look for a different practice but I just don't have the stamina for it. When it comes to educators and doctors I seemed to have developed almost universal low expectations. So I'll just suck it up. But I'm not bitter or anything. Far from it. At the moment things are going rather swimmingly. Each night after I tuck the kidlets into bed I sit myself down at the computer and spend a couple of hours immersed in learning. And my learning is making an impact on the way I am able to guide Oliver's learning. What could be better? I've written a bit about our struggles to help Oliver understand the nature of communication. I have been stymied about how to teach Oliver to reliably answer yes and no. Sometimes it really seems as though he gets it but when he is tired or when he isn't up to form, 'no' means 'yes' and 'yes' means 'no'.  But recently I've been reading about how infants learn to communicate and how they learn to interpret communication from others. It doesn't start with words. In the beginning,  infants  are participating in communication events that are based on visuals, vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions. Words don't come until much, much later, usually sometime during the second year. So I decided to take a step back and try to communicate using just those means and as few words as possible. When we started RDI last year I learned to talk much less than is natural for me, to amplify my facial expressions and increase my use of gestures, but I never went as far as eliminating language altogether. Intuitively I always felt that if I wanted Oliver to talk then I needed to model language. But I have also known for some time that what he struggled with most was the very nature of communication,  not necessarily the production of words. We are two days into our little experiment and I'm not sure how much of an impact it is having but I do know this: today we had our first two arguments. He wanted something and I didn't want him to have it and both of us stood there shaking and nodding our heads at each other.  In the past Oliver would pretty much imitate anything I did or said hoping it would get him what he wanted. So if I shook my head no he would do the same, thinking/hoping, that this was what he needed to do. He wasn't communicating, he was imitating. There was no real meaning behind it. But today was different. It was a real argument and it was beautiful and clear and I gave in almost immediately. I would happily lose a thousand of those kind of arguments. And the best thing about this little exchange is that both Oliver and I came away from it motivated to keep trying. And I feel pretty confident that already we are both getting it right. And now I'm off to find my sheep.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/02/sleep-sheep-and-lovely-arguments.html", "title": "\nSleep, Sheep and Lovely Arguments\n"},
{"date": "September 10, 2007", "body": "\nDo you ever have days where you think you just don't stand a chance? Days when you just want to throw up your hands in defeat? I'm having a month like that.  Overall, I would say that I'm a fairly positive person, particularly so when I write or talk about Oliver and autism. In my opinion the real tragedy about Autism is that it is so hard to find positive stories about it in the media. Except of the \"I saved my child through the strength of my love and my steely determination\" variety. So I try to do my little part to spread positive messages. And that is one reason I'm so happy for the blogosphere: real people telling real stories that show the tremendous variety of human experience in every life.  But lately I've been finding it difficult to remain upbeat. When we decided to keep Oliver out of school this year I felt pretty good about that decision. We'll work primarily on communication issues, I thought. And so when the school district also agreed to chip in for some speech therapy each week, I welcomed the idea. A few weeks ago the SLP called and we made an appointment and discussed what goals we would try to work on with Oliver this year. I also asked that she do an initial evaluation since we haven't had one in several years. As our appointment date grew near I was hopeful that the SLP's input would help give some focus to our efforts at home -- you know, professional guidence. But I didn't realize that I had such high expectations until they all came crashing to the ground half-way through our appointment.  And let me just say this, I like the SLP and I'm trying not to jump to conclusions about how useful her input is going to be. But it was hard to find anything positive at the end of that first hour. First, she was sitting less than a foot from Oliver while she was administering the evaluation and she was talking at the top of her lungs as though he were deaf. Later, she asked if there was any kind of food item that she could use to get Oliver to sit in his chair. She repeatedly grabbed Oliver's chin and tried to turn his head to look at the photos she had laid out in front of her. And at the end of the session she said that she thought she should concentrate on teaching Oliver common vocabulary by getting him to label pictures.  But here is the thing: I had already spent a great deal of time explaining to her my opinions about Oliver's problems with language and why I think verbal behavior isn't the right approach in our case. I have never really understood why Oliver can't -- or won't talk -- and no one has ever been able to explain it to me either. One \"expert\" told me that Oliver wasn't talking because he wasn't MOTIVATED to speak. That realization completely flabergasted me until I realized that it was completely wrong. There are so many times when Oliver very clearly wants to communicate with us. When he is desparate to communicate something but just can't. And then there are exchanges like this: Me: Oliver, what is this? Oliver: perfing. Me: These are glasses, Oliver. Glasses. Oliver: Glasses.  Me: What is this? Oliver: Perfing.  Me: No, they are. ..? Oliver: Mmm.  (From our studies of the phonemes, this is the sound of the letter M.) Me: No.  Oliver: T. (Again, the sound that the T makes from our phoneme studies.) Me: They are glasses. Oliver: Glasses.  And let me just say that Oliver knows what glasses are. Sometimes he can produce the word on the first try and sometimes he can't. If you pointed at the glasses across the room and said: \"Oliver, bring me the glasses,\" he would know what you were talking about and bring you the glasses. So, in my opinion, Oliver's language problem has more to do with being able to retrieve the right word when he wants to use it. Is this then a neurological issue or a speech issue? Or both?  I don't know the answer. And that is just the point. I don't understand fully what the problem is but I do know that the issue is one of communication, not just speech, and that teaching him to label pictures is like using an eye dropper to water a tree.  Maybe the SLP is on the right track and since I'm not an expert in Speech Pathology I can't say much about that. But I do know, after watching her work with Oliver for an hour, that she is looking at him purely as a non-verbal, autistic child with a set of challenges that are sure to get in the way of her teaching him to talk. She is not looking at him, she is looking at how he \"presents\". So a big part of me wants to just cancel the services all together. I don't think it will help. I think it will be stressful if she continues her agressive way of working with him.  But then I stop myself and have to ask: Just who do I think I am? I'm NOT an expert. I don't understand why Oliver can't seem to find the words when he needs them. And I certainly don't know what else I -- or anyone else can do -- to help his brain make the connections that it needs to so that he can decode language and understand the nature of communication. And then I get all wrapped up in self-pity because not only do I not know what to do but I also don't believe that any of the experts know what they are doing either.  I'm going to give the SLP a chance. I'm going to sit side-by-side with them and make sure that she respects his personhood and his unique needs and I'm going to refrain from judgement in the short term.  And in the long term I'll try to keep from throwing my hands up in the air. Because that surely never helped anyone.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/09/just-who-do-i-think-i-am.html", "title": "\nJust Who Do I Think I Am?\n"},
{"date": "February 29, 2008", "body": "\nOK. So maybe I AM bitter. I mean sometimes I just feel like we are totally moving off the grid, here. When I decided to quit my job and do RDI full-time I knew it would mean that I was going to take up the reigns of engineering Oliver's remediation. That's OK. I'm glad for it. And that is how it should be. And then, of course, there is the homeschooling. Our schooling options here in Virginia are so limited that homeschooling has really become our only option. I know that sending Oliver off to school each day would be counter-productive. So I'm happy to take that on as well. And don't even get me started on the doctors and medical experts we have seen! But every Friday afternoon when the speech therapist leaves I find myself feeling so very low. I know that it is a total waste of our time but I can't bring myself to give it up. I'm not ready to become an expert on speech as well as everything else. I just want some support. I want some outside resources to help us along on our way. We will get there -- wherever 'there' is. I'm sure of that. But I really don't want to do it all. I want professionals who are willing to really examine what they are teaching and why and to be willing to throw it out the window if it doesn't fit. To do some research and ask the right questions. And to look at Oliver as a boy with some challenges, not just a boy with autism. Because one size doesn't fit all. But what we have is so very lacking. Today the SLP started off her session by trying to get Oliver to label pictures of faces with the correct emotion: happy, sad, angry. Then she moved on to getting him to label colors and assign quantities. Oliver was a good sport about it but I know him well enough to know that it was totally random whenever he did manage to get something right. And if she said: \"Good sitting!\" and \"Good listening!\" one more time I thought I would reach across the room and smack her.  I'm not saying that these aren't good things to teach someone with a language deficit -- but it is just so far ahead of where Oliver's skills are at the moment that it seems pretty meaningless to me. I'm left feeling so conceited. I'm just a mom. I'm a mom who has done about a million hours of reading on the subject of autism and child development over the last two years, but still just a mom. And when I find myself thinking that we would be better off with nothing than with the wrong thing, when I think we are better off just working it out on our own, I can only marvel at my own arrogance. But on a more positive note: my day was filled with more arguments than I could count. Oliver is really learning to assert himself with the nod of his head! There is absolutely no uncertainty that he knows what our silent dialog is all about. I tried the opposite though: asking him to do something that he didn't want to do and that was less successful. As soon as I started insisting with a yes head nod he followed suit and nodded yes. But with some success under our belt I'm eager to see if he picks it up as quickly.

{"date": "September 05, 2007", "body": "\nI really can't believe that September is here already. Is it just me or did summer go amazingly fast? I know, I'm slow coming to this point. All of you have been preparing for the turn of the calendar page for weeks. But since my kids aren't yet school age (except for RT and he is SO low-maintainance) we don't have any formal transitions to make so it was quite easy to deny that summer was actually coming to an end.  And then? The pool closed for the season. I can't begin to describe how incredibly happy I am watching Oliver in the pool -- and indeed, how incredibly happy he is with himself. Swimming is the only thing so far in life that Oliver has really wanted to do for himself. It is the first thing that he has undertaken of his own initiative. I don't have to push, praise, cajole or motivate. He is persistant because he wants to figure this swimming thing out. Each time we go to the pool I see him try something new and he tries it over and over again until he gets it right. First doggie paddling, then great cannonball jumps from the side that took him right to the bottom of the pool. Then, last week I saw him relax in the water, laying back, pointing his chin to the sky and slowly letting his body rise to the surface. He did it again and again, each time floating for just a little bit longer. A few days later he was still practicing this new skill -- but the BEST part was that each time he really felt himself floating he picked his head up with a huge grin on his face and looked around to find me as if to say: Do you see me, Mom?   On the last day at the pool he began to let his head slowly sink beneath the surface, eyes wide open, and once under the water he reached for my hands and swam a bit towards me. At first when I saw him going under I thought he was so exhausted from all the swimming that he was drowning and I pulled him back to the surface. But then I realized that he was concentrating deeply, preparing himself, in the seconds before he slipped under the water. (Still, it was hard for me not to want to drag him up!). A few times he even made a break for the diving board which sits atop twelve feet of water! I know he will be ready to jump long before I am ready for him to jump!  Luckily for us, the pool will re-open under cover in two weeks. But I'm pretty sure it will be a LONG two weeks.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/09/more-on-my-fish.html", "title": "\nMore on My Fish\n"},
{"date": "September 20, 2007", "body": "\nSeptember is a big month around here: Oliver turned five, I turned thirty-eight, Nik turned forty-nine, and our 6th wedding anniversary is on the 29th. That, plus the change in seasons has me thinking a bunch about change.  What a difference a year makes, huh? And two years? Well, it would be hard for most people to comprehend the changes we've been through over the last two years. In a lot of ways, the trajectory has been at a solid, forty-five degree angle. But in some ways it has been an arc, and we are back where we were before Oliver was diagnosed. In a good way. First, the forty-five degrees. That's Oliver. Wow, that kid is amazing! He is really developing a bit of independence. When we walk together now, he refuses to hold my hand -- as any five year old might. But the difference now is that I can let him walk by my side and not worry (well, almost) that he will dart into the street or run away from me towards something that catches his eye. The other day we walked together to my mother's house. She lives about a half mile from me and at some points he was nearly a block ahead of me. And I wasn't worried. If I needed to I would call out: \"Don't get too far ahead!\" and he would stop and wait for me. A year ago this would not have been possible. And when we go to a store or any other busy place, I don't constantly have to keep my eye on him. He knows that he needs to stay with me. Sometimes he wanders away a bit but he always comes back. Going places is so much less stressful than it used to be.  Yesterday we went swimming at the new pool for the first time and I just stood back and soaked my boy in. Now that he has the basics down he is swimming really beautifully -- not just the doggie paddle but something that looks like the back stroke and the side stroke. He is also swimming under water a few feet at a time. He is so extremely capable in the water. It is such a joy for me. Then later in the evening I decided to take the boys for a bike ride. It was garbage night though so the sidewalk was dotted with garbage cans the entire length. But Oliver and Sam both navigated around all the obstacles and only fell a couple of times. Each time they both jumped up, picked their bikes up and got right back on. Sami kept saying: \"I'm riding with my brother!\" It was so cute. Then I thought back to the many, many hours we spent trying to teach Oliver to pedal and how he would just sit there, on the bike, not moving a muscle. I wondered if he would EVER learn to ride a bike. And now here he is, incredibly capable on the bike.  And then there is the arc of development. That's mine. There was a time, more than two years ago, when there was never any doubt -- any question, even -- that I was the expert on my child. I never would have thought to ask anyone for input on my parenting. I am a believer in attachment parenting and that's what I did: I breastfed him until HE chose to stop at 2.5; He never slept anywhere but with me; I carried him close to my heart in a sling until he grew too heavy. I never let him cry. I wanted him to feel secure, attached, not alone in this world. That was the best way, I thought, to help him feel confident enough to develop independence. I never would have thought that someone understood Oliver better than I did.  But then the diagnosis came along and my grasp on motherhood loosened. Suddenly there was someone else who claimed to understand Oliver better than I did. When I would talk to her about something particularly troublesome she would tell me what to do. I  wanted  her to tell me what to do. Live through enough 45-minute long tantrums that end with you and your child both covered in vomit and you'll know what I mean. I was  glad  she was there and she was glad to share her expertise with me. And yet, I now see how much our parenting strategies changed and how this person's appearance subtly shifted the dynamics in our house. I see how vulnerable we all were and how we lost something intangible and yet so valuable.  I came to really resent this person and am glad that she is no longer present in our lives. And don't get me wrong: she is no monster. She is acting from the heart. She believes she is helping families. But from our experience I also now see that these \"experts\" hold a tremendous power over families in their most vulnerable state. To not recognize that is almost criminal.  Anyway, back to the arc. It took me awhile, but I have finally reclaimed my hold on motherhood. I put our bond, our relationship, first and know that Oliver will go as far in life as he is able. It is my job to see no limits, only potential. The experts, those who label and classify him, don't know shit. Because he is not apart from us, his family. He is a part of us, his family. It took me two years to fully embrace my instinct and intuition again and sometimes I still falter. But overall, I must say, it feels good to be back where I started.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/09/where-we-are-is-where-we-were.html", "title": "\nWhere We Are Is Where We Were\n"},
{"date": "November 09, 2007", "body": "\nSo, about a week ago Oliver had a piece of pizza. I watched him. And I waited. And I watched some more, trying to be as objective as possible. Mostly what I saw was just a very, very happy boy. After that my heart wasn't really in it anymore.  Going GFCF wasn't really that difficult for us. I want to say that it was even  easy . Give me some rice noodles, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, lime, basil, meat, chili peppers, maybe an egg or two and I can usually whip up something in about 20 minutes. And usually it would be gobbled up by just about everyone except Sami who doesn't eat these days just to be contrary.  We started the diet on August first and kept it up, without infraction, for almost 14 weeks. But if there was any difference in Oliver is was extremely subtle. Extremely subtle. Oh sure, there were times when I thought he seemed more this or less that, but there were an equal number of times when he was dysregulated and I had to wonder if it was him or me. Because really,  I'm  often very dysregulated. And we're a unit, my boy and I. So in the end, it was really hard for me to say that the diet made any difference at all. Except that without all the bagels I dropped five pounds.  But here is the interesting part (to me, anyway): I'm feeling a bit guilty about it. You see, the day after the piece of pizza I loaded the boys into the car and took them to the cookie store. Both boys know the downtown bakery as the cookie store and going there is one of our favorite outings. \"Let's go on an adventure\", I'll say. \"To the cookie store!!\" Then, we pile in the car and I drive a half mile to the city center. I park in the parking garage, we make our way to the bakery, go inside and order up four cookies for a dollar. I like the snickerdoodle and the boys both like the chocolate crinkle or chocolate chip. I give Oliver the money and he pays the lady, then we find our chairs in the back of the little seating area and have at it -- each of us seeing who can eat our cookie the quickest and lay claim to the fourth. Normally Oliver wins but usually I can convince him to give me half.  I love taking the kids to the cookie store. I love everything about it. I love how excited they are to be in a parking garage. I love how the bakery smells. I love how competent Oliver is at navigating his part of the adventure. I love how Sami gets covered with gooey chocolate. I love how the bakery ladies cluck over how handsome my boys are. And I love how someone looking at us from the outside would think we are just like any other family -- how for that half hour excursion I  feel  just like any other family.  But then a little annoying voice in the back of my head says things like: maybe you just didn't do it right. Maybe you didn't try long enough. Maybe it takes six months. A year. Maybe you should have also cut out soy. Or corn. .... Or maybe the diet was just preparing his body for what should have come next. Anti-fungals? Pro-biotics? Zinc? B-12? And what? You're giving up almost fourteen weeks worth of work for a cookie???  So I argue with myself and say: \"Well, no, actually. It was four cookies. And two happy smiling boys. And the ladies who cluck over my kids. Even if one of them has autism and won't engage them in conversation but thanks them anyway with his hearty appreciation for their cookies. It was my strong desire to just live life with my boys. To stop weighing and measuring and examining every little moment.  It's an argument that will probably be on-going with me. Every time I hear about someone whose children made incredible progress on the diet or by following a DAN protocol I'll probably wonder if my instinct was correct, if I was just seeing what I wanted to see, or if I gave up too soon, didn't do enough.  My sister-in-law, who has Down Syndrome, turned 50 this year. I remember that when we were trying to find which direction to take with Oliver, my mother-in-law told me (well, Nik translated for me) that when her daughter was very young they didn't know what caused Down Syndrome and that some believed that blood transfusions and other similar kinds of interventions would help \"cure\" or lessen the symptoms. There were doctors out there who did these sorts of things. Nik's mom did all the research and eventually decided not to do any of it. She would have had to travel a great distance and it would have been costly. Besides, she said, her daughter was always a very happy child. She told me that she thinks that the understanding of autism today is where Down Syndrome was fifty years ago. So I often wonder how long it will be until we look back at today and know -- really know -- what it is and what to do to help lessen the challenges that face kids like Oliver. I hope it is in my lifetime. And I hope I don't regret all those cookies.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/11/gluten-free-no-more-or-whats-in-cookie.html", "title": "\nGluten Free No More -- Or What's In A Cookie\n"},
{"date": "September 03, 2007", "body": "\nIt's like magic, it really is.  Before we got started with our consultant, Nik and I sat down and watched the five hour intro to RDI DVD. I remember saying to Nik that if Oliver could even accomplish a little bit of what we saw on that DVD then I would be happy. At the time, so much of it seemed out of our reach. Out of Oliver's reach. But in the last 8 months Oliver has come so far that I can hardly remember what it was like when I had to chase him for every article of clothing that I wanted to put on him. Yesterday, Oliver and I played a game together that we haven't played since he was just a little guy, back before the regression when there seemed to be so much more social give and take with him. And the best part is: Oliver initiated the game.  As I was sitting on the floor in the hallway, Oliver rolled a big yellow truck right to me and then sat looking at me, waiting for my response. Surprised, I rolled it right back at him. He turned it around and the game had commenced. Soon Sam wanted in on the action (of course!) and the three of us spent at least 10 minutes rolling the car to each other. The whole game was totally dynamic. We often didn't know who would get the car next. Sometimes it wouldn't go far enough or in the right direction and someone would have to get up and get it, correcting the action. Usually that was Oliver, and he always did it without being asked to. He was definately doing more than 50% of the action to keep the game going. Nik and I were stunned. Later, after the game kind of collapsed because Sami was being such a pain in the neck, Oliver found another truck and spent some time rolling them both around the hallway, deep in play. Also a first.  I know that to some this won't seem like a big deal. But trust me, it is. We have been working on coordinated actions with Oliver over the past couple of months: turn taking, doing the same thing together, doing the same thing in parallel, doing different, complementary, things to complete the same activity, etc. And it has been slow going, especially the turn taking part. But here today it all came together as if by magic. And Oliver initiated the game. And he often did all of the work to keep the game going. It was breath-taking! And heart-warming. And motivating!!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/09/this-rdi-thing.html", "title": "\nThis RDI Thing. ...\n"},
{"date": "September 17, 2007", "body": "\nUPDATE: I couldn't let it go last night. I kept asking Nik to describe for me how everything transpired at the pool. There were a lot of tears, a lot of protests and through it all Oliver kept his hands clamped tightly over his ears.  I wanted to say that we would just keep trying but if the noise were truly that upsetting I wondered if attempting to \"de-sensitize\" him would just be cruel.  So before going to bed I sent off an e-mail to the director of a local health facility describing our situation and asked if they would consider donating a membership to us (it is quite expensive). In the morning I got a response asking us to come in, get a tour of the facilities, and fill out an application. It isn't a sure thing because our request has to go before a committee, but I'm so glad I thought to ask.  **************************** I've been thinking lately about how to organize our time now that it is just me and the kids at home everyday. It's easy to just kind of go with the flow and not worry about structure. But I decided a few weeks ago that I needed a bit more organization to make sure that the time we spend together is more purposeful. So I sketched out a rough schedule for the week and given how much Oliver has come to love the pool, swimming figured prominently in the week.  But what is that they say about the best laid plans?  The pool opened today under a bubble. And Oliver would not go inside. Nik was with the two boys and reported that he tried all sorts of strategies to convince him that it was OK. But once inside Oliver could only curl up in a ball with his hands over his ears and a towel wrapped around his head. Apparently the sound of the air pumps keeping the bubble inflated is too much for him.  I'm not sure if we should try again. I may give it a shot and see if his sensitivity to the noise might lessen if he grows used to it.  Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have a fish out of water for the next nine months.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/09/we-might-have-to-make-do-with-bathtub.html", "title": "\nWe Might Have to Make Do With the Bathtub\n"},
{"date": "November 06, 2007", "body": "\nThis yes/no thing is not to be over-rated. It's great. I mean, it's changing our lives. This morning, while we were still lounging in bed I asked Oliver: \"Do you want some water?\" Because the heat is now on my throat is parched by morning so I imagined his would be too. But his answer was an emphatic \"No!\" Still, I wasn't convinced. Sometimes he gets them confused and says the opposite of what he really means. So I reached for the water bottle, held it out to him and asked again. He pushed my hand away and again said: \"No!\" Well, alrighty, that's communication, I thought. Then again, when we went to the kitchen for breakfast I decided to find out what he wanted to eat. Now, if your child is like my Sami, then you wouldn't get why this is such a big deal, because Sami  tells  me, and forcefully so, what he wants. I don't even have to offer Sam a choice, he knows what all the varieties are and that if I've got it he can have it. But not so with Oliver. Oliver has a hard time making choices. If I held out two different pieces of fruit and asked him to choose he would just sit there or walk away completely. So normally I have to guess. And if I've guessed wrong then whatever I prepare will go uneaten and I'll have to try again. But normally, he is happy with whatever I put in front of him -- which is good because Oliver is basically pretty easy to please. But it is also bad because I would love, love, love to know his opinion about things.  But this morning was pretty much different from any other morning. It went something like this: Oliver? Do you want a banana?  No. Do you want a muffin? No.  Do you want cereal? No. Do you want oatmeal? Yes.  Oatmeal? You want oatmeal? Yes!  And this last yes wasn't just a yes, but one with an exclamation point beside it. It was one with emphatic head shaking.  Head shaking !  Another really fun thing about this yes/no trick of ours is that it is opening things up for debate that weren't debateable before. For example, this evening the kids were both exhausted from swimming at the end of the day but I let them watch the Wiggles anyway because Sami is just so cute with his dancing and guitar playing. But then, before the video was over I said: OK, five more minutes and it is time for bed! And Oliver just looked at me and said \"No!\" with more emphatic head shaking. So what could I do? We watched all the way through to the end of the credits.  Yes and No are such little bitty words, really. But man, I can't help but feel like a rather large and heavy door has been opened. I've got my foot in there and I'm already peering inside. I don't know if this will lead to more language, more communication. But at the moment I am emphatically, euphorically optimistic.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/11/emphatically-speaking.html", "title": "\nEmphatically Speaking\n"},
{"date": "November 18, 2007", "body": "\nIt has been a very busy coupla weeks around here, culminating in two nights away last week in our nation's capitol. I used to be very  interested  by such things. Thrilled by it; motivated by it. But now I just don't care as much. I guess that means it really is time to move on, professionally speaking. And so I shall. These two nights/three days away were kind of a dry run for the upcoming ten days --- TEN DAYS -- when I will be in Houston for beginning my RDI certification program. The downside is that I missed the kids terribly.  Terribly . I mean it was almost physical how much I missed them by the second morning. But the upside is that they were all fine. Nik was only a tiny bit relieved to see me when I got home but the house was cleaner than when I left it and none of the kids broke down sobbing with relief upon my return. I guess they can manage without me and that genuinely gives me some peace. But this post is about a few other things. Firstly, I finally got around to hosting the video of Oliver and I shopping. This was taken six months after we started RDI (around the end of September, I think). I wish I could also show a similar video of before we started. But believe me when I say that prior to RDI, there was nothing like this sort of interaction going on. And I never would have been able to let Oliver walk freely through the parking lot or the store. He just wasn't tuned in to me enough so that I would feel confident of his safety. Secondly, I'm looking for something to solve a little dilemma of ours and wonder if anyone out there is better at searching the web than I am. Oliver, you see, has a little bit of a zipper problem. He will NOT wear a coat or sweater or anything else that zips and so we have not been able to spend a lot of time outdoors for the past couple of winters, which is kind of a drag. Fortunately it isn't that cold this winter but I would still like to find some kind of pullover parka or something that would keep him warm. I did find  this one  at Land's End but don't want to spend $130. on a coat that might not fit next year. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Next, a brief update on the toileting: last week Oliver began to use the potty independently! The way it happened was so natural and easy that I almost didn't even notice. So between that and the YES/NO thing, I feel like we are moving on to the next stage in life. Also, we went to a birthday party on Saturday for a two year old. When I accepted the invitation I had no idea that so many people would be attending. The party was in a very small apartment and there had to be about 20 adults and at least as many kids. But Oliver handled the crowd better than I did! He even protested when we left. Lastly, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who has been reading along and commenting on my blog the past month or so. I have been reading along on everyone else's blog but have not had any time to leave comments. And I don't know about you, but the feedback and encouragement that I get from my cyber-friends means the world to me. It helps me feel not so alone that others know my disappointments and share my joys.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.landsend.com/pp/ArcticPullover-70199_176279_7.html"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/11/few-things.html", "title": "\nA Few Things\n"},

I thought maybe I just needed time to let everything sort of 'gel', and voila! the perfect post would pour forth. But December is quickly waning and I don't see that happening. SO, testing, testing. .. Brain to Blog. .... This post is going to be just my attempt to get some words out into the atmosphere.  First, thanks so everyone for your suggestions about our winter coat dilemma. A lot of people recommended a button-up coat and that would have been the perfect solution if only buttons would be tolerated. Trial and error has proven that only an over-the-head remedy has a snowball's chance. ... We found a ridiculously expensive fleece jacket from Patagonia and, although it wasn't as heavy as I had hoped given the price, we've have had some luck with layering. Thankfully, here in Virginia, it has been on the warm side this winter.  Second, thanks to everyone who left comments or sent e-mails wishing me luck in Houston. I have so much to say about that experience that I hardly know where to start. BUT, since I've been back in my somewhat normal life these past ten days, one or two things have kind of stood out for me so I'll start with that. I'm sure more will filter in over time.  1) During my training I was surrounded by an incredibly wonderful group of professionals who just \"get\" it. I can't begin to tell you how validating this was for me. I didn't have to convince or educate. I had long, wonderful conversations about how a program can simultaneously be incredibly simple and astoundingly complex, about watching kids make truly meaningful progress, and about the importance of strengthening family systems.  Since Oliver was diagnosed we have been surrounded by many caring professionals. But caring about, and understanding autism, are two different things. How many times have I questioned a strategy or a statement about Oliver/autism only to be looked at as though I had just stepped off of the moon? How arrogant I have felt when concluding that so many professionals don't really know what they were doing. Just the other day I had a hurried conversation with the SLP where she again told me that kids with autism just don't have the  motivation  to speak. No, I told her. I KNOW he is motivated. He just doesn't fully understand the nature of communication. THAT is what I need help with.  But of course that is so elementary that it is beyond comprehension for many. . ... (note: I'm sure there ARE professionals who DO understand autism, but we live in a pretty small city and I haven't yet found any here who have a clue.) 2) This thing about \"doing\" RDI with your child? It is very hard sometimes. I came back thinking that at the very least I would now feel more confident of my own ability to help Oliver. Well, my knowledge, my understanding, of what to do has increased about a hundred times over. But I STILL find it very hard. Being Oliver's mother challenges me in ways directly proportionate to my greatest weaknesses. I struggle greatly with patience and control. I want to be in charge. I want to DO it; remediate the autism. But that isn't the way it works. Oh sure, there is a lot that I am \"doing.\" I am thinking constantly about my language, the way I set things up, my goals and objectives, how to guide without needing to \"get\". But the moment I start to focus too much on the activity or the skill then I have lost because the ability to be in the moment with Oliver and to truly participate in a dynamic interaction is ultimately what it is all about. It is the process of participating in dynamic interactions, engineered to allow the child to discover and learn along the way, that is at the heart of RDI. It is breathtakingly simple and yet oh so complex. It is one part science, one part art, a part zen and a bunch of parts magic when you get the first three parts right.   3) The other great, important, wonderful thing that came out of this whole experience is that even apart we are all OK. The kids managed beautifully. Nik is a pro at keeping it all going. And, I'm not too ashamed to admit this: I hardly missed them. I was so, completely, engaged that the time just flew by. I chatted late into the evenings with my colleagues and I was happy to begin again just where we left off at breakfast the next morning. I laughed longer, louder and more frequently than I have in years. And I had a Margarita -- on the rocks with salt -- every night, just because I could.  Happy New Year everyone!

When I put the phone back to my ear, Nik asked: \"Was that Oliver?\" Darn toot'n. And later tonight, after swimming, Nik prepared to make a quick trip to the pharmacy. Sami and RT were tagging along but I thought I'd keep Oliver home with me. Having none of it, Oliver stood at the top of the steps in the hallway and loudly said: \"Let's Go!! Let's Go!!\" Naturally, he went. And later still, after pjs and after teeth brushing, Oliver stood at the top of the steps again and told me: I want cheese. \"Cheese?\" I asked. \"Really?\" To which our boy answered: \"Yes.\" then quickly, \"I want to eat.\" Okaaay then.

The last time we drove an hour for an evaluation at a highly reputable children's clinic that is part of a University Hospital. The good doctor spent about a half hour with Oliver and then basically told us: \"Yup, he's got autism.\" To which I should have responded: \"And what? We've paid you a gazillion dollars to tell us that?\" After that I determined that I would never put Oliver -- or ourselves -- through something like that again. But I've changed my mind. Last week I finally got my copy of The Fabric of Autism and the way author Judith Bluestone writes about autism, about sensory problems and about how they lead to certain familiar manifestations was incredibly exciting to me. It all made sense. I couldn't read  it fast enough. I got half-way through reading each page completely and then couldn't contain myself and kept skipping and skimming through the rest of the book. Then I picked up the phone and called the HANDLE Institute in Seattle. Even before I spoke to Nik about it I knew that I wanted to take Oliver there to be evaluated. Luckily I found out that they also conduct evaluations in New Jersey and Atlanta, both of which are closer for me. And so in December we will make the long drive to New Jersey to start Oliver on a HANDLE program. And in the meantime I feel like I've been given a window through which to view my little boy and to understand better what motivates him to do certain things.  I also particularly like her take on the Theory of Mind. Anyway, Oliver had a kind of rough day yesterday. He woke up and immediately started biting his nails -- something we have been trying to stop for months with no luck. He wasn't able to focus well during his morning therapy session and cried a lot and seemed anxious in the afternoon. After such a long string of incredibly good days lately I had to wonder what was going on with him. Then I wondered if it had to do with our latest home renovation project. I'm paining the bathroom and have been using an oil-based primer. Even though I've been keeping the windows open and the exhaust fan on, it has taken a few days for the fumes to dissapate. After reading Bluestone's book I wonder if maybe it is the smell that is causing Oliver some extra anxiety. A funny aside about the nail -biting is that my poor boy's fingernails are so short that he can't possibly bite them down any further and has started trying to bite MY nails! Happy October, everyone! And may the fresh autumn air blow away all of our gassy fumes!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/10/changing-my-mind.html", "title": "\nChanging my Mind\n"},
{"date": "October 04, 2006", "body": "\nDid I mention that Judith Bluestone has autism? I think that is why I have been so drawn to her book. She has the emic and the etic of autism; not only does she understand the experience of autism from the inside out, but she can also explain it within the context of the central nervous system because of her understanding of the subjects of neuropsychology, neurophysiology and neurorehabilitation. She is a neurological translator. MOM-NOS asked after my last post about Bluestone's take on the Theory of Mind. Rather than paraphrase I copy here a few key sentences: \"I believe that those of us whose sensory-motor experiences are unusual, who cannot sustain our attention as others might on continuous shifts in the nuances of facial and bodily expression of someone in our immediate environment, who cannot allow ourselves the sensations of discomfort or pain to move in ways similar to those of the people around us, and who therefore cannot fathom what other people are feeling beacuse we cannot allow ourselves to feel what we are feeling -- we may not understand what drives another person's behaviors, and therefore we may be deemed to have no Theory of Mind. However, the other person, in turn, does not understand what drives our behaviors. Is it only because the other is in the majority that we are deemed to be lacking this quality?. ...Why cannot the other -- the adult or child who does not have these abnormal neural messages interfering with his ability to communicate -- why can he not understand my intent?\" I also particularly like what she wrote about what some might call \"stimming\", especially because it has helped me put into better context some of Oliver's behaviors. She writes: \"As a child, I spun the wheel of the tricycle around and around, feeling and seeing how the movement of my arms and the resisance of the pedals affect the rhythmic or dysrhythmic movement of the wheel. I began to build a unity of sensory experience. If I was interrupted before this unity occurred, I needed to revisit the experience. sometimes, just because so many other things in my day had jumbled my senses, I needed to return to the activity that unified them.\" I hate to quote and run tonight but one feverish and one teething boy kept me up for most of the night last night and my alarm is set for five thirty in the A M tomorrow because of this intrusive little thing called work. ...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/10/from-inside-out.html", "title": "\nFrom the Inside Out\n"},
{"date": "August 09, 2006", "body": "\nThe one year mark passed without much notice at our household. The night before August 4th I thought back 52 weeks and remembered how I sat listening to all those professionals tell me about my son while I breastfed Sam and pretended that I had to memorize every soft downy hair on his infant head. And then I remembered how I couldn't get through the days that followed without crying. Two, three months I grieved outright, followed by a dull echo, an aching sadness the color of grey winter sky. But those days passed too, unbelieveably. And life has become again routine. So much so that I only thought again about the significance of the day once it had passed. And indeed, by the time I thought again about what the last year has meant to us, and to Oliver, I had so many things to feel good about that I didn't have time to linger on what has come and gone. On Saturday morning Oliver indicated that he had to use the toilet by leading his therapist by the hand into the bathroom. Prior to that we spent a good deal of time over the past nine months anticipating (and, disasterously, not) when he had to go. So this was certainly a step in the right direction. The next day we went for a hike but forgot to put him on the potty first. Nik helped him make use of the great outdoors and I was, frankly, surprised that they had any success. Well something about the power of peeing standing up apparently intrigued Oliver so much that since then we haven't been able to keep him out of the bathroom. In fact, he drank so much water that on Monday I counted 4 successful trips to the toilet in 90 minutes. Now when I look around and can't find Oliver there will inevitably follow the telltale sound of flushing! The past few days have also seen a remarkable increase in his use of language. His vocabulary itself isn't what has me so excited, but rather it is his  willingness  to speak .  There had been times in the past when no amount of prompting, cajoling or pleading on my part would get Oliver to say even one word. But lately he is repeating us --  spontaneously . Of course that is still not communication, exactly, but hey, at least it seems that he is trying to meet us somewhere in the middle. After almost two years of silence I can live with that. And there are other things that seem like cause for excessive celebration, including an actual moment of interactive play with a little girl named, of all things, Hope. Last night at the library Oliver joined a little girl in play with some barnyard animal figures. First he took the horse, then the cow, carefully repeating \"horse\", \"cow\", as she offered them to him and I thought I could literally feel my heart pushing against my rib cage. Then the two of them walked their respective animals through the barn doors, layed them down and made snoring noises like it was some kind of great animal slumber party. Oliver said \"bye\" and I had to resist the urge to give little Hope a hug when her mother finally called her away. The other important, amazing bit of progress that has come about is imitation. Imitation, the great building block of learning, is something that does not come naturally to Oliver. But over the last week or so he has somehow learned. Now, if you happened to come by and look in my window one afternoon (which I hope you won't do because my house is a mess!) you might see me call out: \"Hey Oliver!\" Then, when he glances in my direction, you would see me throw my arms up in the air and, after a pregnant moment, you would see him do the same and then the two of us collapse in a pile of tickling and giggles. If you hadn't been reading along you might not know that neither of those things -- the look or the action -- would have been possible a few months ago. It has been quite a year. Not a year I ever would have imagined. But still, quite a year.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/08/one-year.html", "title": "\nOne Year\n"},
{"date": "June 01, 2006", "body": "\nSleep is one of those things that I can't do without. Apparently this is not something that my son and I hold in common. Yesterday marked the fourth day following the fourth night that little Oliver was awake for a wide swath of time. This happens periodically and I've grown almost used to having disrupted sleep. Anyway, if it isn't Oliver, it's Sam. But on the fourth night I was really feeling as though things got out of hand. Oliver was slow to fall asleep even after we had taken special effort to wear him out with lots of physical activity throughout the day. Finally, around 10pm the sounds coming from his darkened room quieted and finally stopped and I breathed a sigh of relief, sure that he would sleep through. I was surprised then when he later climbed into my bed and I looked over at the clock to see that it was only 12:30. And my surprise grew to chagrin which turned into anger and despair when the hours gradually took us closer to dawn. At 4:30 I woke Nik and asked him to please drive Oliver around, hoping that would lull him to sleep. Unfortunately by this hour I was so upset that I could not fall asleep even without my tossing, turning, and loudly vocal little guy next to me. I was in some kind of strange, between sleep and alert stage when Oliver, fully awake, climbed back into bed with me at 6:15. At 6:30 he finally drifted off to sleep. I went to work and waited until 8:40, at which time I called his pediatrician's office and asked to speak to a nurse. After being on hold for a few minutes she came on the line and asked what the problem was. Unable to hold back, I started to sob into the phone. I need help I told her. I need for my son to sleep, I said.  I  need to sleep. So that set some things in motion. I took Oliver in for a quick check up and our pediatrician did some research, called  some experts, and then recommended Melatonin. And benedryl for emergencies. I feel like we are all coming off of a four-day bender. My head certainly feels like I've got some kind of hang-over. And I'm carrying around a bucket-full of remorse; my recovery is as much about the anger and despair as it is the lack of sleep. In other news from our little green house: Sammy is now saying \"Mama\" and has learned how to wrinkle up his nose, which he does when something he has just done -- like thowing a partly-mauled banana from his high chair half-way across the room -- pleases him immensely. I have been invited to sit on the special education advisory panel for our city, which I happily accepted. Lindsey, our much-loved in-home therapist, gives me a count-down every day for vacation. This morning it was: \"Twelve more days until Switzerland!\" She is ridiculously excited and it reminds me of how I felt the first time I went to Europe when I was her age. Actually, come to think of it: I am ridiculously excited even now. We haven't had a vacation in two years!! When I woke up this morning and realized that I had slept completely through the night -- and so had Oliver!! -- I felt like celebrating and so I had a big bowl of ice cream for breakfast with my morning coffee. So I guess that's all the news that wasn't, as they say, and I'll wish you, and me, and Oliver, a very good night of sleep and happy dreams for all of us.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/06/sleep.html", "title": "\nSleep\n"},

Today I made the most amazing Turkey.  3 HEADS of garlic with cloves pushed deep into the bird, then marinated overnight in a savory sauce made from lemons, white wine, orange juice, cumin, pepper and oregano. I ate so much that I had to stop myself after two helpings and then ate still more later when I was cleaning the kitchen. I can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow. Oliver was a real star today. Nik took him to the grocery to pick up a couple of apples that I forgot to purchase yesterday, then he and I chopped them, along with 5lbs of carrots and fed them one by one into our Jack LaLaine Juicer. Then, throughout the day whenever I had some task to do I asked for his help and together we set the table, cleared it, unloaded the dishwasher and put the leftovers into the fridge. Of course with some of those tasks he lasted only a minute or two but still, he was willing and it was fun thinking of ways to include him in an RDI, experience-sharing kind of way. I've been putting some thought into figuring out what I'm really thankful for today. The short list is pretty easy: I'm supremely thankful for my kids and for my wonderful husband. I'm also thankful that I have the world's most wonderful boss and that he helps me to feel accomplished at work even though it has been such a rough year and that I wasn't always \"there\" even when I was sitting at my desk. I'm thankful for the friends who have stuck with me and for those I've made this year. I'm thankful that I decided to start this blog even though it seemed like kind of a weird, narcissistic thing to do, because the people I have \"met\" over the Internet have been unbelievably supportive. But perhaps the thing that I am the most thankful for is that my story is still such a work in progress. And that I have the chance to do even better. To be a better mother. A better friend. To take what has happened this year and learn from it. I'm looking forward to what is around the corner.

{"date": "August 16, 2006", "body": "\n  I never wrote part one of this story. That was before Oliver was diagnosed and other mothers all seemed to have similar stories so I figured it was just my initiation into one of the more frightening parts of motherhood: the lost child. When Oliver was just shy of three years old he decided to play in the puddle on the side of the road at the intersection at the end of our block. We're not sure how long he was gone, probably less than 10 minutes, but someone found him before we did and thankfully called the police. Nik found Oliver sitting on the curb with the man just before the police arrived. Oliver couldn't tell anyone his name or where he lived and that man could have been less benign. It was a wake up call and we have been much more careful since. Even with the extra care, we've had our share of scares since then but usually it turned out that he was just sitting quitely in an overlooked spot. But last Thursday was different. Nik came home from work and found me in front of the stove cooking dinner. We exchanged \"how was your day\" and then he looked at me and asked: \"Where's Oliver?\" It had probably been two or three mintues since I last saw him but the front door was open from Nik's arrival. I bolted out to the sidewalk while Nik checked upstairs. No sign of him. I ran up the street, my heart in my throat. Then, my neighbor, on his front porch waving to me: \"He's here. He just walked right in and sat down.\" I took one look at Oliver, buried my face in my hands and burst into tears. Thank God he was OK. Thank God he went that way instead of towards the intersection. Thank God he went into that house and not the one with the lunatics and pit bull or the crazy old lady who calls the police because she thinks someone is stealing her lightbulbs. When I got Oliver back home I promptly sent Nik out for a bottle of beer. My day warrented it. Before Oliver escaped I had caught him twice sliding down the bannister -- which from the top is probably about a 12 foot drop. And once I found him with his feet on the ceiling. Yes, the ceiling. He had climbed to the top of his closet and laid down on the top shelf with his feet on the ceiling. Then, when Nik was out getting the beer and I was cooking dinner I glanced out into the backyard to check on Oliver who had been swinging. He wasn't swinging. He wasn't in the sandbox. I went outside and gasped to discover he wasn't in the backyard. All the gates were closed so I started to go back inside to check when I spoted a flash of white out of the corner of my eye. He had just rounded the corner of the neighbors house and come back into veiw. What the heck? He climbed the fence!!! I would have sat down to cry again but Nik arrived just in time with the Corona. If this keeps up I may need to keep a six-pack in the fridge!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P1010047.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/08/great-escape-part-ii.html", "title": "\nThe Great Escape, part II\n"},

A few mornings ago I found him awake in bed. He turned and looked at me after I greeted him Good Morning and said: \"I want coffee.\" Where did this come from? I don't know. Maybe he has heard this exchange between Nik and I about a zillion times since birth. Come to think of it, he probably thought it was the desired response. But the point is: he said it. And then we were sitting with our neighbors on the front porch (yes, we live on a summer is spent on the front porch with your neighbors kind of street) eating popsicles. Oliver had finished his and reached for mine. I pulled it out of his reach because, after all, it was lime which is my favorite and I didn't want to share. But then he said: \"I want the popsicle.\" So I handed it over. My neighbors eyes just about popped out of her head. She has a daughter, 2 and a half, with downs syndrome who has yet to say even mama, so I know she is celebrating with me. I, of course, was bursting with pride. And the therapists are all a buzz. At the end of each session they joyfully tell me about his emerging language skills. Of course this is Oliver's accomplishment but it is hard won all the way around. They are as excited as we are for what this means for him. And it comes in the nick of time. PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) is taught in something like 5 phases. Oliver breezed through the first two phases in record time. And then he got stuck. Phase three was not so easily conquered. He has been working on it for almost nine months. There have been days over the past few months, many of them I'll admit, when I succumbed to despair.  It is a wrestling match with me. I have always believed that Oliver could talk. That he would talk. But the day after day of the silence often made me question that belief. I had thought that PECS would be the vechicle for language acquisition. But no progress and no speech. ... that was rough. And then: boom. He's talking. So we're chucking PECS. I want to reinforce success. I want to reinforce what motivates him. And at the moment that really seems to be language. So we're switching gears. PECs is out the window and we begin on a verbal behavior program next week.

{"date": "November 25, 2006", "body": "\nStarting when Oliver was very small I got together once a week on Friday morning with a group of mothers and our kids who were all about the same age. There is a park about a mile from my house that has the most amazing play structure for kids. It is a big, elaborately built wooden structure with ladders and slides and things to crawl through, over and under, and they call it the kid's castle. I grew to really hate the kid's castle and was glad when Sam's birth caused me to stop going there with Oliver. I hated it for a couple of reasons. One is because there is a creek that runs nearby, across the soccer field and by the time he was two, Oliver spent the majority of his time trying to leave the castle so that he could throw rocks in the water. This would have been okay in principle, but on Friday mornings I coveted my time with the other Mom's because I seemed to be having so much trouble adjusting to motherhood and it was helpful to hear that others had the same doubts and troubles even though most of their kids seemed to be sleeping through the night. I also hated the kid\u2019s castle because, although Oliver had always been pretty coordinated, the whole place seemed fraught with danger to me. Nik, who had already been through the early years with RT, looked at me with that are you serious? look whenever I started to hyperventilate because Oliver was standing too close to some precipice or other. I will never forget a time when another mother from our play group looked at me with eyebrows raised as if to say: \u201cGeez, chill out!\u201d when I called out to Oliver using that danger voice that mothers acquire at the birth of our first child. Her daughter happened to be standing right next to Oliver and she calmly said to me: \u201cHe\u2019s not going to fall.\u201d But the thing is, I didn\u2019t believe that he wasn\u2019t going to fall because it always seemed to me that Oliver had no real sense of danger.  I didn\u2019t believe that he had any idea that at the age of two he could not safely jump from the height of five feet. And worse: he didn\u2019t seem to heed my danger voice at all.  One of the things that I like so much about RDI is that so much importance is placed on the art of referencing. Referencing is the ability to get important information from the non-verbal actions of others. In the DVD that lays out the RDI framework, Dr. Gutstein describes the following experiment. A baby, around six months of age, is placed on a table with a glass top. Below the glass is another surface that is designed to visually make the baby think that the surface drops away. The child is placed at one end of the table and his mother is sitting on the other side of the perceived cliff. Typical children will crawl to the drop off point and then look at their mother for information. If the mother nods and smiles and encourages the baby to continue then he will. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Even if the baby\u2019s visual perception is telling him that there is nothing there to support him he  will continue forward because his mother has told him (non-verbally) that it is OK. That is referencing. And that is something that Oliver cannot do. So his ABA program can teach him to look someone in the face when it is appropriate to do so, but it won\u2019t necessarily teach him to look there for important, non-verbal information.  The promise of RDI is that will help a child learn to WANT to look at his parents to get that kind of information. If you have a typical child, or a typical spouse, or typical co-workers, just think of all the times this ability has come in handy. If I could only tell you how many times a raised eyebrow has cause RT to stop doing something that he shouldn\u2019t be doing. Or when Sam is unsure of something and feels confident to proceed with just a look in my direction. When I think of the possibility of Oliver developing that ability it makes me absolutely giddy. We won\u2019t formally begin our RDI program until January but we\u2019ve already been trying to implement some basic activities and to just change how we communicate with Oliver in general. Part of this involves a lot of head shaking. Vigorously. Yes and No. Sometimes I shake my head \u201cNo\u201d so emphatically I get dizzy. But slowly, slowly, slowly, it seems to be working. One activity that seems to lend itself naturally to the need for referencing is using the computer. Oliver and I log on to seseme street at least once a day to watch the elmo video about using the bathroom. When elmo or one of the other characters needs to use the bathroom the user is asked to press any key on the keyboard to help them make the right decision. Oliver loves this part and always presses the letter G.  Two times. The program gives the user two or three chances to push a letter before it continues on its own. I position myself between the keyboard and Oliver and shake my head NO the first time or two before finally smiling broadly and shaking my head yes and indicate that he can push the button. We\u2019ve been doing this for a few days and finally today he looked at me twice to see what I was \u201csaying\u201d and changed his actions accordingly. It is a small, small step but when he has it mastered I believe the impact will be profound.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-im-not-saying.html", "title": "\nWhat I'm NOT Saying\n"},
{"date": "February 07, 2007", "body": "\nEvery parent should be forced to watch themselves interact with their child on video. I've found that it opens up a whole new window into our parenting style. Working with our  RDI  consultant requires that we videotape various activities that we set up each day, then once a week we upload them to a file server and send them off to her for review. She then sends her assessments back to us and we use the feedback as a learning tool for thinking about our next activities. So far it has worked fairly well. In the beginning I set up the activities and pushed the record button judiciously. But after a few weeks I started getting a bit looser in my recording style so that now I often will just have the camera set up in a corner of the playroom or kitchen, hit the record button and see if we can capture something that meets our objectives. But even if we don't, if nothing really gels like it should, I still find it fascinating for the small picture it has given me of Oliver and myself -- and to a lesser extent other members of the family. For one thing, I'm not such a bad mother. I mean, I know that but I also know how impatient and frustrated I can get. But I was really stunned one evening recently when I was reviewing the video of an activity that we were working on that never really came together. I was showing it to  Nik  and describing to him how frustrated I had gotten at one point. \"Well, you don't  look  frustrated,\" he told me. And I looked down at my own image smiling  serenely  and had to agree. On the inside I was jumping up and down, stamping my feet and screaming: \"Just cooperate, will you?!!\" But on the outside I was smiling and nodding and quietly humming The Wheels on the Bus. Another thing: when Oliver is really engaged in an activity with me or his father or RT he looks just like any other little boy who enjoys spending time with his family. We play a little and during the short pauses in action he turns and smiles up at us, beaming from ear to ear. Or he is all concentration as he carefully places each piece of  pepperoni  just so on top of the pie so as cover the maximum amount of real estate. Or he jumps up and down, all excited energy, as we discover the cache of hidden eggs that we will now get to break for our lunchtime  omelet . And there are other things, too, like how bossy I can be when it is  Nik's  turn to orchestrate an activity. Or how I sometimes talk differently to Oliver than I do to Sam. And did I mention how bossy I can be? We are just four weeks into our video adventure but I can already see the evidence of our hard work and I'm looking forward to seeing where it will take us.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/02/seeing-is-believing.html", "title": "\nSeeing is Believing\n"},

That's not to say that we don't take the time to do nice things for each other but usually it is just part and parcel of our everyday life together.

One year we went shopping together and each bought a really nice pair of hiking boots and that is about as close as it has ever gotten to actually buying a gift  for  the other person. So birthdays, holidays, and yes, even Valentines Day, usually passes kind of quietly. I suppose that this seems a bit unusual to some and I often get funny looks when someone asks, for example: \"So, what will you and Nik do for Valentine's Day\" and I try to explain that we don't normally DO anything. Over the years I've learned to answer without answering. All this kind of fleetingly crossed my mind on Wednesday at about 9am in the morning when, at that early hour, I had already had the best Valentine's Day ever. At 2, 3 and 4am, however, I certainly wasn't thinking about hearts and roses when Sammy was kicking and crying out, grabbing at me and calling for milk like he was a man lost in the desert. We kind of got off track with the night weaning when he was so sick recently and I can never decide if the stamina needed to try it again is more than the stamina I need to just go with the flow, so to speak. Anyway, it was a rough night, compounded by the fact that I was a congested mess and can't take a proper decongestant because of the milk, AND I had been working many, many hours of overtime to finish a set of proposals that were due on Friday.  So when Sammy and the alarm clock both went off at 6am, I talked loudly about how wouldn't it be nice if he went to help Poppi make the coffee, then rolled over as they went to face the morning chill. In my half-asleep, half-awake state I was vaguely aware of Nik later bringing in a silent offering of coffee and juice and leaving it beside the bed. A bit later I heard him praising Sammy for using the potty. Then, thanks to a hit of nasal decongestent I slipped off into sleep. Meanwhile, the weather outside was frightful and the University where I work was closed so Nik decided to just leave me be even though he had his own looming deadline at work and his office was NOT closed. When I finally came to, a little before 9am, Nik and the kids came in and climbed on the bed. Both Oliver and Sam were dressed and fed, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Nik kissed me on the forehead as the kids climbed under the blankets, then reached over, took my coffee cup and disappeared out the door. When he put a new cup of steaming coffee in my hands a few mintues later I looked and saw that the clock read 9 o'clock. \"You jump in the shower,\" he said, \"and when you're ready I'll head out to work.\" So that is why, even minus the hearts and roses, my Valentine's Day and my Everyday is about as good as it gets.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/02/land-of-milk-and-coffee.html", "title": "\nThe Land of Milk and Coffee\n"},
{"date": "February 06, 2007", "body": "\nOur little guy, Sam, talks as much as Oliver doesn't. His his physical size bears no relationship to the largeness of his verbal presence. Oliver's speech developed to a point, then stopped, then receeded altogether, so I missed out on what a pleasure it can be to watch how a child discovers the world through language. I am in awe of how Sam learns through the environment and then expresses it through words. I marvel at it. It is my guilty pleasure. Oliver, however, doesn't share my pleasure in Sam's very vocal presence. In fact, Sam's incessant chatter really gets on his nerves. I understand that too, because Oliver and I are alike in the fact that we both like it quiet. Too much noise can be disturbing. Upsetting. Agitating. Especially first thing in the morning. So even though I love the blossoming dialogs that Sam and I are having, some mornings I wish for a mute button. Oliver expresses his displeasure by either leaving the room or by pushing Sam  out  of the room. This morning I was helping Oliver with his breakfast and Sam, having finished his while narrating the whole sequence step-by-step, had wandered into the next room still talking. At not quite two, Sam is already pretty skilled with words but he hasn't yet mastered the fine art of conversation. So even through he was now in another room he was still talking  to  me; still expecting a reply. Tired of yelling between the two rooms I got up from where I was kneeling beside Oliver and moving towards the playroom I said \"Sam!\" in my most exasperated voice. Following immediately I heard, \"Shut Up!\"  -- not from my mouth but certainly echoing what I was thinking. Turning in surprise, I saw Oliver smiling quitely into his morning oatmeal.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/02/when-enough-is-enough.html", "title": "\nWhen Enough is Enough\n"},
{"date": "June 02, 2007", "body": "\nI haven't posted in awhile because I didn't want to follow my last two posts with another downer. But if bad things really do happen in threes then hopefully we are about done with it. So I might as well just post and get it over with so I can clear my psychic space to get ready for all the good stuff that is hopefully out there at this moment looking for a place to land. First, a close member of my extended family left us a note. The kind of note that, let me say, you never, ever want to find. There is a lot that can be said about this, but to respect that person's privacy, I won't say any of it. In the end I am just extremely thankful that I can still express my love to this person. This whole episode also opened my eyes to how extremely important it is for all of us to feel accepted for who we are to be able to feel secure that we have a place in this world. For as long as I can remember this particular member of my family has struggled with the challenges that come from being different. It caused me to really take a long hard look at the messages that I knowingly and unknowingly send to my children. And most especially to Oliver. Next, Oliver became ill. It was just a fever but it lasted 7 days. He didn't eat, he woke frequently in the night, he refused to budge from the couch during the day and he became easily frustrated with my attempts to take care of him. It was this last that was the hardest. He struggled so hard to communicate with me and I just didn't understand what he was saying. He made the same requests over and over again, first taking my hand and drawing me down to him then saying the same words again that I didn't understand while pushing my hand away as if to say: \"Now go do it.\" And of course when I couldn't do it because I didn't understand he would grow more and more frustrated. By the time Nik got home from work each day I was such a wreck that I had to leave to take a walk just to keep myself from completely crumbling. On the one hand it really seemed that Oliver has been/is trying to communicate more persistenly, so I should be happy about that, right? But it is still very hard to watch him struggle so much to make himself understood and then fail every single time. And as a mother I guess I feel like I should be able to fix what needs to be fixed but with this I don't even know where to start. There is a third thing completing my string of bad luck but I'm not even sure how to post about it without invading the privacy of others. So I'll just say this: our family of five is under threat to become just a family of four. I don't necessarily believe that it will happen; it will involve a battle that will probably leave us exactly where we are now only with less money in the bank! It just totally sucks. So there you go. The times haven't been so good in our little green house but I think we are on the road to better times. Still, if you have positive energy to spare we could use every little bit of it over here that we can get! ********************* ps: I STILL can't figure out how to get the pictures off of the memory card on my video camera. I have no trouble downloading the videos but can't seem to access the card!

{"date": "March 02, 2007", "body": "\nSome things I'm thinking about this week: 1) The changes that I'm seeing in Oliver since we started RDI are so gratifying and cause me to be filled with such excitement about where our future is headed. He is joining in and  enjoying  play activities with very little prompting. All I have to do is say: \"Hey, Oliver, let's play a game over here.\" And he stops what he is doing and joins me! No more escaping, no more chasing!!! He is  voluntarily  coming to me. I can also now call to him from  another part of the house  and he will usually respond. How great is that?! 2) Music is essential to life. It used to be that there was always a soundtrack to my life. But for whatever reason I haven't listened to much since the kids were born. Anyway, I finally got around to ordering  this  CD by the Hackensaw Boys. I saw them perform live last year and was blown away. They have been described by one critic as the Ramones meet the Carter Family. And if you think that sounds incredible just wait till you hear their music! The whole family loves it and our post-dinner dance sessions have brought a new element of joy to our kitchen. I think music and dancing are here to stay at our house. 3) Sammy has potty trained himself. About a month ago we switched over to cloth diapers and I realized that they were never wet -- even first thing in the morning. Then I talked him into trying underwear and we never looked back. He's not quite two yet and he tells me when he has to go to the potty. So this is how the other half lives!!! 4) Nik is going to China. For 10 days. I'm terribly excited for him but also a bit stressed about how I will manage everything in his absence. I plan to order out as much as possible :-) 5) It is supposed to be 55 degrees here today and sunny. The snowman in my front yard barely shows up under the brim of his hat and daffodils are sprouting all around him.

{"date": "June 01, 2016", "body": "\n \n \n \nI started this post weeks ago, before I got waylaid by the sticky emotional muck of IEP season. Maybe you know something about that. Since then I've been yearning to get back here, to this space, to the habit and practice of writing. \n \nWhen I sat here last looking at this blank space, on May 7th, I had an idea about something I wanted to say and got started with a few sentences about the stuff of memories. But now, ironically, I can't for the life of me remember what it was I meant to say. So to save this from going into the unfinished draft pile, I'll just commit the beginning here and call it the end.  \n \nTo get to whatever it was I was getting to, I had to begin by talking about RT and so I wrote: \n \nIt occurs to me that someone new here might not know that RT -- that is: Resident Teenager -- is the oldest member of our kid brigade. And in fact, RT is neither Resident or Teenager any longer. He is all the way into adulthood. Graduated from college. Making a life away from us in New York City. When I think about wanting to hold on to these childhood moments that I'm smack in the middle of with the other kids, thinking of RT reminds me that it's no joke: his childhood is a big blur to me.  \n \nMaybe it's different for other people, but I somehow didn't manage to collect a whole catalog of memories from his childhood the way I feel I should have. You know how many of those long, tedious days that you live through as a parent? The ones that feel just endless? Endless strings of endless days, sometimes. You imagine that they will be etched into your brain for the rest of your life. But they won't. They'll pass and be gone. Oh sure, if you really think about it, you might remember the (many) repeated attempts that he made to educate you on the finer points of Pokemon, but you won't really be able to picture the ragged nails on slender fingers holding a card out for you to admire or how bright his dark ebony eyes shone when he did. The things we notice about our kids that make us suck in our breath, jolted by an electric kind of love, aren't the sort of things captured in a photograph. They are as ephemeral as the slow smile that crosses a boy's face, a shadow of his father, as he spins a tall tale. As tender as the pink of new skin on a scabby knee.  \n \nThat's all she wrote, friends. I wish I knew where I was going with it but as I head into another IEP meeting tomorrow maybe it's enough to remember that this, too, shall pass and that these are the days I will miss, all rolled into one. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GE58CHlrRvM/V09SpohisUI/AAAAAAAABcE/NtFi9Abr6V8aTnELTK1CltVhy1achv3fgCLcB/s1600/memory.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2016/06/memories-or-waylaid-and-forgetful-in.html", "title": "\nMemories.

{"date": "July 05, 2007", "body": "\nThis new language program -- The Association Method -- really has me coming and going. One moment I'm feeling pretty optimistic and the next I'm completely overwhelmed again. Fortunately, my neighbor is a stay-at-home mom who is also a speech pathologist and I've recruited her to be my head cheerleader. She has looked over the materials and in a few weeks we will sit down together and go over all my questions. In the meantime, I've been methodically reading and re-reading the relevant parts, hoping for divine inspiration. My original plan was to learn as much as I could and develop an instructional game plan so that we could begin by August 1st. But the other day I decided, what the heck, let's give it a try. So I picked out a couple of phonemes: M, T, and P, wrote them in his new composition book using purple and red markers and pulled out the corresponding 4x6 drill cards that I purchased with the manual. Then I got some paper and wrote the letters out in cursive script, large enough for tracing. For good measure I also wrote them on the chalkboard wall in the play room.  I was a bit apprehensive when I called Oliver over to me to begin. I shouldn't have been. He loved it. To my relief and utter surprise, he loved every single bit of it with the possible exception of the tracing of the letters. And why wouldn't he? Every chance he gets he studies a book or video cover -- or anything handy with letters on it. It isn't the pictures that interest him -- it is always the letters. Especially if the letters are white on red or otherwise in high contrast. He LOVES the Scholastic logo. In fact, throughout our little lesson, Oliver was positively giddy. Especially when we got to the M. I pointed to the letter and made the sound expecting Oliver to repeat it. He got it right everytime and I also got a kiss with each M. Apparently the sound of the M is also the sound of our kisses: \"Mwah!\" It certainly doesn't get any better!  I've put Oliver's composition book and the letter cards on the shelf, near his favorite spot on the couch, where he can reach them anytime he wants. Everytime I found him with the book I took the time to review each of the sounds with him. He also added the word cards that say \"Face\" and \"Ham\" to the other three phoneme cards so I read those to him each time as well.  I feel so bouyed by this beginning success that I have to be careful not to push too hard, too fast. I want to keep it fun for him. And for me.  On a completely different note, I think someone has stolen my youngest child and put a two-year old in his place! His favorite word has become \"No!\" Said just like that, with the capitol letter and the exclamation point. \"No,\" is closely followed by his second favorite -- the single most annoying sentence ever spoken: \"Why?\" All I can say is that it is a good thing he is so darn cute! Actually, they both are.

{"date": "July 09, 2007", "body": "\nOn Saturday morning I awoke with a searing pain in my right ear. Oh, I thought, this is what an ear infection feels like. But, of course, I had two children clamoring for attention and breakfast and not a lot of time to feel sorry for myself. I mostly just hoped it would go away if I didn't think about it anymore. No such luck. While standing over the waffle maker I became conscious that the pain wasn't confined to just my ear. I could barely touch the scalp on the right side of my head without a great deal of discomfort. The pain was radiating from my ear to the entire right side of my head. This wasn't any ordinary earache, I thought. It must be a brain tumor; some horribly malignant kind of tumor was pushing against my skull from the inside. Then: Who would take care of my children? Who would help Oliver? I told Nik right then and there that I had to go to the emergency room. He looked kind of surprised given that I normally have to be coaxed into taking even the mildest aspirin. And I don't get sick. I can count on one hand how many headaches I've had in my whole life. But if this brain tumor really was growing substantially by the second I wanted to know about it sooner rather than later. I haven't lead an incredibly charmed life. It got off to kind of a rough start. But in my early twenties I learned some things about being content and in general life started to work out more in my favor than against it. Even when I had the occasional bit of bad luck things generally worked out for the good in the long run. And I began to believe that I had gotten all of my bad karma out of the way while I was still very young and that the rest of it would be smooth sailing. And then came autism. I don't mean to say that as though autism is the worst thing that could happen to anyone. It isn't. And I've made some peace with it. But in the scheme of things where the absolute worst case scenario in the world is something that negatively affects your child's lifelong health, welfare and happiness, it feels pretty bad. Add to that the feelings of utter incompetence and powerlessness that I felt at the start and you'll understand why I began to feel so vulnerable and why the world began to seem such a random and incomprehensible place. And why it seemed perfectly reasonable to me that I would be dead and my children motherless within a month when I succumbed to brain cancer. I once suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. I couldn't cross the street without my heart racing and without visually and physically imagining what it would be like if a car slammed into my body from behind. I imagined the the feeling of impact, the sound it would make and then of flying through the air before hitting the pavement. In my head I knew that there were no cars coming. I had checked and re-checked before stepping off the curb. But in my mind there was always that possibility. The event that caused the PTSD had nothing at all to do with getting hit by a car. But it had left me with this very powerful feeling of physical vulnerability. And in a way, this is very similar to the emotional vulnerability that I have discovered in the wake of Oliver's diagnosis. It isn't something I think about very often and I think I am still a pretty positive, see the sunny-side of things, person overall. But my palate of paint has a few darker tones than it once did. And it affects me in often unexpected ways. So this is why, standing over the waffle iron at 8:45 on Saturday morning, I found myself worrying if Nik's future new wife and my life insurance policy would be enough to help Oliver through his teenage years. I must make Nik take pictures of me, I thought. There are none of me and Sam will forget what I look like. \"Do you want me to drive you there,\" Nik asked. No. It's probably just an ear infection. Either that or a brain tumor, I said, and looked at him sideways to see his reaction; to see if he was thinking the same thing. But he was already deeply involved in negotiating with Sam about which waffle he should have -- the cow, the pig or the barn. Oliver took the chicken. When I got to the ER the doctor quizzed me about my symptoms for a few minutes and conducted a brief exam. As he was writing something down I tried the same thing on him. I hesitated for a brief second because I really didn't want to give him any more ideas but then said: \"I figure it is either an ear infection or a brain tumor. Either way, anytime you have shooting pains through your skull I figure you should have it checked out.\" Much to my relief his expression didn't take on a new look of interest. \"Nope. TMJ,\" he said feeling my jaw once again. \"Have you been under any more stress than usual? Has anyone ever told you that you grind your teeth?\" \"Really? It's not a brain tumor?\" \"Not likely,\" he laughed and handed me a prescription. And with that laugh I exhaled for the first time since I stood over the waffle maker. It all seems pretty silly to me now as I stop to remind myself so many times throughout the day to stop clenching my teeth and just relax. Living, learning, growing, healing. It is all such a process and at times so very perplexing to me. But I guess I'll take the process over a brain tumor any day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/07/better-than-brain-tumor.html", "title": "\nBetter Than A Brain Tumor\n"},

Nik took the #2, who apparently has come to the terrible twos a bit late, on the bike in the early evening hours before bed. I took the #1 to the supermarket where I had just a few things on the list. Oliver likes going to the store and I like spending time with the children one on one whenever possible. I like even more not having to listen to the constant barrage of comments and complaints from #2 for a few blessed moments. The outing to the store went fairly well and when we returned to an empty house I offered Oliver a popsicle. My thinking was that there was only one lime popsicle left so if I offered it when there was only one child I avoided the inevitable ruckus should one child have to settle for raspberry or strawberry. So, outside with the popsicle Oliver roamed around and occassionally obliged my request for a taste. I took the opportunity to roll up the new slip and slide so that it wouldn't kill the grass in the morning sun today. In the middle of this task Oliver finished the popsicle and headed inside. I quickly ran through a mental checklist. Front door: locked; bladder state: empty. Ok, I'll just be a minute and then I can join him, I thought. Then I heard it, the sound ever so small but most definately a splat, followed closely by a second splat. No, surely he wouldn't, I thought, as I grabbed up the slide and threw it on the deck. I opened the door to the house and scanned the kitchen immediately relieved by the sight of the closed refrigerator door. But what's this? A head barely visible on the opposite side of the kitchen island. A sicking feeling comes over me and I peer around the island at the floor and the sight of Oliver's obvious delight: Two eggs that must have hit the ground at high velocity. \"Messy, Messy!\", he said sounding highly pleased as I handed him the paper towels. Having been through the drill twice previously that same day he knew the routine.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/08/checklist-just-got-little-bit-longer.html", "title": "\nThe checklist just got a little bit longer\n"},
{"date": "August 11, 2007", "body": "\nThe downside to not having air conditioning is the heat. And the humidity. But believe it or not, there are upsides. In our neighborhood of houses mostly built in the years before 1910 only a few have air conditioning. So the early evening hours will find people strolling. And visiting. Sitting on the glider or porch swing on the front porch. We know most of our neighbors and there is the feeling of being part of a community. Need an egg or a cup of flour? Go ask Crystal. A flashlight or help with your car? Ask Angel. Someone to watch your kids for an hour? Leanne or Phil are always at home and one more kid doesn't make a difference at their house. The other upside is that it forces us, especially on a week like the one we've just had, to find ways to stay cool. If you have the time a trip to the river is always good. Or the library. Or the bookshop with the great Thomas the Train setup. Or head to the bakery for a cup of lemonade and a cookie. A trip to Lowe's? Yes, that will kill an hour in the middle of the afternoon. We've also made a daily pilgrimage to the community pool this week. We timed our 4:30 arrival to coincide with the time most folks are leaving for the evening and can swim for an hour or ninety minutes when the sun isn't so high and the pool not so crowded. I've loved watching both boys in the water. Oliver is in his glory. He can stand now in the 3.5 foot section and just keep his face out of the water. He moves about by taking little jumps and doesn't mind if the water washes over his face on the landing. He is also really good about jumping from the side of the pool. Sam, in his little arm floaties, swims like a fish. Yesterday as I was sitting on the step of the pool watching both kids another boy came over to where I was and said hello. I watched him for a bit because he had the same \"swimming\" technique as Oliver. He appeared to be about the same age and size and he hung around the area of the steps just a few feet from where Oliver was. Everytime a child or adult came near he would greet them with the same \"Hello.\" A few minutes after I noticed this boy I heard Oliver's excited vocalizations -- noises that sound to me almost like excited buddhist chants. Only I soon realized that it was the other boy making that same sound. I looked around for the boy's mother but didn't see any likely candidates. I hover. Don't all moms of autistic children hover? Ready to leap in if their child needs help navigating something? No one else was hoving nearby. The boy eventually moved out of my orbit and I returned focus to my kids. But later I scanned the pool for the boy and saw him climbing the steps and running along the side of the pool, hands flapping in excitment. His mom swooped in and got him to stop running. She then took ahold of his wrist and led him to the opposite end of the pool. So then I knew. How many times in the past, when Oliver was prone to darting, had I told Nik and RT not to pull him along by his wrist? Just ask him to hold your hand, I'd say. I watched them wondering if I was seeing what other people saw when they saw us. If you didn't really know about this boy, you wouldn't know. Aside from the wrist pulling, I really admired this mother. She wasn't hovering. She was standing at a very discreet distance from the pool, ready to jump in at a moments notice if she needed to. When her son got too near the deep end she beckoned him back. I wanted to find a way to approach her, to say: Your son reminds me a lot of my own. But I couldn't find a way to comfortably do it. What if she took offense? I mean how do you approach someone and start off a conversation like that? I watched as they prepared to leave the pool. I watched as the boy tried to slap her when she made it clear they were going. It happened so fast and with so little to-do that a by-stander might have thought his eyes were mistaken, that he didn't really see this five year old try to smack his mother. Then I watched as she positioned the boy between two pool chairs and the fence, standing between him and the pool, and told him to put on his shoes and dry off. About this time, I told Oliver it was time to go. On this day there were no complaints. Both boys were tired and hungry.  Before leaving the parking lot I drove around once, scanning the cars for a magnetic ribbon on the bumper. I didn't see one. But then I don't have one either.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/08/about-this-heat.html", "title": "\nAbout this heat. ...\n"},
{"date": "August 06, 2007", "body": "\nI was ridiculously excited all day Saturday at the thought of Oliver getting to see his favorite band perform. And I wasn't disappointed. The Hackensaw Boys are incredible performers, their music is so alive and funny and just makes you want to dance. (Go  here  to listen to an NPR piece about them) They tour constantly it seems, both in the US and Europe, so I was pretty amazed to find them performing at this very small fair. But it was perfect. We got front row seats (in the grass/dirt) right in front of the stage. During the first few songs Oliver's eyes were about as big as I've ever seen them. He immediately started to clap right along with the music and later played along on a little wooden xylophone that Sami had insisted on bringing. I leaned in once or twice and whispered in his ear that he could get up and dance if he wanted to. But mostly he sat very still on my lap and didn't take his eyes off the stage. Then, more then half-way through the performance, Oliver jumped up and started to dance. Someone observing him might think his rhythmic style looks a bit like calisthenics but to me it is the most beautiful sight. In fact his joy in the music brought tears to my eyes. After the music concluded we went up to the stage to introduce ourselves. Oliver got to look at all the instruments and shook a few hands. I think I gushed a little bit. Following the music we rode the merry-go-round, the scrambler and the mini roller-coaster about three times each. Oliver didn't seem troubled in the least by all the people, nor was he phased by the lights and the sounds. A very good time was had by all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5028245"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/08/night-out.html", "title": "\nA Night Out\n"},
{"date": "August 08, 2007", "body": "\nIt was a big night at our little green house. Actually, it was a big night on the street in front of our little green house. August 7th is National Night Out, an event sponsored by cities and municipalities as a way to help people get to know their neighbors so that we can help each other in times of need or notice when something is amiss in our own neighborhood. For the past four years we have made fliers and planned for a block party that would bring everyone together. But last night was the first time that the event was truly a success. We got special permission from the city to block off a portion of the street, we put up a lemonade stand, cut juicy red watermelon, turned a sprinkler on in the middle of the street, and suddenly the whole block was teeming with wet, shouting, happy, kids and their parents. A lot of them I knew but some were coming out for the first time. And best of all: I could socialize without worrying about Oliver running out into the street! Sam was in his glory. Two days ago he learned to pedal his tricycle and so he spent the whole two hours riding it through the sprinkler, taking breaks only long enough to go and grab another slice of watermelon. I loved watching him. His growing self-confidence and Independence is such a pleasure. It makes me feel as though I've done some things right by him. Oliver enjoyed himself, too, I think. More and more I see that he is able to stay in the fray. True, he tends to stay on the edges -- so unlike Sam who is right in the thick of everything -- but he stays, and that is the important part. Also, I found it endearing that he passed up all the brownies and cookies and zeroed in on the cut veggies. Give that boy some cucumbers, carrots and green peppers and he's happy. By 9 o'clock though he had had enough and began tugging on my hand to go home. Once in the door he peeled off his wet clothes and headed straight for bed. I tucked him in and he was snoring before the light was out. Sam, on the other hand, stayed outside until the very last possible minute. When he finally conceded to get into bed it was 10pm and he was still going strong. Too strong. Five minutes after heading downstairs to clean up a bit I heard Oliver's piercing screams. Nik and I looked at each other. Wasn't he sleeping? Then I bolted upstairs to find Sam sitting on the bed next to a prone Oliver.  Then his unbidden confession: \"He bit me so I just bit him.\" A quick search of Oliver's body revealed a nasty bite mark  on his face , just below his left eye. But he was already drifting back off to sleep as I kissed the spot and silently hoped it would be gone by morning. No so luck. This morning Nik remarked that it looked like an animal got the poor kid. I'll have to post a picture of him and with  another boy I know  we'd have a couple of bookends!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://gretsblog.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/08/big-night.html", "title": "\nA Big Night\n"},
{"date": "August 09, 2007", "body": "\nWe're one week into the gluten-free, casein-free diet. Why? Oh, because I need something else to do with my time. And because I need one more thing to obsess and fret over. But really maybe I should just have my head examined. Instead I fell asleep last night reading a gluten-free bread book and wondering where I could lay my hands on some bean flour. I'm fortunate in that both my kids eat a wide variety of foods. Both of them went straight to table foods at 7 months and have eaten pretty much whatever I was serving since then. A lot of my cooking tends to be Asian-inspired anyway so it was no stretch for me to eliminate the gluten and casein, although grilled cheese sandwiches and pizza will be missed -- hence the gluten-free bread book. Shortly after Oliver was diagnosed two years ago we embarked on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. THAT was hard. It got easier, though. And it was effective, Oliver's digestive system normalized. The SCD eliminates many, many carbohydrates and all grains from the diet and so we were also gluten-free for a year. But we weren't casein-free as the diet allows some yogurt and cheeses. Then last year I tried a dairy-free diet just to see. After about 8 weeks of seeing no effects we quit. So now why the new diet? Well, my mind wonders: what if both have to be eliminated simultaneously? The proteins are so similar, they say. And if I don't try it I will always wonder. And I like to cook and my kids are good eaters -- so why not? Sometimes Oliver has this look about him, this zoned out, faraway look. A drugged look. What is going on in his little body to make him behave that way, I wonder? Could there be something to the opiate theory? The last time Oliver had that look about him I surveyed his diet for the past twenty-four hours: oatmeal, grilled cheese sandwich, pizza, more oatmeal and some fruit and veggie snacks. I do get tired of wondering all the time. I get tired of observing so closely, of wondering about the cause and effect of every little thing, of weighing and measuring, hypothesizing and pathologising. And yet it is not hard for me to see the link between what I eat and how I feel, so I'll give this a go. But in order to have the right frame of mind about it I've decided not to make it all about Oliver. It is about my family's heath and fueling our bodies with the very best. And it is about my new quest to make a perfect gluten-free loaf of bread.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/08/another-adventure-in-eating.html", "title": "\nAnother adventure in eating\n"},
{"date": "August 15, 2007", "body": "\nOliver is swimming. In my last post I described his joy in the water and his bouncing technique for moving around. But yesterday when we went to the pool I saw him experiment a bit with pushing off from the side or from the stairs and move a few feet by kicking his legs and moving his arms. I saw him lay back in the water, pick his feet up and swim another few feet. I saw him venture away from the side of the pool towards the middle, swimming a few feet then bouncing, then swimming a few feet more. And I saw his proud, proud smile. The smile that tells me more than a million words ever could. I could never have taught Oliver how to swim. Being in the water is such an overwhelming sensory experience for him that it would be next to impossible to get him to really absorb any kind of instruction. I know because I tried. I hired a college student who was also studying special education. She gave up after about 10 minutes. \"He's not really paying attention.\" So this is something that he learned completely on his own, from trial and error, experimentation and from an awareness of how to control his body in order to achieve a certain outcome. There is nothing extraordinary about this. Kids do it all the time.

{"date": "August 10, 2007", "body": "\nIt's kind of funny what choosing a perspective will do for you.  Yesterday was the official last day of Early Intervention services for Oliver. It was the last day that a therapist and babysitter both came to our house while I headed out to work with that nagging, guilty feeling. It also marked the last time I will ever have to hear the dreaded sentences: \"Oliver, I have candy!\" and, \"First work, then play!\"  After almost two years we were so ready to be done with it! When we first learned that Oliver was aging out of his eligibility for services, I can't deny that I felt a worrisome, sinking feeling for a few days. But the truth is that I had been struggling for some time to reconcile ABA with my parenting and philosophical views. I mean, why reward him with candy for touching his shoulder when he did it for me for nothing? With RDI I found a framework that fit our family better. But even so, it was difficult for me to think about abandoning ABA completely. How do you say no to $75,000 worth of in-home services a year that families in the next county would kill for? I found it very hard. So in a way I look at Oliver's early birthday as a blessing in disguise. I didn't have to make the decision to stop ABA, it was made for me. But I embrace it. Preparing for the transition we gradually reduced the number of hours of service from 21 to 9. During that time we started to establish our own rhythms and rituals. I became less stressed. I could suddenly afford to wait the few extra minutes that Oliver needs to respond to my requests without growing impatient. It didn't matter if he got dressed now or an hour from now. Choosing the RDI and homeschool approach is not something I ever would have predicted. In the beginning I wanted 40 hours of ABA plus OT plus whatever else we could lay on. Now I believe that sometimes less is more. So we're celebrating in my house today. At lunch time we will crack open a bottle of our finest sparkling apple cider and drink a toast. It is the first day of something different. We've moved on from one phase to the next. In the past when I thought of this day it was with apprehension. But now I only look forward with anticipation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/08/done-with-it.html", "title": "\nDone with it!\n"},
{"date": "August 18, 2007", "body": "\nNik is working a lot of overtime lately so I've been stuck without my much-needed, much-loved, much-taken-for-granted partner in parenting. I've also been stuck with the children. I hate to use the word stuck, because I love them and I know I'd never just leave them by the side of the road or anything, but sometimes I would just like to know what it is like not to have a conversation with someone other than myself while sitting on the toilet. So in that sense, yeah, I feel a little stuck. I was also feeling a bit in that way today when we came home from the grocery store. Sami was having a fit because the man at the grocery store gave both boys a balloon on a stick and he desperately needed to have both of them. He needed them much in the same was as he needed more room in the fire truck shaped grocery cart that the two boys rode in and two bags of candy not just one. And he needed those as much as he needed not that glass but the other glass and not that apple but a different one. Each of his needs throughout the day -- and there were many, many of them, were punctuated by loud wailing and occasional bouts of throwing himself to the ground. In an effort to limit the amount of crying that would take place between unloading the car and nap time I decided to work with Sami rather than against him. And that, I tell you, is no easy task. It involves a lot of dialog and every explanation ends in \"Why?\" So I parked Sami's butt on the counter, put the groceries away, started to figure out what I could fix the two boys for lunch and found myself also half lost in thought. I wondered: Is it normal that he talks so much? He never stops. I never met another two year old who talks so much. Maybe there is something wrong with him. Should I ask the speech pathologist about it the next time I see her? How can I complain about one kid who talks too much when I've got another who won't talk at all? But really, he talks so much I.can't.think. I just really can't think. And then I heard a voice and knew in an instant, even before the voice in the hallway said what followed hello. Oh my god. How could I be so stupid?! I raced into the hallway, the man's face barely registering and as I sprinted past him and heard him say: \"We found a boy wandering in the street. We've got him. He's safe. Don't worry.\" I looked up the street and saw Oliverr walking with a young, college-aged woman. He was still clutching he Popsicle box that he had insisted that I empty of its contents and give to him. I had left the front door propped wide open so that I could carry the groceries in. And later I even saw Oliver come in from the back yard and head towards the front of the house. But we never leave the front door unlocked. Never. So I didn't even think about it. And I guess I've gotten a little bit relaxed, too. Oliver doesn't run off like he used to. He doesn't try to scale the fence or dart into the road. He is pretty happy to stay in the yard. As I sat weeping, holding Oliver on the curb and waiting for my legs to stop shaking, I thanked the college students who live next door to us. So many of them have come and gone since we moved to our street five years ago that I didn't even know their names. I had seen them. They seemed nice. But mostly I hoped they would be quiet and that they wouldn't hog all the street parking on the block. \"No problem,\" the young man said. \"We'll keep an eye out for him.\" Yes, I told him. I will two.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/08/forget-not.html", "title": "\nForget Not\n"},
{"date": "July 27, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday I had a bit of a meltdown. I'd say it was about an 8 or 9 on the scale. As you know, we have decided this year to focus on Oliver's communication needs with both RDI and the Association Method. The beginning level of the Association Method focuses on the child's ability to recognize a phoneme and reproduce its sound. To start, I chose the letters M, T and P. But this soon proved to be a mistake. Oliver learned the three sounds easy enough but was not associating them with the actual letter. He would just run through the three sounds until he got it right no matter what letter I was pointing to. So I scaled back to just one letter: M. It didn't take long until he produced the M sound every time he saw the letter. Then I introduced the T again. But he just doesn't get it. He knows both letters and both sounds discretely but when I try to do them consecutively he gets all mixed up. How can this be so hard? Does he know what I want from him? I am trying not to put so much pressure on him. And on me. I know that is counter-productive. But it is hard when I so badly want him to be able to communicate. Thankfully, a friend called at just the right moment and was able to help me see a few positive things. Why is that so difficult at times like this? Last night I built a powerpoint presentation for him with the letter M and a multitude of slide transitions (which he loves). It is a little variation from the Association Method teaching strategy but I'm hoping it will make learning a bit more fun for him. Hopefully it will help.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/07/frustrated-or-update-on-learning.html", "title": "\nFrustrated.

A mother's love for her child is supposed to be such a simple, true, uncomplicated thing. But sometimes it isn't. For me, it gets all wrapped up in my own issues of ego: what I think I want and need out of relationships, out of life. But it is so damn difficult for me to stop in the middle of my frustration and think: ooooh, this is all about me! Look how perfectly lovely and loveable he is! But the frustration and impatience melt away (well, not really, but it DOES get put into proper perspective) when I manage to do just that. So for me, as I wrote in my comment to her, loving has as much to do with my head as it does with my heart. Surprisingly so. #2.  Like so many of my on-line friends we are going on vacation!!! Normally, we visit Nik's family in Switzerland every year for three weeks in the summer. And don't get me wrong, it is always wonderful! I mean, three weeks in Europe being pampered by Nik's mom, what could be better? Think chocolate, chocolate, more chocolate, mountains, fresh air and the distant sound of cow bells. But this year the airfares never came down to what we could afford (we're a family of five now!) so we decided not to go. Instead, a friend of ours owns a small place on an island off the coast of Maine and this year we have decided to take her up on her standing invitation to visit. I went to high school not far from the island but have not been back since the year after I graduated; Nik has never been to that part of the country.

{"date": "July 16, 2007", "body": "\nWe finally had Oliver's IEP meeting. I'd been trying to get it scheduled since April. The school district has been calling me and sending letters asking that we enroll him so they could hire an aide. First, I said, I'd like to have an actual IEP draft so that I know what kindergarten would actually look like for him. Second, I'm not at all sure that we want to enroll him this year. Or ever. But we're taking that one step at a time so I left that part unspoken. On Thursday we saw a draft of the IEP and asked to take a look at the classroom and meet the teacher. If you've been following along you might remember that we had pretty much decided that Oliver is definitely not ready for school this year. But in the interest of thoroughly weighing both sides of the issue I wanted to go through the decision-making process with an open mind. Luckily for us the next day was the last day of the ESY program and we could go over in the morning and have a look. We were encouraged to take Oliver with us. When we arrived at the school on Friday morning Oliver wouldn't get out of the car. He obviously remembered the building from his short stint in pre-school two years ago. He was all smiles and laughter and someone who didn't know him well would have thought he was just being mischievous. But this is rather how Oliver shows nervousness and fear. I offered him a piggy-back ride and he agreed. When it came time to visit the classroom, which is located in a trailer -- um, that is, learning cottage -- at the rear of the building, Oliver agreed to take my hand and walk the hallways. As we got closer to the exit his pace slowed to a stop. I offered him another piggy-back ride and when I bent down to let him climb on he turned my body so that I was facing the opposite direction. His message was loud and clear. Don't worry, I said, I won't leave you here. We're just visiting and I'll stay with you the whole time. The classroom itself was very noisy when we arrived. Everyone was talking and it took me a few minutes to fully take it in. I'm not sure what I was expecting but in all honesty I was completely shocked by what I saw. The room was divided up into small booths and each of the four children in the classroom was paired with an adult, each pair in their own work area. They were working on discrete trials of the kind I'm familiar with. Touch nose. Touch shoulder. Good job. Do this. Touch nose. Good job. Every time the child responded correctly he was given a small piece of candy. I stood nearby and watched one pair working and felt so saddened by how clinical it looked and sounded. And then I noticed that the young boy was sitting very close to the back wall and that the heavy desk was pushed so close that it was touching his little body. A rolling cart of drawers was blocking his only exit from the desk. Looking into all the other cubicles I saw nearly the same set up in each space. The children had no freedom of movement. I looked over at Oliver who had found the one bin of fisher price toys along the wall. He is a boy of spirit, my Oliver. He laughs and cries and feels things profoundly. And he is a boy of movement and strong will. He would never be at home in a classroom such as this. It would break him. And part of me wondered if maybe that is what it was designed to do. Leaving the classroom I thought to myself: I don't care if Oliver never learns to touch his head. I won't go to any lengths. I want him to have a good and happy life, yes. But most certainly not at the cost of his spirit.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-happens-to-spirit.html", "title": "\nWhat Happens to the Spirit?\n"},
{"date": "July 30, 2007", "body": "\nIsn't it funny how life presents us with opportunities for appreciation and gratitude when we most need it? I took the kids shopping on Friday. I hadn't planned to and I didn't need anything in particular but they were driving me crazy, I was driving them crazy and we all needed to get out of the house. Also, I'm learning that Oliver feels the most at peace when he is in motion. A walk or swim are the best but a ride in the car or on an escalator, cart or wagon are a close second. I got the kids into the car without any clear destination in mind but quickly settled on  Big Lots  because there is always something interesting to look at and because they carry our favorite brand of sparkling apple cider that is packaged with a cork stopper that pops like champagne and that the kids like to drink out of fancy wine glasses that they clink together to \"cheer\" each other. There is no better way to make something special out of an ordinary afternoon. My strategy regarding outings is to always be prepared to call it a day at anytime -- sometimes even before arriving at our destination, or after as little as 30 seconds or three minutes. Of course that rarely happens anymore but I had never taken Oliver to Big Lots and didn't really know what to expect. If you have never been to a Big Lots, it has a much more claustrophobic atmosphere to it than say, Target, which is a place that Oliver generally likes. I also wondered how crowded the place would be in the middle of the afternoon on a Friday. Tight spaces plus a lot of people might be enough for us to beat a hasty retreat. We have been putting a lot of emphasis lately on having Oliver help us with things, with trying to get him to take an equal role in activities throughout the day. It is surprising how willing we have all been to assume that Oliver couldn't or wouldn't participant in everyday activities, whereas Sammy isn't happy unless he IS made a part of whatever we are doing. So even though I didn't arrive at the store with any particular objectives in mind, I did make choices that I might not have otherwise. For example, we chose our shopping cart outside the building and then had to negotiate the front doors with the cart. Without a word or a prompt, Oliver struggled to hold the door open as I got first the cart and then Sammy through the doorway. So I started out right away being totally impressed with my little guy. The trip was already a success and we were barely through the front door. The carts at there are too small for riding in and Sammy had already claimed the riding spot on the front, so I let Oliver drive (with some assistance from me). The isles were pretty close together so moving the cart from place to place was actually not that easy but he stuck with it and helped me -- really helped -- with it.  At one point I couldn't decide between two brands of dish soap and, on a whim, held them out for Oliver to choose. After considering it for a brief moment he selected the green, slightly taller bottle and, pleased with himself, chucked it into the cart.  Oliver has a very difficult time making choices, which I think is closely tied to his very genuine lack of self-awareness, so I was tickled that he actually chose one variety over another and made a mental note to myself to offer more opportunities like that to him. Sometimes when I paused to look at something Oliver wandered up and down the isle. A year ago -- no, three months ago -- he would have taken off running if I didn't maintain physical contact with him. But now I simply have to remind him to stay with me. The store was quiet enough that I even tested him a bit by starting to walk away when he had wandered to the opposite end of the isle. Both times I turned the corner and waited with my breath held only to exhale a moment later when he rounded the isle with an anxious look on his face and he slid his hand into mine. After loading 8 bottles of apple cider, one green bottle of dish soap, and one each Dora and Diego folding baskets into the cart we made our way to the check out counter. If the trip was going to go bad this is where it would be. Oliver laid claim to the Dora basket and was holding it in one hand while still helping me guide the cart with the other. But really, ALL the things in the cart were now, in Oliver's mind, ours. Taking things out of the cart and loading them on a conveyor belt is very confusing and upsetting to him and the checkout line has been the scene of many, well, scenes.  But wouldn't you know it, when we parked our cart in front of the register Oliver  automatically  started to help me unload the cart. He picked up the soap and handed it to me and then reached for another, and so on. Wow, I thought, what is going on with this boy?  So, pushing it a little bit I got down next to him and quietly told him that he would have to give the lady his Dora basket so that we could pay for it. I told him twice and then waited. He turned it over again in his hand and then laid it on the counter.  When we got home I even opened a bottle of Big Lots finest and drank a toast to my awesome little shopper and most beloved Oliver.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.biglots.com/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/07/awed-or-new-kind-of-retail-therapy.html", "title": "\nAwed.

It took us some time to arrive at this decision three days after he himself had arrived. The actual decision had something to do with a dead fish but I'll spare you the details. Sam. I liked it from the start, such a strong and solid-sounding name. But the trouble with the name is in the way most Americans pronounce it -- so that it rhymes with Man or Ran. To my dear Swiss German husband it sounds like fingernails on the chalkboard and he exaggerates the worst American twang to get the point across anytime I let go of my vowels. So here's the thing: Nik has taken to referring to our little strong, solid man as Sami -- complete with the umlaut over the A (which I can't figure out how to do in Blogger), which he hopes will encourage people to use the short A sound. But I am not one who typically goes in for stylizing names with all kinds of extra i's and y's and e's and this is dangerously close. So what do you think? Does it work? Is it a little too weird? Or is it weird in a cool way? How will it change his life to go through it as a Sami rather than a Sammy or a Sam?

And thanks to everyone who posted a comment or e-mailed me privately. It really helped to know that there were people out there pulling for me. On Saturday I got up in the morning and discovered that I had lost three pounds (out of 10). This was due to stress no doubt but I'll take it. I have a new diet strategy. Every time I feel like snacking I first make myself go to the freezer and take out a two and a half pound package of frozen chicken breasts. Have you ever really considered how heavy 2.5 pounds of chicken is? It is pretty darn heavy. And that nasty, gooey yellow chicken fat? Blech! So that is pretty much enough to keep me from reaching for another Klondike bar. Anyway, so I went and got dressed and when I returned to the bathroom in order to usher Sam, who was playing in the sink, downstairs, he turned to me and said: \"You look very cute today, Mom.\" I was a bit taken aback. I mean he's only two and he already knows that he is supposed to compliment women on how they look? I asked him to repeat it just so I could hear it again. It has been a long time since I've been called cute. Then later we were in the playroom and Oliver, who was making a sixty-piece, Ravensberger, Thomas puzzle, got my attention and indicated that he wanted me to come and sit beside him. I was surprised to find that he had already finished the puzzle with only two pieces to go. When Oliver makes a puzzle there is always a particular piece or two that go in last. As I sat down next to him it occurred to me that he wanted to share this moment with me. I watched as he fit in those last two pieces. Sam came over at the very last moment and said: \"I'm proud of you Oliver!\" taking the words right out of my mouth. I am amazed at the focus and persistence he has when it comes to making puzzles. We are still having some moments of difficulty with Oliver. I think he is reaching a new level of frustration at his inability to communicate. I'm not exactly sure if that is a positive thing or not but I just try -- as much as possible -- to stay calm and soothing and encourage him to try again to help me understand what he wants. I am discovering that he is able to say so many words if I help him get started, sometimes with just the first sound. But it definitely helps if I know what it is that he wants. I had been hoping that Oliver's language would just sort of kick in as we progressed with RDI but this last couple of weeks has me wondering if I am doing all I should. I've been reading a bit lately about the association method of teaching language and may consider giving that a try. It looks hard though. OK, now I'm off to try and install this memory card reader on my laptop. Hopefully I'll have some pictures to post very soon!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/06/on-way-up-again.html", "title": "\nOn The Way Up Again\n"},
{"date": "June 17, 2007", "body": "\nFinally! It appears that the problem of mooching wireless access has much to do with graduation. The street where I live is loaded with group houses for the local university. Now that the summer school students have moved in there are wireless connections aplenty. So for now anyway, I'm back in business. Kyra, over at ThisMom tagged me a few days ago for a meme: 8 things about me. I've never been \"it\" before so I gave this a little bit of thought and couldn't think of much that was terribly interesting. So I decided instead to do a little photo essay instead. My garden. This was a wasted patch of brown dirt and scrub grass when I started 3 years ago. I dream about my garden in the winter and a day is not complete without walking though the spring-summer-fall garden at least once.   My bookshelf. From The Lovely Bones to The Art of Loving and everything in between. My refrigerator. I hate clutter but you wouldn't know it by the top of my fridge where everything gets stashed.   In the kitchen. For me it really is all abut the joy of cooking! The dreaded tupperware closet. How can I possibly have so many mis-matched pieces? OK. I realize that is only 5 things but it is too dark outside to take a picture of the inside of my car, which is a real wreck, and my sock drawer is in the room where the kids are sleeping. So let's see. ... 3 more things. ... 1. I've had like 40 different jobs in my life. I started working when I was 13 and always had at least two jobs at a time. Even now I find myself looking at the want ads and seeing job descriptions for ticket takers or food demonstrators and think: \"I could do that on the evenings and weekends.\" And then I realize that no, I couldn't. It is a mind set that is hard to break. If I were to write a real resume it would include: dental assistant, closed-caption transcriber, personal assistant, short-order cook, ironer and laundramat attendant, rough carpenter, baker, cashier at grocery store (one day only), cashier at Au Bon Pain (also one day), ethnographer, house cleaner, census taker, salad maker. ... it pretty much goes on and on. 2. I once crewed on a 42 foot wooden sailboat from the Philippines to Thailand by way of Borneo. All of the other crew members were German-speaking and I secretly admired the only other woman on board because she showered topless on deck while I clung to my Puritan heritage. 3. I have really big feet. I wear a size 10 1/2. I hit puberty really late -- I was 16 -- and I didn't grow height-wise until after that. So for about a year I was 5 foot, 2 inches tall with a size ten shoe. I later grew into those feet (I'm now 5'9\") but it was a pretty scary waiting for that growth spurt. So now I'm supposed to tag someone else, I guess. But I'm not going to because it feels a little too much like choosing up for a game of softball and as the short girl with big feet who never got picked that kind of goes against my ethos. Still, I have to say I enjoyed being tagged and it was kind of fun going about my house with the camera thinking: \"This says something about me.\" or \"This says way too much about me!\" Anyone else care to give it a try? ps: I can't figure out why I can't get the spacing to work right when I add pictures and text. .. it is really frustrating\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/RnXWScL4q7I/AAAAAAAAABs/HzhKyi7QNL4/s1600-h/IMG_0427.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/RnXXB8L4q8I/AAAAAAAAAB0/pcwR7wfWLtY/s1600-h/IMG_0430.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/RnXZoML4q9I/AAAAAAAAAB8/WyDI7dWOOQg/s1600-h/IMG_0431.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/RnXaVsL4q-I/AAAAAAAAACE/AXMvor-iq5E/s1600-h/IMG_0432.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/RnXbCsL4q_I/AAAAAAAAACM/72QE2xuuLzY/s1600-h/IMG_0433.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/06/back-in-business.html", "title": "\nBack in Business\n"},

But on the other hand, Nik is away for a week so I am actually getting stuff done that has been on my to-do list forever.

{"date": "June 07, 2007", "body": "\nThere is something weird about sleeping all night long for so many nights consecutively. I wake in the morning a bit disoriented. It's light out? Have I overslept? Where are the the children? How did this happen? Then I see the children curled around each other like dogs and Nik suddenly appears with a cup of coffee in hand (How does he know just the moment when I'm waking). \"How did you sleep?\"  \"Good. You?\" \"Good.\" We both look at each other in slight astonishment and lay back on the pillow together to drink our coffee in silence, hardly believing our luck. In my mind I silently contrast this to a few years ago when I was regularly jolted awake in the morning by Oliver's piercing screams. Even if I happened to wake before him I was always braced for the screaming. I don't know how to describe what that is like: always waiting for the stressful moment to come. I asked Nik about it once recently. I described that period to him as the most stressful time of my life because the screaming episodes were frequent throughout the day and night.  I think I suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome because of it and he barely remembered it. Why is that, I wondered? My only theory is that mothers are supposed to be programmed to understand their children's cry. We are supposed to know a hurt cry from tired cry from a hungry cry. But with Oliver all of his cries sounded like an emergency to me. I remember other parents at that time who spoke of not rushing to pick up their child at every cry but I was never able to do that. I wondered why I had such a hard time adjusting. And then Sam came along and things were different. Every cry wasn't an emergency. I could soothe him from across the room with just the sound of my voice. I could hand him off to Nik or RT and they could soothe him. Right from the very start it was different. I must admit that part of me is wondering how long this spate of good luck will last. It seems pretty inconceivable to me that we can go to bed every night expecting to sleep until morning.

{"date": "June 06, 2007", "body": "\nWe are finally back to normal in our house. Or at least as close to it as we get. Yesterday I actually even set up the video camera and attempted some structured activities with Oliver. I had to re-think how I was approaching our current objective a bit and felt pretty good about the outcome. Of course Oliver objected the whole way through our three, two-minute activities, but at least he did them and was successful. And I was much better at realizing that extending an activity, just because I'm sure it will go better the next time, isn't always a good idea. In fact, it usually isn't. Besides, the more I think about this objective (coordinating actions) the easier it is to work it into everyday activities so there is always another chance to practice just around the corner. It takes a lot of pressure off so that I don't feel like we always have to get it right each time we try something. We've been seeing some interesting developments lately with Oliver. First, his receptive language ability is skyrocketing. Hand-in-hand with that is his growing ability to respond more quickly and his ability to respond to cues in his environment without verbal prompting. Getting Oliver dressed used to be quite an ordeal. Nine months ago if I had to change three articles of clothing I would have had to chase him down the hall four times before finishing. Six months ago I no longer had to chase him but I still pretty much had to keep him focused on the task at hand and also had to help him with each article to be changed. A couple of weeks ago I started just handing him the clothes that needed to be changed or put on, telling him that it was time to change his clothes and then waiting for him to do it while giving minimal support. Yesterday I just layed out his clothes for the day and walked away and he had started the task before I even left the room! And the same goes with his shoes. \"Oliver, let's go outside. Here are your shoes,\" I'll say. And on go the shoes. Of course it isn't every time and it isn't always so easy but you can't imagine what a difference it makes!  I know this sounds incredible to some people but a year ago I couldn't imagine a time when Oliver would be able to get dressed by himself. And now we are almost there. It makes me feel like anything is possible!

{"date": "June 19, 2007", "body": "\nI can't say how many times I have asked myself some variation of this question since becoming Oliver's mother. What's this new thing? This new insight? This new behavior? This new sleep pattern? Is this a new emerging skill or a one-time thing? In a comment on someone's blog recently I referred to myself as the Puzzle-Master because I am always trying to figure things out, to see patterns and devise strategies and approaches. My greatest frustration and the source of a lot of anxiety for me is the not knowing if I've got the right answer, if I'm doing the right thing, too much or too little. And sometimes, when I focus too much on what I think is lacking in my own abilities to get it right, I get stuck; I get overwhelmed with inertia. Since Oliver's bout with the flu a few weeks ago, when his frustration over not being able to communicate seemed to take center stage even while his fever hovered in the so-high-it-makes-me-nervous numbers, I've been stewing. I've written before that Oliver's silence has almost become overlooked at our house these days. He is just our Oliver and he doesn't talk. We are happy when we hear words but it hasn't been our focus over the past year. Starting RDI helped me to feel more comfortable about not focusing on the language bit. Instead our goal became  communication,  which is a vastly different thing. And I've been so happy with his progress overall that it has helped me not to be so panicked by his lack of speech. But then again, I would really love to hear what he has to say. I would love to know if he is cold or hungry or what he finds so funny. And I never want him to again be so frustrated because he can't say: \"Just leave me alone!\" On the upside, Oliver is  trying  to use language more and more. I can ask him simple questions and he can respond: \"What's this?\" \"A cow.\" \"How does a cow go?\" \"Mooo.\" And he is repeating much more of what I say and can label just about anything. But it is all prompted. Very little of it is spontaneous. And I am starting to see that he has trouble making certain sounds. And sometimes he has trouble being able to produce a word that I know he knows. And sometimes he just says the first sound or syllable of the word. And sometimes he just tries to get away from me! So what to do? If speaking is something that causes anxiety for Oliver then I don't want to keep pressuring him to talk by always asking questions. On the other hand, it is SO encouraging to hear his little voice and to know that he knows certain things. It gives me immeasurable hope. And yet I find myself almost constantly barraging him with questions and that isn't right either. Who wants to be constantly bombarded with questions? After thinking about it a lot I determined that I need to find a structured approach that will help to address his issues of competency so that his level of anxiety will also gradually decrease. So for now I have settled on the Association Method because it is a \"multi-sensory\" approach to teaching language syllable by syllable. In a way this very much parallels the RDI approach to autism remediation in that areas of challenge are addressed in a very incremental way that focuses on building competencies. I am more than a little anxious about getting started. I'm not a teacher or a speech pathologist. I never could learn grammar, myself. Why do I think I can do this? And this method teaches reading and writing simultaneously. ... Is this biting off more than I can chew? More than Oliver and I can chew together? Well, maybe. But I'm going to give it a try anyway. But gently. And hopefully Oliver and I will develop our competencies as we go along. Together.

{"date": "April 16, 2007", "body": "\nSam and I have both been sick all weekend with some sort of stomach virus. With all that time on the couch I had a million thoughts going through my head but now I can't seem to pin any of them down into a complete post. So I'm just going to do a brain-dump instead. Here goes: 1. I don't know how it came up but I told RT the other day that I was planning to homeschool the kids and he looked at me incredulously and said: \"But they're not going to have any friends!!\" I thought that was kind of funny and kind of sweet. It reminded me that to him Oliver is just his little brother. Yes, he has autism and yes, he can be kind of a pain in the neck if you are a teenager and want your brother to just stay out of your room. But he really doesn't fully understand how likely it is that Oliver's life will look much different from his own. 2. Every morning I wake the kids up and as they wipe the sleep from their eyes I open the blinds and say: \"Good Morning Birds! Good Morning Sky! Good Morning Tree! Good Morning Street!\", etc. Sometimes Sam joins me and repeats what I'm saying. This morning it was Oliver who stood next to me at the window and echoed my greetings. It gives me such high hopes! 3. I took Sam for his 2 year well-baby appointment last week and was surprised to learn that he is only in the 10th percentile for height and weight! He is such a little guy but has such a huge presence. The paper they gave me that tells what I could generally expect for the coming year said that he would soon start speaking in 5-6 word sentences. I had to laugh at that because just after I read it he was heard to tell the doctor that: \"Dinosaurs stomp their feet on the ground and go GRRRR!\" So much for generalities. 4. It is insane how many extra-curricular things RT is doing at the moment and how complicated it makes our life at times -- especially given that we now only have one car. Guitar lessons: once a week; karate lessons: 4 nights a week; soccer: practice once a week, games once or twice a week; then there are the field trips and the academic extras that come up every other week or so. We need a special teenager calendar just to keep track of it all! And then, once we get the swing of balancing all of this he will be off to college! 5. I'm wrestling with the whole vaccination issue for Sam. I had told myself that I would selectively vaccinate after he turned two but now I just can't decide what to do. Intellectually, I don't believe that Oliver's autism was  caused  by his vaccinations. But he did get terribly sick immediately following his last vaccinations, lost most of his speech in the next 3-4 months, and his digestive system never fully recovered. Is all that just a coincidence? I don't have the confidence to say one way or the other and so I sit here on the fence. 6. I took a bunch of pictures of the boys the other day so now if I can just figure out how to download them I'll post some. 7.  Watched Little Miss Sunshine the other night -- wow! what a great movie! And if I wasn't on the couch being sick, sick, sick, it would have made me want to eat a bowl of ice cream.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/04/stuff.html", "title": "\nStuff. ...\n"},
{"date": "April 04, 2007", "body": "\nWhat is that saying? You know, the one about not seeing the forest for the trees? Sometimes (OK,  often ) that is the way it works with me. I get so caught up in seeing all of Oliver's challenges that I don't focus enough on how far we've come. And we  have  come far enough that each time I look up for a couple of minutes I notice that the landscape has changed. Yesterday I met with our RDI consultant to go over the new objectives. The program has recently undergone a total overhaul, taking it from a linear approach to development to a more 3 dimensional model. It more accurately reflects how a typical child develops. And BOY! is it complex. Something like the ABBLs pales in comparison. Really. So the details and scope of the new objectives had me really excited. But then I started seeing those darn trees every time we read a new objective. I'd wonder, \"Can he do that?\" and then get a bit more discouraged every time I'd admit that no, I don't think he can. But then I went home to the boys and set about doing the day's  stuff . Our stuff yesterday involved running a series of errands, not your typical fun kid stuff but I try my best to at least make it interesting for them. I've been really trying very hard to give Oliver more and more freedom and running errands gives us a very natural way for him to exercise this independence. This is only possible because he is becoming MUCH less impulsive. And because his receptive language skills are slowly increasing. It used to be that  any  time we went  any where I kept a tight hold of his hand. If I didn't then I could count on him running off somewhere, which is highly stress-provoking. I was terrified of him getting hit by a car or getting lost -- and for good reason because he really wasn't aware of his surroundings. I still don't think he is terribly aware but at least I can count on him not taking off at a run the moment his feet hit the pavement in a busy parking lot. So yesterday we went from the Post Office, to the Ice Cream stand, to the plant nursery, to the grocery store and then back home. It took about ninety minutes and during that whole time Oliver completely managed himself. I only had to call him back to me a couple of times and each time he quickly returned to my side. And the whole time we were out I practiced our referencing activities and he responded beautifully. So when we were at the grocery store I merely got his attention and then looked in the direction we needed to go or the item we needed to get, etc. Now if only Sam were that easy. HE wants to argue over  everything . I am still on high alert every time we are away from home. It is as if every molecule of my body is ready to spring into action at any moment. But just the fact that I don't have to keep an iron grip on Oliver all the time is an indication of how much things have changed over the last six months. So slowly, slowly, I am learning to relax. And the more I relax the more I get to enjoy the view. The forest. And from where I'm sitting right now it looks pretty good.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/04/from-where-im-sitting.html", "title": "\nFrom Where I'm Sitting\n"},
{"date": "April 02, 2007", "body": "\nA couple of weeks ago posts about IEPs started showing up on many of the blogs I read. It's that time of the year. It's stressful. It's anxiety-producing, and it's mandatory. I haven't written about our IEP meeting because we haven't yet had one. But we have been having lots of meetings and phone calls and discussions -- all leading up to the IEP. And all of it has made me a bit sad. A bit bitter. A bit less naive. Here's the thing: we are lucky enough to live in a school district that really  is  trying to do the right thing. They are strong advocates of early intervention and have hired a company that specializes in ABA techniques to provide all pre-school children on the spectrum with in-home services. The program that this company has developed is truly wonderful -- not your typical desk-top, dtt program -- and it is staffed by the most caring people. The school district has also hired an Autism Coordinator to oversee the needs of all children with autism at all age levels. The Director of Special Education is caring and progressive. She and the Autism Coordinator recently went to a 2-day RDI workshop and are investigating how they might employ an RDI consultant to work with families and teachers. Sounds pretty good, right? I know that many, many families don't have access to these kinds of services and I am thankful that I don't have to educate the people on our IEP team about Oliver's needs. And yet. And yet I am coming to understand that still -- despite all their good intentions -- they see Oliver as just another boy with autism. And since he has autism that means, according to them, that his education should be structured in a certain way. The real trouble started when I began questioning this rationale. This is when I discovered the myth of the IEP \"team\". Up until this point I had earnestly believed that we, the parents, were part of the \"team\". But now I see that this is only true if we go along with the rest of the players. Now we are the rogue players. We are the ones questioning the coach, the strategy and even the rules. It started simply enough. After a year and a half I saw that Oliver still required a tremendous amount of physical prompting when it came to completing the visual schedule. This was irksome for me because I often thought that those working with Oliver, although well-meaning, prompted him too quickly. They didn't allow him time to process, to mentally disengage himself from whatever preceded. But beyond that, Oliver has never really had trouble with transitions in the rest of his life. We rarely find the need to use physical prompting with him. And with RDI I found that he would even gladly engage in an activity that might not be all that interesting to him. All I have to do is ask him to join me. And, to top it off, I don't believe that Oliver is necessarily a visual thinker. So why the visual schedule? Why keep pushing him to do something that is meant to help him compensate for difficulties that he doesn't really have? The answer? Oliver needs to be able to fit into a structured environment and to understand the nature of sequencing; that everything has a beginning, a middle and an end. He needs to transition at the proper pace and not in his own time. When he comes to need less prompting to complete a schedule they will begin to phase it out. Can anyone say Circular Logic? I could waste a lot of virtual ink explaining why I believe that teaching him to comply with an artificial schedule rather than helping him learn to take cues from the environment and to enjoy cooperating on a series of activities is a mistake. But rather I'll just say that this one conflict has helped me to understand a greater scheme of things. It has helped me understand how the specific needs of specific children get lost in the system. Even when that system is made up of caring individuals. That is just the nature of things. An  Individual  Educational Plan is still governed by what the school district believes to be appropriate practice. That's the system. Not too long ago a woman with the school district repeatedly referred to Oliver as \"low-functioning.\" After the third time in as many conversations I interrupted her and told her that I thought it was inappropriate. To this she responded: \"Oh, we just use that as short-hand in reference to a child's communication skills.\" That's the system, too. They need labels and adjectives as identifiers. But in the end you have people who are making decisions about your child who are only really acquainted with the modifiers. So in our case you have: low-functioning, autistic child = visual schedule, physical prompting, heavy use of reinforcers. And so we're opting out. I haven't worked out all the details yet. I don't know exactly how I'm going to make this work. But I won't be sending him to school in the Fall. I won't send him until he is ready and I can't say when that will be. But it feels pretty liberating to know that I won't have to compromise anymore about what I think is right. And it feels wonderful to know that we are free to use our own modifiers. And in our case that would be: eager to please, ready to learn Oliver = Homeschooling.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/04/system.html", "title": "\nOpting Out\n"},
{"date": "April 05, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday Oliver was occupying himself by running in and out of the house. First to the swing then to the kitchen for a glass of water, then to the sandbox, empty now and filled with leftover winter muck just perfect for boys of a certain age. Then he was back in the kitchen for a handful of grapes, and so on. He was in the kitchen when I happened to catch him leaning precariously from a chair to the kitchen sink two feet away with a glass in hand. I stopped myself from instructing him to move the chair closer or from taking the glass and filling it for him, held my breath and just let him do it. You see! I\u2019ve come a long way. Then, after he had a mouth full of water and watched as it dribbled out of the corners of his mouth to his now damp shirt I surmised that he wasn\u2019t really thirsty and we could begin. \"Oliver,\" I said, \"let\u2019s see if we can find some eggs!\" Then I waited. He continued watching the drops of water wetting his shirt. I waited a bit longer not saying anything. After some time and without acknowledging me in anyway, he put the glass down, got down from the chair, walked to the refrigerator and opened it. So much time had passed since my request that I momentarily wondered what he was doing. Then I realized that he was scanning for the egg carton. \u201cOliver,\" I said bending down next to him, \"I see a different kind of egg! Look at that!\u201d He didn\u2019t look at my face and again gave no indication that he heard me but slowly turned instead to look in the same direction and there he spied the plastic egg I had put next to the butter. On closer inspection he saw that inside the egg were two small pieces of candy of his favorite kind which I let him devour immediately. \u201cWow! I wonder if we can find more eggs like that? Maybe over there,\u201d I said while looking towards the doors. One door leads to the bathroom and the other to the hall. Oliver took my cue, shut the refrigerator door and went immediately out into the hall. I cleared my throat. He glanced up at me and I looked excitedly into the bathroom. He found the next egg nestled in the empty candle holder next to the bottle of yellow Listerine. In fact, he found a total of 10 eggs yesterday afternoon, scattered all over the house. And as soon as the last one was deposited safely into the little cloth bag that I had given him and Oliver sat happily examining his booty, I dialed the phone to share my joy with Nik: \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what your wonderful, amazing son just did!\u201d I was pretty hesitant to start the activity. This isn\u2019t the sort of thing at which he normally excels. I couldn\u2019t say, for instance: \u201cI\u2019ve hidden little plastic eggs filled with candy all over the house and now we\u2019re going to find them.\u201d His receptive language just isn\u2019t there yet. And in the past he might have found one egg but not understood that there were more eggs waiting to be found. And until recently he might not have even understood that the other eggs all had candy in them. But this time it all came together and we had ourselves an Easter egg hunt. Some time ago, probably without even realizing it, I let go of trying to fit Oliver into holidays and events and activities that mark the passage of childhood for other families. I realized that if I wanted to be happy \u2013 if  Oliver  was going to be happy -- I had to fit those things to Oliver  if it worked . And mostly it doesn\u2019t work for right now so we skip a lot of things and that is just fine with me. But something about this one little success had me thinking yesterday that just about anything in life is possible. Suddenly I could imagine him on a big green field with a dozen other kids looking for those silly plastic eggs filled with candy I don\u2019t even want him to eat. If I were a better writer or a better Christian I could probably come up with some seasonal analogy between what Oliver found yesterday and what I found. I'm not sure what that is, honestly. But it was something. We both found something.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/04/what-we-found.html", "title": "\nWhat We Found\n"},
{"date": "April 23, 2007", "body": "\nThe  end of March  punctuates my year like no other occasion. No specific day is marked and no single event, really, is remembered. But still, there is something with me on these quiet days as we move into spring that is real, if not easily definable. It is one part grief, one part contentment, one part optimism, one part shadow. And although I can't find a way to describe it any better I am happy and it seems fitting that this punctuation -- be it period or exclamation point or question mark -- comes in the spring. In graduate school, where I studied Anthropology, we talked a lot about the concept of liminality, which is just a fancy way to describe a person who is in a state of being that is between two things. You are no longer what you were but not yet what you will be: a boy participating in a rite of passage into adulthood, a bride whose father has just given her away, a pregnant woman. When I started this blog I felt deeply liminal myself. But in contrast to other periods of liminality in my life, this one was prescribed by neither text or ritual. I was completely unmoored. In one of my first entries I wrote: \"We're not quite the family we were and we haven't yet found how all of these pieces will fit together to create the family that will see us through. And as individuals: mother, father, brother, we  haven't yet learned how to fill those roles in this new context.\" I often think about this and wonder if I am yet the special needs mother that I need to be. Oh sure, I am the mother of a special needs child -- and just the fact that I can put those words in a sentence is evidence that I have journeyed far -- but am I through with the  becoming  part? Just how long is this process supposed to take and how will I know when I have arrived? Really. This is not a rhetorical question. I want to know. I think I am getting there, I really do. Yet I still feel as though I have so very much to learn. I still have dark moments of doubt and fear and frustration. But there isn't a mother anywhere that doesn't feel the same way, I'm sure. Special needs or not. And maybe, coming to the understanding that there isn't so much difference between me and any other mother, is why I think I'm getting close to the end of my journey of becoming. My journey, it seems, has been circular and I find myself right back at the beginning where I was just a mother and my boy was just a son. I emerged from my pregnancy with a beautiful, shining boy; I emerged a mother. At first, to be sure, I was a  new  mother. And let's just say that  it took me awhile to learn the ropes . But learn them I did and I grew to love mothering my little guy. It was only a short time later when a whole new vocabulary of adjectives started to be applied to my son -- delayed, autistic, low-functioning, non-verbal -- and I began to believe that the rules had changed, that being a good mother now required more and different things of me. I read Catherine Maurice's \"Let Me Hear Your Voice\" and wondered if I had all of the stamina and the courage and the persistence that she did. I wondered if I were really up to the task. Nearly two years has passed now and I've spent a lot of time trying to figure it all out in lieu of the text and ritual. And what I've come up with is this: the rules never did change. I only  imagined  that they did. I don't have to be anything more or better or different. I don't have to be Catherine Maurice. I just have to be the mother that I set out to be four years ago when all I ever imagined I'd need was love, patience, a bit of creativity and a box or two of band-aids. I just wish it hadn't taken me quite so long to get this far back to the beginning.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5697/1679/1600/P8230114.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/04/back-to-beginning.html", "title": "\nBack to the Beginning\n"},

Global Warming is one of those things that keeps me up at night. Seriously. I work everyday so that I can help to ensure that my kids will have a good quality of life in the future yet I worry about what kind of world they will be left with. But I tend to avoid reading or hearing too much about the subject because it just seems so out of my hands, you know? So overwhelming. And that is why I LOVE the EcoMom Challenge. There are 82 million moms in the US alone and if we all make some basic changes -- some of them very easy to do -- then we WILL have an impact. I just love the idea of a bunch of mom's getting together to save the planet! The website includes a list of 10 easy things you can do -- that anyone can do. Go ahead! Have a look. SO! Over the weekend I went out and bought 16 compact, flourescent light bulbs ($2/each with a life of 7 years per!) and replaced almost all the regular light bulbs in my house. Then I had a little family meeting with Nik and RT and we agreed to make this a priority at our house. I showed them the website and asked them for ideas on what we can do to help save the penguins and the polar bears. We came up with a list of ideas, wrote them down and each of us signed it. Then we visited  this site  and calculated our Carbon Footprint -- that is, the amount of carbon dioxide our family produces per year. I am happy to say that we scored in the Much Less Than Average category even before you factor in the light bulbs. Our family produces 31,117 lbs of Carbon Dioxide each year, which still seems like a lot to me. And the cost of that is only $16/month. That is, the cost of purchasing clean energy that will offset that same amount of Carbon Dioxide, is only $16. And that, my friends, makes us Carbon Neutral! So if you've ever felt like climate change was something that you couldn't do much about and if you are a mother, or if you have a mother, or if you would like to be a mother or if you know a mother -- then what are you waiting for?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thismom.com/", "http://www.ecomomalliance.org/index.html", "http://www.nativeenergy.com"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/04/16-cost-of-good-night-sleep.html", "title": "\n$16 = The Cost of a Good Night Sleep\n"},

Then a day of mourning pops up out of nowhere and just completely knocks me down and wanting Oliver to talk is all I think about. Luckily though it doesn't take me as long to get back up as it used to. And of course it helps to have friends who point out what I already know: We are on the right track and Oliver is growing by leaps and bounds every day.

{"date": "April 24, 2007", "body": "\nI know that I write a lot about RDI these days and that is because I have come to feel so passionate about it. For us it is right thing to do. Last night Nik and I sat on the couch and reviewed the videos from our first two weeks. Seeing Oliver now you wouldn't believe that those videos were taken just four months ago. A big change that we've seen with Oliver of late is an increase in his ability to communicate. Oh, he isn't speaking that much more but he is communicating and I do believe that we are starting to have our first conversations, which is so exciting. Who cares that hardly a word is spoken. Here is an example of an exchange that we had yesterday: Standing at the back door and holding it open an inch or two Oliver is poised to go outside. \"Oliver, lunch will be ready in two minutes.\" Oliver looks again outside and inches the door open a bit further. I clear my throat, he looks up at me and sees me shaking my head 'no'. He then smiles and vigorously shakes his head 'yes'. I shake mine in the negative one more time while simultaneously setting a piece of pizza down on the table. End of conversation. Short but oh, so sweet! Some other changes that we've seen since we started doing RDI: Oliver is starting to be able to make choices. When presented with a number of books he will study them for a moment and then intentionally choose one. A few months ago he would have sat immobile if presented with a choice. He is also now independantly getting things to eat -- even if that means he has to climb up on the cupboards and chairs to get it. I have always left fruit out on the counter so that anyone can grab a snack when they want. But Oliver never before took the initiative to do it -- even when he was really hungry. Now, nothing is safe. And one day I even found him hiding outside and trying to get a popsicle wrapper off! I was so stunned that you could have knocked me over with feather. Another exciting development is that the range of toys he chooses and his manner of playing is starting to vary a bit. I am starting to see more and more elements of pretend play which is kind of fun to watch. We still have a long way to go, to be sure, but at the moment anyway it all just seems so very good.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/04/changes.html", "title": "\nChanges\n"},
{"date": "May 07, 2007", "body": "\nOK, it wasn't that long ago that I wrote a post explaining how we had decided to homeschool and honestly, at that point, I was feeling pretty good about it. This is in direct relationship to how compromising on what I thought was right for Oliver had made me feel so bad. But then we had the pre-IEP meeting where we told the school district that no, we didn't want to send Oliver to school this Fall. I didn't even mention homeschooling, only that we wanted to delay school for another year. And we wanted his in-home services to continue and we wanted funding for our RDI program. To make a long, long story short, they came back and said no twice. If we didn't send Oliver to school we would get nothing. I felt really worried and scared about it for exactly one day. My gut -- and what I know about Oliver -- tells me that we are making the right decision. But then there is this little voice in my head making itself heard that says: \"So, you think you can meet all of Oliver's needs ON YOUR OWN?\" I Do, I Do! I keep replying. But even I recognize that the voice in reply doesn't have the strong sound of confidence. So I review the things I know: 1) I know and understand Oliver better than any professional or therapist ever could. 2) Oliver has made more strides in the last six months with RDI than in the past 18 months with ABA. 3) I am buildng a strong support network: I've got friends who are there for me; I've got a virtual cheerleading squad via blogland; I'm finding other local RDI moms who also fit in that first category but bring an extra-special understanding with them; and of course Nik, who makes me feel as though there is nothing I can't accomplish. And then there is this: I sit on the advisory panel for Special Education in our city and when we met last week the Director presented the proposed budget for the next school year. During this presentation she discussed their plan to put a greater emphasis on the needs of children with autism at the middle school level. She told us how it had been common practice for the district to recommend placement in residential facilities for children with certain behaviors. Now they will try to address those behaviors in other ways.  There was actually more to it than that but honestly I stopped listening after she got that far. Seated to the Director's right was the mother of a 17 year old child who was placed in a facility at age 11. Listening to her comments about that experience in repsonse to the Director's plans were wrenching. I almost had to leave the room. \"Not my child,\" I kept thinking. That will not happen to my child. I can't know what the future holds but I DO know that every day we take steps towards our future. I feel pretty unsure of myself at the moment. I don't know if I'm making the right decisions but I do know that sending Oliver into a school environment at this point would be the  wrong  decision. Still, I sure wish there were a \"Parenting an ASD Child Decision Making Manual\" out there!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/05/on-opting-out.html", "title": "\nOn Opting Out\n"},
{"date": "May 02, 2007", "body": "\n Can I just say that Monday, the one day of Blog silence, nearly killed me. I kept pathetically checking back on my favorite blogs hoping that the author hadn\u2019t heard about it! When I finally gave up the hope I drafted a new post that I planned to get up yesterday but I\u2019m only now getting around to posting it. \u2026 **************** I wanted to post a bit more about RDI and how we make it work for us even amidst all of the other things that we have going on. We really try to keep things pretty simple but when you are talking about a household of 5 people there is invariably a lot of extra \u201cstuff\u201d going on. I first read about RDI about a year ago and I kind of shelved it before I really understood how it worked. It was appealing to me but it is a parent-led approach and at that point I honestly didn\u2019t think I could handle doing more than I already was doing. BUT, I was interested enough that I came back to it six months later and the second time I\u2019m glad I followed my gut. That\u2019s when I e-mailed  ThisMom  and said: \u201cCan I do it? Will it work with Oliver?\u201d Her resounding and unequivocal YES!! had me on the phone with a consultant that very day. Overall, I have to say that \u201cdoing\u201d RDI has not been terribly time-consuming or difficult for us. Throughout the week we focus on a particular objective that is designed to address a specific skill that Oliver needs help with. Right now we are working on helping him learn to reference.  So over the course of any given day we find opportunities to work on this in just about every interaction we have with him. An example might be when I needed the pencil that was on the floor next to Oliver and I said: \u201cHey, Oliver! Can you hand me that?\u201d Then I looked purposefully towards the pencil. At first he mistakenly picked up the sock and tried to hand it to me so I shook my head and again looked at the pencil. His gaze went back to the floor where he located the pencil and handed it to me. Another example of how we use referencing in daily activities is when we set the table. I hand him the plates one by one and indicate with a look where I want him to set each of them down on the table. When we first started RDI an activity like this would not have been possible. Not only could he not reference but I could barely sustain his attention for 30 seconds at a time. Now these kinds of interactions might last anywhere from 2-3 minutes to 30 minutes or more. And I am amazed at how many opportunities I find throughout the day to weave in a little bit of RDI work. I look at everything we do and wonder how I can vary it so that he will have to flex the part of his brain that he needs to. Besides this lifestyle sort of strategy we also set up specific periods of time throughout the week when we have the camera rolling and structure activities designed to demonstrate his proficiency at the skill we are targeting. So this weekend, for example, we made cookies together. I had already mixed everything together and set up two cookie sheets when I invited Oliver to help me and turned the camera on. As I handed Oliver a ball of cookie dough he needed to reference me to figure out where I wanted him to put it. The whole activity only took 4 minutes but he was able to correctly place every single cookie.  I try to record one or two of these activities every day and then at the end of the week I\u2019ve got about 15 \u2013 20 minutes of video to send to our consultant and I think it gives a pretty good picture of where he stands at any given time. The other thing that I love about watching Oliver\u2019s progress through RDI is that as we help him fill in the developmental skills that did not come naturally for him other skills DO fall into place naturally. Here are a couple of things that I noted in my last e-mail to our consultant:   1)   Oliver has surprised me lately by becoming upset whenever I am impatient with him or if I use an angry voice with him. This is totally new because it used to be that it made NO difference if I yelled at him. He just completely ignored it. Or maybe he didn\u2019t understand that I was angry. \u2026. But he sure does now. It astounds me.  2)  Oliver has developed a pain threshold. It used to be that Oliver didn\u2019t react much to events that other kids would find painful \u2013 but now he cries and comes running for comfort whenever he gets hurt. I guess this is just another element of his emerging self-awareness. So that\u2019s about it on the RDI front but on a different subject entirely: Oliver has graduated to a two-wheel bike with training wheels!!

{"date": "April 27, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday afternoon the boys and I were making yet another trip to the hardware store. I've gotten a home improvement bug this spring and so the whole house is littered with tools and tape and just when I think I'm good to go I discover that I need something else. But on these rainy afternoons it gives us a good excuse to get in the car and go somewhere. So there we were yesterday, all strapped in our Ford station wagon that sports the new bumper sticker proclaiming that: This Car is on a Low-Carbon Diet.  My mind was on other things, really, when I heard the words \"Red Truck\" from the back seat just as a red truck passed us in the other lane. It took a second. I pushed away what I had been preoccupied with. No, that wasn't Sammy, I thought. That was Oliver. Did he say 'Red Truck'? It sounded like red truck. And there certainly  was  a red truck. Oliver said 'Red Truck'!!! Now, I often say that Oliver is  mostly  non-verbal. He  can  talk and he  does  communicate certain needs reliably. But mostly his language consists of the phrase: \"I want\" followed by some noun. He can also sing a couple of songs and can fill in the words to stories he is familiar with. But most of this is either prompted or driven by his desire to have his needs fulfilled. Which is OK, but it doesn't tell me a whole lot about what goes on inside his head. But THIS! This 'Red Truck'! This is something completely new and wonderful. Oliver saw something in the environment that caught his eye and he labled it to share what he saw with the others in the car. That's communication.  Spontaneou s communication. There's no telling where we'll go from here!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/04/red-truck.html", "title": "\nRed Truck\n"},
{"date": "May 25, 2007", "body": "\nI slept through the night last night. Without exaggeration I can say that it was the first time in five years! Sam is now night-weaned. This is kind of bittersweet for me. With Oliver we practiced child-led weaning and I thought I would do the same with Sam. But since the only time he wanted to nurse was between the hours of midnight and five a.m., night-weaning him has amounted to weaning altogether. But I was fortunate to be able to nurse both of my kids for more than two years so I'm happy with that. That, and the amount of sleep I got last night. Imagine that I wasn't still tired when the alarm went off this morning! So now does this mean I have to wean myself from my morning espresso? Hmm. I'll have to think about this. On another note, I happened to find a VHS tape of home movies that we took when Oliver was between nine months and two years. I had completely forgotten about those movies. It captures the progression of his autism in breath-taking fashion. It was like watching the period of his regression in one of those time-lapse movies where everything is sped up. What a very unsettling feeling it was to watch the whole thing unfold on tape. It made my stomach kind of hurt. I hope everyone has a very good and safe long weekend!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/05/ah-sleep.html", "title": "\nAh, Sleep!\n"},
{"date": "May 08, 2007", "body": "\nGosh, there has been so much going on around here over the past week or so that I almost forgot to post about our wonderful hiking adventure last Sunday. One thing about the place where we live is that there are many, many good hiking opportunities within just a short drive from our house. Our favorite hike is one that starts off with a hill that is just littered with large stones. To get to the trailhead you must first hike uphill about a quarter of a mile, making your way by scrambling from stone to stone. It requires a good deal of concentration to pick your way up the hill, deciding as you go which stone to step to next. At the top you again begin a gradual decent towards the stream and once you reach the water you then have to step from stone to stone along the trail that takes you down the middle of the stream. This is pretty challenging but lasts for just a short distance and when you reach the proper trail again, it runs alongside the water where you can then stop and refresh yourself at the most beautiful and serene swimming hole you can imagine. During the peak of the summer the strong of heart can take a plunge in the chest deep, icy cold water. It is a heavenly place. We go to this place several times a year for a bit of respite and a bit of swimming when the weather allows. In the past our hikes have been kind of slow going -- one of us carrying Sammy and the other helping Oliver along and sometimes carrying him as well -- especially when we reach the stream. But this time Oliver managed the whole hike by himself and I was simply glowing with pride. There are not a lot of situations in which Oliver is completey competent on his own, but on Sunday I saw him master that trail. It was wonderful. On the way up the first part of the trail I hiked parallel to him. At times it was difficult to determine where exactly the trail was going as you have to be able to look forward and see the next opening in the trees while also managing to figure out where to place your next step. On hikes similar to this that I took pre-children I often mused to myself how incredible the brain body connection is. In order to keep your gait kind of steady your eyes must scout the next step and in a split second that information is communicated to your body and without even really \"thinking\" about it your foot is suddenly there. It is a pretty amazing system really. I thought of this again as I watched Oliver do just that: scan, decide, step, scan, decide, step -- all the while keeping a pretty steady pace. Then later when we reached the stream I went a step ahead of Oliver and kept hold of his hand when needed so he didn't lose his balance and fall in the water (but each of us did end up with wet feet at one point!). This part was particularly gratifying to me because it demonstrated that we really do have referencing mastered. I say that because we weren't doing an RDI activity. I didn't set out to make this into a referencing exercise. But it ended up that way because when Oliver needed my help he always looked to me for information and it was natural for me not to say anything but rather to look where I thought he should step next. And sometimes he would look at me, I would look at a particular rock he would appraise my directions and choose a different rock instead. This is true dynamic thinking and the ultimate goal of RDI.  I have never been more proud of any accomplishment of Oliver's as I was when we reached the end of that part of the trail. I had been thinking lately of writing a post about how, knock on wood, our bad days seem to be behind us. Taking Oliver just about anywhere has become easy. He rarely has what I would call a melt-down and when he does they aren't of a magnitude anywhere near where they were a year ago. Oliver is mostly just an easy child. He is learning and growing and I really only have positive thoughts about our life these days. Anyway, I thought about this again when we were nearing the end of the trail on Sunday. But then when we got into the car and started to drive away I offered both kids an apple. Sam chose first and apparently that was a big mistake because Oliver proceeded to have an enormous melt-down. I'm not sure if it was because he wanted the red apple, not the green one, or if he just didn't want Sam to have an apple. But it was ugly and every time he calmed himself down a bit he stole a glance at Sam and got all worked up again. You'd think I would know how to handle these situations but I don't do a very good job. So I'm glad I never did write that post about saying good-bye to the bad days but they certainly are much less frequent than they once were. It is a sign of progress in us all. The other bit of good news that we got last week -- the day after the pre-IEP -- is that Oliver is apparently ready for Stage Three of RDI (in the old system). Stage three is coordinating actions: either doing the same thing at the same time or complementary actions to accomplish one goal. I'm still getting a handle on how to approach this with Oliver. The first couple of activities that we tried were dismal failures!! But still, I am amazed at how much progress we have made in just 16 weeks. We celebrated again with cake, candles, a round of \"for he's a jolly good fellow\" and sparkling cider in the fancy glasses.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/05/my-little-trailblazer.html", "title": "\nMy Little Trailblazer\n"},
{"date": "March 15, 2007", "body": "\nStage Two of RDI is all about referencing, that is, helping a person to learn how to get non-verbal information from another person. I\u2019m sure it is actually more complicated than that but this is how I understand it. Just think of all the information that we pick up from other people\u2019s face and body language! There are the more obvious head shakes and nods, smiles and frowns, but also many more subtle forms of non-verbal communication that help each of us to navigate life. Oliver has to be taught to read another person, step-by-step. So first we started with smiles and nods that told him, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right!\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ve got it!\u201d or \u201cKeep going!\u201d etc. And now we are moving on to frowns and head shakes and the more complicated: watch my eyes and see what they are seeing. So throughout the day I am trying to set up opportunities of uncertainty for Oliver so that he will have to check in with me visually to see what he should be doing. \u201cYes, go forward.\u201d Or, \u201cNo, go back.\u201d  Or, \u201cYes, put it in here.\u201d Or, \u201cNo, put it over there.\u201d  For the most part he is getting it although that doesn\u2019t mean that he always wants to listen to what I have to say! I celebrate this too, by the way. I love how he now has learned to steal a glance at me to see my reaction to something before he does it \u2013 even if it is followed by some mischievousness!  And even more, I love how he is learning to look at me when he has done something that pleases him as if to say: \u201cHey Mom! Did you see that!\u201d We also tried another activity yesterday that I wasn\u2019t sure would work. I placed two cups on the table upside down and let Oliver see me place a piece of candy under one of them. I then moved the cups around a bit so that he could no longer be sure where the candy was. He had to look at me and follow my gaze to learn where to find the candy. Oliver and Sam both stood on a chair in front of the counter and took turns. Sam had no problem understanding the game and immediately looked at me to get the needed information. He is not yet two and got it right every time. The little stinker! Oliver, however, had a little difficulty understanding what I wanted from him. He immediately reached out for BOTH cups and seemed to be more interested in trying to get them to continue moving around on the counter. But after a minute or two he did come to understand that finding the candy was the object of the activity. The first two or three times I did everything but point to the right cup and shout, \u201cIt\u2019s under this one!\u201d But then he got it. During that short, simple activity he came to understand that he could learn information from following my gaze! Of course I\u2019m sure we will have to do it many times over and in many different contexts before it becomes second nature to him. But still! He is just so amazing to me!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/03/did-you-see-that.html", "title": "\nDid You See That?\n"},
{"date": "March 11, 2007", "body": "\nI am trying to keep with our little family routines as much as possible while Nik is away and RT is with his grandparents. Today, that meant an early morning hike with a stop at Costco on the way home. If the weather hadn't been so beautiful I might have thought of skipping the whole thing -- neither Sam or I have the constitution for cold weather hikes unless Nik is along to help us appreciate how \"envigorating\" it can be. A year ago I never would have contemplated doing this routine solo. I vividly remember taking one short hike alone with the kids, more of a walk in the woods really, and being so stressed out about managing both kids -- one of whom I HAD to carry and the other of whom I MIGHT have to carry. Just depending. And then there was the fear of what things might look like if Oliver just decided to take off. How could I chase after him with a babe in arms? But with Sam now so independent and Oliver finally starting to understand the Mommy Voice -- you know, that certain way a mother shouts \"Stop\" when there is danger present -- I am now positively bursting with confidence compared to a year ago. So off we went. And oh how I wish you could have seen us! Oliver was positively amazing. He would start to head down one trail and I would stop and say: \"I think I'll go this way.\" To this Oliver would respond by turning around in his tracks and joining us in the other direction. Later, I walked between Sam and Oliver and sung a simple made-up song about how we were all walking together. Up the hill. Down the hill. We're walking, walking, walking. Then, mid-sentence I would purposefully stop walking and singing. And wouldn't you know it but EVERY TIME I did that Oliver would stop, then turn around and look at me as if to say: \"Hey, why did you stop?\" I was positively glowing with pride. Even though he was a few steps ahead of me at times and the casual observer might not have been aware of how connected we were on this beautiful spring-like day, Oliver was showing me just how very much he was paying attention to me. And as the mother of a child for whom communication is not a strong point, let's just say that the look said it all. Compare this to the first RDI video that we submitted 8 weeks ago that shows Oliver hand in hand with Nik as they walked around a track. They walked together for some distance before Nik suddenly came to an unexpected halt. Oliver danced around, pulling himself out of Nik's orbit until  both of their arms were fully extended with the knot of their fingers in between. He looked at his feet, at the sky, at the grass, at everything but Nik. And Nik just waited, patiently at first but as the seconds dragged on he stood there anxiously clearing his throat. Finally, after quite some time, Oliver stole a glance in Nik's direction and then they were off again. When our consultant told us that we were ready for Stage Two, I have to admit that I was thrilled but also secretly doubtful. Had we really mastered what we needed to in Stage One? But this evening after the children fell asleep I reviewed the videos from that first week and was stunned by the difference these last 8 weeks have made. Actually, so far, they have made ALL the difference. So here we come Stage Two!!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/03/and-were-off.html", "title": "\nAnd We're Off. ...\n"},
{"date": "January 17, 2007", "body": "\nLast week an RDI consultant came to our city to work with us over a three day period. During this initial assessment period she asked me to engage Oliver in a series of activities that are designed to determine where he is developmentally with regard to RDI stages and objectives. The idea behind RDI is that there are certain \"Core Deficits\" in all people with ASD. For whatever reason, there are certain fundamental developmental building blocks that people with ASD don't learn naturally -- these are the core deficits -- and they are essential for learning how to relate to other people successfully and to thrive in other dynamic situations. By addressing each of the core deficits in the order in which the traits are known to develop in typical children, it is believed that one can develop the skills that were missed along the way. I could try to explain the theory in more detail but since I am new to this game I will leave it at that. If anyone is interested in learning more I would recommend the RDI website. So, the results of the assessment were quite what I had guessed. Oliver is starting out in Stage One and our first objective is to increase facial gazing. He has come a long, long way since we started doing RDI informally back in October. He is now so willing to join me for activities. I no longer have to chase him down to do the simplest things. Our games now last for minutes, not seconds. But I'm still doing all of the work to keep things going. If I stop a game in the middle, Oliver will simply walk away rather than trying to keep it going. But that will come. There were many things about the assessment that I expected. When activities were introduced I knew pretty much before we started if they would be successful or not. And usually I assumed they wouldn't be. But there was one very poignant moment for me. We had been playing together with a toy that Oliver found very engaging but it took two people to operate. After a certain amount of time the consultant asked me to stop playing and just sit there. I wasn't to speak or do anything unless directed to by Oliver. At this point I kind of held my breath. He really liked playing with that toy and the point of the activity was to see if he would try to initiate play with me. At first he kind of walked around, close to the toy, but not appearing to be taking any more interest in it. Then he picked it up and walked towards me. OK, I thought, You Go, Oliver! But instead of bringing it to me he just sat down with it on the bean bag chair opposite me. I felt my heart plummet. There he was, my own little boy, and he didn't even know how to engage me in something that I knew he really wanted. Six months ago I think something like that would have really broken my heart. Yes, it still wounded me but not mortally. The reason being that now I really have hope and believe that he will learn how to do these things one day. He is  delayed . But he  will  get there. The other good thing about the RDA was that I learned how to refine some of the things I had been doing so that they will be more effective. It was nice that our consultant actually travelled to us because we spent a lot of time working around the house, doing the kinds of things that we normally do together, and she gave a lot of feedback as to how we might modify or add to things we were already doing. Another nice perk is that the other mother in my neighborhood who began RDI with her son last month joined us for an hour one day and we both picked the brain of our poor consultant. This was nice because even though her son is on stage two, we both needed clarification on some of the same issues and now I think we can offer each other even more support. There are some other things that I have been thinking about since last week -- namely: how instructive it has been to watch myself interacting with Oliver on videotape. Also, why switching gears from crisis mode would be my New Year's resolution if I were to actually make resolutions. I don't because I can never manage to keep them. But I'm pretty good at keeping promises so that is my new promise to myself. Also, and finally, (and this has nothing to do with RDI but maybe with getting out of the Crisis Mode) Nik and I are  going out with friends on Friday night .   Yeah, you heard me right. Believe it or not it has been more than two years since we've been out together! But I'm a little worried that I won't know what to talk about. Small talk? Lighthearted conversation? It has been so long! So if you happen to read this before Friday night and would care to help me out with some conversation starters I'd be much obliged.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/01/about-rda.html", "title": "\nAbout the RDA\n"},
{"date": "March 10, 2007", "body": "\nI've got two questions turning around in my head tonight. Number one: Why does anyone hang wallpaper? Especially in a room like the bathroom where it is almost impossible to get it off behind the commode and the sink? And number two: What made me think that this, the week dear Nik is in China, would be the best time to tackle that downstairs bathroom? I'm not sure I know the answer to the first. Maybe it has something to do with eternal optimism. I like this pattern now so I'll probably like it even more 10 years from now. Or, by then I'll have sold this place and moved on up to something better. I'm also still scratching my head about the why now part. Maybe it is because Nik hates it when I start projects so by waiting for him to be out of town I won't have to gently put my hand under his chin when he comes home one evening and his jaw drops when he sees what I've done. But maybe it also has to do with not wanting to spend too much time without moving hands while he is away. Moving hands are a good remedy for a roaming mind, I've found. Consequently there are a lot of projects half-started in this house. Consequently my dear husband hates it when I start projects. But it really hasn't been as hard as I thought. The managing part anyway. Teeth still get brushed, bodies bathed and fed, morning muffins made and we've even been to Lowe's three times for various home improvement tools and every paint chip booklet they have. And the children are doing well enough, too. They are putting up with an occassionally grumpy mother and are all too happy to move the little blue, red and yellow card table in front of the tv for yet another meal. And forgive me, but just how many times can I serve my children pizza, pasta and grilled cheese sandwiches before child protective services comes? Oh, and we got some really celebratory news the very same night Nik left. Oliver has officially graduated to RDI stage two: referencing. The next afternoon we celebrated all together, my two boys and I, with a bottle of our finest sparkling apple cider served in the fancy wine glasses with the beaded stems. Then we listened to my new favorite CD and danced a jig. Literally. When I was little kid people used to tell us that any hole we were digging, if we kept at it long enough, would take us \"all the way to China.\" I haven't really thought of that in years but today I noticed that there is a still a pretty big hole in our back yard from where we dug out the clothes line pole that had been anchored by a big hunk of cement. It had probably been useful back in the days before the maple tree beside it got so large that hanging anything on the line became amusing to all the birds in the neighborhood. Anyway, that hole out in the back yard isn't much of a start, but if Nik were planning to be gone longer than ten days I might seriously start looking around for the shovel. In the meantime, anyone have any good ideas for removing wallpaper?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/03/two-questions.html", "title": "\nTwo Questions\n"},
{"date": "March 22, 2007", "body": "\nWe're like dogs at my house. We're like a little pack of puppies wriggling and squirming, jockeying to get the most comfortable position every night. I've re-instituted the family bed. I'm not getting any more hours of sleep each night, and I'm still oft-awakened, but I'm greeting each morning happier and more satisfied with the hours that preceded it. We have always practiced co-sleeping, but when Oliver was about 18 months old we finally (and with MUCH struggling) moved him to his own bed. First this was a mattress on the floor next to our mattress on the floor. Then it was his own bed on the floor of his own room down the hall. Then Sam came along and we never got around to moving him to his own bed and as I have gradually come to the conclusion that he will be my last baby I haven't been in a hurry to move him. I'm not yet ready to be independent. But bedtime had been kind of a hassle because our routine required me to lay down with each child in turn until he drifted off to sleep. This sometimes stretched  out to where I wasn't enjoying it anymore. So, in an effort to both shorten the routine and help Oliver and Sam bond a bit more, I began bringing them both to my bed for book reading. Then we turned out the light, sang a couple of songs and curled up around each other until both were sweetly breathing deeply into sleep. At that point I would extricate myself and watch as they turned and twisted around each other in the warm vacuum that I left. At first we carried Oliver to his own bed down the hall. But then Nik was away and I just kept him there with me and the three of us made our way towards morning every night. Together. And I started to really look forward to going to sleep each night. And Oliver, who can be quite a non-sleeper, has been sleeping solidly almost every single night. Maybe he is as comforted by our little nest as I am. Or maybe that is just how things will go for now. And later they will go differently. And that is the beauty of learning that the best mothering is by instinct. For me this means doing what feels right regardless of what the books say, what the experts opine or how I imagine my mother might react. So for right now, anyway, we're sleeping like dogs in our little green house. It's liberating.

I've got a million lists all over the place and even though I'm crossing things off like crazy I probably won't finish everything when I need to. Ah well! There's nothing to do but sigh and carry on. So, in keeping with my holiday list-making mania, I am going to throw a bunch of things into one here and call it a post! 1. I did ALL of my shopping this year on-line and I may never go back to shopping in an actual store again. First of all, think of the emotional energy I saved!! Also, I probably saved a bundle on those incidental items that I DIDN'T buy. Plus, it's been like Christmas all month for me as the packages arrive at my doorstep and I open the box to discover what is inside.  2. My children still aren't sleeping. I say children because on the few nights over the last two weeks when Oliver has actually made it through the night, Sammy has woken and demanded \"Milk!\" over and over again until I think I'm going to scream. I'm trying to night wean him (he's almost two for pete's sake!) but sometimes I'm weak because I just so desparately want to go back to sleep and now it has evolved into a battle of wills. We have stopped giving Oliver both the Melatonin and the Benedryl altogether. Neither one seemed to have any effect so why bother? 3. We are making the LONG drive to NJ tomorrow for our appointment with the HANDLE Institute on Friday.  I am looking forward to the appointment -- not the drive -- and the two nights we will spend in the hotel. I know that sounds funny but we REALLY don't get out that much. 4. Last night I was giving the kids a bath and RT was helping. At one point he turned to me and said: \"Do autistic kids have trouble making eye contact?\" I replied that it was definately a characteristic of many people with autism. Then he said: \"Well, Oliver doesn't seem to have that problem.\" And it is true that Oliver is doing really well in that department since we started RDI. I try not to draw too many of those conclusions because a lot of times I think I see what I WANT to see. But I haven't talked about RDI with RT or with Oliver's regular therapists and everyday lately when I check their daily notes I am thrilled to read comments like: \"Great eye contact today!\" 5. One thing about the Christmas season that I love and hate is Frosty the Snowman. The video, I mean. You see, Oliver LOVES to watch Frosty. A couple of years ago, before I knew what echolalia was, I thought it was so cute that he went around the house repeating lines from the video. And watching him act out certain scenes over and over again. Well, Oliver still gets so much joy out of watching the video that I don't mind letting him watch it -- sometimes even twice a day! But now - twelve days into December -- we're all developing a bit of echolalia. Two nights ago when Sam fell out of bed I rushed to help him saying: \"Oh Sammy, did you fall down?\" and he said: \"No money! No Ticket!\" And Nik, whose first language is NOT English, has developed his own peculiar brand of echolalia and has turned \"Look at Frosty Go!\" into \"Let That Frosty Go!\"  Of course this is the same guy that went around the house the other night singing: \"I shot the Frosty! But I did not shoot the Santa Claus!\" There's no telling where this will all lead with another two and a half weeks to go in December.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/12/making-my-list-checking-it-zillion.html", "title": "\nMaking my List; Checking it A Zillion Times. ...\n"},
{"date": "January 15, 2007", "body": "\nOK, I've just finished a bowl of vanilla ice cream  and  a bar of Hersey's Special Dark chocolate and I'm still staring at a nearly blank screen. The reason being that there has just been so much going on that I don't know where to begin. The ice cream and then the chocolate bar were just sort of time fillers while I waited for inspiration about how to focus. I still don't feel inspired and I don't dare head towards the kitchen again so I suppose I ought to just begin. We're one month into our HANDLE program and I am still cautiously optimistic that the subtle shifts I've started to see will gel into something of lasting impact. As I mentioned in a previous post, we are having many, many nights of good sleep. Only three times since we began implementing the program has Oliver awakened in the night. But in the past Oliver has cycled between periods of good sleep and not-so-good sleep, so I am hesitant to fully attribute this to the new regimen. But there are other things. The most noticeable to me is that Oliver seems to be getting much better at regulating his own energy. Previously if I had to describe Oliver's energy to you I would have likened it to a drop of water the moment it hits a panful of very hot oil. Skittering, skating, exploding across the surface. Never resting and going in all directions at once. But lately that has changed. A few times I have even caught him resting on the sofa in the afternoons and wondered if he might actually nap. He also seems a bit more focused in all of his activities. So how do I explain this? I'm not sure, really. But I imagine that as we teach him how to organize the input he is receiving through all of his senses he has to spend less energy trying to control and/or block out sensory experiences. He can  afford  to rest a little. Sometimes I look at the exercises that were recommened for Oliver and they seem so simple. I wonder how they could possibly have any profound impact. But then I go back and re-read parts of Judith Bluestone's book and my confidence is restored. The way she describes the interaction between our environment and our senses, our nervous systems and our brains just makes sense to me. If anyone is interested but hasn't yet read the book: \"The Fabric of Autism\" there is a radio series on Autism One radio that started in December. The second installment was on January 11th. Both of them are worth listening to. The second big thing in our little world is that we officially began our RDI program last week. The consultant we hired came to work with us for three days. Three  exhausting  days. Three marevelous days! But now that I think of it there is so much I want to say about the experience that I suppose that really deserves a post of its own. Between the HANDLE program and beginning RDI, I really haven't felt so hopeful, so optimistic, so on the right track as I do starting off this new year.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/01/handle-with-care.html", "title": "\nHANDLE With Care\n"},
{"date": "March 24, 2007", "body": "\nThis time of year is a bit melancholy for me. In a way, March marks one of the most wonderful events of my life: Sam was born two years ago this week. But it was in the days following Sam's birth that I opened my eyes and saw, really  saw , Oliver. I had wondered before that time about his speech -- it was not developing as I thought it should. We were speaking two languages at home and I tried to reassure myself that it was just taking him some time to sort it all out. There had been a time after Oliver turned two when I asked a lot of people about language development in bi-lingual children. I think I even did some Internet searching on the topic but I don't remember ever feeling either relieved or more concerned. Still, at that point life was, overall, pretty good and somehow I let go of my concerns and focused on other things. I was really enjoying my pregnancy, for one. I hadn't been sick a single day the second time around and I was excited that I had finally committed to giving birth at home, as I had wanted to do with Oliver. I was also pretty busy at work organizing a rather large conference that was planned for mid-February. So the long and the short of it is that when I reflect back on this period of time, two years ago, I feel like I failed Oliver. Because there were other things I could have picked up on. Like the fact that play dates never really worked out because Oliver spent the whole time playing by himself as far away from the other children as he could get. And he absolutely could not be convinced to share a toy or to take turns. How much better would it have been for him if I hadn't been so self-absorbed and had followed my instincts? We'll never know, I guess. I will never forget my great disappointment when Oliver returned from my mother's house soon after Sam was born. We were all crowded into my bedroom cooing at the baby and Oliver wouldn't even look at him. I had wondered before I gave birth if he really understood the whole concept -- that there would be a new little person in our house. I read all the books to him I could find and took him around to meet every new baby I knew. But I wasn't prepared for this total and utter lack of interest in  (awareness of?) his new brother. Oh well, I tried to console myself, it is just his way of dealing with a bit of jealousy. Honestly though, he didn't seem all that jealous. It wasn't as if he were competing for my attention. That I would have understood. Nik went back to work soon after Sam was born and I was left with my two small people. I had really looked forward to this time during my pregnancy. How wonderful, I thought, to get to spend all this extra time with Oliver before returning to work. It wasn't long though -- two days? Three? A week? -- before I really  saw  Oliver for the first time in months. I spent one whole day just watching him. There was a toy cupboard that my grandfather had made my mother when she was a child and Oliver had recently inherited it. The only thing Oliver wanted to do, it seemed, was climb this thing. It was sitting in front of the window and I was terrified that he would get entangled in the cord for the blind, fall and strangle himself. Every day I told him ten, fifteen, fifty times to get down. He ignored me and I pulled him down. Over and over again. I tried explaining. I tried yelling. I probably even tried spanking him, which I don't believe in but I was becoming infuriated. Nothing seemed to phase him. He didn't listen or care. When Nik got home that afternoon I started to tell him what I was seeing and, as so many other people had done half a year previously with the language thing, he told me I was over-reacting. I was judging him too harshly, comparing him to other children. Everyone develops at their own pace, he told me. I wanted to believe what he was saying but then I started listing all the things that had been troubling me. Not only was he not talking much anymore but he used to know all his colors and the shapes and some letters and could name all sorts of vehicles but I didn't even hear those words anymore. \"How can I teach him things if I don't even know what he knows\", I asked. Plus I couldn't tell if he was hungry or thirsty or cold. I just had to guess at those things. I couldn't take him to the park anymore because I spent the whole time chasing him down and dragging him back to the children's area. And, I pointed out that he just completely ignored us most of the time. I was growing fairly upset at that point and standing over Oliver as he piled block on top of block, with Sam in my arms, I started yelling his name. Actually, I screamed until my throat hurt. I was about two feet from his head and he never once looked up from his blocks. He was two and a half. A friend who has a daughter a year older than Oliver had told me some time previously that speech language services through the school district were free. She was concerned about her daughter's speech and so had taken her in for an evaluation. This, I suggested to Nik that day, might be just the thing for us to do. Somebody who knew something about language development would hang out with Oliver and then they would tell us that he was just taking an extra long time to sort things out but that in the end he would benefit from knowing two languages. We just needed to be more patient. Nik agreed and I called the next day.  That phone call set in motion a whole series of evaluations that went on for a couple of months. I sort of knew after the first one at the school that we were talking about something a bit more serious than I had imagined. But still it hit me like a punch in the stomach when the classroom aide in the trailer where I had taken him for observation casually said to me: \"I'll bet it's autism.\" When I left there I dropped Oliver off at my mother's house, returned to work, googled autism and sat staring at my computer screen for the rest of the day in disbelief. The utterly dismal picture of autism that I saw before me bore no relation to my beautiful, joyful Oliver. She was wrong, of course. And yet. ... I couldn't deny that the more I read the more things about him were starting to come into focus. We've come so far since that time two years ago. It seems like a lifetime ago but at the same time still very fresh. It took Oliver more than 7 months to acknowledge Sam. And by that I mean even look in his direction. Today he tolerates him. But Sam is very persistent and adores both of his brothers. And he always puts Oliver first. If I give Sam a cookie he also demands a second one and then races to give it to his older brother. If I tell him we are going to the store or the park he always says: \"And Oliver, too!\"  I often wish that the two of them had a more traditional sibling relationship. I really want that for Sam. But I can see around the corner and I know that there is a special power in their relationship and I will always be so glad that they have each other in their lives.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/03/melancholy-march.html", "title": "\nMelancholy March\n"},
{"date": "May 20, 2007", "body": "\nI haven't been writing much lately. I'm really struggling. I know this will pass but man it really sucks. I've often read that other moms of special needs kids say they become better people because of the challenges that they face with their children. This isn't true for me although I wish it were. Being Oliver's mom makes me  want  to be a better person. But that isn't the same thing, is it? Being Oliver's mom just seems to magnify my short-comings. It shows me where I need to make improvements to BE a better person but it doesn't make me any more  able  to make those changes. I often find it ironic that the one critical trait that is so important for being a good mother to Oliver -- patience -- is the one thing that I most need in greater reserves. Oliver is doing so incredibly well these days and I've said before that I think we are on the right track for him and for our family. I still feel that way. But the thing about RDI is that in order to progress, Oliver needs to be kept right at the edge of his competency. And he needs to have just the right degree of challenge and motivation. So when we start something new it is a delicate balance -- I want him to be challenged and successful -- but if I don't get it right there is a high degree of frustration for everyone.  I haven't been getting it right.  And the more I don't get it right the more effort it takes for me to want to try again. But the very worst part is that I know this is exactly how Oliver must feel everytime I don't get it right. It is a vicious circle. Not to end on a completely down note, though: we went for another hike today to the very same place I described in my last post. I took the camera this time and got lots of great pictures. Now if I can only figure out how to download them I will try to post a few. I think  I have about 270 pictures on the camera since we bought it in December though so it may take me some time to wade through them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/05/circle-time.html", "title": "\nCircle Time\n"},
{"date": "December 19, 2006", "body": "\nEight hours in the car is a lot longer than it used to be! Our trip to New Jersey was a whirlwind that I am still trying to process but other than the long ride in car it was all good. Oliver and Sam were  a-maz-ing  on the ride. Seriously, they did better than I did. I kept whining about how long it was taking. How my legs were falling asleep. How I thought it was only going to take five or six hours. How stressed out I was because you, Nik, drive too close to the next lane. Or because I can see the speedometer and we really don't need to be going that fast! Yeech. How did I get this way?? BUT, our appointment with Judith Bluestone was very interesting. Here's the thing though: I have to kind of suspend my in-grained, culturally-induced belief in the medical model of health, which as we all know has it's problems when it comes to giving us an understanding of something as complex as autism. So that shouldn't be hard, right? I mean this is coming from someone who gave birth at home, far from the reaches of the medical profession. And also from someone who was once  \"healed\"  by a kind of \"medicine woman.\" And from someone who keeps a Worry Monkey on her desk. But still, for some reason, I find it difficult to put traditional practices on the same playing field as western medicine. And the HANDLE approach is very much a mixture of many traditional approaches including homeopathy, reflexology and massage. All of them are explained in terms of what we know about the central nervous system and the brain. And all of the recommended exercises aim to get at the causes underlying behaviors. They aim to organize the input that the nervous system and the brain are receiving. So we now have a list of about 15 different activities, including face tapping and skull tapping, that we do throughout the day in an attempt to help regulate and organize the way Oliver's system deals with various sensory input. I don't know if it is working but it isn't hurting. And here is this: Oliver has slept through the night every night since we started. And once, when he woke at 4am I was resigned to a very early morning until I thought: wait, how about those massages? And I did them. And he fell asleep again within 15 minutes and slept until 8:45 when I finally woke him. As I say, I am still trying to process it all, but overall I am very optimistic about how this program will work for Oliver. It's a funny world we live in, we know that buildings can make us sick and people who laugh more live longer. So who's to say what good a little face tapping can do?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/12/whos-to-say.html", "title": "\nWho's to Say?\n"},
{"date": "December 02, 2006", "body": "\nLast Sunday I took Oliver to the grocery store with me as usual and he did fantastic. Until we got to the checkout. We went later in the day than usual and it was really busy and when I tried to get him to help me put the items on the conveyor belt he started to get upset. I was surprised because I thought we had worked through this about a year ago when we made many, many trips to the store for just one thing so that he could quickly see that he always got the item back after we paid for it. So, surprised as I was, I didn't persist in getting him to help me. I switched modes entirely to let's just get this done quickly and get out of here. I switched into emergency mode. But it didn't matter because Oliver also went into full melt-down mode. I could see that people were trying not to look at us. And who knows what was going through the mind of the cashier and the bagger as I threw my credit card at them from where I kneeled on the floor next to Oliver.  But when Oliver got up and we both walked out together, I made sure to tell him, loudly, how proud I was of him. Later in the week Oliver twice went into the bathroom and used it. On his own. Without prompting. We celebrated with cake and ice cream. Then, on Wednesday, we coincidentally arrived at the park at the same moment as a friend and her children. My friend has a son Oliver's age on the spectrum and I was so happy to run into her because it had been ages since we had time to talk. But watching her son talk and try to play with Oliver and try to get my attention was hard. For the rest of the evening a comment made by one of Oliver's therapists -- about how low-functioning he was -- became an uninvited sound track in my head. Then I discovered that another mother I know has hired the same RDI consultant to work with her. We talked on the phone for 40 minutes and our mutual excitement and optimism bouyed me. An ally. We're on different ships but in the same deep, dark water. There is no way to describe how reassuring that is. I often wonder how different my parenting experience is from that of others. I try really hard not to blame everything on the autism. Parenting is just hard. Period. And maybe some of it is MY neurological make up. Maybe the highs of my ups and the lows of my downs are such as they are because of the way I'M wired. I don't guess I'll ever know. But as I look back over my week -- over my year -- I have to wonder if I will ever get back to an even keel.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/12/just-medicate-me-please.html", "title": "\nJust Medicate Me, Please!\n"},

So, to pass the time and take some of the pressure off I've been telling him (and myself) every silly joke I can think of. It helps I think. I've been paying very close attention to my boy during those hours and, I could be wrong, but it seems as though he doesn't  want  to sleep.  It looks as though he is struggling to keep his eyes open. Is he afraid to sleep? Is he having nightmares that wake him?

{"date": "November 03, 2006", "body": "\nDo you know how hard it is to change your whole manner of communication? Well, it is hard. At least for me.  Our first appointment date with an RDI consultant isn't until January and so I have been reading everything I can get my hands on and trying to learn as best I can how to incorporate RDI strategies into our everyday life. The first thing on my RDI to-do list is to reduce the verbal clutter through which Oliver has to navigate. I'm talking less so that there is less to process. Part of this exercise of talking less means that I am concentrating more on using non-verbal communication. This is something I was skeptical of at first. One of the things that is supposed to be true of kids on the spectrum is that they don't pick up things from the environment in quite the same way as typical kids. So would he even notice my gestures, faces and posture? But I gave it a shot and tried to channel a paris street mime as much as possible. To help I started doing completely ridiculous things at random times throughout the day so that he wanted to keep checking out what I was up to. For example I might work up to a big, loud, messy sneeze. Or I might put Oliver's underwear on my head instead of my hat. Neither Sam or Oliver appear to know what to think these days. And thirdly, I am concentrating on speech actions that don't require a response from him. I comment. I wonder aloud. I exclaim. And only when necessary do I direct him to do something. This is the hardest thing for me. I tend to use a lot of rhetorical questions when I speak -- especially, it turns out, when I speak to Oliver. I wasn't aware of that until I started paying attention. The rule of thumb is 80% declarative; 20% imperative. I think I had it inverted. So about 100 times a day I find myself slipping up.  Especially since the verbal behavior program is structured so that we ARE supposed to elicit responses from him. (Which is a real conflict and one that I will have to work out before too long). Oliver's response to all this was immediate and, well, amazing. He has seemed much more engaged. He is looking at me longer and more often. He seeks me out to play silly little non-verbal games that we've invented. We are connecting again. Occassionally over the last year I have had epiphanies or insights into the human condition, or MY condition, or motherhood, or whatever  -- that have profoundly impacted me. Beginning RDI with Oliver has opened a window for me on my parenting style over that last year since Oliver's diagnosis. Simply by looking at how I structure my language has shown me how much I demand of him. And not just on a day-to-day basis, but minute-by-minute. In a past post I noted how I have made a real committment to uping the fun ante at our house. RDI certainly seems to dovetail nicely with that goal.  In conclusion I will leave you with this thought: if you try any of these tricks at home don't forget that you are wearing underwear on you head when the doorbell rings.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/11/getting-started.html", "title": "\nGetting Started\n"},
{"date": "November 26, 2006", "body": "\nAs I mentioned in a response to a comment by Mom-NOS yesterday, I am just chugging along, reading what I can and experimenting with what I  think  is the theoretical framework of RDI, which is organized into stages. One stage should be mastered before moving on to the next. But a lot of it seems to overlap to me. So, while I am excited about the prospect of referencing, we are mostly just working on setting up non-verbal communication events, which probably lays some groundwork for referencing. ... And trust me, we have a lot to work on. Using non-verbal communication with Oliver usually means that I have to be sitting right next to him. Maybe even nose to nose. Or I have to make some funny noise or wild motions to get his attention from a few feet away. I've been working on this part of it for a couple of weeks now and already have noticed some slow, small changes in just his willingness to pay attention to me. Along with the non-verbal communication, I've been trying to find all sorts of ways for Oliver and I to do things, accomplish things, together. I've been trying to incorporate Oliver and RDI into little things that happen throughout the day. Some of them are successful and some aren't. The key, I've found, is to be less focused on an end-goal and more on doing things -- however small -- together. Here are a couple of things that we've been doing: (and again, these may not be done the right way -- I'm just going on instinct until we start with the consultant in January). But even if it isn't good RDI, it feels like good parenting, so no harm no foul. Loading the dishes in the dishwasher . After Oliver is finished eating his lunch or dinner, he and I both take an item from the table and \"race\" with it to the dishwasher. Oliver normally wins the race, but then I open the door to the dishwasher and we each load our item inside. Getting out of the car . Before opening Oliver's car door I usually mash my face into the window until he looks at me -- then we go nose to nose for a minute. I've noticed that when I open the door Oliver sometimes pulls it closed again ( I think because he likes being in the car so much and really doesn't want to get out). So now I've made a game of it and we play a kind of tug-o-war with the door. Going down the slide . We went to the kid's castle today and because of the warm weather there were a ton of kids there. Well, Oliver's favorite activity at the castle these days is throwing tiny pebbles down the largest spiral slide. And it takes him for-ev-er! With a line of kids behind him this can be problematic. After some impatient looks from other kids and their parents, I tried to strategize how to get him to skip the pebbles part. So what I did was join him on the slide. I sat at the top with him between my knees and ever so slowly inched down the top of the slide, gripping him tightly and telling him how scared I was. When we were hovering just at the point where gravity would soon pull us down the slide, Oliver inevitably lurched forward putting us in motion. Then we would both sprint up through the castle to do it again. After I started doing this with him he didn't try to grab another handful of stones the entire time. And once, as he sprinted towards the castle I pretended that I needed help to get up from the slide and he actually stopped, turned around, came back and got me! That's when I knew I was doing something right. Grocery shopping . This has been pretty successful for us. Oliver hangs onto the outside of the cart and when I find something that we need he gets it and throws it in (I've had to be cautious though when requestion items in glass jars!). When we find an isle that is empty of people I drive the cart like a mad-woman, starting and stopping quickly so that he has to pay attention to what I'm doing or he will fall off. Then when we get to the register he helps me put everything on the conveyor belt. Fixing a bagel . Oliver helped me cut the bagel then he put it in the toaster. When it was done we took turns spreading butter.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/11/just-chugging-along.html", "title": "\nJust Chugging Along\n"},
{"date": "July 11, 2006", "body": "\n\"No, no, no, no!\" is a favorite remark of Oliver's. And sometimes it really gets on my nerves. Like when I know he has to pee and I give him the count-down until the potty and still he tries to get out of going. First he tries to slip from my grasp as I reach out to direct him to the bathroom and then it's all: \"No, no, no, no!\" So I find myself saying: \"Oliver, just say 'YES'! Say 'YES' to life!!\" I feel very Norman Vincent Peale when I say it but sometimes I really do think 'yes' is the key to life. And what I wouldn't give to hear that little word from my little man. Saying \"YES\" to life is something I thought I had learned throughout my twenties. This was absolutely necessary, by the way, because there was a time when I was a real mess: a complete bundle of stress and anxiety. Luckily though I learned a thing or two and now I also have Nik who is my best role-model. His natural ability to accept new challenges, changes and to just generally go with the flow and have fun was one of the things that attacted me to him most. So I'm well into my thirties now and thought I had a pretty good handle on this business of life. But lately I'm wondering if I have closed myself off too much from 'YES' and have retreated to a place where fear of the unknown rules the roost. I'm afraid of a lot of things these days. I'm afraid that I'm not doing right by Oliver. That I'm not doing enough or the right things or enough of the right things. I'm afraid that I'm not doing everything I can to help Oliver have a happy rest of his life. I'm afraid of how the rest of the world will treat him when he is eventually thrust from our protective arms. And it is too much of looking questioningly, fearfully, into the future that gets in the way of being fully in the now, in this moment and saying 'YES' to what it has to offer. Of letting be, of going with the flow, of having fun. Here is a real concrete example. Oliver has a few, shall we say, favorite activities that bug the heck out of me. He likes to walk backwards with his eyes closed over the same path in the back yard. He also likes to run while vigorously shaking his head from side to side. And then there is this loud buddhist-monk-like chanting thing that he does frequently throughout the day (and night -- but that is another story). Well, I know that each of these things is useful somehow to Oliver. They provide comfort or help to ground him somehow. Or maybe he just enjoys the way they make him feel. But these are also the very things that cause other children and adults to stop what they are doing and stare.  For people to take a second, reappraising, diminishing look at my Oliver. They are things that will  serve to isolate him further in the future. And so I find myself shushing and interrupting and redirecting -- so much so that now the \"No, no, no, no!\" is coming from me. Acceptance and patience are two parts to saying \"Yes!\" to the here and now, neither one of which are particular talents of mine. I think this each night when I sit looking at Oliver's sleeping self and tell myself that I have to do better.  Because I'm fairly certain that accepting things about Oliver that I find annoying or that I don't understand and instead patiently helping him to acquire the tools he needs to feel secure and to succeed is the right way ahead. But it is hard hard hard for me to remember this sometimes when all I want him to do is stop making that noise because I said so and I'm his mother and I already gently distracted him from it a million times over the past four hours. Acceptance and patience are two things that Oliver needs from me -- from his family, from all of us. But giving these things to him demands that I stretch and push against myself constantly, all day long. It is hard work this business of changing, of bending, of flexing. But why shouldn't I have some of the hard work? Flexing, bending, changing: isn't this what we demand from Oliver all day every day? We're a team, Oliver and I and Nik and Sam and R.T.  And all I can hope for is that each of us rises to these challenges that we never expected to face. That we each say \"YES!\" and embrace fully what is before us today without undue regard for the unknowable future. And that, my friends, is my challenge to each of you. May you say \"Yes\" to the challenges before you today, accept what might be hard or scary or uncomfortable, and go forth with your own little team into the bright future.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/07/opening-myself-to-yes.html", "title": "\nOpening myself to Yes\n"},
{"date": "November 06, 2006", "body": "\nMaking connections. That's what we've been doing with even the limited RDI time we've been using RDI methods with Oliver. I can see it in the way he engages with me when we play; when we are laying side-by-side and he takes my face in his hands and searches my face with his eyes, eager to see all that is there. And I can feel it when he is the one to hold our embrace for a second longer. I wanted to reply to the couple of people who posted questions about RDI after my last entry but I don't necessarily think I'm the best person to ask. We just started and we haven't yet had any training. But for those who want more information about RDI and how to get started or want to find additional resources I would read  this  and  this . I would read every single entry of  this blog . And I would visit the  RDI website  and register as member which allows you access to non-public documents. I would also say that if you are interested you should read a little bit so that you have a pretty good understanding of the approach and then just call a consultant.  And talk to that person about your unique situation. And ask for the name of someone who might have a child similar to yours that you could also talk to. I wish I had looked into RDI six months ago when I first read about it. But at the time I thought it was too complicated and too costly. Now I don't think either impression is terribly accurate. It isn't any more or less complicated than ABA for instance and it feels much more natural to me. Also, I don't think it is particularly THAT expensive. Yes, it is more than nothing; but certainly not as much as a 20 hour/week ABA program either (at least not where we live). OK, I got a little off the track there. I wanted to outline a couple of wildly successful activities that we've been doing that have increased Oliver's willingness to share in the excitement of what is about to happen by exchanging looks with me. The first is a game that is fun for all of my boys. RT goes into a bedroom at either end of the hallway, turns out the lights and hides himself. I take Oliver and Sam each by the hand and together we walk slowly down the hallway with me making nervous, excited noises as we get closer to the door. Then, just before we reach the doorway I stop and look at Oliver with my eyes wide in anticipation. I continue to hold Oliver's hand until he looks at me (which doesn't take long). At this point he is usually so beside himself with anticipation that he almost climbs on top of me. Then I say \"Go!\" and he and Sam run into the bedroom and after a few seconds RT pops out of some corner and they all collapse in shrieks of real and feigned terror. Another game that we like to play is that I sit close by to Oliver and say with great anticipation: \"I'm going to. ...\" then I pause to exaggerate the anticipation and take the time to share excited looks with Oliver as he waits to see what will happen. Then I end with sometime like \". ... tickle you!\" or \". ... eat your toes!\" or \". ... kiss you all over!\" or whatever. The thing about RDI's concept of facial gazing that I like so much is that the aim of eye contact then becomes helping the child to learn to read someone else's expression -- to get meaning from it and to  share  information between two people. It's about making connections. Pure and simple.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thismom.com/", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/i-do-declare.html", "http://jacobs-journey.blogspot.com/", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/11/making-connections.html", "title": "\nMaking Connections\n"},

All through the winter and spring months we watched a movie each week or ten days and I felt like I was finally coming out of the cultural underground. I even entertained the idea of putting episodes from the series Sex in the City, which I have never seen, in my queue just so I would get the cultural references. Although when it comes to TV I'm so far behind -- I haven't watched it since 1991 -- that I doubt I should even  think  about trying to catch up. But movies! I used to love watching movies. But that was before children. And most especially it was before I seriously considered each night if flossing was really worth the extra minute or two of sleep that I would sacrifice. We are in the throes of some serious sleep issues at our house at the moment. Oliver goes off to sleep each night only to wake a few hours later and then stays awake for the rest of the night, averaging about 3-4  hours of sleep per night. When this happens I typically go and make a bed on his floor and the two of us lay awake, together, for as long as it takes. I can't bring myself to leave him on his own. The night is so long. All this means that I've passed by the red netflix envelope on the front hall table week after week after week without the desire to find the time in my day to watch it. Besides strategizing how to get more sleep there are newspapers and books to be read, clothes to fold and put away, bathrooms to clean, and oh, yeah, conversations with my husband are nice, too. So last night I told Nik that I was planning to cancel Netflix. We've already spent $30 on  City of God  and at this rate it isn't a bargain. But then something took hold of me and I suddenly felt the overwhelming desire for subtitles. If I can't eek out 2 hours of escapism in my week then I'm in worse shape than I thought.  Two hours later I was emotionally exhausted and thankful that I only had some minor sleep issues to deal with. With the sights and sounds of Rio still fresh in my mind I had trouble drifting off to sleep. But as I did a line from one of my favorite movies, \" My Life as a Dog  ,\" recurred to me. Ingemar, the main character, sometimes had it rough, but not as bad as Laika - the russian dog sent into space. And he was often heard to say: \"It's good to have things to compare to.\" So for now anyway, Netflix stays.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.miramax.com/cityofgod/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089606/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/11/night-off.html", "title": "\nA Night Off\n"},

{"date": "September 01, 2006", "body": "\nYesterday I had five phone conversations with mothers of children who have autism. All but one of them have a child between 3 and 4 who has been diagnosed over the course of the last year. Interestingly, all of us also have younger children. Only one of them has been at this longer than I have and she was the one who was there for me, the one who has walked in my shoes. It felt good to talk to them. To listen. To cry a little; laugh a little.   I went to the public library yesterday and asked if they had a space available where we could all meet for an hour once a week, together with our children. There is a room that is normally used for story hour that is full of toys that would be just perfect. \"My son has autism,\" I began, \"and so regular story hours and play times don't really work for us.\" Even though I've been at this more than a year now I still find it hard to get the first part of the sentence out without feeling the sting of tears threatening. But the librarian I spoke with was very kind and thought it was a wonderful idea. It turns out that her husband also does some music therapy at a local school for the deaf and blind. She thought he might be convinced to put something together for our kids. So I called each of the mothers and asked them if they would be willing to come and build a little community with me. I need the support, but I also need to  give  a little .  They were enthusiastic and welcomed the idea. Now I am just waiting to hear back from the library. And, so I don't let this post conclude without a little bit about Oliver: he really is a monkey!! The past 4 days have been incredible. If he had suction cups on his feet he would literally climb the walls. I've been summoned to other rooms of the house by loud crashes only to find Oliver at the highest point around. The tops of closets, on top of the fridge, on top of book cases, on the desks. ... I've caught him trying to climb the window frames by standing on the back of the couch and gripping the top of the moulding or by standing on the bottom ledge and holding onto the top of the window looking for a toe hold. ... We had to leave K-Mart because I couldn't keep him from climbing the shelves. And everytime I haul him down from somewhere he says: \"I want to climb!!! I want to climb!!!\" I am frankly at my wits end. It is a little bit funny but I do recognize the danger as well. I'm not so worried about him falling as I am about him knocking something heavy on top of either himself or Sammy. And wouldn't you know that Sam has to try everything that Oliver does so the next thing you know I'm going to have two monkeys at the top of the closet!!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/09/building-community.html", "title": "\nBuilding a Community\n"},
{"date": "July 13, 2006", "body": "\n\"So will Oliver be able to stay with you?\" The question was so far from anything I had ever thought about that it took me a second to realize what she was talking about. \"Um. Yeah. I mean I can't imagine him being anywhere else.\" But she hadn't yet met Oliver, that would come the next day.  And the question was an honest one and based on what she knew about autism.  I was helping to host her family while they stayed in our town, her husband working on a project with my colleagues. Their two girls were exactly the same age as my two boys and so when I found out they would be accompanying him I offered to show them around, share some toys and for our kids to play together. We exchanged e-mails prior to the visit and, although I rarely talk about Oliver's autism to those whom I don't know well, I found myself typing out the words: \"my son has autism.\" Just like that. No further explanation. Her reply surprised me. She told me that her brother, who died 4 years earlier, also had autism. He had other health issues that made it difficult for them to keep him at home and so, at the age of seven, he went to live in an institution. In another country. There was a time in my life when I would have felt that I could pass judgement on those two points. That time has certainly passed. When we met at the tea shop that morning my children were at home and I spent the hour trading stories and secrets and jokes with her young one who is Oliver's same exact age. I couldn't take my eyes from her. I threw all my energies into not thinking about how I wished to know my own child in the same way. The next day we met at a beautiful park with hiking trails and a lake where we go often to walk and feed the ducks. We took a picnic lunch and the children and sat on a blanket under a shade tree eating grilled cheese sandwhiches. I felt relaxed in her company because I knew she understood and because I knew she wouldn't pass judgement and because I knew she could see how beautiful he is. And when she said: \"You're doing a really good job with him.\" I knew she meant that too. I cautiously asked her about Ben, the brother who had died. He didn't talk much and couldn't tell them exactly what was wrong when he began to feel the pain. He was admitted to the hospital too late and by the time they found the cause it had already killed him. He loved to swim. He loved to sit in a room full of moving lights. She wished she had known him better. As she spoke she couldn't take her eyes from Oliver. And then it was too hard for her to talk about anymore. Our conversation lapsed as we sat there, two near strangers in silent understanding. I will never forget Ben, though I never met him. And I will never forget that afternoon by the lake.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/07/ben.html", "title": "\nBen\n"},
{"date": "September 07, 2006", "body": "\nEver since Oliver was born I've called him my Sunshine Boy because that's what he is: bright and golden. And since he was a baby I've often sung to him the song You Are My Sunshine. Sometimes when he was an infant, one who took hours and hours to fall asleep, I'd amuse myself by singing it using a thousand different voices or I'd make up crazy verses to follow the first. So tonight, on the eve of my 37th birthday, I got the best present I've ever been given when Oliver sang the song right along with me. Since we started his verbal behavior program I have made more of a habit of modeling language and of stopping mid-sentence, trying to encourage Oliver to fill in the blanks. And the thing is, I'm astounded by how much Oliver knows. I've never worried about Oliver's intellect, really, but I could never be quite sure how much he was absorbing. Oliver used to be able to name all of the shapes and the colors and his body parts. And then, gradually he stopped. So it was hard for me to know what he still knew and what, if anything, he was learning. I mean, I know for sure that he doesn't pick up things from the environment the way other kids do. And he seems to struggle with tasks that require him to do things -- like identify shapes for instance -- that he could once do easily. So tonight, after he nearly flooded the bathroom durning bath time by spitting gallons of water over the edge and me not really caring because I had a beer in one hand and was tryng to pull all of the wallpaper off the walls before Nik came up the stairs and caught me, we both climbed into his bear bed for our nighttime routine. First, I opened our well-worn copy of The Three Bears. Reading to Oliver has become a challenge because he always wants to turn the pages quickly until he gets to that certain page that captures his imagination. But I insist on going through the motions of the book anyway. Tonight I did all of this the same but wouldn't you know it, Oliver started saying the words right along with me. \"Once upon a time\" \"Goldilocks peeked in the window.\" \"She went inside.\" \"She ate it all up.\" \"It broke all to bits.\" \"It was too hard.\" \"The bears were hungry.\" I started slowing down a bit as I realized what was going on and Oliver was less persistent in his efforts to get me to turn the page. And then, we were done and he had told the story right along with me. I closed the book and told him how proud I was of his talking and that he was my wonderful sunshine boy. Then I started singing to him and he just joined right in. We sang together for the very first time and my heart was bursting with pride. When I think that Oliver wasn't talking 8 weeks ago I am simply awestruck. Pluto might not be a planet anymore but the sun is shining even brighter and anything -- and everything -- seems possible tonight.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/09/my-sunshine.html", "title": "\nMy Sunshine\n"},
{"date": "September 14, 2006", "body": "\nToday started out on a high note and just kept getting better. Oliver woke with a cheery smile and a \"Good Morning\" for each of us. He even joined in the good morning song that I greet each of the children when they awake each day. Then it was business as usual, getting dressed, breakfast, teeth brushed and ready for the therapist that arrives each morning 8:30. The out of the ordinary thing this morning, though, is that I stayed home. Although I quit my full-time job in January, they were kind enough to ask me to stay on for whatever amount of time I could spare away from home. I still go to work four days a week but now I am home by 11:30; early enough to overlap for a half hour with the therapist and then orchestrate the rest of the days activities. But today I took the morning off because we were having special visitors. Our school district has created a new Autism Program Coordinator position and the man who has taken the job came by to meet Nik and I and Oliver. I didn't quite know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised by his knowledge, his demeanor, and his attitudes towards working with the parents. There are 19 children in our district, in 6 different schools, plus 4 in home-based programs like Oliver. That gives him a case load of 23 children. And he plans to visit our home twice monthly to spend time with Oliver. He made it clear that he wants to establish clear lines of communication with the parents but that he also wants to know and understand Oliver so that he can be of more assistance as we look to meet all of his needs. I've written before about how pleased I am with the efforts of our school district and I know that many parents struggle to get what we have been given so I feel very fortunate. I also hope he isn't too good to be true! As we were sitting in the living room talking to this gentleman, who was accompanied by Mary, our much-loved lead therapist, Oliver came into the room during a break from one of his activities. I took the chance to ask him to sing for Mary, who had not heard his rendition of You Are My Sunshine. He sang beautifully and I tell you there are not many people who can keep a dry eye when listening to Oliver sing that song. And I love how he finishes with a flourish, holding the notes here and there for an extra beat or two. And when he finishes he basks, he revels, in the applause. I have never, ever, seen him so pleased with himself. Luke, the new coordinator was genuinely impressed. Only after Oliver left did he tell me that he had earlier expressed concern to Mary that we had abandoned our PECS program for the Verbal Behavior program. After seeing and hearing Oliver he now agrees wholeheartedly with the change. As the day wore on I did some reveling myself. Oliver and Sam have gradually, slowly, tentatively, started to establish a playful relationship with each other. Most of this is due to Sam's persistence and the very physical play skills he has learned from RT. One of RT's favorite games to play with Sam is \"Sumo.\" RT will walk into a room and say: \"Hey Sam! Sumo!\" and then Sam will tackle him sumo-wrestling style. This same thing has become very effective with Oliver and it is fun to watch as he lays down on the floor or bed and becomes increasingly excited as Sam repeatedly jumps on top of him. Sometimes Sam will hesitate for a few seconds and Oliver will breathlessly call out: \"Jump, Jump, Jump!\" or \"Go!!\" Then, once sam lands on Oliver the two roll around in a posture that is half wrestling, half hugging. It makes me deliriously happy. Then at 4:00 we rendezvoused with our neighbor and her daughter on the porch of another neighbor to sing Happy Birthday to one of the happiest faces on the street. The woman who lives two doors down is always eager to invite the kids onto her porch to sit on the swing or to have some sweet that she has just concocted. She turned 80 yesterday and delighted in the special kiddie-style serenade. Oliver didn't join in the group song but when the candles were lit it seemed as though everything came together for him and he launched into a solo version of the song. I have never told her that Oliver has autism but I gather she has figured it out because she once told Nik about a program that she watched having to do with the immunization theory. Anyway, as we were sitting there shooting the breeze Oliver kind of curled up beside her on the swing and put his head on her lap. She then turned to me and said, \"I really think that he is doing much better.\" I had just been thinking the same thing myself and wondered if my gratitude to her for saying it out loud showed on my face. But all these high notes were juxtaposed against a couple of more somber notes. Oliver hasn't really had any tantrums of note since last November. That is, until last week. Twice in the past week Oliver has had monumental meltdowns of the kind that I would sooner forget. Both of them occurred in the car while I was driving. Oliver can now get out of his seatbelt and these tantrums had him lunging across the backseat aggressively towards his brother. What can you do when you are halfway between home and your destination in this situation? I drove for a block then pulled over, put a hysterical Oliver back into his seat and drove another block then repeated the whole thing three more times. It was awful. And scary. And I'm now busy brainstorming ways to avoid the same scene next week when we make this particular trip again. One thing about parenting: it requires resourcefulness and creativity unlike any other job I've ever had.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/09/hitting-high-notes.html", "title": "\nHitting The High Notes\n"},
{"date": "August 22, 2006", "body": "\n\"You really need to teach him that there are certain things that he just can't do inside.\" This was a comment made by someone who ought to know better but just doesn't quite \"get\" how unhelpful that kind of advice really is with a kid like Oliver. This is the same person who once told me that there was nothing wrong with Oliver that a little extra love wouldn't cure. And the same person who told me, at the height of my grief last year, that Oliver would suffer for any mistakes I made. And so, she implied, I had better shape up. Well I guess I did. Shape up, that is. And I learned to stop sharing things with this person, which is a shame because she had been a pretty big part of my support network. And I learned to draw support from people who genuinely offered it and to not feel bitter that those who should have been there for me weren't. Well, ok, I'm still working on the not feeling bitter part. I mean we're talking family here. Siblings who  haven't even called  in the last year. Friends that I've had for twenty years who also must have misplaced my phone number. And I'm sorry but I just can't catch them up. They just can't jump in now and ask 'so how is everything with you?' Um, we're fine now but let's see, there was that period of time when I was scraping shit off the floor, the walls, the bed, the boy, etc, two or three times a day to the tune of my crying children when we most definately were not fine. Not fine at all. Oh, and did I mention the periods of utter despair but also of incredible, unsurpassable joy? We've been on a journey the past year and I'm not the same as I was. And there is just no way to summarize any of this in a meaningful way for those who kept their distance. But the thing is, I can't throw the first stone. Disability makes people uncomfortable. I remember a time when a neighbor sat in my living room with her newborn daughter and told me that she was born disabled. I stammered out some kind of response but I really didn't know what to say. There were times after that day when I thought about her and wondered how she was coping but I never asked. I was embarrassed because I didn't know if I could find the right words and I didn't want to offend her. Besides, I thought, she looked like she was keeping it together and she must have closer friends, other people offering her comfort. She and I have become much better friends over the last year. Ironically, she is someone who has offered me a great deal of support and comfort in the wake of Oliver's diagnosis. She came and sat with Sam when I cleaned up during the worst of the poop crises. It was to her house that I went one day when I just couldn't stop crying and didn't know where else to go. She didn't say much but handed me a spoon and a tub of ice cream and we sat there on her couch -- side by side -- eating straight from the box, watching her beautiful daughter play. If I have learned anything over the last year it is that great friendships are built on small deeds. On finding a way to extend ourselves to the people around us even if it makes us feel uncomfortable. Even if we risk something in the process. I don't believe that it is the thought that counts. Somebody got that wrong. It is the action. The phone calls. The words. And most certainly the spoon and the tub of ice cream.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/08/small-deeds-and-ice-cream.html", "title": "\nSmall Deeds and Ice Cream\n"},
{"date": "September 29, 2006", "body": "\nDo you believe in it? I used to snicker at the idea. But I still remember the first time I saw the man I would end up marrying 5 years ago today. I saw his shoes first. Brown loafers coming down a steep set of stairs. I didn't know what to expect of this man named Nik with the funny accent who had called me in to interview for a position for which I was clearly over-qualified. He later told me that my cover letter sold him: perfect spelling, perfect grammar, perfect punctuation and perfect formatting. To someone who deals with print media those things mean a lot. I remember sitting through the interview feeling embarrassed because I was so flustered by my reaction to him that I couldn't put two words together. He hired me and even though I was his assistant we didn't spend a lot of time together, which I was grateful for seeing as how I couldn't breathe when he walked into the room. I was excrutiatingly, wonderfully, profoundly uncomfortable around him. In a good way. Six weeks after I started to work for him I found another-- better-- job, and left. A few weeks later I worked up the nerve to call him and ask what he was doing for New Year's Eve. He didn't answer the phone that night and I couldn't quite work up the courage to call again. But as the fates would have it, I met him again at a party a few weeks later and we have been together ever since. After our first date I told a friend that this was the man I was going to marry. I think about that time a lot these days. How unlikely is it that Love At First Sight would end up as a marriage that really works? Those days when the fresh rush of love offered no hint of the times that were to come seem like just yesterday. When we were preparing to be married, a friend who is a Catholic priest, sent us a \"marriage test.\" We each took the test separately and without comparing answers mailed them off in an envelope to be scored. A few weeks later we received a summary of the results along with a note from our friend that read: \"You two will either have a marriage made in heaven or you weren't answering honestly!\" When we took the test I remember thinking that I had no idea how Nik felt about some of the questions. I don't remember if the test asked \"What if your child is born with a disability?\" or \"Would you give up your financial security so that your child might feel more emotionally secure?\" or \"What if 'Date Nights' turn into 'I need a break' nights?\" If it did I probably didn't give them much thought. Those things happened to other people, after all. But I chose wisely. Or I was in the right place at the right time. Or there was someone watching out for me. Or I was just plain lucky. Five years ago tonight on that little dance floor at the Inn where we were surrounded by our closest friends I probably couldn't have imagined the ins and outs of our life today. After Oliver was diagnosed with Autism last year I remember reading some scary statistics about how many marriages don't make it. But now I know the answers to all those questions that wouldn't even have occurred to me pre-Oliver and I know for sure how we will weather other challenges that come our way. I understand now why couples choose to trade vows more than once in their marriage. Nik and I are not the same as we once were -- as a couple or as individuals. We have probably learned more about each other in the last year than some couples learn in a lifetime. And even so, I would do it all over again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/09/love-at-first-sight.html", "title": "\nLove at First Sight\n"},
{"date": "January 29, 2007", "body": "\nI am out of crisis mode and into 2007! And to prove it I have had a date with my husband, gone out to dinner with a friend and started taking yoga again. All in one month! I have it in my head that this year will be a bit different than the last and so far I'm off to a good start. I came to see that I was in crisis mode some time back when friend and fellow blogger,  ThisMom , wrote a passage in one of her posts about how she had been feeling like she was in a state of constant emergency since the time of her son's diagnosis with Aspergers Syndrome. Yes, I thought, that is exactly how I felt. But I didn't quite know what to do about it either. A big part of my emotional state was tied up in not having a clear roadmap or plan when it came to what to do about Oliver's autism. And then there was the mythic, looming, magic, five-year mark, rapidly approaching, at which time his brain would suddenly become less agile, less capable of developing new pathways -- whatever that means. So there I was, the house was on fire, the clock was ticking and I was sitting on the floor of the room, the boy on my lap, smoke pouring in from all around, and it all depended on me but I was completely unable to focus and prioritize. But gradually, things have changed.  For one thing, begining RDI has given me a pretty good roadmap. And more importantly, I feel  competent  to use it to find our way. And competency is such a huge thing for all of us. Feeling competent is what allows us to keep finding the motivation to face that which challenges us. And although I love Oliver more than I could ever begin to describe, parenting him challenges me in ways that I never expected. And that frightened me more than anything because there were times when I honestly could not see that I was up to the challenges. But today, even in the face of all those challenges, I now find myself recounting to Nik all of our successes at the end of each day.  With each success, my feelings of competency soar. And as I re-gain my competency as a parent, Oliver's trust in me is also growing. I see it everyday in  willingness  to try new things with me. Three months ago when I called Oliver's name he would literally run in the other direction. Now he runs  to  me. I don't feel like I'm in the midst of an emergency all the time anymore. Every day just seems normal. Ordinary almost. But all of this is a process and even through we have made great strides in the past few months I know we still have some distance to travel. One of the things that remains very hard for me is looking into the future. Thinking about Oliver's future begs many questions that I'm just not sure I'm ready to look at squarely. My dearest hope is that I will one day be able to have a conversation with Oliver.  But that might not happen. It is a struggle to maintain that hope and yet accept that conversational-style communication just might not be in the cards for us. But if it is, when might it be  reasonable  to think it might happen? In a year? Five? Twenty? I'm not yet willing to totally give up on verbal communication. But setting goals requires that we evaluate what we believe to be realisitic and it also requires that we maintain some sort of expectations about the future. If we don't believe that our goals are attainable then why set them? And so my goals tend to be very short-term. I know what I want to accomplish this week, this month. But it is as if my road-map is leading me over very rocky terrain and I still need to keep my eyes on the very next step. Maybe as I become more adept -- more competent -- I will be able to look up at the bigger picture. But I'm just not there yet. But I AM taking Yoga every week. And after my first class on Sunday my muscles have been reminding me that stretching in new directions comes at a cost. I'm achey and sore but also pleasantly surprised that I could keep up with the class. And during that first class last week, the instructor offered up this: \"All balance is a gift. I'm not sure how to end this post, except with that thought. Balance  is  a gift.  And if 2007 brings me nothing more than balance I will be happy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thismom.com/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2007/01/and-now-for-something-completely.html", "title": "\nAnd Now for Something Completely Different!\n"},
{"date": "September 21, 2006", "body": "\nI've mentioned our lead therapist, Mary, a couple of times on this blog. And I believe that I also told you that she was much-loved. And she is, mostly. But let me tell you how weird it is when something like this happens to your child and you find someone who seems to know what they are doing and you invite her into your home, into the very heart of your family, and it sometimes feels like she has the secret key to your child. She has twenty years of experience working with kids like Oliver. And now she has a year of experience working with Oliver. And if she wasn't confident we wouldn't love her as much as we do. But sometimes it really stinks because she says things -- she  believes  things -- that I just don't like very much. And I'm not sure why I don't like them. Is it just because I'm not ready to see what she sees yet? Or is it because in my heart I don't believe that just because she is so wise and wonderful that she is necessarily right? I don't know but it really stinks -- like a big ole yukky skunk, as Oliver used to be fond of saying -- back before he stopped talking and I stupidly didn't know enough to savor every single thing he said. So yesterday Mary and I met for coffee to go over the ABBLS assessment to see where things stand. Anyway, I had also asked to see the latest data for his visual schedule, which is currently part of his IEP. To consider it mastered he has to do it independantly 90% of the time and I thought we were probably getting close. And we are, he does almost every step independently except for when an activity is \"all done.\" That he only does independantly 58% of the time. So I asked Mary if you wouldn't maybe see the same thing in any 4 year-old who was engaged in an activity. Wouldn't it also be hard to get any other four year old to stop an activity once in awhile? At that Mary looked at me and I could tell she was considering how to answer. Then she looked me directly in the eye and said: \"Christine, Oliver doesn't do  anything  like a normal four year old. Any other kid would have figured out the system after two weeks. But let me tell you, for as low-functioning as Oliver was when we first started working with him, he is doing really well. I never would have expected these kinds of results after only one year.\" That's pretty much what she said -- word for word. I know because those words have been ringing in my ears and bouncing around my head since she said them. And I don't know: is she right? Probably. Thank goodness that I don't get to spend a whole lot of time with other four year olds. But I'll tell you, it took a little while for the weight of what she said to fully hit me. He doesn't do  anything  like a normal four year old? Can that be true? And low-functioning? What the hell does that mean? Do you measure functioning as degrees from normal? I honestly don't know what normal is anymore. I look at Oliver and I see a little boy who loves and laughs just like any other kid. So what exactly is normal, anyway?

After his first birthday when I tried to have a smallish party that turned out disasterously I have reinstated the no party rule. When I was growing up my birthday was always a special day because I got a cake the flavor of my choosing (always pink with pink icing), everyone sang the birthday song followed by each of my siblings giving me the number of birthday punches corresponding to my age -- and one to grow on, of course. I could have lived without that last tradition. Whose idea was that, anyway? But it was all part of the fun. Sometimes I got a gift; sometimes I didn't depending on if we could afford it at the time. But I always got a cake and I was always made to feel like it was my special day. That was enough. Nik's family traditions were pretty similar (but without the punches). So that is the kind of birthday that I would like my boys to have each year. I've been talking about Oliver's upcoming birthday with him for about two weeks now. I talk about how he is going to be four and we count to four together. I tell him that we will have cake (chocolate because I still get to choose) with four candles and that we will sing Happy Birthday. But I'm not sure how much he gets. I know he will like the cake and the candles but will he understand that it is  his  birthday? That he was born 4 years ago? That it is  his  special day? I don't think so. And so I have been trying to think of the perfect gift. But anticipating what Oliver will like and what he will ignore altogether is hard. I went to Target today all set to buy a toy for him that he had played with when we visited a friend with children a few weeks back. It is the kind of toy where you hammer balls into a kind of zig-zag tube. He'll love it, I thought. After all he played with it nearly the whole time we were at our friend's house. But then I saw the box and it said the toy was appropriate for ages 12 months+. So I couldn't bring myself to buy it for my boy who is about to turn 4 years old. And then I just got sad because I couldn't find one single thing in the toy section that I thought would appeal to him. So I think I am going with my original idea: fish. Oliver LOVES fish and so does Sam. Sometimes we even just take trips to Petco to watch the fish for a half hour. And fish will kind of break me in to the idea of pet ownership. I have been toying with the idea of getting Oliver an assistive dog for companionship and also to help keep him from danger. If we can keep some fish alive maybe that bodes well for a pet of the four-legged variety.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/08/anticipation.html", "title": "\nAnticipation\n"},

{"date": "August 28, 2006", "body": "\nAfter a lot of feedback from friends I decided to go ahead and buy the ball and hammer toy from Target for Oliver's birthday. And, although it was not the ideal scenario, I took the kids with me on Friday morning to pick it up. I planned to wrap it later and I knew that he would enjoy opening the gift and playing with it even if it wouldn't be a surprise. Well, as it turns out, I was the one in for a surprise. When we rounded the isle into the toy section at Target, Oliver -- who had been riding on the outside of the cart -- hoped down and began perusing the toys. I was busy looking for the toy I intended to buy while keeping Sammy from jumping out of the cart. Oliver then chose a box from the shelf, looked at the pictures for a minute or two, then held it up to me and said: \"I want this. I WANT this!\" And just like that it was in the cart and we were headed for the cash register without another thought about the ball and hammer toy. There are a couple of things about the scenario that I just described that make it pretty amazing to me. Consider that 6 weeks ago Oliver wasn't speaking. Also, he has never been the kind of kid that has shown much interest in toys. A few months ago a trip down the toy isle would likely have found him riding in the cart more interested in the lights on the ceiling than in the toys. The toy that I set out to buy cost $15.00, the one I put into the cart, $30; but the real value was priceless to me. Oliver really seemed to enjoy all of his birthday activities. A few neighbors and friends stopped by throughout the day to sing Happy Birthday, each time eliciting a huge smile from him. He watched me put iceing on his cake and was so beside himself with joy that he was literally jumping up and down. Later, as the family gathered around him when he blew out the candles it really seemed to me that there was no difference between him and any other four year old. And for the first time in his life, Oliver was excited about unwrapping his gifts, did not require assistance, and was actually interested in what was inside. I always approach any day of tradition or celebration with a bit of trepidation. The things that make those days special for some people tend to throw Oliver a bit off-kilter and so I have to work very hard at negotiating my own expectations. But I don't think I could have wished for or gotten a better day or more reasons to celebrate. Oh, except for one goldfish that must have swam back to Elmo's house while the children slept. But that is a whole other post.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/08/birthday-surprises.html", "title": "\nBirthday Surprises\n"},
{"date": "October 10, 2006", "body": "\nYesterday I sat watching Oliver in the waiting room of our pediatrician office and I'm sure my face fairly shone with the pride I felt. Oliver, my beautiful, sweet Oliver was moving from place to place, interested, exploring everything. There were only two other people in the waiting room, a mother and her teenage daughter, and they were fully engrossed in conversation, not paying a bit of attention to how exquisite my boy was for those moments. I even laughed out loud when Oliver played with his reflection in the fun house mirror. And I thought to myself: \"This boy is really going to be OK.\" He is so easy these days. I can take him anywhere and I never have a problem with him. And if that mother and daughter had been paying attention to Oliver would they have sensed that something about him was different? Would they see the little things that I was so sensitive to that set him apart from other four year olds? That noise that he made when making his way across the room? The way he occasionally stopped and bit the back of a chair? The way he kept moving his hand across the reflective surface of the mirror? So perhaps it was it was because I was feeling so smug that I didn't pick up on the clues that might have warned me that trouble was ahead when the nurse finally called Oliver's name. Instead, I noted with pride that he looked right at her when he heard his name called out. I asked him to give me his hand so I could lead him from the waiting room and he came but then immediately yanked his hand from mine and retreated to a toy at the far corner. I went to him, lowered myself to his level and asked him to come with me, which he did. But as soon as we were in the examination room it became apparent that Oliver was full of anxiety about being there. He began to wail and scream and flop to the ground. When I tried to pull him onto my lap so that I could comfort him he arched his back and became dead weight on the ground. I tried to be soothing and calm. I got on the floor next to him but I could feel my own heart racing. When we moved out to be weighed and measured he did calm down momentarily but then flopped and screamed again as soon as he stepped off the scale. I occupied myself with trying to talk to him, to get him to come with me, to soothe him somehow but I could see a group of shoes out of the corner of my eye. People standing there, staring at us, somehow making everything worse. When we were finally able to move back into the exam room, the nurse returned and began to ask me questions about his eating, his activities, etc. Then she launched into a series of questions and I was so pre-occupied with how upset Oliver was that I didn't realize immediately that she was asking me questions from a developmental milestone chart!! After two or three questions I finally turned to her and calmly said that I didn't think it was appropriate to ask those questions and that I didn't want to answer any more. She apologized and looked at Oliver and said, almost to no one: \"It must be so hard.\" I wanted to smack her. We have been seeing a nurse practitioner rather than a doctor for all of our health care needs because we have found one who is sympathetic, pragmatic, caring and optimistic -- exactly the right combination. But we had to wait for her for what seemed an interminable amount of time. And when she finally did enter all she wanted to do was ask questions about Oliver and his therapies, which, under other circumstances I would have been happy to talk about. But as it was I could not concentrate on anything more than my son and so I told her that we had better get on with it. I just wanted to get out of there because by that time I had also lost control, was holding tightly to Oliver and both of us were crying into a puddle on the floor. I always get angry when I hear autism spoken of as a \"devastating\" disorder. Autism is not devastating to me because  my son has autism  and he, my beloved Oliver, is what has brought the most meaning to my life. But sometimes there are bumps in the road that  are  difficult and everyday we are challenged to give Oliver the tools he needs to cope, to learn and to grow. One of the most difficult things about autism -- to witness, to live through, to talk about, to write about -- is when a parent watches their child injure himself on purpose. When I see Oliver become so agitated, so driven to the extremes of frustration that he bites himself hard enough to leave teeth marks and bruises, and when I, his mother, am so incapable of helping him. ... well, that is hard. So when I first had to restrain Oliver from biting me and then watched as he tried to turn on himself I knew I had not paid enough attention to what he was trying to tell me. As soon a we left the building, Oliver was fine. I re-adjusted the rearview mirror in the car so that I could keep a constant watch on him as I drove. Only his red, splotchy face hinted of the storm that had just passed. That night, after Oliver had fallen asleep and I had gone over the events with Nik I retreated to the bathroom that I am in the never-ending process of painting. As I quietly worked I went over and over the events, trying to see where to lay the blame. Our last visit to the pediatrician office had gone smoothly enough. Oliver has never reacted so vehemently about being in any other space. Was it the fluorescent lights? Was there a smell I didn't detect? Was he expecting to go to another examination room? One thing I know for sure about yesterday: I failed Oliver. He was communicating something to me as loudly as he could and I didn't listen. I don't know exactly what he was trying to say but I do know that next time I will retreat with him when he needs more time and space. I will hold his hand in mine and only move forward when he is ready. Damn the expectations of others.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/10/following-storm.html", "title": "\nFollowing the Storm\n"},
{"date": "October 23, 2006", "body": "\nThere's nothing like blubbering to a room full of strangers to make you feel like you've totally lost a grip on things.  I should know because that's what I did last Thursday. I am now part of the local Advisory Committee for Special Education and was asked to give a three minute presentation to the State Advisory Committee about the need for more ABA training for the teachers in our state. Easy enough, right? I was also asked to pepper in some details about Oliver and how helpful his ABA program has been. Also, very easy, you think. I practiced, revised, practiced again and thought I had a fairly good presentation ready. I was only anxious because -- as my graduate school friends will tell you -- I typically look like I am having some sort of seizure if I actually have to speak in public. I turn red (all of me -- not just my face), my voice shakes, I perspire heavily, I don't breathe often enough. It isn't a pretty sight. Only this time I hadn't counted on the emotional factor of actually talking about Oliver and his autism to a group of strangers. I had to stop three times to regain my composure. At one point the lady next to me even asked if she could finish for me! But I did finish and afterwards I was surprised by how many people came and told me that they still got emotional when talking about their children who were now much older than Oliver.  A small group of us gathered in one corner of the room at the conclusion of the formal activities and talked for more than ninety minutes about topics ranging from hiring an ABA consultant to respite care to diets and sleep. It was really uplifting. Then, I walked to the parking lot with another mother from our local board. This woman recently sent her son, now 17, to live in a residential program because his aggressive behaviors had gotten to the point where she, a single mom, couldn't handle them any more. On the short walk to the car she told me about her battles with the previous director of special ed., about uncaring and non-supportive teachers, and about the struggles she faced during her child's time in the city schools. The new director, she assured me, is a breed apart; someone who really cares about making things work for the children. And she joined the committee to help make the system better so that other familes might benefit from her experience.  The thing that has really stuck with me about this woman's story is that she adopted her son when he was 6 years old and at that time must have wondered if she would always have to take care of him. Now, 11 years later, it was clear that  not  being able to take care of him was the hardest part of her journey through motherhood. As much as I hate speaking in public I will say that Thursday night reminded me of one thing:  Everyday we challenge Oliver to do things that are hard for him and so the least I can do is challenge myself on his behalf at least as often; and in the end, we're all better people for it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/10/unexpected-lessons.html", "title": "\nUnexpected Lessons\n"},
{"date": "October 16, 2006", "body": "\nThe incident at the doctor's office that I last related was just the tip of the iceburg. By Tuesday afternoon I began to sense that something was deeply affecting our little guy. When I searched my brain for possible causes I remembered that the first negative behavior scenario was on Saturday morning just as his therapist started a picture schedule. I recognized that trouble was brewing and so asked the young woman working with Oliver to make all the activities very quick. But small (and big) tantrums, flopping behaviors, screaming and biting continued with more than regular frequency through the weekend and on into Tuesday, including the disasterous visit to the doctor's office. Putting two and two together, as any parent -- and certainly any parent of a child with autism -- would do, I began to wonder if perhaps Oliver was reacting to the teaching style of his newest therapist; if therapy had become more work than fun. A quick call to Mary, our lead therapist, confirmed that she was not surprised by my concerns. So we took stock and as a team figured out how to regroup. We decided to take the work aspects of therapy down a notch or two, up the fun quotient and work on re-building relationships. The staff member who had been a bit too concerned with data and finishing required tasks was paired with another therapist for a few days for additional training. And we -- I -- learned some valuable lessons about the high cost of complacency. There are so many moving parts to making a program for Oliver that works and sometimes I get overly focused on the logistics of it all and don't take the time to sit and actually watch a therapy session and to continually question approaches and methodology. I was aware of this particular therapists rather task-oriented approach about two weeks ago but didn't stop to consider the impact until it became obvious that Oliver was experiencing some rather extreme anxiety. But, if something good can come out of something bad, I believe that this series of events has also hightlighted for me my own focus on tasks at the expense of fun -- and not just as it relates to parenting Oliver. So, onto a new approach and thank you to Oliver -- again -- for pointing the way! This lovely fall weather has cooperated nicely with our new fun-fun-fun approach to life in the little green house. We've been spending our share of time outdoors, greedily taking in the crisp, sharp air. I would post some pictures to prove it but blogger is apparently all blogged out and won't let me add my photos. So you'll just have to imagine Sammy \"milking\" the wooden cow for the moment. ...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/10/high-cost-of-complacency.html", "title": "\nThe High Cost of Complacency\n"},
{"date": "October 17, 2006", "body": "\n  This thing about having fun? Well, it's fun. Surprisingly. A scene from last night: 5:05. Mommy rushes in the door from work to the the constant Sammy refrain of mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy and the splashing sound Oliver's arm makes creating mini-tsunami's in the fish tank upstairs as Nik recounts how good, bad, and tiring his day with the children was. I slap a couple of sausages in the pan and assemble the remaining ingredients for the jumbalaya on the menu. Sam clings to my legs making me feel like I've suddenly grown an extra appendage. Oliver wanders into the kitchen dripping from head to toe and I wonder if I hear the sound of fish flopping and gasping for breath in the upstairs hallway. Then, from out of nowhere: \"Jumbalaya, crawfish pie, fillet, gumbo. 'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my machez a mio. ... \" Sam, still attached to my leg, is then whirling around the kitchen as I pirouette over and grab Nik's hand. The sound, the song, is coming from me and a glance down at Oliver's face reveals a half-frozen smile but eyes that dance and say: \"What is going on here?\" I reach down and grab Sam's chubby little body and spin him into the air, feet flying as we make another set of turns around the kitchen. Nik grabs Oliver, hoists him into the air as well, doing an elaborate set of spins and dips and joins in for the next chorus: \"Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh my oh! Son of a gun, well have big fun on the bayou!\" Then more dancing in the living room, dining room, up the stairs, on the beds, and a look of sheer, glorious, pleasure across each red and sweaty face.

{"date": "October 30, 2006", "body": "\nSo the fish are no more. I watched the algae overcome the tank and just couldn't get it together enough to clean it again. A couple of days after a distinct smell started to eminate from the tank I wondered aloud to RT what was worse: letting the fish choke to death on the algae, cutting off their air supply, or consigning them to the porcelain chair in the next room. In the end the sound of swooshing water won out because I couldn't live with the smell of that water for another day. The image of the two little survivor fish trying valiantly to escape my little green net by zigging to my zags was brought to mind on Friday afternoon when I took Oliver for his first session with the OT from our school district. Since Oliver is on track to start Kindergarten next year the idea was that we should start taking a look on what additional motor skills he might need to work on. This first meeting was meant to be a get-to-know-you kind of thing where she (the OT) would just observe Oliver at various activities set up throughout the room. The trouble though was that Oliver, much like those fish, wasn't keen on coming to rest in any place in the room where he could be trapped. So as the OT zigged my boy zagged.  It was kind of amusing to watch at first but also frustrating that she seemed so inept (although she does have experience with children with autism and is every inch the caring professional) and then a little sad as I tried to imagine if this is how Oliver might experience kindergarten.  But I'm not going to get to ahead of myself here. Who is to say what might happen in the next year? I've committed to keeping our appointment with the OT this friday but if I still feel this way afterwards we won't be going back. We have enough to focus on. There are two things on our horizon that I feel very excited about: first, we have made an appointment with Judith Bluestone of the Handle Institute and will be seeing her in December and second, I have engaged an RDI consultant who will begin working with us in January. RDI is something that I read about earlier this year after reading posts by some of my blogging friends. At the time I did my initial research the approach sounded intriguing to me but I put it aside as too expensive and too complicated. The truth is that it is neither. And after testing Oliver's response with some simple activities I am more and more convinced that RDI is a good fit for us as a family. I'm not prepared yet to chuck the ABA program that we have going but I now feel that I am in a position to be more discriminating about how his program is put together. Anyway, I hope I'm not too much like those fish, myself. I hope I'm not zigging and zagging too much here. My poor husband's head is spinning. But I feel positively bouyant and I can't wait to get home and RDI with my son. Can't say I ever felt the same about ABA.

{"date": "December 09, 2008", "body": "\nI have a book at my bedside called The Cradle of Thought.  Sami  asked me the other day what the book was about and I told him it was about how people learn to think. Then he asked why I wanted to know how people think and I told him it was so I could learn to be a better teacher (that's how I explain my work to him). And when I really consider this I decide that teaching my autistic 6 year old son how to think isn't really that different from any kind of teaching. We provide the right amount of challenge,  the right amount of support and we create situations that require thought. I do it with him everyday without even realizing it. This just happens to also be what  RDI  is all about. But with  RDI  a lot of thought and energy goes into the teaching process because without even realizing it I tend to underestimate and overcompensate for Oliver. I simplify things too much before testing to see how simple things really need to be. I remove obstacles that might get in the way of getting from point A to point B rather than helping Oliver navigate around them. And I don't involve Oliver enough in thinking about how to prepare for events and activities. As I heard a speaker recently explain: I'm robbing him of the opportunity to think. I've been thinking about this a lot lately as I try to re-jigger how I approach homeschooling. Throughout the day there are just so many opportunities to teach thinking skills. For example, lately I've been giving Oliver a squirt bottle to use in the bathroom in an effort to avoid him going after all my cleaning supplies. A few days ago the bottle ran out of water and Oliver, frustrated, threw it into the bathtub and began to move on to another activity. Luckily, I was standing right there and so I commented to him that if he put more water in the bottle he could keep right on with the fun of squirting. Oliver hesitated for a minute then grabbed the bottle, turned on the faucet and thrust the bottle under the water. Since he hadn't removed the top it didn't fill up and realizing this, he threw it down again. \"Oh,\" I said, \"the water can't get in!\" This was a bit too subtle for Oliver and he turned to leave, so I picked up the bottle and said: \"I wonder how we could get this open?\"  Oliver hesitated for a minute, then took the bottle in his hands and played around with the screw top until he figured it out. Once he got the lid off he knew what to do, filled up the bottle, put the lid back on and was back in business.  I didn't tell him what to do but I gradually led him through the process of thinking about how to solve the problem. Sounds easy, right? And yes, it was, on a certain level. But the hard part is being the mother who is supposed to be supporting her son through these simple cognitive tasks but who is also standing there watching her son holding a closed bottle under the running water and thinking oh. my. God.  So yes, there is that. The overwhelmingly crushing realization of how something so simple is, well, not simple for my beautiful, wonderful, smiling boy.  But on the other hand (after a bit of reflection) there is also the wonder that this same boy keeps on trying. That he is so incredibly  persistent . And that he can learn. And that he keeps on smiling through it all. So back to the homeschooling front. I mentioned in a previous post that I'm abandoning any kind of academic pretenses.  RDI  will be our curriculum.  Thinking  will be our curriculum. And I think I'm good with that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/12/thoughts-about-thinking.html", "title": "\nThoughts about thinking\n"},

I wasn't going to attend because I am in the midst of applying for the DD waiver and have been hitting some roadblocks. Oliver doesn't test well. Well, he doesn't really test at all. Almost every time we have him evaluated the report from the psychologist says some version of: \"the tester could not get an accurate measure of the child's abilities. ...\"\u00a0 blah blah blah. But for the waiver they need a damn number. And we don't have a number. And it seems like it might be hard to GET a number. They don't make it easy on us parents. Basically, I've started down this road several times over the years, knowing that I had to do it but feeling like the whole process was impossible.  \n \nAnyway, I went to the workshop. I learned about another waiver. A waiver with NO WAITING LIST. I applied. We were screened. We were determined eligible. \n \nJust. Like. That.  \n \nThe benefits? In-home aides and respite care. I found and hired a wonderful,  wonderful , local young woman who loves children and has a natural way with my fair boy. She is with us 20 hours every week and her job is just to help out with Oliver or things related to Oliver's care. The gift to me is ME. For a few hours every week I can do things that I need to do without worrying about who will take care of the boy. I can exercise. I can work. I can  browse  the racks for a new sweater. (No more hit and run shopping!!) I can shampoo the sofa without having to keep one eye out for the boy. \n \nI had a hard time thinking about what all this meant as the day approached when our aide would start. OK, I thought, it is agreed then. It is understood that my boy needs pretty much constant supervision. We've known this for a long, long time. But now  it is written . Yeah. On one hand I was elated to imagine free time. On the other hand it was a slightly bitter pill. I wish we didn't need the help.  \n \nBut it has been a week now since Rachel has been coming to work at our little green house and more and more I see her as someone who is here to expand the possibilities. And so I think: maybe this is our time for expansion. Maybe we've contracted enough over the past couple of years. Oliver has someone new to negotiate a relationship with. He has someone new to love him. And I have someone new to trust. And yes, I feel that we are expanding. Every day a little bit more. We are growing and learning new ways to be. \n \nI've gone to do my RDI work at a local coffee shop for a few hours everyday. I've gone early for pick up time at pre-school just to watch Sami playing through the window. I've listened from another part of the house as Rachel and Oliver concocted and cooked a yummy butternut squash soup. I've sent them on errands and they've come back flushed and laughing. I started learning German again.\u00a0  \n \nWe'll see how it goes. So far, so good.

You are high maintenance. It's true. I love you and you've given me a lot over the years -- emotional support, friendship, a sounding board, and good advice (just to name a few).

And the other day when Oliver cut his finger with the potato peeler and then tolerated a band-aid for the rest of the day as if it were no big deal, I wanted to share it with you because, hey, last time he had a cut our house looked like scene from Evil Dead. I'm almost finished with my certification program. You know, the one that has me working almost every evening. The one that causes me extreme deadline anxiety! We're leaving for Switzerland at the end of the month and by then I hope to be finished. And then, Then!! I'm all yours. Well, after I return fat and happy from  chez  Mother-in-Law, home of the perpetually filled ice-cream freezer and chocolate cupboard. I'll take a picture with my new digital camera and share it with you. You won't believe it. If there is time before I leave I'll drop you a little note or two and tell you about Bo Bo the Rabbit. I'll complain to you a little bit about why I can never do anything part-way and why I should have thought twice before picking up anything written by Michael Pollen. I'll tell you about a grant we received from a national foundation that will pay for Oliver's speech therapy. And I'll tell you about our amazing adopted tribe. But before I leave I will most definitely sit down for at least a couple of minutes and tell you about the beautiful, perfect, amazing tie dye shirt that we received from John, Sam and  Kal  over at  AutismTwins , and I will ask for your help in recruiting kids who would like to keep the color flowing (feel free to get started on this immediately). So. Are we better now? Because  I  feel better. You're such a good listener, blog. Gotta run, now though.

Let's just say I've killed my fair share of tomatoes. And just when I thought I was done, thought I couldn't bear one more basket of tomatoes looking me in the face every time I walked into the kitchen, I went to my favorite local farm stand and found that they were selling tomatoes for $14 a bushel. Do you have any idea how many tomatoes are in a bushel? I had to go home and google it before rushing back with cash in hand, then loaded 53lbs of tomatoes into the trunk of my car.  I couldn't stop myself. I think I have a disease. I just have to say no to vegetables. It has gotten that bad. On the upside, we had our first day of \"school\" last week. We spent part of it at the river, part of it in the garden (you see, there are those tomatoes to deal with), and part of it at the art table.  I had a momentary bout of panic when the school buses zoomed by our house each morning last week. We were still stretching and yawning into our pillows and thinking of blueberry pancakes. Its kind of odd, I tell you, when everyone else seems to be moving on to the next stage of life and here we are,  still doing pretty much what we did the week before. I know that things will change for us as the season changes, when it is time to put in the garlic, carve and can the pumpkins and don heavier clothes. Still. I'm not entirely unruffled by it all, this sense of being removed from all the hubbub. I'm usually such a hubbub kind of girl. On the up, upside, Oliver was recently evaluated by the public school system to determine his eligibility for special education -- a formality, really -- and I was so happy to learn that he is pretty much age level for the life skills portion of the evaluation. Needless to say, this was not the case at the age of three so I guess we are managing to do something right. The \"something right\" part is surely our focus on  RDI , which encourages us to slow down and help Oliver (and  Sami !!) to participate in just about everything that goes on around here. I swear that by now that boy could make the coffee and mix up the bread all on his own! Too bad that wasn't part of the test. I have another post in mind about language -- how utterly rewarding real communication is!!! -- but I'll save that for another night when I don't have a bushel of tomatoes waiting for me.

{"date": "March 09, 2010", "body": "\nOliver continues to sleep. \n \nNik and I are grateful, of course, but we certainly can't point to a single thing that might have brought about this dramatic change. After years and years -- Oliver's whole lifetime -- of charting and guessing and trying to draw lines from point A to point B, it seems right and appropriate that this shift should also seem so random. Whatever it is, we'll take it. \n \nIt has been a whole month now, or a month and one night, as the sleep cycle started on February 7th -- a day that I hope we celebrate in some fitting way next year after 333 more days of good sleep. It hasn't been all smooth sailing -- Oliver woke at 4am two mornings in a row this past weekend. We worried that our run of good sleep was coming to an end but the next two nights were fine. \n \nOver the past 4-5 years, if you asked me, I might have told you that Oliver didn't seem that affected by his lack of sleep. I might have told you that he simply seemed to need less sleep than almost every other person on the planet. I believed this to be true because lack of sleep never seemed to affect him in the way I thought it should. It certainly didn't seem as debilitating for him as it felt for the rest of us. Getting so little sleep, all of it broken, caused me to feel cranky and irritable, it affected my eating habits, I had trouble concentrating, I couldn't remember things like I used to, I was easily distracted, easily frustrated. ... none of that probably seems very surprising for a person who averaged 4-5 hours of sleep for years and years. But Oliver! Oliver is one of the most easy-going kids I know (considering all we ask of him) and always, always so full of energy. In fact, keeping up with him when we were often so very tired has been one of the most difficult parenting challenges that we face.  \n \nAfter a month of sleep, I'm revising my former opinion about Oliver's need for sleep. I see changes emerging before my eyes and now realize how much the lack of sleep had impacted his ability to function and to learn. Exhaustion just looks different for him than it did for me. For one thing, the manic energy is decreasing. He doesn't run or gallop everywhere these days. His appetite -- while still hearty -- has decreased. He is calmer, spends longer periods of time focused on tasks and doesn't seem to get Lost in Space quite as much as he used to.  \n \nA couple of days ago I noted the George Will editorial -\u00a0  \"How to Ruin a Child\"  in which he writes: \"Until age 21, the circuitry of a child's brain is being completed. ...\u00a0 Research on grade schoolers showing that \"the performance gap caused by an hour's difference in sleep was bigger than the gap between a normal fourth-grader and a normal sixth-grader.\" In high school, there is a steep decline in sleep hours, and a striking correlation of sleep and grades.  \n \nTired children have trouble retaining learning \"because neurons lose their plasticity, becoming incapable of forming the new synaptic connections necessary to encode a memory. . . . The more you learned during the day, the more you need to sleep that night.\" \n \nI found this very interesting in light of what we have been observing in Oliver after just a month of long, restful nights.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/03/AR2010030303075.html"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/03/month-and-day.html", "title": "\nA Month and a Day\n"},
{"date": "August 03, 2010", "body": "\nOur neighbor across the back alley had just come home to find that another neighbor's dog had gotten out of the yard. After quickly rounding up the dog and putting him back inside the fence and securely latching the gate, he was surprised to see a bicycle police officer coasting to a stop before him. \n \n\"Did you find him?\" \n \n\"Yeah,\" said my neighbor, surprised that the police were aware that the dog was loose. His surprise then grew even greater when the officer held his hands out to take his son from his wife who was standing nearby. \n \nIt took a minute before they straightened out the fact that one of them was talking about a missing dog and the other about a missing boy. The missing boy that half the police in the city were looking for would be my Oliver. And he wasn't so much missing as, well, sitting quietly on the toilet upstairs in his very own home, quite unaware that his hysterical mother was, well, hysterical. \n \nConfused?  \n \nLet me backtrack a moment. \n \nTonight, the first Tuesday of August is also National Night Out. NNO is an annual event in which city officials visit \"at risk\" neighborhoods and meet with residents. Our neighborhood, which has a very active neighborhood watch group, is always a stop for the caravan of officials in our city. We combine it with our annual block party and find that it is the one time during the year when many of us can connect and spend a few minutes catching up on the news of each others lives. When the caravan arrives there is generally a good deal of commotion -- and a  lot  of people. Oh, and did I mention that a good many police officers are among the caravan, including about eight bicycle patrol men? \n \nSo anyway, I was talking with two of our city council members, congratulating them for approving a recent bicycle and pedestrian plan for our City and encouraging them to find the money to support the plan, while keeping one eye on Oliver who was keeping to the edge of the fray and hanging out a bit further down the block, closer to the busy intersection, than I normally allow. And then, suddenly, he was gone. When I didn't see him I stopped mid-sentence and sprinted to where I had last seen him, what, 30 seconds before? A minute? Not more than that but long enough. When I didn't see him I sprinted towards the intersection, shouting his name in that panicky voice that comes from a place of deep, deep fear. When I didn't see him at the intersection I sprinted back to the house, calling his name, panic rising. \n \nAs I got closer to my house and the party on the street in front, I was vaguely aware that the police were already on the move, someone asked what he was wearing and for his description but I just kept running, not wanting to lose one more second and sure that one of the neighbors could give that information. \n \nOliver, for his part, has become very aware of his surroundings over the past year or so. He seldom ventures out of our yard and when he does he knows how far he is allowed to go. He knows how to look both ways before he crosses the street. And he is not a wanderer. Anymore. But this wasn't always the case. It wasn't that long ago that a passing motorist found him playing on the railroad tracks that cross by a block or so from our house (I found him seconds after they did) or the Sunday evening in Switzerland when he took the scooter without our noticing and rode it all the way down to the playground by the Rhine, crossing train tracks and a major road in the process. It always happens in the blink of an eye. And when it happens you cannot believe how quickly it happened or how stupid you were for not paying more attention.  \n \nThe back door to our house was propped open so I could more easily carry out everything I needed for the party. As I raced into the downstairs hallway, now very upset and calling Oliver's name, the whole house was quiet. There was no response. No movement, no sound from my little boy who would not just yell out, \"What?\" in response to my urgent calling but who would, always, come to me. I called again and waited, dreading the silence that followed, my mind racing: what do I do now?! And: This is an emergency! \n \nAnd then? I heard a small sound from upstairs and after a moment saw my boy walking towards me with his hands clamped over his ears. My shouting had frightened him.  \n \nClose on my heels was the Captain of the city SWAT team -- did I mention that there were a LOT of police officers around? Through my tears I apologized more than once for causing such a commotion. He made some kind remark about it being a good time to lose a boy when there were so many police officers in my front yard and shifted his weight to the other foot as I continued to sob and hold Oliver in what must have felt like a death grip. I wondered how many hysterical mothers he had seen in his career.  \n \nWhen I finally made it outside again the caravan was pulling away, most of the guests were departing and there was a lot of cleaning up to do.  \n \nAnother day in the life of a mom and a boy.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/08/missing-in-eye-of-beholder.html", "title": "\nMissing in the eye of the beholder\n"},

I had it in my mind every day: Tonight I will blog. Then I curled up in bed with a book instead. But I'm back to this autism cum sleep-celebration-blog with some pretty joyous words: May 7th. Three Months. All night. Every night.\u00a0 So I hope you'll understand my little blog-vacation because even though you'd think I'd have lots of new energy -- and I do -- I've also re-discovered the joys of curling up with a good book before bed and of waking up early and  lounging  in bed until I hear the stirrings of my little ones. It has been glorious, if not rejuvenating. You see, when I look in the mirror I see the evidence of those 7.5 years of exhaustion. When I regard myself frankly I see the truth of what we have endured etched forever on the face looking back at me. And so, I thought, as I abandoned this blog for another night: it's ok. Go ahead. Rest. It has been a long time coming.  \n \nMaybe this post means I'm back. We'll see. \n \nSo what can I tell you? Since I last posted Sami has learned to read. Just words so far but he is beyond excited and I don't think it will be long until he is reading independently. Oliver is also doing well but about a step and a half behind his brother. What keeps me going is the look of pleasure on his face when we sit down to work each day. I just pray that the winds continue to blow in our favor. \n \nThe arrival of spring at our house means that a great deal of time is spent on the bikes and in the garden -- two things I'm sure I'll be posting more about. Oliver and Sami simply take my breath away when I watch them on the bikes.\u00a0 Often, when we are biking around town, drivers will slow down to pass us and I will note their broad smiles and thumbs up.\u00a0 I know that they are mostly taking note of Sami -- the improbably small, newly-minted five year old, riding like he was born on the bike. But what they would never guess is that Oliver is hands-down the most amazing kid I know and a downright miracle on the bike. I've watched, for example, as Oliver looks ahead to obstacles in his path and changes course to avoid them. I've been amazed by how seamlessly he reads our gestures and hand signals to navigate. To see him riding is to see a boy with no limitations, the boy of my heart's eye. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/05/back-from-blogging-break-i-think.html", "title": "\nBack from Blogging Break (I think)\n"},

I almost take for granted that I'm embarking on a solid night of sleep once my head hits the pillow. Almost.\u00a0 And during the daytime I never wonder anymore if I should skip the mug and just mainline the caffeine. \n \nThere's still one or two things that amaze me about the whole shift in sleep thing. For example, I didn't tell you but after about a week of solid sleeping I decided, on a whim, to move Oliver into his own bed in his own room. You would think at that time I would be worried about changing something that finally seemed to be working, but, well, I didn't really think it through. But it didn't seem to matter. So Oliver is now sleeping in RT's room while he is away in London. But the really, really amazing part is the  way  he goes to sleep each night. You see, Oliver has never, ever been able to fall asleep without me or Nik next to him. Before we discovered the joys of melatonin this sometimes ate a two hour chunk out of my evening. And usually he wanted me to sing to him as he drifted off. It's a good thing I have fond associations with Twinkle Twinkle or I might by now have an unabiding hatred for the song!\u00a0 These days, however, we all gather for stories in the big bed -- the one Sami and Oliver have shared for the past few years-- and then Oliver will inevitably tell me that he wants to go to bed, I'll say good night and off he goes. Nik tucks him in, turns off the light and we don't see him again until sometime the next morning. \n \nHow amazing is that? \n \nAnd with all this rest, Nik and I are doing radical things: He is taking a half day off on Fridays, we take a yoga class together, then a leisurely walk home. We've hired a babysitter two Saturdays mornings a month so that we can start biking together again. We're thinking of going out in the evening! Together.

Oliver looks for 2.3 seconds and chooses an old favorite. Sami takes longer, looking for a book about submarines that I don't remember.  \n \nThe boys finally take their place on either side of me, I draw the comforter up high and tuck it in under all our chins, for the house is chilly with November, then I begin to read. After just three words Oliver begins to get up. I stop him and ask: \n \n\"Don't you want me to read the book?\" \n \n\"Yes,\" he replies.

At eight he weighs eighty pounds and has never walked anywhere lightly. \"Please,\" I pray silently to myself, \"let him have the book.\" Let him have the book.  \n \nAnd then he rounds the corner into his room and I see he is holding a large blue ball.

Curious, I followed him and stood in the doorway watching as my boy yanked the sheets from my bed in a very determined fashion and then dragged them back to his room!

Just a list, which to my blocked brain feels somewhere between nothing and a real blog post. So. Here we go: \n \n1. Oliver is all boy on the bike. He has recently begun to pedal full-speed ahead, slamming on his brake at the very last moment leaving delightful skid marks in his wake. And also a Mama who wishes she took valium. \n \n2. And speaking of bikes: Oliver also does this thing where he gets a good glide going then he stands up on the pedals, leans all the way forward resting his hips on the handle bars, raises his arms up over his head like he's just won the Tour de France and actually  steers  with his hips. It is the most amazing thing I have ever seen. And it makes me wish I had a stash of valium in my bike bag.  \n \n3. I am NOT a public speaker. I have hated it my whole, entire life, starting when I was just a grade schooler and  could not  raise my hand to answer a question or make a statement in class. This persisted through college and, to a lesser extent, graduate school. If I tried my heart would have exploded. But last month I gave four presentations within a two week period.  And I enjoyed it . And? Apparently I was good at it because I got three more invitations to speak in the coming months. I'm not sure what changed. I guess maybe I just found something that I really love to talk about. \n \n4. Sending Sami to the sudbury-type school has been quite a learning process, calling for me to really question my beliefs about almost everything. For instance, I've given a lot of thought to how I define success and how my parenting in this moment lays the groundwork for what my kids will be in the future. And strangely? It mirrors much of what I thought I already worked through with regards to Oliver. I had no idea that the terrain of my journey with Sami's would so closely resemble Oliver's. And mostly I had no idea that Kindergarten could be so thought-provoking. \n \n5. I grew a pomegranate bush. Yesterday I went outside to check on it and found a teeny, tiny little pomegranate hiding behind a beautiful red flower. I have no idea what to do with this tiny little thing and the internet hasn't shed much light on it -- but I can't wait to see what happens. \n \nSo. That's it, my friends.

So I've made a lot of excuses, let the phone ring the machine will get it, turned down invitations, left early when it didn't feel right and just generally tried to keep my feet in close contact with the earth in my own little patch of backyard. Yesterday I spent some time with Oliver laying in the grass in our backyard, gazing up at the tree and the sky and the clouds. It has been a long time since I did that, maybe since I was a child myself. It reminded me what it is like to be a little person in a big person's world. It was also quite itchy laying in the grass like that. Oliver  is  making some progress though on his use of language. He is repeating more: both immediately and delayed. If I help him point to objects and then label them he will ususally try to repeat what I've said if I give him the space and time. Or if he is upset or confused he might also repeat what was just said. I know this is a good sign but I am also trying hard not to get so excited that I begin to pressure him into performing. The three words for celebration this week are: \"Bye\", \"Oliver\", and \"Yes\". All of which have consistently been heard from a little special someone who moves me beyond words.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/07/beyond-words.html", "title": "\nBeyond Words\n"},
{"date": "November 03, 2010", "body": "\nRemember awhile back when I posted  this link to the bubble wrap website ? Oliver had taken quite a liking to it and I predicted that soon he would have the mouse/cursor thing figured out. I had, from time to time, tried to get the boy to use the computer but learning how to use the mouse or track pad did not come easily to my boy who really struggles with eye-hand coordination. But I was right about the bubble wrap and learning this skill opened up a whole new world in terms of computer-based learning. \n \nWe own a couple of copies of  Rosetta Stone  language learning software -- I'm perpetually trying to learn German (and I'm actually making headway these days, danke!) so that one day I can actually converse with my mother-in-law. And RT studied Spanish throughout high school. If you aren't familiar with Rosetta Stone, it is marketed as the \"Dynamic Immersion method.\" And now that I'm using the new, online learning system, I have to say that it is pretty remarkable. You never really have a grammar lesson but you are gradually introduced to more and more complex language through reading, writing, speaking and visuals. (And the pictures? They are  goregous !) So, for a long time, I thought it would be cool to see how Oliver would do using the English learning software. But since he didn't have the cursor thing worked out it didn't make sense to try. \n \nLast Friday we finally sat down to try. And do you know what? I was amazed at how Oliver breezed through the initial parts. Intuitively he knew what to do each time a response was required from him -- either speaking or matching a picture to a verbally given description. The verbs and the colors are easy. He does have trouble distinguishing between, for example, \"woman\" and \"women\", \"he\" and \"she\" but does usually get \"they\". \n \nWhat is really cool about the program is that it gives me another little window into what Oliver understands and what he doesn't. Also, it was gratifying to see that he picked up the system right away -- no explaining necessary. Some of the content is hard for him but he LOVES sitting at the computer and going through the lessons. And every time he gets one right his face just completely lights up and he turns to me as if to say: \"See, Mom? I get it! I know the answer!\" \n \nKind of makes me realize for about the one thousandth time that usually it is all about how we ask the questions!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/southwark/accounts/staff/samlinton/web/Smartboard%20Materials/Southwark%20Interactive%20Whiteboards/Notebook%20Resources/Games%20and%20Extras/bubblewrap1.swf", "http://www.rosettastone.com/nolang?pc=semet10&cid=se-gg&gclid=CJ_T-ayPhqUCFRYM2god4De6QQ"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/11/it-all-began-with-bubble-wrap.html", "title": "\nIt all began with the bubble wrap\n"},

{"date": "December 06, 2010", "body": "\n So, one of the really great things about RDI is that it has made us very conscious of the many ways that we can involve Sami and Oliver in the everyday, mundane details of life. Over the years, I confess, it hasn't always been fun to involve the kids in the shopping and the cooking and the cleaning and all the other errands that pile up each week. But spending that time together, doing things together, modeling my thinking for the kids and helping them find many ways to participate in our lives together has ultimately been very rewarding. The real goal of working through all this stuff with my kids isn't about teaching them how to do the laundry or make a bed -- it's about executive functioning: what do you do when you are faced with something that isn't working out as we expect? How do you know when you've done something good enough? How do you plan? How do you evaluate and choose between two things that are similar? In RDI, this is what we call apprenticeship in thinking and now that the kids are getting older I can clearly see how it is benefiting both of them; each in their own way. \n \nBut the side benefit is, of course, that they were also learning to be independent. With Sami, I suppose he would have managed to pick all this up along the way, regardless of my efforts. But Oliver? He is eight and working independently is just not one of his strong suits -- to put it mildly. This weekend, however, I began to take note of just how far he has come in this, too. Shooing the kids into their room to clean up, I suggested that Oliver pick up the items on the floor and Sami make the bed. At first, Oliver kind of wandered around in a not very directed kind of way and I figured he probably needed some more help so I said: \"How about if you start with the cars, Oliver.\" And then? I stood back and watched him put every car in the right spot. Then he moved onto the books and finally the random toys laying in a heap. Meanwhile, Sami made the bed and they finished up by working together to stack the giant cardboard blocks and then vacuuming. All without a word from me.  \n \nNow I know that two kids, five and eight, cleaning their room together might sound like no great shakes to some. But if you only knew how many times I wondered if I would have to stand forever beside my boy, telling him the next thing to do, then you would understand why a little piece of the dread I carry around with me when I think about what the future might hold for my boy evaporated. \n \nAnd it helped that my house was spotless by the end of the day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TP0HH7cWz_I/AAAAAAAAAto/pXuQqG0NLus/s1600/IMG_2302.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TP0HLrHaBrI/AAAAAAAAAts/4QjsPGZpzsQ/s1600/IMG_2304.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/12/learning-by-cleaning.html", "title": "\nLearning by cleaning\n"},
{"date": "April 17, 2012", "body": "\nWhoa! Lookee here: A blog! With my name on it! Imagine that!  \n \nFor the first time in, well, fifteen months, I'm staring at my little expanse of blogspace here and thinking of all the things that I could say to fill it up. I've got quite a story to tell. It's epic. Profound. Life-changing. You might not even believe it. There are times when I'm in a state of sheer disbelief, myself. \n \nSo that's what I'm going to do: tell the story. At least the parts of it that I know. You see, it's still unfolding and every day things are both a little more fantastic and a little more clear. But it has not yet ceased to be amazing. And I want to tell it because I think maybe what is happening inside the walls of our little green house might be useful in some way to other people. \n \nA year ago, I quit the blog. It wasn't anything I'd thought about. I didn't sign off in any thoughtful or dramatic way. I just quit writing. I suppose I expected that I would post again one day but for one reason or another I just didn't. \n \nWriting about our journey with autism had always helped me process the experience, to sort out the complicated mix of thoughts and emotions. But in that year prior to my last entry, I was having trouble figuring out how to write about something. Twice that year, I had been gently told by people whom I trusted (our developmental pediatrician and the school psychologist) that I should start facing the fact that Oliver was intellectually disabled and that -- I'm paraphrasing here -- I shouldn't expect very much from him. You see, at the age of eight Oliver was still only able to communicate at the most basic level. And he was never able to demonstrate much intellectual ability through any kind of testing. I went through a bit of a crisis at the time. It wasn't that I would love Oliver any less if he had a greatly diminished capacity to learn, it was more that I just didn't believe it -- despite the fact that there was so much that Oliver could not or would not do. But for the first time in the five years since we learned of his autism, I started questioning what I believed to be true about Oliver: was all my faith, hope and optimism built on the blind love of a mother? It was a rough couple of months for me. I was a complete fool. \n \nSomewhere along the way, mid-year perhaps, I came to my senses and just decided to let it all go. The tests, evaluations and learned opinions of professionals had never really been of much use to us. In the end, we just have to go with the boy in front of us and help him achieve to the best of his potential. Even if they are right, I decided, it doesn't change a thing about how we think about today and tomorrow. \n \nI'm not even sure how to continue this story. Because, you see, one thing almost certainly doesn't lead to the next in this amazing tale. Telling you of our homeschooling efforts, for example -- the weeks and weeks of labored progress with the Bob Books series and my excitement over Oliver's slow but growing phonemic awareness\u00a0 -- would only be a red herring. So instead, I'll just tell you the story of the day at the end of March 2012 when I put the pen in Oliver's hand. I needed to do something different that day. I was bored with all the things we had been doing and thought we might work on copying. Oliver was pretty good at tracing shapes and letters, but he has never been able to draw one on his own. If you put a writing instrument in his hand and asked him to draw a square, he might start off accurately but then inevitably end in random scribbling, not able to finish the shape. \n \nBut on this day, something slightly different happened. I wrote out 6 or 7 letters of the alphabet and told him we would practice writing them. I left my hand cupped around his to help him remember to rest his hand on the paper as he wrote. And do you know? The boy seemed to write beautifully and with great ease. I wrote out the numbers one through ten and he did it again. I wrote out: \"My name is Oliver,\" and he did it again. I was buoyed and excited but I didn't want to push it. But each day I challenged him a little bit more. \n \nAfter two days, I realized he didn't need to copy my sentences. If I kept my hand very lightly cupped over his, he could write whatever I asked him to. Soon, I was writing out questions, helping him read them aloud, and growing more and more astonished that he could answer my questions in writing with perfect spelling, perfect grammar. Not long after that, I realized that Oliver could read much, much more than he could say. It was a Saturday morning when we had the exchange pictured below and our lives have not been quite the same since. \n \n \nI'm not sure where all this is going. It feels pretty remarkable. Three weeks ago I wasn't even sure if Oliver knew his last name. Two days ago he read a book about dinosaurs and explained to me, in writing, what the word extinct means.  \n \nThe funny thing is, as I reflect on it tonight, our life hasn't really changed all that much. Suddenly we know that Oliver knows a good deal more than we thought he did. Each day we're astounded by what he is able to communicate through writing. It feels pretty good to have my belief in Oliver finally validated in a way that the rest of the word values even though I wish I could say that I don't give a shit. But we still feel like we're flying by the seat of our pants with this little guy.  \n \nLucky for us, he sort of seems like he knows what he's doing and is very tolerant of his befuddled parents.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MGMCf--y4YI/T44mHiPYW6I/AAAAAAAAAug/Z_c9prH109w/s1600/Oliver.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/04/flying-by-seat-of-our-pants.html", "title": "\nFlying by the seat of our pants\n"},
{"date": "May 06, 2012", "body": "\nYou may be wondering about Oliver's first piano lesson last week. Well, I was there and I'm still wondering about it.  \n \nI hired a friend -- someone Oliver knows a little; a musician who plays the piano but doesn't necessarily know how to teach it. I chose Greg because over the years I've watched him interact with children and he is blessed with a natural reserve of patience and creativity. I talked to him beforehand about what we've been learning about how Oliver learns and I counted on his ability to think outside the box. \n \nThe lesson itself was pretty unremarkable. Oliver was very anxious. He did not want to sit at the piano with Greg. In fact, he did not want to sit at the piano at all. But he did agree to stay in the room and listen. And he did agree to let Greg come back next week. In the meantime, he was asked to practice Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. The notes are marked on the keys and he has the corresponding numbers marked on a sheet of paper. \n \nBut what is most interesting is what happened two days after the lesson. I asked Oliver to sit down at the piano with me one day to practice. He did not want to do it. Undaunted, I put the song aside and just asked him to make some sounds on the piano with me. He did not want to do it. I mean he  really  didn't want to do it. The more I pressed the more he objected. \n \nSo I launched into a little pep talk about practicing. It is important to know that a person can get better at something over time, I told him. And I reminded him about how he fell down a lot when he first learned to ride his bike but that now he is such a great rider. I think I went on and on a bit. At one point, Oliver took the pen and wrote: \"I want to play well.\" And that just added more fuel to the pep talk -- you know: every great musician started out as a beginner, blah, blah, blah, that sort of thing. \n \nThen, Oliver took the pen again and wrote: \"I know what would help.\"  \n \n\"What, Oliver? Please: Tell me!!\" \n \nTo which he replied: \"I must have a tape recording of Debussy.\" \n \nAt this point can I just stop and tell you how amazing that sentence is on so many levels? I must have a tape recording of Debussy. I don't know which part I love more. The \"must have\" part melts my heart. And  tape recording ? Where did he get that?  Debussy ? Why  must it be  Debussy? I think I've repeated that sentence in all its glory to myself about a thousand times since Thursday. \n \nI must have a tape recording of Debussy. \n \nI think it is the most beautiful sentence I've ever heard. \n \nAfter that I spent a few minutes clarifying the request and within a half hour the kid had nine mp3 tracks downloaded onto the iPad. But as I was getting it all ready the questions just kept coming and despite my agreement to ask Oliver fewer questions, I couldn't help myself. \n \nMe: Oliver, how will listening to these songs help you learn to play the piano? \nOliver: I can listen and hear the notes. \nMe: But how will you know where to put your hands on the keys to make those notes? \nOliver ( giggling  as if that is the funniest thing he ever heard):\u00a0 \"I'm really smart!\" \n \nUm, OK. I honestly just don't know what to think. The kid wants to play Debussy and I suddenly have no doubt that he is somehow figuring out how to do it in the same stealth way that he figured out how to read and do math. But I'll tell you that I don't have the slightest idea about what I can do to help him along the way and it is  killing  me! Do I just stand back and let him do his thing? Is there something more I could be doing? Somehow I don't think figuring out the notes to Twinkle Twinkle is what he needs.  \n \nAny musicians out there in the peanut gallery? I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/05/twinkle-twinkle-to-debussy-in-one-post.html", "title": "\nTwinkle Twinkle to Debussy in one post\n"},
{"date": "December 04, 2010", "body": "\nBefore bed tonight, the boys and I were all snuggled down with the iPad, ready to watch chapter 3 of Rockford's Rock Opera (a totally awesome \"ecological musical story\" about extinction -- how's that for bedtime fare?), when Nik called out to Oliver that it was time to brush his teeth. \"No, Thanks.\" he replied. So I joked: \"C'mon, Oliver, tell us how you really feel about it.\" and he said: \"I don't want to brush my teeth.\" This wasn't an argument that he was going to win, but still! Pretty awesome if you ask me. \n \nI tell you that by way of introduction to the real story behind this post, which is about working with the professionals that work with my son. Some of you may know that I had a pretty stressful experience with a couple of speech therapists over the summer. We were trying to find a new SLP, one who was a medicaid provider, so that Oliver could have speech all year long as opposed to nine months of the year as provided for by the school district. \n \nWhat followed was a harrowing experience. The new SLP was a very sweet, well-meaning and caring individual who  wanted  to work with Oliver. And she had  some  experience working with kids on the spectrum. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough. Oliver balked at even going in to the building, she felt frustrated after each session, I felt like throwing up and I always ended up apologizing to Oliver for putting him through it. But the thing is? I wanted it to work out. I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt even when I saw that she couldn't, or wouldn't, incorporate my feedback.\u00a0 For example, I suggested each week that she needed to incorporate more processing time for Oliver, that she should probably refrain from talking SO LOUDLY and that she could, after all, talk to him like an eight year old, not a baby (someday I'll write a rant about \"therapy speech\", which is right up there on my list of most hated things with sentences like: \"Good sitting!\" Attention all therapists: can you just try to be authentic with my child??). I also suggested that maybe it shouldn't matter if he got up from the table now and then and hopped around the room -- stuff like that. \n \nAnyway, after six or eight weeks of this I was really ready to hang myself. And at the end of each session I would try to be positive and enthusiastic but really I was just super frustrated and saddened by another well meaning professional who looked at Oliver as a child who could not learn because of his \"behaviors\".\u00a0 Carefully, diplomatically, I tried to explain that Oliver was  responding  to her and that, perhaps, by changing her approach she might also influence what he was able to accomplish. Why is this so hard to understand?  Of course  we respond to the person we are interacting with!  Of course  it impacts our behavior. This is true for everyone but maybe more so for kids who are so sensitive to the environment. But of course kids on the spectrum -- especially kids like Oliver -- aren't thought to be socially aware and so it becomes easy to throw one's hands up in the air and explain behaviors in terms of their \"deficits.\" \n \nAt the start of the school year we happily went back to our old SLP, who is wonderful. I was, however, a little ambivalent when she told me that she would be supervising a graduate student intern who would be working with Oliver. On Thursday I listened to the session through the half-opened door and thought a lot about what I was hearing. Immediately I could tell that she was using far too much language, not allowing Oliver to process -- the result was that Oliver would verbally respond but without any thought whatsoever, rendering most of the session useless. The other thing I wondered about was this: why was it that she was struggling to get Oliver to respond using two word utterances when he is clearly producing much more complex language at home? \n \nWhen the session was Over I went in and asked if I could share my observations and was gratified that both the SLP and the intern were enthusiastically receptive. When I brought up the question about language complexity, the student quickly assumed that this was a matter of generalization -- he could do it at home but not in the clinic (which I politely dismissed). After further discussion though, a light bulb went off for the SLP and she said: \"It's all about partner expectations!\" And there we have it: I know Oliver has full, complete, grammatically correct sentences in there and I won't let him get away with \"want spin.\" But if you don't believe he is able to achieve more than that why would you even try? And Oliver, of course, is responding to the person he is interacting with: if you don't expect anything from him that is exactly what you will get. \n \nI left the clinic feeling positively bouyant and hopeful. Because I know my boy has a long way to go but he  will  get there. And the getting there will be easier if I can keep finding professionals who are willing and able to turn the lens on themselves from time to time -- Lord knows I do it more often than I'd like to admit! \n \nSo tonight after the teeth were brushed and chapter three of the rock opera had concluded I asked Oliver to turn out the light, to which he responded, \"No, thanks!\" And then: \"I. want. to. play. with. the. iPad.\"\u00a0\u00a0 He didn't win that argument either but I expect there will be many more in our future.

{"date": "April 30, 2012", "body": "\nWe had a few sad moments in our little green house yesterday. \n \nThe day had been full, punctuated by two long, wonderful bike rides. Sunshine and warmer temperatures were a big improvement from the day before when the weather kept us inside pretty much all day. After dinner I dashed outside to get some gardening work done while everyone else was unwinding: Sami with a library-borrowed episode of Bonanza, Oliver with the iPad and Nik with the Economist. But as I worked I heard Oliver through the open window growing more and more vocally distressed. At one point I even came inside to see what was going on only to find him on the couch still with the iPad and not looking all that upset. So I returned to my garden. Sometimes it is hard to know. What sounds like distress might be something else entirely. Years of relying solely on these clues from Oliver have made me pretty attuned to his emotional state, but for a boy who laughs and giggles equally when he is happy as when he is anxious, sometimes it is just hard to know.  \n \nSoon, however, it became apparent that Oliver was, indeed, quite upset. Big crocodile tears and sobs to make your heart break told us how he was feeling but not why. And despite the fact that Oliver is now relatively conversant with pen and paper, it surprises me how many moments like the one I'm describing still occur. How do you shove a pen and paper in the hands of sobbing nine year old and get him to focus on explaining himself? How do you know that there is something on his mind, something bothering him, something that will lead to this kind of upset without asking him all the time? Figuring all this out is part of the process. After so many years of hoping that Oliver would learn to communicate, I guess I just imagined that when he did a lot of these problems would somehow also be magically solved. So I find it surprising now to find ourselves in this odd state of being -- between what we were and what we're becoming. \n \nLater, after Oliver had taken a shower and dressed in his favorite pajamas, I did ask. \n \n\"Oliver,\" I wrote, \"Why were you crying earlier?\" \nTo which he answered: \"I wanted to go to the park.\" \nMe: What Park? \nOliver: Waterman. \nMe: Why didn't you tell us? \nOliver: I can't talk! \nMe: But you CAN write, Oliver! \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: So why didn't you bring a paper and pen to tell us? \nOliver: I couldn't do that every time! \nMe: Yes you can! And I will listen every time, Oliver! \nOliver: OK. \n \nI don't know how hard writing is for Oliver. It certainly seems very easy for him from where I'm standing. It almost appears to be without effort. Although maybe that is because I still find it so surprising that he can do it at all. He has told me that it is hard for him but not why -- is it the physical part? Anxiety? Confidence? I hope I'll understand more one day so I can help make it easier for him. I hope he'll soon learn that his words have incredible meaning and power. \n \nIn the meantime, pen and paper now litter every table and counter in the house. And the stacks of scribbled conversations grow taller by the day proving, my friends, that anything can happen.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/04/not-exactly-walk-in-park.html", "title": "\nNot quite a walk in the park\n"},

Here was a boy with few words. 100 maybe? 200? They were the ones he needed. He  could  say: \"Can I have some water?\"\u00a0  with support  but usually the single word \"Water!\" was enough to get what he wanted. \n \nWithin the space of three weeks I now find myself having complex conversations with this same kid. Where did I put all those exclamation points? Cause that's a sentence that certainly deserves one!! \n \nAnd what do we talk about? Everything. And nothing much. Turns out they are pretty much the same thing. Think about the conversations you had with your spouse and your kids this morning. You traded all the information you needed. You talked about your thoughts, ideas, feelings and opinions. The weather. Lunch plans. What to have for breakfast.\u00a0 But it all probably didn't amount to much.

Our normal at the moment is so profound! All these years I had tried to get inside Oliver's head, to figure out his thoughts, ideas, feelings and opinions -- but really, there is just so much 100 words can convey. And now? He can tell me that the kid at the park shouted at him to go away and that it made him feel bad but that he just ignored it. He can tell me that he likes swimming in the ocean and that he also likes oatmeal but he is kind of sick of it right now and definitely doesn't want to eat it for breakfast again. \n \nAnd he can tell me that he also knows how to add, subtract and multiply because: \"I saw it in one of RT's books. .... when I was about five.\" And when I stare at him in wonder and disbelief he can also say \"I'm just really smart, Mom.\"\u00a0  \n \nHe can also tell me that he prefers writing because when he speaks he has a hard time finding his words.

Here is the result: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMy first thought was: \"Thank God we have a piano!\" But believe me, if the kid had asked for an upright bass, I would have run right out to buy one. \n \nSami can make long lists of the things he wants to try, have, learn about and avoid. Exploring his interests is easy. But for a kid with little language, and for whom communication is so difficult, figuring these same things out becomes a series of trial and error.\u00a0  \n \nFinding out that my boy wants to be a musician when he grows up is nothing short of a miracle. This is a kid who, just a few short days ago, had nothing but the present. He had no past or future tense. He couldn't even reliably answer a yes/no question. He still can't. Not verbally. It is absolutely astounding and confounding. \n \nBut I slept fitfully last night because I can't help but wonder why. Why is this possible for Oliver now?

If this is possible for Oliver, it must be possible for legions of others. \n \nI wish I had more to offer than our story and some words on a piece of paper. But who knows? I'll bet someday soon Oliver will have something to say on the subject.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uKWdhhfIn0U/T5PW3X6wz0I/AAAAAAAAAuo/GGD_raftn5k/s1600/future+rock+star.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/04/it-was-four.html", "title": "\nOliver the rock star\n"},

{"date": "May 08, 2012", "body": "\nI used to tell people that Oliver understood everything that was said. This wasn't always the case. I remember many times when I despaired because he didn't understand even the most basic things. Gradually, and with a lot of attention, that changed. But, of course, without a certain kind of back and forth dialog that most people take for granted, I no way of truly knowing how much of the world around him Oliver understood. Beyond his ability to execute actions upon request, there was really so little I could know for certain about his comprehension. And some days, in fact, his ability to even follow directions -- especially certain kinds of directions -- was compromised. \n \nThe last time Oliver was up for his triennial review (for those not in the know, this is a process undertaken by the public schools to determine a child's continued eligibility for special education services. Even though we homeschool, Oliver still receives speech services -- 1hr per week, 9 months of the year! -- through the school system.) he did very, extremely, incredibly poorly on every test they tried to administer. And they made all kinds of allowances. They came to our home.\u00a0 They even let me try to ask some of the questions. I've mostly blocked the whole experience out, but I do remember standing and watching as Oliver could not answer question after question -- simple things like: point to (or show me) the triangle. Oliver seemed not to understand what was being asked of him. First he would point to the picture of the triangle, then he would shift and look at the examiner questioningly and then he would point to each of the other pictures. It was impossible for her to know if he knew what a triangle was or if he really didn't understand what he was being asked to do. Inside I was screaming: \"He knows this! He knows what a triangle is!\" But even I had to admit that it looked like Oliver just really lacked the most basic understanding of the world around him. Even though I knew it was not true it was very hard for me to reconcile what I knew about my boy and what I saw that day. \n \nI don't remember if I got a written document outlining the results of that day. If I did I ripped it up and threw it away. I don't keep file folders full of those documents, just the one round filing bin. Oliver obviously qualified for services and that was all that mattered. But after that I promised Oliver and myself that I would never make him take another one of those tests. What was the point, really? I knew the test was failing Oliver and not the other way around.  \n \nSo the other day I sat down with Oliver in a quiet moment and told him how proud I was of him and that I have always been proud of him. I wanted him to know that we don't love him more now that he can communicate. I also explained to Oliver that he was not the only person out there who can't talk, that there are many others like him. He took the pen from me and wrote: \n \n\"They should keep trying. Nobody else will be able to unlock them.\" \n \n\"Were you locked, Oliver?\" I asked. \n \n\"Yes.\" \n \n\"What unlocked you?\" \n \n\"I started to write.\"  \n \n\"Oliver, why can you write now when you couldn't before?\" \n \n\"Because I was blocked. I'm not blocked anymore.\" \n \n \nThis conversation might not tell us all that much but it's gratifying to me for many reasons. It seems he is saying that whatever has shifted for him, allowing him to communicate at the age of nine, was internal, not something that was done to him.  \n \nI wonder if Oliver will ever be able to tell us more than that. I \nimagine that it was a complicated untangling of many things. I like to \nimagine all the work his brain was doing while he slept, while he was \nriding his bike and when we were rock-hopping through the woods. The absolute grace that Oliver has always exhibited when doing those last two things never helped him a single bit on all those tests he had to endure. But its what kept us going all those years and I have to believe its an important part of Oliver's story.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fxQNDQ4B-xc/T6k9Qbsh73I/AAAAAAAAAvE/LOz8vKsS_I0/s1600/ipad+pictures+174.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/05/untangling-story-line.html", "title": "\nUntangling the story line\n"},
{"date": "May 02, 2012", "body": "\nToday was a day full of apologies -- at least four of them that I can remember. The first apology of the day was made to a dear old friend and offered in the face of a broken promise. Another apology went to Sami when he pointed out that I was preoccupied and not listening to him fully. But it is the other two apologies that I want to write about here. \n \nOne of those apologies went to Oliver. \n \nThe last week or so has been tough on all of us. Inexplicably -- or seemingly so -- Oliver started behaving in a manner that was trying everyone's patience. There was lots and lots and lots of whining about everything. Lots of resistance to everyday activities. Lots of darting away. And lots of outright disobedience. As the days passed my patience did too. But that isn't a great measure of anything -- I'm not a patient person by nature. Rachel, on the other hand, is. Rachel is the young woman who has been Oliver's attendant for the last couple of years and I've submitted her name for possible sainthood. So when Rachel comes to me and says she is at her wits end (no, she doesn't say: \"he's driving me craaaazy\" as I might, she says: \"I just don't know how to help him be more comfortable.\"\u00a0 See? She IS a saint.) Then I know for sure that something is going on and I go into sleuth mode. If you are the parent of a child with autism then you know what I'm talking about. I looked at the situation from all angles and tried to figure out how 2+2 somehow equaled 5. \n \nBUT! Oliver can communicate now! Aha! I thought. I'll just ask him!!! And so I did. Or at least I tried. And tried again. I phrased the question a little differently each time. I tried asking him questions about things I thought  might  be the issue.I tried asking him specific questions.\u00a0 I tried asking him open-ended questions. But each time he answered without giving me any useful information. Like the following exchange: \n \nMe: Oliver, why are you so upset lately? \nOliver: Because I want to go on the computer. \nMe: But in general you seem very sad and angry everyday. Can you tell me why? \nOliver: I want to go outside. \n \nEvery so often I would try again. And I tried to also ask him frequently throughout the day for input into the things that were happening around him. What would he like? What was he feeling? Did he want to tell me anything?  \n \nThen, this afternoon he grew distressed when we sat down together at the piano. On the distress scale of 1 to 10, with ten being a meltdown, it was more like a 3. But it was the cumulative effect of days and days of hovering around a 3 or 4 that was wearing us all down and I was determined to figure it out. So I pulled Oliver to the couch with a pen and paper and tried again. \n \nMe: Oliver, why are you so upset about playing the piano? \nOliver: Because it is too hard. \nMe: What makes it hard for you? \nOliver: Please would you stop asking so many questions! \n \nAnd then, everything clicked into focus. I had so badly wanted to hear what Oliver had to say but I wasn't really listening. He had told me how hard it was for him to write numerous times. For nine years he has related to the world in one way and now, almost overnight, there is this new -- enormous -- expectation that he relate to the world differently. I wasn't thinking about how overwhelming it must feel for him. \n \nOne of the initial lessons an RDI parent learns is to think carefully about how we are verbally communicating with our children. Normal, everyday dialog between communication partners is something like 80% experience sharing language (comments, exclamations, statements) and 20% questions. But somehow, when you introduce a child with autism to the equation, that ratio gets turned around and we wind up asking the poor kid questions all day long. We are so desperate to know what they know, think, and feel that we inadvertently challenge them to perform every time we communicate with them. Think of what it would feel like to be constantly expected to do the thing that is the hardest for you. And that, somehow, is what I did to Oliver.  \n \nIt hit me like a ton of bricks. \n \nAnd so I apologized. And I thanked Oliver for telling me how he felt. And for putting up with me. \n \nBefore bed tonight, I pulled him aside and wrote: \n \n\"I hope I'm doing a better job not asking questions.\" To which he responded: \"Yes you are.\" \nMe: Thank you for telling me how you felt. \nOliver: You're welcome. \nMe: You still look sad. \nOliver: I'm not. I'm very happy. \n \nSo, the last apology that I offered today (I hope) was to myself. I was pretty hard on myself after Oliver's revelation. I tried not to imagine how trying I've been for my boy. I tried to forget how frustrated I've felt with him for the past week. I wish there were some rule book or coach. But there isn't. At the end of the day there is just me and the boy navigating this adventure together. And I hope I can be forgiven for forgetting that often the most meaningful answers are to questions never asked.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/05/apologies.html", "title": "\nApologies\n"},
{"date": "December 16, 2010", "body": "\nThis is going to sound like a big complaining post but that isn't the way I intend it. It's less of a complaint and more of an observation that can be generalized to, well, lots of interactions with professionals. You see, I take Oliver to a completely awesome pediatric dentist. Every parent I know who has a kid with autism takes their child to this dentist. The guy has a waiting list for his practice. But if you have a kid with autism? You go to the top of the list. Someone told me that the man is a Christian and that he sees his work as a service to God -- or something like that. I don't know about that but what I can tell you is that I'm sure God is most definitely pleased with this guy. Like I said: he's awesome from the clown printed surgical mask he wears right on up to the surfboards and fish hanging from the ceiling.  \n \nAnyway, I have on occasion (OK, every visit) had to remind him that standing just to the side and behind Oliver and reaching around his head is not such a good idea. I think it freaks the boy out that suddenly two disembodied gloved hands are trying to reach into his mouth. When you think of it, that IS a little freaky, right? So Mr. Awesome Dentist always graciously moves forward and tackles the job head on, which is much more tolerable for Oliver. \n \nBut now here is where I get to the observation part. Oliver hates to have his teeth brushed, although the two of us long ago reached a kind of d\u00e9tente and now I can do it with minimal complaint from the boy. However, Oliver readily -- easily -- lets me floss his teeth and lightly scrape them with the $10 set of dental instruments I bought at CVS (which I've been doing for years, mainly to make visits to the dentist easier all around). I might even say that he likes it as he will often bring me the dental floss or a scraper and ask me to clean his teeth. \n \nI explained all this to the dentist. Multiple times. But he has his kind of routine about getting kids who are often traumatized by dental exams to feel comfortable and that proceeds incrementally towards a full cleaning. And that's OK. I get why he does it this way and I really respect his time and patience and dedication to care for kids like Oliver. \n \nBUT. \n \nToday the teeth-brushing part went kind of rough, probably because it started with the whole disembodied hand thing. And when I suggested that he try cleaning with the instruments the idea was shot down. I distinctly got the feeling that he thought I was trying to rush Oliver too fast. Then, perhaps to make me feel better, he tried flossing Oliver's teeth. When he saw how relaxed and cooperative Oliver became, he remarked that most kids don't tolerate that at all. Next time, he said happily, I think he'll be ready for the instruments!  \n \nNow, maybe this sounds kind of picky and, you know, it probably is. But um. ... oh, never mind. I'm just the mother.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/12/im-just-mother.html", "title": "\nI'm just the mother\n"},
{"date": "May 10, 2012", "body": "\nOliver told me again to get the hell off his back. Or at least I'm pretty sure that's what he  felt  like saying. But instead, after a few rough moments, he wrote: \"You are asking too many ques. ..\"\u00a0 He's taken to not completing words when he knows that his meaning is understood. Pretty smart, that guy. \n \nBut here's the thing: how can I NOT ask questions? It's almost physically and emotionally impossible. I am really, really, really trying to also share with him how I'm thinking and feeling. And I'm trying hard to give him the space in which to do nothing because he seems to need it at the moment. I know how that feels. I am surprised by how often I've found myself just staring blankly into space. I feel overwhelmed and I'm sure Oliver does too. \n \nLong time readers of this blog know that I chose to homeschool Oliver  after a really dismal visit to what would have been his Kindergarten classroom . Teaching your child at home is a pretty hefty responsibility. With Sami I have little fear of that responsibility: he has a natural curiosity and a drive to learn that leaves me breathless. Oliver on the other hand? Well, Oliver has a lot of anxiety about not doing things the right way, about getting it wrong. He is hesitant to try new things and that kinda gets in the way of lots of learning contexts.\u00a0 But somehow that kid has learned an awful lot! So in this new upside down world of ours I've abbreviated our homeschool time to just 20 minutes per day and I'm using that time to try and figure out what I should be teaching the boy.  \n \nA few days ago I gave him a book called How Things Work and opened it to a page about the brakes on a bicycle. I wanted to find out how well Oliver understands what he is reading and to determine his reading level. So I asked him if he could tell me what the article was about. After barely glancing at the page of text he wrote: \"When you squeeze the brakes on a bike it creates friction that stops it from moving.\"\u00a0 Pretty good summary, huh? So today I used that reading from a few days ago to see how well he retained information. This is how our conversation went: \n \nMe: Oliver, do you remember how brakes on a bike work? \nOliver: When you squeeze them they make friction. \nMe: Do you know anything else that makes friction? \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: What? \nOliver: everything. \nMe: What do you mean? \nOliver: Everything moves against air. \n \nThen:  \nMe: Oliver, do you know the three states of matter? \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: What are they? \nOliver: Solid liquid gas \nMe: Do you know the planets? \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: Will you name them for me? \nOliver: Mercury, venus, earth, mars, neptune uranus pluto. \nMe: Wow, that's great. There are actually two more. Jupiter and Saturn. \nOliver: Oh. \nMe: Do you know how a plant gets the energy to grow? \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: Will you tell me? \nOliver: photosyn. ... \nMe: Do you remember everything you hear and see, Oliver? \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: That must be hard. \nOliver: It is.  \n \nI don't know if that's true. How can it be true? But one thing is certain: the boy knows far, far more than anyone -- including yours truly -- gave him credit for just a few short weeks ago. I wish I could climb inside his head and take a look around for an hour or two. This random drilling for information is not the way to go, I know that. It's upsetting to him and it's just too random help much. So I've declared that today was the last day of school for the year! I just made that up as I sit here typing and without even thinking about it I know that it is the right thing to do. Maybe I need to just sit awhile with Oliver, not ask anything of him, and see how things unfold. \n \nIsn't it funny how the more things change the more they stay the same?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/05/lets-sit-awhile-shall-we.html", "title": "\nLet's sit awhile, shall we?\n"},

{"date": "May 15, 2012", "body": "\nSome pretty remarkable things are happening in our little green house and, as you can imagine, I just want to  talk  about it. This blog has been a good outlet but I'm out of practice and I have to admit that I feel a little uncomfortable sharing our story sometimes. Thousands of people have visited this blog since I started writing again and that feels a little weird. Part of the reason I continue though is that so many have told me what our story has meant to them.\u00a0  \n \nAnd then there is this other reason. The one behind today's post.  \n \nFor the first few weeks after Oliver began communicating I kept telling people about what was going on thinking:  Someone should DO something.  Like, you know,  someone else.  Someone with more knowledge and understanding about boys who can't communicate much at all and then suddenly open up like the unfolding of the most beautiful flower you've ever seen. What I've found most remarkable is that I haven't had to struggle or teach him anything. It was all laying just below the surface, a bundle of potential just waiting until this moment. \n \nBut, how do I explain this to the people around me in a way that makes sense? I was at a gathering a few weeks back. Oliver had just that day -- the  hour  before -- told me that he could multiply and that he learned it from looking in one of RT's** school books years ago. Skeptical, I tried it out, writing out equations then handing him the pen. It was like a game of ping-pong with a fast and sure opponent. At some point I had to get up and get a calculator to keep up. \n \nSo at the gathering I found myself feeling that now-familiar dazed feeling and like  I really should be telling someone about this !!! But these were people who didn't really know Oliver. They might not have known anything much about autism come to think of it. So maybe I shouldn't have been surprised when two people said some version of: \"Wow! Maybe he'll be talking soon!\" and one person asked: \"But what are his social skills like?\" All three comments kind of brought me down -- which I didn't think possible -- and they've managed to linger in the back of my mind despite Oliver's daily incredible awesomeness. \n \nIt makes me sad to think that someone might just look straight past all this kid has achieved and can offer to those around him and see only the hand-flapping and hear only the noises he makes and take note only that the kid doesn't talk. They diminish his abilities by seeing them only in the context of what he can't do. Is this what they call ableism? Are people assuming that he has less value as he is, that the goal is to make him like everyone else? Indistinguishable from his peers? Are his achievements really nothing if he can't talk?\u00a0 If he still struggles with other things that make him so  different ?  \n \nWell, despite the fact that I kept thinking that  somebody should do something  with regards to Oliver and his new-found ability to overcome whatever obstacles were keeping him \"blocked\" until the brave age of nine -- I've long suspected that there really is no one else. It's up to Oliver. And me. And all the other people who love him to be supportive and caring despite whatever obstacles that block the rest of us from time to time.  \n \nIt's up to all of us to keep talking, to keep the conversation going, to keep telling people about the incredible awesomeness of our kids. Because Oliver is as special and amazing and singularly unique as every other person who walks on the face of the earth. No more. No less. And I want people to know it so that Oliver inherits a place in this world where his worth is never questioned. \n \nAs Temple Grandin says: Different not less.  \n \nAnd that's something that's worth talking about.  \n \n \n** RT when I started this blog, RT was, in fact, the Resident Teenager.

{"date": "November 27, 2010", "body": "\nI don't know if I can come up with the right words to describe Thanksgiving, a day that was just all kinds of perfect from beginning to end. To begin with, it started after a full night of sleep -- so really, our nine month track record of sleep gives me more than a person has a right to be thankful for! Then, when the roasted turkey gave our house the smell of Thanksgiving, I packed up the bird and headed to our local community center for the meal that has become the center of our holiday. \n \nWe are very lucky to live in a smallish city where service to others is a core value to so many. The place where we share a meal at Thanksgiving time was started by a group of people who, once a week, cooked a meal for \"anybody in the world.\" Three years ago, with a committed cast of supporters and volunteers, the group was able to buy a building, renovate it, and create a place where people in need can now eat three meals a day, every day of the week. On Thanksgiving the building is overflowing with friends, food and fun. And each year I cannot imagine a place where I would rather share a meal and give thanks. \n \nThis year, Sami asked if he could go with me and help prepare for the meal. I hesitated only because the place is thick with activity and I worried that he would be too much underfoot. But despite his small size, Sami knows how to get things done and together we set the table for 150 of our friends and then made the biggest vat of whipped cream you ever saw. And it made me very proud to see how determined Sami was to be of help. \n \nNik and Oliver joined us in time to eat, finding a space in the middle of a long, crowed table, in the middle of a very crowded room. Tradition dictates that each person present call out, in turn, one thing for which he or she is grateful. With about 180 people in the room, this takes some time -- but Oliver sat smiling through it all. Even during the moment of silent prayer (can you believe how long a minute is??), Oliver was, well, silent. But after the meal, when a whole group of kids and adults went outside to play soccer, Oliver made it clear that he was done, done, done. We left Nik and Sami to walk home after the game and snuggled up at home with a cup of hot chocolate. \n \nLater, I made a giant pot of pumpkin-ginger-cranberry soup and we walked five blocks to a neighbor's house for our second communal turkey meal of the day. Oliver and I, not much for traditional T'giving fare, were extremely thankful to see that our neighbors from El Salvador had contributed a massive bowl of beans and rice with an amazing chili sauce! And then I was content to sit back and listen to the flow of Spanish-to-English conversation, trying to sense of it as I could.  \n \nThe day ended perfectly when all the kids ran outside to jump on the trampoline and exhausted themselves!\u00a0 And all of us went to sleep fat and happy! \n \nSo yes, I'm thankful. I'm thankful that we are part of this community. I'm thankful that my kids are growing up surrounded by people who see value in every human being. And, as in years past, I'm simply happy for each of us to have a spot at the table.\u00a0\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/11/in-which-i-am-thankful-for-beans-and.html", "title": "\nIn which I am thankful for beans and rice and many other things.\n"},

And there is at least that much again on the vine outside. I ought to have my head examined! Clearly I am a warped individual. \n \nBut instead of persevarating on the tomatoes, I'll tell you a nice little story about a mostly non-verbal little boy. Oliver, it seems is figuring out this communication thing. And it is happening in great, giant, delicious bursts. Full sentences like: \"I want to sit here. Get up.\" and \"Sami, I want to draw pictures.\" and, \"Papi, can I have a quarter?\" And my personal favorite (said while handing me a plate full of green beans): \"I don't want to eat this. I want chips with cheese.\"  \n \nAll of Oliver's words and sentences are said slowly, with space in between the words, in which I imagine the words and the sounds traveling some complicated neural backwoods road.

{"date": "August 21, 2010", "body": "\nIt occurs to me that I've written a lot here about riding bikes lately. Maybe that is because it has become a very big part of our family identity and maybe it is because I continue to be thrilled each and every time I go for a ride with my kids -- Oliver in particular. It is also a little bit because everyday I appreciate that I can share this thing that I love with my boys. I don't take that for granted. \n \nOne thing in particular that blows me away each and every time we ride is how it highlights Oliver's abilities. I spend too much time thinking about dis-ability and our daily rides have become a powerful reminder that there is so much my boy can and will do in this life. For example, Nik and I communicate to the boys while riding using lots and lots of gestures: over here, go that way, turn here, get up on the sidewalk, ride on the street, come this way, stop, go, go slow, stay steady. ... it is endless and varied and amazing that Oliver flawlessly reads our non-verbal communication. Watching his ability to shift focus between the road ahead and his riding partner, making adjustments along the way, makes me endlessly proud. Incidentally, both of these things -- maintaining coordination with a partner and reading non-verbal communication -- are RDI learning objectives that we have worked on, they didn't come naturally or easily for my boy. But now they are like second nature. How cool is that? \n \nI've been teaching a friend's child to ride, just a little bit each week, and wanted to post a video showing what it looks like when a child is just starting with the gliding technique.

He likes it a bit more since we took the pedals off-- at least he is willing to get on the bike -- but declares he is walking the bike, not riding, which I think makes him feel more confident. No matter -- he is still out there, still trying and I know he will get it eventually.

{"date": "August 28, 2010", "body": "\nSeptember is approaching and I couldn't be happier. Once again, August has kicked my butt. I'm exhausted. My feet hurt from standing in the kitchen for hours and hours. My house is filthy dirty from all the produce that gets lugged in and out on a daily basis. And yet? Yesterday I brought home about 50lbs of grapes (that I got for free!!) that hopefully will soon be made into juice and jelly and will bring a bit of summer sweetness to the days ahead when we need to conjure it most. And maybe you would be surprised to hear that this is  on top of  the 75lbs that I brought home a week ago (also free, free, free!)! \n \nI write here about our efforts to eat locally and I believe that this is a manageable, important bit of activism and that it is a vital part of teaching my kids to live in this world. But unless you read between the lines you might not get a good glimpse of how much my children participate in this part of our lives. This week, for instance, the kids have worked right alongside me as I picked grapes, carried them home, sorted them, removed the stems, crushed them, stirred them, poured them into a strainer, then made jelly and juice for canning. My kids work as hard as I do, but -- between you and me? They think it's  fun ! \n \nI give most of the credit for this to RDI. If Oliver didn't have autism and I was just parenting the way I hope I might have, maybe I would have come to this kind of \"extreme cooperative venture\" parenting anyway. But probably not. Maybe it is an\u00a0 unexpected gift of autism that I've found a way to slow down and include my children in just about every thing that I do. And the truly stunning part for me is to realize how much a kid can learn about problem-solving and decision-making in little moments throughout the day that we might otherwise rush through. Like: What can we use to stir this? How do you know if a grape is good enough for the pot or should be thrown into the compost? What size bowl should we use? How do we know when it has cooked long enough? Of course each kid is contributing and being challenged on different levels, but they are both there with me, learning together. And do you know what? I am new to most of this, too. So we are learning and figuring things out together. And honestly? It feels like a grand adventure! \n \nSo yes, that is very cool and it is extremely rewarding when everything is going well -- it doesn't always, trust me! But yesterday, when we were taking a rest from the great grape escapade, I asked the kids to please go and clean their room. And can I just tell you how amazing it was to watch Oliver and Sami work together to 1) pick up all the books and put them away, 2) make the bed, 3) put their own folded clothes away and 4) vacuum the floor? I mean, Oliver blows me away. A year ago I was writing about how much trouble he was having just locating his clothes in the closet to get dressed in the mornings! All those times when we have worked together cleaning their room, problem-solving along the way and now I see that it really has come to pass that he can figure things out. Today, for instance, there were no sheets for the bed so Oliver  went from room to room looking for a sheet ! In times past he would simply have given up and gone on to do something else.  \n \nWhen I do these every day kinds of things with the kids it is never really with the intention of teaching them how to make jelly or juice or whatever. Rather, it is teaching them how to approach thinking about things: how to plan, how to react when something doesn't quite go the way we expect, how to decide when something is good enough, how to work together. But the upside? The beds are made and we will have a bit of summer sweetness to carry us through the winter months ahead!  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/08/what-goes-into-jar-of-jelly.html", "title": "\nWhat goes into a jar of jelly\n"},

I know: you could just gag, right?\u00a0 Well, maybe it is the vitamin D talking (or the Newcastle) but summer makes me feel so downright hopeful. Optimistic. Joyful.  \n \nAnyway, between the homeschooling, the garden, and the other outdoor stuff, it is shaping up to be quite a summer. Most days end with a bike ride. After dinner, when it has cooled off a bit, we head to a nearby park and ride the mountain bike trials. This is a relatively new thing for us and it has me feeling both thrilled, apprehensive, and old.\u00a0 You see, Oliver is a shining star on the mountain bike trails. He so deftly and athletically picks his way over the obstacles that he totally leaves the rest of us in the dust. It is amazing to behold. That's the part that has me thrilled. I'm apprehensive because none of us can keep up with the boy and the paths have many twists and turns so that he could easily become lost. Luckily he has had the charity to wait for us before making any turns thus far. And Old? Well, did I mention that I can't keep up?\u00a0 This is not an exaggeration. Granted, I'm the only one not riding a mountain bike (I have a hybrid), but I can't blame it all on the bike. I've become cautious. It won't be long now before Nik and the boys start suggesting that I stay home in the evenings. \n \nHow did it come to this? \n \nOn the homeschooling front, we made these cool sensory writing bag things today: \n \nYou just fill a gallon-sized ziplock bag with a mixture of tempra and finger paint and use it to trace letters and numbers with your fingers. The paint is solid enough that it holds the shape of whatever you draw. All was well and good until I heard Sami shrieking from the playroom as I was cooking dinner. When I went to investigate I initially had a heart attack as it looked like he was covered in blood. Then I discovered that he had only been writing too energetically and the ziplock had split open, covering him in red paint. I quickly then sealed Oliver's bag with plastic tape, knowing that he would do the opposite of scream if his \"accidentally\" split open. \n \nWe also had a bit of impromptu phys ed when the kids tried to break out of rest time.

I think I mentioned that a few weeks back I made a commitment to myself to focus more on teaching the boys -- especially Oliver -- to read. Well, one day, not too far into our reading odyssey, I sat down on the couch with the two boys and a small white board. Carefully I laid out the word MAT for them, starting with the sounds of the A, then the T, then the AT together, then the M. Alrighty, I said, now you have all the sounds, let's link them together and see what word this spells. Before I could say another thing, Oliver quietly read the word. He went on to read word after word and I actually saw the look on Sami's face change when he realized that his brother could do something that he could not. \n \nIt was quite a moment for all of us. \n \nSince then, Sami has actually developed a greater fluency but Oliver continues to amaze and inspire me.

{"date": "July 19, 2010", "body": "\nIt was only 11:30 in the morning and it already felt like a day when everything went wrong. Maybe it is because the night before had been one when Oliver didn't sleep much at all, breaking his string of nights slept through. If you have lived that life you know how it feels to be without patience, full of over-wrought emotions and unable to muster more than a fraction of optimism. So when I sat down to my first meal of the day, a veggie burger with tomato and onion salad, all I wanted to do was refuel my body and recharge my emotional battery with a few minutes peace. I was surprised then -- and a bit annoyed -- when Oliver sat down across from me and said in his halting way: \"I want a sandwich.\" He had only woken ninety minutes earlier and had already eaten two servings of baked oatmeal. How could he be hungry? But as you know, if your boy with limited language tells you he wants a sandwich, then by all means you fix him a sandwich. Except when you don't \n \n\"Oliver,\" I said, \"you can make yourself a sandwich if you're hungry. Would you like a grilled cheese?\" Mostly, I'll admit, I said this because I was just plain annoyed with him -- I had just finished cleaning up from his  first  meal -- and I thought my offer might stall him a bit so I could finish my burger. \n \nBeing a boy of few words he didn't answer me and I watched with curiosity to see what would happen next. After a few seconds he walked over towards the area of the kitchen where we keep the bread and the silverware. He looked around a bit and picked up some random items from the counter and set them back down again. I refrained from saying anything more. Then he opened the microwave, retrieved the bread (we keep it in there to discourage mice) and brought it over to the table where I was still watching, now with a bit of surprise, my annoyance completely faded away. \n \nLet me say, before we go any further, that Oliver has spent a LOT of time in the kitchen cooking with me so he knows where just about everything is kept. But prior to this morning I never really just turned him loose to fix his own meal. Also, as I watched him I felt that now familiar twinge of my heart muscles contracting to realize how far he has come with his receptive language ability. Only two years earlier I had sat in the same chair despairing that he didn't understand the most simple commands like \"Turn on the light,\" or, \"Get me the fork.\" \n \nBut back the cheese sandwich. When Oliver handed me the bread I placed it on the table and then turned back to look at him expectantly. I saw the look on his face that registered his understanding that I was still waiting for something and watched as he went to the refrigerator, scanned its contents and retrieved the cheese. This time when he returned to the table I noted aloud that there was another item from the fridge that we would need. Once more he returned to the fridge and found the butter. \"Ah ha,\" I said, \"now we have all the ingredients.\" Upon hearing this and perhaps thinking that he was ready to make the sandwich he sat down and took two pieces of bread from the bag, then stopped and looked at me. I looked back at him and adopted a puzzled look. Then we both just sat there for another minute or so and I held my breath, again struggling with myself to refrain from saying anything. \n \nFinally, after what felt like the longest, heaviest minute, Oliver got up and brought a knife back to the table and got to work buttering the bread, at one point declaring: \"I want some help.\" Because the butter was cold and did not spread easily. He sliced the cheese, he assembled the sandwich and then sat there looking at it. \n \nI told him, \"I can help you cook it if you get everything ready for me, Oliver.\" Then I watched as he slowly -- and thoughtfully -- retrieved a pan and placed the sandwich in it on top of the stove, dragging a chair over there in the process so he could center the bread precisely in the middle of the pan. \n \nBy this time I had finished my veggie burger and had begun to feel as though this were a day when all was right with the world.  \n \n \nTo help Oliver cook the sandwich, I merely stood to one side and adjusted the heat. He was in charge of the spatula. When he determined that the sandwich was cooked well enough, I carried it for him on the spatula to the table and stood there. \"Should I just put it on the table?\" I asked. Oliver turned to retrieve a plate but found that there wasn't a clean plate to be had. He stood for a moment, unsure, thinking. Then I watched as he retrieved a towel and spread it at his place at the table. \n \n \n \nIt occurs to me that I don't write very much any more about what we are doing with RDI. I don't want to beat anyone over the head with it. Plus, it is just so much a part of how we parent both our boys now that I sometimes forget what an important part of our lives it has become. Also, I probably don't make enough of all my uncertainties about how we are navigating this road with Oliver. We do RDI, not ABA. We homeschool. We don't have a team or IEPs or ESY. We only just started with OT (which I will post about soon). We didn't even have speech for more than a year. All of this is, well, outside the norm and I am keenly aware that we do almost everything differently than almost everyone else that we know. For the past three years I have put executive functioning first. Problem-solving, planning, reasoning --  thinking  -- this I hoped and prayed and believed was where much of our teaching efforts should go. There are other things, sure, but without executive functioning he could be the most social, verbal kid on the planet and still be in big trouble. Remember  this post  when I watched Oliver struggle to solve such a simple problem?\u00a0 That was just 18 months ago. Re-reading my words above and that post from December 2008, it is hard not to feel a bit gratified that I've chosen to follow my intuition even if it means that I sometimes (often) feel like we are completely off the grid.  \n \nI know we still have a long way to go, but even though I didn't get a bite of that sandwich, it was the most  satisfied I have ever been by two pieces of bread and a little cheese! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/07/best-grilled-cheese-sandwich-i-never.html", "title": "\nThe best grilled cheese sandwich I never ate\n"},

Although my friend married in November, she and her new husband waited until this past weekend to gather their family and friends together in celebration. My closest friends from graduate school were there and we fell into that easy rhythm that you can create with the people you carry in your heart, despite such infrequent contact. And it was so, so lovely to share such an important occasion with my friend, who deserves every ounce of happiness that this life has given her. \n \nBecause of frequent flier restrictions, I ended up flying there on Saturday and returning here to Virginia today, Sunday. And, since I flew out of our wee small local airport my total commute time round trip was fourteen hours. I didn't really mind though because it is the first time I can remember in eons when I was totally, completely alone. And what a luxury that was! I mean, of course, I was surrounded by people but I was free to focus my mind on whatever I wanted. I decided ahead of time that I would take real advantage of this and make an effort to slow my mind and not think too much. I often miss out on the feeling of things for the thinking of them. \n \nBy and large it was a great success. Here are some of the observations I made, most of which brought my thinking back to Oliver: \n Communication can be a lot of work. It feels pretty good to take a break from it once in awhile. (I've got one kid who doesn't talk and one who won't stop: it can be exhausting!) \n How I feel about myself is sometimes influenced by my perceptions of the people around me. (It's a big world out there with all kinds of people!) \n Feelings of vulnerability can be extremely anxiety producing. (I mean, I was  flying  for pete's sake!) \n Anxiety over the unfamiliar and the pressure to perform can really impact my ability to be social (Otherwise known as rental car anxiety!) \n \nAnd finally: \n \nIt is so weird this window that we get into the lives of others because of technology.\u00a0 I find it SO odd that a person would carry on a lengthy private phone call, in a normal tone of voice, in a very public and crowded place. Is this vanity? Is it a total lack of consideration? I just don't get it. Someday I'm going to get up the courage to continue the conversation with the person after he hangs up. \n I can't believe your wife did that. I mean, it sounds like you are seriously busy with all this website stuff you are working on. What did your mom say? Did she agree with you? I certainly do. And isn't that funny that you and your father are both having cataract surgery in the same year. And it is so good that you finally got to connect with your parents for that 45 minute call after having been in and out of Syracuse, Albany, the UK, the Netherlands and now Russia for the past month!

A minute into the bike ride my whole outlook changed.  Oliver, I quickly realized, has got it. He's riding. He's using the brakes to slow down on a hill and to stop when we come to a signal or road crossing. He's standing up to put more power into his pedaling on inclines. He's staying as far to the right as he can manage. We still call out to him and remind him from time to time: slow down, use your brakes. ... but mostly it has become unnecessary. He's so aware of his environment, watching us, adjusting his actions to mirror ours. Cautious but in control. And the best part? The look on his face as he rides along with us. Peaceful. Joyful. Competent. I threw away his old tennis shoes -- the ones with the holes in the toes that showed he hadn't quite mastered the brakes. His new shoes are a size and a half bigger! This time I bought the really expensive Stride Rites (well, on sale) because I knew he'd be keeping the toes until he out grew them. My boy turned seven a few days ago.

Where once I had to lay with him, singing and soothing him to sleep, he now goes easily to sleep on his own. Where once I had a boy who could not fall back asleep if he awoke in the night -- who in fact often appeared to struggle to stay awake -- I now have a boy who seems eager to fall back asleep if awakened.

{"date": "September 17, 2009", "body": "\nIf I were brave enough to go back through some of my old posts on this blog, I can imagine that I might be able to track some significant behavior issues and tie them in with the change of the seasons. We've had some rough moments in our little green house over the past few days. I hesitate to use the word rough though because in the scheme of things, the rough of today is just a blip on the radar compared to the rough of a few years ago. Last year we went through a particularly difficult period, in fact, at just about this time. The rough of today mostly looks like a super animated, can't sit still, coming out of his skin, Oliver.\u00a0 He is still smiley and happy, cooperative and game to participate in whatever, but -- whew! I am tired just watching him.  \n \nToday we went to the library. It was rainy and colder than usual and I just wanted to get out of the house. Plus, we don't get any TV reception and our stock of library VHS tapes (yes, our DVD player died) was almost two weeks old and we were in need of some new reading material. When we arrived we found that the childrens area was completely occupied by a group of adults with disabilities and their aides. Great, I thought: what perfect timing. The librarians were so occupied with this group that they wouldn't notice a young boy galloping around the young readers area. Or so I thought. A few minutes after we arrived I stood next to the librarian to ask a quick question, she answered me then glanced at Oliver, looked back at me and said: \"Autism?\"\u00a0 \"Yes,\" I smiled. She smiled back so warmly that I quickly made a mental note to schedule all of our library visits for Thursday morning. Let's just say that some of the other librarians are not as warm.  \n \nWe accomplished our mission at the library but it became increasingly clear to me that Oliver was sincerely struggling with some sensory issues. He galloped, he jumped, he hummed and at one point he even started flapping his hands -- something I have never seen him do before. Then, just as I was about to suggest that we leave, he ran up to a young, old order mennonite, woman and started hitting her. Not really hitting in an agressive way, but in a sensory seeking way that I've seen him do before. He takes both hands and claps them against part of a person's body so that the body is in between the clapping hands (strange picture, I know). Usually he does this to Sami's head!\u00a0 I have never really seen him do it to another person outside the family before.  \n \nAfter I apologized profusely to the confused looking young woman, I took Oliver aside and explained that it was NOT ok to touch another person like that. Then I asked him if he wanted to hug me. He said yes and gave me a hug that might have killed a small child. So I whispered in his ear: \"Do you want to go outside and walk around.\" \"Yes,\" he answered, \"Outside.\"\u00a0 Then I asked him if he wanted to go home and he said \"no,\" then repeated the word \"outside.\" So we went and walked around, before finally collecting our things and heading home.\u00a0 The nice part about this is that finally, finally, finally we are at a place were we can have some back and forth communication that helps us find resolve. Also, he is mostly regulated these days so disregulation stands out loud and clear. \n \nWe're also having some minor sleep issues -- not bad yet, but he is having trouble falling asleep and wakes up way too early. Overall it is manageable but not ideal. I'm crossing my fingers that it doesn't get any worse. \n \nI know we aren't the only ones to note the change in season or weather and corresponding behavior changes in our kids with autism.

In years past, I might have appreciated this kind of community meal because it would have made me thankful for what I DO have.

I stayed home to recharge before the brushing of the teeth, changing of clothes and the long bedtime ritual that comes with a child who has trouble falling asleep. \n \nWhen the boys returned I asked Sami if he had a good time. He said that he did and that he met a new friend who lives just a block from us and that he had fun playing with the boy. I then asked if Oliver also played with this new friend and he replied: \"No, he played with the older boys.\" The older boys? I wondered what that meant and later asked Nik about it and and he confirmed that Oliver played, although somewhat awkwardly, with some kids his own age. Nik and I were both somewhat surprised. I have seen my boy's increasing interest in other children but it is usually reserved for babies and children quite a bit younger than himself. This was most certainly a first. \n \nContrary to the advice of a great many experts, I have not been too pushy about putting Oliver in lots of activities with his same-aged peers. I don't believe that just by putting a child like Oliver with other children his age that he will magically start to understand how to interact with them or to model their behavior in any way. Maybe there are some children that this works for but with Oliver it would be like putting a go-cart on a speedway, the other kids are just too fast, light years ahead him. We've focused instead on helping him to understand himself in relation to family members, believing that this has to happen first, because this is how all children learn to become social creatures. And because we are willing to slow down enough that he never has to feel like a go-cart. \n \nWe home school but my house is a pretty socially-rich environment. Friends know that they can just drop by with their kids and hang out if they are looking for something to do. I'm the one people call when they need someone to watch their kids for an hour or an afternoon. So during any week, there is bound to be a time or two when it is a full house around here. Over the years I've watched as Oliver first completely retreated from visitors, usually to another part of the house altogether, then to maybe just another part of the same room. Lately, though, I've watched as he has moved with the pack -- always to the side but there nonetheless. \n \nTowards the end of the summer I saw something new developing with Oliver. For the first time ever I saw that he was struggling to become part of the group. I watched as he watched children he knew well, studying the situation and then trying to join in, failing and becoming upset. I know that many a mother would find this upsetting, but for me it seems like a very big step towards learning how to relate to other kids. I honestly don't know if he will ever get there, the gaps are just so huge and the other kids aren't slowing down. But his desire is there and certainly nothing would be possible without that. \n \nLast year at this time I wondered how we would do it all -- the RDI, the homeschooling -- I felt so completely off the grid and wondered if that is where I ought to be. This year I\u00a0 feel more confident. I see Oliver blossoming in ways that I was afraid to ever hope for. When I used to fall into that black pit of fear I would remind myself that Oliver was developing, not typically, but according to his own timetable. And the more time I spend being his mother the more I know this to be true.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/09/my-go-cart-kid-is-picking-up-speed.html", "title": "\nMy go-cart kid is picking up speed\n"},

Not only did he let me pretend that I didn't hear the boy but he brought me coffee in bed at seven, having given up any thoughts of going back to sleep himself hours before. \n \nBut before we get discouraged (easy for me, having slept till seven) we'll hope this is an anomaly in our new solid sleeping habit. We'll mark it on the calendar and note that a) it is almost a full moon, b) it is raining today, which means that the barometric pressure was changing in the night and c) Nik took the boys for a walk that turned into a run in the hour before bedtime. Even after all these years we still try to find some thing that happened at point A that took us to point B. My guess is that we'll never find that  one thing  but at least it helps us feel like we are doing  some thing.  \n \nOn another note, and because I don't talk about Sami near enough on these pages, I just have to say that four is a great age. I utterly delight in that boy and the little person I see him becoming. I have momentary worries about him. He has to play second fiddle in so many ways around our house but he handles it with a grace that is far beyond his years. For instance, yesterday Oliver accidentally destroyed a lego mobile that Sami had spent a good deal of time building. I held my breath as I watched Sami\u00a0 take it all in before cheerfully saying: \"Oh that's OK. I can build it again.

Basically, this means that he sleeps for about 4 hours and then gets up for three or four or five hours or that he just never goes back to sleep. (we see this extreme every year at this time.) \n \nSo last night was better than a lot of nights. The boy slept until 3:30 before waking every one up. I traded beds with Sami and kept Oliver company, whom I had dosed up with melatonin, hoping that he would fall back asleep before dawn. No such luck. \n \nBut here is the brilliant part. Rachel arrives at 8:30 every day!!! So I didn't even bother changing out of my pajamas because -- get this -- I could take a nap!! And I did.

But even my really good dentist couldn't make the dental experience trouble free with my fair boy. Teeth brushing has always been a challenge for us. When Oliver was very young it was downright traumatic. It was so traumatic that I negotiated with my husband: Look, I'll do all the breastfeeding -- I'll take care of  nourishing  our son -- if you would only just brush his teeth every day.\u00a0 Somehow he agreed and when it was time for the brushing of the teeth I always left the room. \n \nWe started taking Oliver to the dentist every three months at around age 2.5 for \"happy visits\" so that he could get used to the experience. I also bought a set of dental instruments at a local pharmacy so that he would get used to the tap tap tap of metal against his teeth. Those things, plus maturity, seemed to have helped. \n \nTeeth brushing has gotten easier but a combination of sensory defensiveness and genetics led to Oliver's first cavity, which I noticed a few months ago as a small dark spot on his last right molar. When I brought it to the attention of the dentist he told me that even though he loved having our boy as a patient, there was someone in town that was better suited to work with Oliver. Based on his sensory issues, he told me, a cavity probably meant that the work would have to be done under anesthesia at the local hospital.   Today was that day.\u00a0 \n \nAs much as I love our really great dentist, I have to say that this new, pediatric dentist who specializes in special needs kids, was totally, incredible. His staff, his office and his entire demeanor set Oliver and I at ease when we met for the initial consult. The one time when Oliver started to get agitated I offered a suggestion and the dentist, only allowing the teeniest bit of annoyance to show on his face, changed his approach. When my suggestion worked he was quick to earnestly thank me for my help in making it a successful interaction. I knew right then that he would do a great job with Oliver.  \n \nToday Oliver did fantastic. He wasn't allowed to eat before the procedure and even though I had explained that to him the night before, I was surprised when my ever-hungry boy didn't ask for breakfast this morning. Everything went without a hitch except that he vomited the sedative all over me after I forced him to drink it despite his adamant refusals. Every time I do that I regret it. (Note to self: don't do that!!) \n \nI also asked three staff members to get me one of the face masks that he would have to breathe through after they took him to the operating room and all of them acted like it was too difficult. Finally, I asked the dentist himself and he replied: \"Great idea! Let me go fetch that for you!\"\u00a0 A few minutes later he returned with one and I was relieved to see that Oliver thought breathing into it was very amusing. Later the dentist congratulated me for thinking of it and said he would offer the same to other parents in the future. \n \nWhen they finally wheeled Oliver away from me through the operating room doors I let myself realize just how emotional the whole experience was. The nurse standing next to me said: \"There's just no two ways about it -- being a mom is hard.\" And he was right. It is hard sometimes. I went to the cafeteria for a cup of coffee and a yogurt and felt so weepy that I had to keep reminding myself: it's just a cavity!! In the grand scheme of all the reasons why someone might wheel my child away toward the operating room it was a very small thing.  \n \nStill, after the quarter incident early this year, I earnestly hope we don't see the inside of a hospital again any time soon!! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/11/in-which-it-takes-six-hours-to-fill.html", "title": "\nIn which it takes six hours to fill a cavity\n"},
{"date": "February 12, 2009", "body": "\nIf I could go back in time and tell my early-diagnosis-self a thing or two, I know just what I'd say: don't sweat the small stuff. Of course I'd probably also want to take my shoulders in my more wizened hands and shake good and hard. I could have used that back then. But this business about the small stuff? So important.  When I look back over the countless things that occupied me, that took up emotional space that I was borrowing from something more important, well, I see that those things weren't worth the amount of upset that I caused myself, Oliver, and the rest of the family. The list is long and varied: wearing shoes and socks, wearing a coat, eating with utensils, biting fingernails, picking the nose, licking this, that and the other thing. ... um, that poop thing. ... well, you get the idea.  Some of you may know that while you are in the midst of these things they feel like such a very big deal. In the midst of it there were times when I felt at war. I felt that I needed to conquer or -- in the terms of ABA -- to extinguish. Now I can only shake my head at myself. This was my child, not my enemy. I'm reflecting on this lately because Oliver is newly interested in utensils. Yes, you read that right: spoons, forks, knives, ladles, whisks -- you name it. At first I didn't really pay much attention, Oliver just seemed to always have a fork or a spoon in his hand. But we spend a lot of time in the kitchen together. Then I slowly realized that our meals were without drama. They were without the monitoring and reminding. (Oliver, don't forget to use your fork. Your  fork , Oliver!) And it only smacked me in the head when I realized that Oliver was now using utensils for everything. And I mean everything. Witness this photo (that I took especially for Keen): Can you make that out? Yes, that's a carrot he's eating. With a spoon. (I don't know: why am I not worried about this? Isn't this an  obsession ? Maybe I only find it so utterly delightful because it is a  useful  obsession in my mind.) But anyway. If I could go back in time I'd tell myself that this is the way of things. In the end it doesn't really matter if he chooses to eat his spaghetti with his fingers and his carrots with a spoon. So then what  does  matter?  Well, I don't know. I'm still in the process of figuring it out. My eternal process. But if you were to ask me now I might say something so obvious that I'll end up giving myself away. You might realize by my answer that  my journey to motherhood was slower even than I first reported . But I'll go ahead and say it anyway because it is something that has been occupying so much of my thinking of late. If I could go back in time and change one thing it would be this: I would spend far more time making sure that Oliver knows that there is no \"right\" way of doing things, of thinking, of being. And I wouldn't just tell him that, I would really believe it. You see, for me that is the real key. In fact, not to give myself too much importance here, but sometimes I wonder how much of Oliver's anxiety has to do with the autism and how much of it is due to  my  reactions to the autism -- and all the sweating I've done of the small stuff. So, I'm just curious: if you could go back in time and tell yourself one very important thing about this journey you've embarked on -- what would it be?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SZTaPN7xOTI/AAAAAAAAAVY/cC24zKm2uNk/s1600-h/carrot.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/02/spoonful-of-carrot.html", "title": "\nA Spoonful of Carrot\n"},

This wouldn't have happened a year ago!\"  When I think about each little thing individually they don't seem that remarkable, but taken altogether they make my heart sing.  So I hope you won't mind if I do a little boastful blogging and share some of those little successes with you, my friends who get why the little things mean so very much. As reported in my last post: We now have fork and spoon success! Some of you may remember my pleas last year for alternative winter coat ideas. The boy would NOT wear anything that zippered, buttoned or snapped. We spent a lot of time indoors. This year it has been a total non-issue. In fact, when he knows we are going out he hunts around, finds his coat and puts it on himself! Shoes and socks also get put on and stay on. Mostly. And they always have to be Crocs. Oliver no longer has the need to ride in the carts when we go shopping and, in fact, prefers to walk along with me and explore the environment.  We can now drive past my mothers street and house without stopping, without issue.  Oliver is no longer afraid of the sound of the shower and even enjoys taking them! When we visit the children's museum in our town, Oliver now explores the exhibits instead of spending all of his time fixated on the Thomas the Train face on the train table.  When we leave the house, Oliver holds the door open for me and for Sami (as opposed to letting it slam in our faces).  When we get in the car Oliver automatically puts his seat belt on and does not remove it until we get where we are going.  Oliver will now sit contentedly and look at a book. He will even prolong storytime by bringing me book after book.  Oliver has conquered his fear of the local public swimming pool  (actually his fear was of the bubble that houses it in the winter time) and now he can hardly be persuaded to come home.   And the biggest and best -- the one I appreciate the most:     12.  For the past month, whenever he has awakened during the night he simply turns the light on  and goes back to sleep on his own !  We've only had to give him Benadryl one time in four weeks!!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/02/little-things-that-mean-lot.html", "title": "\nLittle Things That Mean A Lot\n"},
{"date": "November 30, 2009", "body": "\nAnd also with you. \n \nFor years these have been the last words uttered between Nik and I as we drift off into a hopeful sleep. Anyone who lives with a child with a sleep disorder knows that it can be rough. The hardest part, I might add, isn't waking in the night but the long days that follow when we must still function. We must be patient and loving, responsible and alert, even when all we want to do is lay down in the fetal position and sleep a long dreamless sleep. \n \nYou'd be surprised -- or maybe you wouldn't -- just how unhelpful our doctors have been. I vividly remember one time when I was still working and in the middle of an intense five week program attended by 30 foreign diplomats for which I was largely responsible. Oliver hadn't slept in 4 nights and I was on the brink of despair. I called the pediatrician's office and couldn't stop sobbing. Bring him right in, they urged me. I walked out of there a half hour later with their sympathy and a recommendation for melatonin and benedryl. That was it. And it was not nearly enough. \n \nOliver is seven now and we've finally gotten someone to take the issue of our sleeplessness seriously. I'm not crazy about medicating my boy but at this point I'm starting to believe that we don't have much choice anymore. What else can we do that we haven't already tried? So. Clonidine. We started giving it regularly ten days or so ago and, after adjusting the dose a bit, it looks like we now have sleep -- seven to ten hours every night for the past five nights. I'm seeing some other differences as well -- the constant restlessness, the galloping the running -- they all seem to have abated a bit. He seems calmer and less impulsive. He has surprised me with word choices. Instead of: \"I want eat,\" he says, \"Let's go eat.\" Even, \"I'm hungry,\" with the all important use of the pronoun. I don't know if that is the clonidine or the effect of some solid sleep. A bit of both? Either way, I'll take it.  \n \nI felt a little weird putting this post together. It seems so revealing to talk about my son's medications. But I spent a couple of evenings looking for blogs that mentioned the use of clonidine for children with autism and I couldn't find anything useful. Judging by the comments I got on my last post about the subject, I guess other parents are giving it a try and I wonder: why is there so much written about diets -- what we feed our kids and what we don't feed our kids, but so little sharing about medication? Why is there such a stigma? Because, really, if medication helps us get some sleep then I'm gonna feel like shouting it from the rooftops. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/11/may-sleep-be-with-you.html", "title": "\nMay the sleep be with you.\n"},

He is now regularly wearing an old, old pair of PJs that he inherited from Resident Teenager. (It is so hard to believe that Oliver, now seven, is wearing clothes that RT wore ten years ago!)\u00a0 The pjs are a comfy flannel, green and white checks with teddy bears. And the button up the front. \n \nButtoning was never on my list of things to teach Oliver -- the same with tying shoelaces. That's what pullovers, tee shirts and velcro are for, after all. But one night a couple of months ago, I noticed Oliver paying particular attention as I buttoned up his well-loved pjs. Here, I said, you try it. He gave it a go but couldn't quite get it. The next night, however, he brushed my hands away as I started to button. He'd never done something like that before. Normally, he prefers for me to do things for him even when he can do them perfectly well on his own. It's a least amount of effort thing that I totally get, being that way a little bit myself now and then. But THIS time, he wanted to figure it out and I stood back. \n \nIn the moment following the one in which his fingers grasped the button and slid it through the hole and into place, Oliver raised his face to find mine -- beaming. And I was so happy for the next four buttons because I got to see that gorgeous look of accomplishment each time. That look that said: \"Hey Mom! Did you see what I just did! What do you think of that?!\" I looked forward to bedtime every night for a week after that, knowing that I would get to watch it over and over again. \n \nIt took him about a week longer to master the un-buttoning, but master it he did. The really incredible part of this, for me, is that I just didn't have it in my mind to teach this thing to him. But there he was, ready to learn and ready to take charge of the process. I've wondered aloud to Nik a couple of times since about what would have happened if I had tried to teach him last year. Or last Spring. I think it would have been hard. I think he would have struggled and I would have gotten frustrated.  \n \nI tend not to worry too much about Sami. He is four and a half and can't name all of the letters of the alphabet if they are out of order. And I don't really care because I know that when he is developmentally ready he will get it and if that doesn't happen until he is six or seven then so be it. I have confidence in his ability to learn and grow and that he will do it at a rate that is appropriate for him. \n \nThe Remarkable Incident of the Button kind of reminds me that the same is true of Oliver.  \n \nIt's good to be reminded every now and again. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/11/remarkable-incident-of-button.html", "title": "\nThe Remarkable Incident of the Button\n"},
{"date": "August 11, 2009", "body": "\nWe are going through some major adjustments in this little green house that, for once, have nothing to do with Autism. Last winter I read two books that had a pretty big impact on me. Michael Pollen wrote both the Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food and I read them each in just about one sitting. You might say I devoured them. Then I made Nik read them. It was hard to look at the way we eat in quite the same way afterward. (I won't go into any detail about the books. They were on the bestsellers list forever so you can just google if you want more info.) And so, we set about to make some changes. We challenged ourselves to see if we could feed our family in a more sustainable way. A long time ago, -- ok, yeah,  so there is an autism connection here but it's a small one -- we followed the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, so I already knew how hard it was to find real food in the grocery store. Everything is a product. Even items that you wouldn't think twice about throwing in your cart like chicken and cucumbers aren't just chicken and cucumbers.  That experience was responsible for some already significant changes to our diet. I make our own bread from whole grains. I make our yogurt. We buy our meat from a nearby farm (coincidentally you will have read about this farm if you've read the Omnivore's Dilemma). We get our our milk and butter, raw, from another farmer. Our eggs come from a neighbor. All in all, we eat pretty well, I suppose. The one key ingredient missing from our local diet was the vegetable. And I'll be honest: I don't know a whole lot about vegetables. I mean, we eat them, of course. I even like them quite a lot. But eating locally and well meant that I would have to do something about getting smart about veggies. You see, I knew that if I was going to do this then I would have to feed my family on whatever was abundant that week. Yet, I had no idea what grew when.  Because any day of any week you can just go to the store and get whatever is in season  anywhere in the world .  And that is part of the problem. Because even if you are buying tomatoes in august in virginia, there is a good chance that they were shipped to you from somewhere else in the world. Eating like that just isn't sustainable. Anyway, all this is to say that we (I) have been really occupied this past year with thinking about food. We put in our first garden, an endeavor in itself. We're shopping at the farmer's market. We're stopping at roadside stands and, in some cases, going right to the farm. My strategy has been to buy whatever is in season, at the height of the season, and preserve it for the winter. So far it hasn't been too bad.  I would even go so far as to say that it has been enjoyable. Fun, even. But I'm just weird that way. And the best part?  I've managed -- and needed -- to involve my kids every step of the way. RDI, homeschooling, survival. ... whatever you want to call it, we're working together and learning together and that makes the experiment an unequaled success in my opinion. That, and the fact that none of us has lost weight. Darn it. Besides the garden that has kept us in herbs, cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, leeks and squash, we've picked cherries, blueberries, blackberries, peaches. We've hauled boxes and boxes of corn, more cucumbers, tomatoes, green beans and every kind of squash. We've made jams and jellies, pesto, pickles, tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, salsa, salsa verde, and had lots of fresh berry ice cream as a reward! I'm not fooling myself that our growing stash of canned and frozen food will keep us through the winter, but I'm delighted to be unchained from the grocery store for as long as we are able. I wish I had thought to take more pictures along the way, but here are a few from the last couple of weeks. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SoOFukfMaFI/AAAAAAAAAag/GEicFydOOhw/s1600-h/IMG_0752.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SoOFvPe4UXI/AAAAAAAAAao/xt9pfo4GTLw/s1600-h/IMG_0754.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SoOFv1nPYUI/AAAAAAAAAaw/u5urgwPJBXs/s1600-h/IMG_0760.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SoOFwcbvJDI/AAAAAAAAAa4/J_j4nXlPy54/s1600-h/IMG_0764.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SoOFw7CqEHI/AAAAAAAAAbA/9d44l3DO9KQ/s1600-h/IMG_0773.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SoOHvuQQWuI/AAAAAAAAAbI/IcZ-96mk92k/s1600-h/IMG_0775.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/08/whats-for-dinner.html", "title": "\nWhat's for Dinner\n"},

My own brother came for a visit over Christmas and stayed at my mom's house across town where she lives with my younger brother. Driving over there one afternoon, Sami said to me from the backseat: \"Isn't it funny that Paul knows Gram and Patrick, too?\" So I explained to him again that Paul and Patrick were my brothers and that we were all little kids together, just like he and Oliver were brothers. \"So did Paul bite and kick you all the time, too, then?\" His question, asked with such innocence, was bittersweet and I answered with an ounce of truthfulness that yes, sometimes brothers do that and that mine were especially wicked. Not much of a stretch, that. Tonight while their father was cleaning the post-dinner disaster area that is our kitchen, I sequestered the two youngest children in their bedroom with instructions that they either play with the fifty or so matchbox cars that were strewn around the room or clean them up. Then I laid down on the bed and watched, too tired to really interfere much. Oliver hopped around the room measuring his now ever present spoon against all straight lines within easy reach. Sami jumped from bean bag to bean bag. In a last ditch effort, I reminded them that if they weren't playing they were cleaning. Oliver half-heartedly picked up a car and sent it down the orange track that had been rigged to the door frame while Sami watched. Then Sami's inner foreman took over and he suggested that the two of them build towers out of the large cardboard blocks scattered about one corner of the room. I watched while Sami instructed Oliver where to place each block and was stunned to see Oliver retrieve block after block while following Sami's directives. \"No, put the block like this. The other way, Oliver. Yeah, that's right.\" Once they had built two towers Sami showed Oliver how to put the track on top of the tower to give the cars real lift as they were placed at the top of the track by a little pulley system. Without any prompting or input from me, the two of them took turns placing cars on the track and watching them fly from the end into a great heap on the floor. When, on occasion the track or the towers fell down, Sami or Oliver or both would race to repair the damage. I became much less exhausted moment by moment, watching them play. Play. Together. My boys. I wondered if I would ever see it. Occasionally, Oliver would stop what he was doing, walk over to his brother, put his face at Sami-level and grin, nose to nose.

And when your kid, who  had  been sleeping like a professional and who had even been  yawning  and going to sleep without melatonin suddenly is up until all hours of the night and keeping the rest of the household up, too?\u00a0 And like when you hear the anxiety, frustration and well, sometimes anger, seeping out of you through the tone of your voice and you dislike yourself immensely?

Then I saw you in Mom's room.\" I asked him who else was there and he got that right, too.\u00a0 He was only two when Sami was born. Maybe this isn't so unusual, but I would never have guessed he remembered it. You know, because even though that was pre-diagnosis, he just seemed so out of it during those years.  \n \nAnd he remembers other things, too: like details of the stories of Greek mythology that I've been reading to the kids. Dates and facts about the ancient Mayans that we studied last Fall. The color of the jerseys of the teams playing in the European Cup soccer matches we watched earlier this summer. Definitions to words that he saw in the new dictionary I gave him. And, from a radio program playing in the background as we made supper a few nights ago, why mantis shrimp see way more colors than dogs, butterflies or humans. Even when it has appeared that Oliver was tuning us out, he was taking it all in.  All of this surprises and delights me -- all of it. \n   \n \n   \nIt's been about four months now since Oliver started communicating with us, telling us what he is thinking and feeling and letting us in on what he knows. Every day with this guy feels a little like a miracle. Like a gift I unwrap layer by layer. And it's amazing how in the day-to-day that kind of gets lost. How I take it for granted that he will cross the room to sit down next to me and take the pen I'm holding so that he can answer a question or tell me something. Or to argue with me. All these things that I had almost given up hoping for have become every day, ordinary. \n \n \n \nHow often does that happen to each of us in our life?  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/08/just-every-day-ordinary-with-bright-and.html", "title": "\nJust every day ordinary with a bright and shiny boy\n"},
{"date": "August 27, 2012", "body": "\nI sometimes wonder -- and worry -- about how I represent Oliver in this blog. Oliver has autism and  \nthat fact is a central part of who he is. But when I relate to Oliver, when I parent him, and when I write about him, I hope I emphasize his humanity above his autism. So sometimes I wonder if someone reading this blog would recognize Oliver upon meeting him. Would they be surprised by how very much autism affects our boy and us, his family? Or would they be surprised by, well, how normal we are? Because both are certainly true. \n \nFor example, I wonder if it would surprise someone to know that occupying and monitoring Oliver is a full-time job. The iPad has been a tremendous, wonderful gift to our family because it is something that engages our boy and so I can give it to him for a half hour and know that I can read the paper or make a cup of coffee. But there are very few other activities that engage Oliver in the same way. So a lot of my time is spent doing things with the boy.\u00a0 There is a lot of good in this, of course, but sometimes, what I wouldn't give for him to have the ability to get completely lost in a book or a movie. So that's part of the context behind the conversation I'm about to relate. The other part is simply that I'd like to understand better how high the hurdle is before us.  \n \nHere's the conversation:  \nMe: Oliver, I would love it if you could sit and read a book every now and then. \nOliver: I can read. \nMe: I know you can read and I'm so proud of you, Oliver. I just think you would enjoy reading stories to yourself. Do you think you might like to do that? \nOliver: No. \nMe: Why not? \nOliver: Because it is too hard.\u00a0  \nMe: Do you think it is easier when I read the stories to you? \nOliver: Yes \nMe: What if I got you recordings of books? That way you could listen to the stories.  \nOliver: OK. \nMe: Do you like to listen to the recording of poems that I've been playing? \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: Do you have a favorite? \nOliver: Yes. I like the one about the woods. \nMe: I'm not sure I know which one you mean. Do you know the author? \nOliver. Yes. Robert Frost. \nMe: Oliver, do you think you could try to tell me again why reading a book is so hard? It seems like it is easy for you when I ask you to read a page or two. You can read about 10 times faster than I do!!! I'd love to understand why a book seems so hard. \nOliver: Because I have to make pictures and then read them. It's too hard when there is a whole book.  \nMe: Do you keep those pictures in your head or do you forget them.  \nOliver: I forget them.  \nMe: But you told me this morning all about matter and we looked at those pages weeks ago.  \nOliver: Because those pictures are still in my brain. \n \nI've had some version of this conversation with Oliver at least three times. It seems that he somehow captures an image of the page first and then decodes it? I'm not quite sure I understand. What is clear, I think, is that he is reading the whole rather than the parts. And when I say \"clear,\" I mean that I can barely conceptualize how this works for him.  \n \nThoughts? Ideas? Anyone? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/08/reading-in-pictures.html", "title": "\nReading in Pictures\n"},
{"date": "August 30, 2012", "body": "\nToday was an awesome, incredible day. \n \nI feel I can say this with assurance because I have yesterday to compare it to, which was decidedly not awesome. Yesterday being a day when I was trapped in a local department store --  at the mall  -- for a half hour with an incredibly dysregulated boy while we waited for his brother to get a haircut. And the only reason I found myself inclined to enter the purgatory of the mall is because I'm too cheap to pay for a haircut for my boys and this particular store was offering free haircuts to kids through the month of August. And, because Sami is now -- ahem -- gainfully employed (finally pulling his weight), I had to do something about his hair. And to the lady behind the reception desk who looked at me with the evil eye? C'mon. I apologized for the mess those papers from your desk made when they landed on the floor and maybe by next August when we visit your establishment again you'll have found your sense of humor. Otherwise you might lose us altogether. \n \n \n He's wearing that cap to hide all the wild red hair. \n \nBut  Today ! Today was awesome!! (Incidentally, isn't it funny how 90 really bad minutes in a day can make you feel like giving up altogether and that 90 totally awesome minutes can make you feel energized and ready to look for more challenges to tackle? Thank goodness life balances out like that.)  \n \nToday we started talking in earnest about ancient Greece. I was actually surprised by how much the boys already knew -- like Greece is where they speak Greek! But also that it is on the Mediterranean and that it is part of the European Union. And, as Oliver pointed out, the ancient Greeks loved math and gave lots of unique properties to numbers. For instance, the color of the number one was considered to be red. We had talked about all of this in relation to the myths we are reading and the history of number systems, so technically I shouldn't be surprised -- but, you know, they were paying attention and they are interested and that thrills me to no end! \n \n \n It was Sami's idea to map everything we know and, as usual, I just do what he tells me. \n \n \nThen, to totally make my day, I asked them if they knew what B.C. meant and, although Sami didn't know, Oliver wrote: \"Before Christ\". So naturally I asked him how he knew that and he said \"I remember from when we learned about the Mayans.\" \n \nYeah. So last winter we took a trip to Mexico and in preparation we read a lot about the ancient Mayans. At the time, of course, I had no idea what Oliver was taking in -- this was before he could really communicate -- but he was always there, apparently taking everything in. I don't know why this kind of stuff still amazes me but it does.  \n \n \n Everything was already broken when we got there. Honest! \n \nThen, after almost an hour of talking about Greek civilization I thought they must be getting tired so I suggested that we pick another subject to work on and Sami said: \"No, that's ok, this is really interesting.\" (and that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is why I love homeschooling!) I asked Oliver and he agreed. \n \nSo, yeah. Today was totally awesome, incredible. And I hope I won't have to pay for it in the balance of things until at least sometime next week.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jaEyikG6168/UD_9f9KKAzI/AAAAAAAAAyc/-lTiQxGFhlg/s1600/photoset1_bw.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NkHLZmXlnQ0/UEAPaTiyi0I/AAAAAAAAAy4/Vuqk2N_MCN0/s1600/August+29+058.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GxF64DmcRcE/UEAOnm1uO8I/AAAAAAAAAyw/EjwuNlZJayw/s1600/110.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/08/sometimes-it-balances-out-in-end.html", "title": "\nSometimes it balances out in the end\n"},

It has been fun -- and enlightening -- to read what the boys come up with. And our discussions about imagination often lead into the next subject of our day: science. I really, really love watching the kids make these connections. And Oliver, for his part, is much more of an active participant in our discussions than I ever imagined possible. It is breath-taking to think of how much has changed for him, for us, in just a few short months. I love sitting down for \"school\" with him every day and I think he does, too.  \n \nYesterday, I had not come up with an exciting writing prompt, so I simply asked Oliver to tell me about himself.

I could write a whole post about how every doctor you see when you've got an incurable brain tumor feels the need to tell you that you are surely dying. Or, as one kindly told my mother: \"You will eventually succumb to this tumor.\" I could tell you that some doctors are gifted in their ability to communicate this kind of information clearly and humanely and that others are, well, not. I could tell you how impossibly beautiful the world looks. How the golden fall light makes the last of the leaves clinging to brown limbs seem somehow noble and full of promise in a season I had always believed to be an ending. How I cannot imagine what it would be like to look at the deep blue autumn sky and know that it will be my last November.  \n \nWe all know we will die someday. But how does one live each day knowing that death is hovering nearby? Mentioning this to a friend he reminded me of how the Buddhists meditate on death so they can live more fully in the moment. That's what each day has been like since we got the awful news at the end of September: a meditation on death. Hard, but oddly full of peace, like the rest at the end of a long exhale. \n \nWhen we got the news my brother asked me what I will do to cope and I replied without thinking: \"I will live\". My kids make it easy to keep that promise. They are so full of life and energy and hope and promise that I find myself craving their company. \n \nSami came in the house yesterday and breathlessly asked if he could use the umbrella so that he might glide gently to the ground when he jumped from the porch. Go ahead, I told him, knowing that in his mind the world is full of possibilities. And who am I to argue? I look at him and agree. Yes, it's possible: one day he might fly. \n \nOliver started working with a local university math professor a few weeks ago. He told her that he wants to learn algebra, geometry and calculus. He has surpassed my ability to teach him. When I come home each night from taking care of my mother he is already asleep. I go to him and adjust the covers, gently setting aside the heavy algebra book nestled next to him on the pillows. I can't get over how his face is changing, how he is growing and how full of possibilities the world seems for him.  \n \nA few weeks ago I was pretty angry that my mother's life has to end this way. I found myself wishing that if she couldn't die of old age that she could at least be taken from us quickly. But now I'm thankful for the time I have with her, for the chance to take care of her and to just sit with her quietly and to talk about the impossibly blue November sky. I've stopped trying to wrap my mind around what is happening. When I look at my kids I know that there exists a whole world of possibility-- of good things to come -- that I can't even begin to imagine.

Until yesterday we were going to school everyday to observe a social skills class in which he will, eventually, participate. But that participation won't happen this week. Or next. And our time of observation is over. It is frustrating and I am reminded of the many reasons why I chose to homeschool in the first place. Chiefly? I am terrible at waiting. This week makes six months that we have been waiting for Oliver to be able to take his place in the classroom. \n \nBut another truth is that I am in no hurry. At least not if the rush comes at the expense of the right supports.

And for this I am willing to wait a bit longer. I don't just want them to make a place for him, I want them to embrace him and to celebrate what he has to contribute to the school and to our community. Without the right supports his challenges will obscure his gifts.  \n \nIn the meantime, Oliver is becoming more and more an independent typer. I have gradually increased the physical distance up to two feet between us as he types and he is making better use of the word prediction element of his app, Assistive Express.

He has spent eleven years observing the speaking world and now he wants to join in but is told to wait a while longer.  \n \nWhen we began this journey towards public education Oliver told me: \"I want to type on my own so I can go to school.\"\u00a0 He has worked incredibly hard to achieve his goal.

{"date": "August 21, 2012", "body": "\nToday was the first day of school in our district. I woke to the sound of kids on the sidewalk outside making their way to the bus stop or the elementary school up the street. My would-be second-grader was curled up next to me. Oliver was sound asleep in the next room, having been up for a couple of hours during the night. Our house was cool and peaceful and quiet. Later, a handful of my friends posted first day of school photos and I thought of posting our own school pictures: Oliver, curled up inside his closet with the iPad and Sami stretched across his bed with a copy of Asterix (in German!). Later, I thought, I might like to take a picture of Oliver standing at his window, playing absently with the cord to the blind and Sami throwing darts while I read to them about how numbers came into use as people began keeping herds of animals. Still later I thought we made a fine picture on our bikes heading to the town library. And maybe I would also include a photo of Oliver playing with the water hose on the back porch during one of our many breaks. Make that many, many breaks. \n \nBack in April when Oliver really stunned us with his breakthrough in communication I felt overwhelmed. I thought I had been teaching to his competencies. Turns out I was wrong. I wasn't even close -- and I really didn't know how to begin to figure it out. So, after we were able to replace our laptop (courtesy of a grant from our local ARC), I got busy putting together some ideas for what we will do this year in the thing like \"school\" that happens in our little green house. I decided not to focus on building from what he already knew (because I don't know!) but rather to begin new conversations with him about things that we both might find interesting.  \n \nWe started back to our regular school routine several weeks ago (we take a long break November - February but generally go all summer). And do you know? It has been amazing. Oliver is focused and interested in a way that I've never seen him. I mean, the kid  happily  sits down with us and patiently writes out his thoughts. Before Oliver could communicate, I would have told you that he was aware of everything that went on around him -- but what, exactly, he was absorbing, was difficult to know. Now, I see that he understands and, indeed, soaks up everything. And, for the first time, Oliver and Sami are on the same playing field. I'm asking them to do the same things and they are equally able -- in fact, Oliver frequently knows the answer when Sami doesn't. \n \n \n \n Our Poetry Wall \n \nSo, if you're interested, for school this yearw e're doing some standard math, using the Khan Academy (yes, I know, it isn't perfect!). But we're also doing  Bedtime Math , and we'll be building these  go karts . We're reading and writing poetry. The boys are flexing their imaginations with creative writing (an upcoming post on this, I promise!). We're learning about ancient Greece and Egypt. Both boys are learning to type using  this  wonderful website. And Sami is working on his German using  Rosetta Stone . And, of course, for PE we'll be out and about on our bikes and hiking the trails we know so well.  \n \n\u00a0I feel very lucky that I can spend this time with my kids. I feel very lucky that I live in a community where I am one of many who have embraced alternative education and so I feel supported. For the first time ever, I'm excited to explore the world of ideas with  both  of my boys knowing that I'll be learning a thing or two myself. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-03u5GRfZjLg/UDRA2X3CioI/AAAAAAAAAxo/7428gy-eux8/s1600/poetry+002.JPG", "http://bedtimemathproblem.org/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYPh48KPnYs", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/typing/", "http://www.rosettastone.com/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/08/if-i-had-camera-our-day-in-pictures.html", "title": "\nIf I had a camera - Our day in pictures\n"},

{"date": "October 02, 2013", "body": "\nI'm not sure how my heart can be at once so full of hope and sheer admiration for my boy and so full of wariness and dread at the same time. While I love that he has the ability to type out sentences that say: \n \n People look at me and they see\nmy autistic self and they don\u2019t believe I can have intelligence. I know I will\nhave to work hard to show them that I can learn like everyone else.   \n \nIt makes me incredibly sad both that he  knows  that people don't believe that he is capable of intelligence and that he will have to prove himself. I love that he has the drive to type these things out through great effort but also that he has the determination to do just what he says. How terrible that he should have to have yet another, needless, hurdle placed in front of him because people have such deeply entrenched ideas about what it means to be autistic. People who cannot speak and who are significantly challenged by autism cannot also be highly intelligent. And if they are, they'd better be willing to prove it by pretending that they really aren't all that autistic and don't really need any special supports.  \n \nOliver has made wonderful strides with communication in a very short period of time. He is frequently able to type without any physical support and he is now reading aloud much of what he is typing. But typing independently comes at a cost for Oliver. It exhausts him. \n \nEarly on when we were still using pen and paper, Oliver told me several times that he couldn't write without my touch because he couldn't feel where his hands were. He couldn't locate parts of his body in space. Understanding that put some of his other difficulties in perspective: for example, why Oliver had so much trouble learning to put on his pants. No matter how many times I tried to break that task down for him into manageable parts, he always had great difficulty. Now I see how difficult it would be to put on your pants when your foot is dangling somewhere in space but you can't make sense of where! Also, when I first tried to teach Oliver to ride a bike it took seven months before he could even move a pedal! \n \nWhen we were in Syracuse I learned how to help Oliver work around this part of his disability by providing backward resistance to his arm as he types. By giving Oliver some physical input he could more easily locate it in space and the act of moving toward a target became much more deliberate because he was more in control. Gradually, he needed less and less physical input but it still requires a tremendous amount of focus and concentration. He cannot tell where his finger is so he must visually track the tip of his finger at all times. Most of us will first locate the key we want and then automatically move our finger to it. Quite a neat trick if you can manage. \n \nTo see what this is like for Oliver, try typing with one finger while never taking your gaze from its tip. If you don't go cross-eyed and give up at the end of a sentence I congratulate you! \n \nWhen I describe my role as Oliver's support person, I always begin by explaining his difficulty with body awareness and how that is a significant factor to his ability to communicate. My job is to support him in several ways. I remind Oliver to focus on his finger. I remind him to hold a firm point -- if his point gets droopy it is difficult to see the typing finger. I encourage him to slow down if he is repeatedly missing the mark. If he is getting too tired or anxious I will rest my hand on his back or shoulder for a few minutes so he has one less thing to process. But most importantly, I offer him emotional support and encouragement. I am profoundly grateful that he is willing to do this very hard work and share his thinking with me and he knows it! \n \nHaving said all of this, I cannot begin to describe how disappointed it makes me when people believe that it is in any way logical or necessary for Oliver to be able to communicate without a support person doing all of the things I describe. It is as if the kind of support that Oliver needs is not valid because other people have a hard time understanding or accepting that locating one's body in space can be a significant barrier to communication. I'm seen as coddling or not able to \"let go\" because I refuse to leave Oliver's side while he is typing. (As if I would betray his trust to accommodate any one else's ideas about my son's performance!)\u00a0 It has been gently explained to me that eventually he has to be able to manage on his own. And I ask: \"Why?\" \n \n Why  must Oliver be able to overcome a significant part of his disability and manage on his own? Most other people are not expected to out grow or overcome their disability. Why shouldn't Oliver expect the generous support of others and the belief that he is  already  doing the best that he can do at this time. Who is setting the agenda that requires Oliver to end up at some predetermined place where he can magically, or perhaps through sheer will, learn how to control his own body as though he were not disabled?  \n \nSomehow Oliver must both prove his intellect and demonstrate that his disability is no barrier to being able to express his intellect.  \n \nQuite a neat trick he is being asked to manage. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2013/10/barriers.html", "title": "\nBarriers\n"},
{"date": "October 10, 2013", "body": "\nOliver's growing confidence and independence with his typing has brought so many new dimensions to our life together. I've started thinking in terms of life Before Typing and After Typing. \n \n\u00a0I remember seeing an interview with a mother whose daughter had learned to type and she tearfully said: \"We met our daughter that day.\" Hearing her say this made me feel deeply conflicted. I already knew my son. For years I held fast to the belief that communication was so much more than stringing words together. There is something beautiful that happens between two people who cannot rely on words, something that is full and complete on it's own. Those who have always relied on language cannot fully understand how tuned in to another person you become when you are looking for physical nuance and meaningful gazes. It is all encompassing. And yet, typing has undeniably allowed a way of knowing Oliver that just wasn't possible before. As the days pass I understand what this other mother had meant. Our days are filled with getting to know Oliver. \n \nLast week we downloaded and started listening to \" The Reason I Jump ,\" written by Naoki Higashida, 13 year old autistic boy who types to communicate. The  Introduction  to the book was written by David Mitchell, the author of Cloud Atlas. (You should get this book. And if I can't convince you, then watch  this interview with Jon Stewart  and then go to audible and download it. It's wonderful.)\u00a0 Each day it has become our habit to listen to bits of it whenever we take breaks from whatever school work we are doing. It has fostered lots of questions from Sami and dialog between he and Oliver. \n \nIt would be an understatement to say that the relationship between my two boys has deepened since Oliver began typing a few months ago. For the first time in their lives together they are creating a dialog between themselves rather than using me as a go-between. \n \nEarlier this week Sami suggested to Oliver that he should write a book like The Reason I Jump. Then Oliver replied: \"We should do it together.\"\u00a0 Sami quickly changed his mind though because, as he pointed out, \"I'm not as good at typing as Oliver.\" So instead they decided to make a series of videos. This led to a whole slew of electronic disasters but lots and lots of wonderful dialog and, for the first time ever, they were working together on a common self-directed project. This probably goes pretty high up on the list of things that I never dared to hope for. \n \nI would like to link here to a video produced by the Oliver and Sami team, but that might be a long time coming as they are running into a series of complications, both electronic and emotional. Sami started the project, I think, expecting that he would do all the questioning. It came as a surprise then that Oliver has followed each answer, patiently spelled out letter by letter, with a question for Sami. It has come as a surprise to me that with his questions Oliver has taken control of the direction of the conversation as naturally as if he had been doing it his whole life. The questions he asks Sami tell as much about how this boy's mind works as his answers do and they blow apart every single stereotype people might have about a person so challenged by autism. Often they are so piercing that Sami turns off the camera before he can answer and I go running for a tissue. \n \nThe most beautiful thing about this dialog though, is that I see how it frames their unique bonds of brotherhood. Autism has perhaps shaped their relationship but it is no less fully lived than any other sibling relationship. They have their own set of rules but the bonds are universal.  \n \nI'm not sure what will become of their video project, but in the meantime, if your child with autism has a sibling who would like to understand his brother or sister better, consider listening to The Reason I Jump together. Because it is written by a young boy, the language is accessible to children and the topics covered are probably ones that are of most interest to a sibling.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thereasonijump.com/", "http://thereasonijump.com/", "http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-october-1-2013/exclusive---david-mitchell-extended-interview-pt--1", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xoWOrJhkCvo/UlbnUaCEWpI/AAAAAAAAA5Y/d4Ir7qNDcM4/s1600/IMG_0789.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RMw3wF47_R0/UlbncZnGeeI/AAAAAAAAA5g/_nWGpD5R__8/s1600/IMG_0790.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bx7pNBbIXXA/Ulbn2yHasTI/AAAAAAAAA5o/tXzQwNo8bHE/s1600/IMG_0829.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2013/10/discovering-brotherhood.html", "title": "\nDiscovering Brotherhood\n"},

I'm reading Karen Armstrong's  The Great Transformation , and wishing I knew more about the Axial Age. Plus the boys and I have been listening to a Chinese explorer's account of ancient India along the silk road and the kids both love history. So ancient China seemed a good tie-in for all of us. The thing  I  love about learning at home is that each of us gets something out of it. The other thing I love is the ability to totally scrap our plans if something urges us in another direction. \n \nApparently,  The Reason I Jump , by Naoki Higashida has given us our direction for at least a little while, it has nothing to do with Ancient China, and I'm learning a little bit about my boys along the way. \n \nEach day after lunch I offer Oliver some choices about what we will do. Right now his options include: \n \nMath\u00a0 -- He is working on Algebra and geometry via the Khan Academy  \nHistory -- Sami and Oliver do History together. They are listening to a book on the Silk Road and watching this wonderful documentary on  WWI .  \nScience\u00a0 -- He is listening to A Briefer History of Time and watching the  Stephen Hawking series on Discovery , because, as you know: Stephen Hawking also cannot speak and is very, very smart so he is a hero to Sami and Oliver. Plus, there are worm holes!!! \nWriting -- Which is any excuse to practice typing \n \nLately, however, it is all about the writing. Both boys are completely engrossed in making their video project, undoubtedly spurred on by Higashida's wonderful book. \n \nUnfortunately, the technical part is aggravating and I am totally falling down on the job! Which is why you won't see their first efforts posted here.\u00a0 The old video camera cannot download to the new laptop and the old laptop is dead so the first part of what they recorded cannot be used. We've switched to the flipcam which is simple enough that Sami can operate on his own. Since nothing else can be done with the first video, I have their permission to transcribe it and record it here. Sami's portions are spoken and Oliver's typed. Initially the boys discussed and agreed on how to begin. Oliver rejected Sami's first question: \"Do you experience autism the same or different as other autistic people?\" as being too difficult.  \n \n \n****  \n \nSami: So, Oliver, do you think it would be better to have a brother with autism or without? \n \nOliver: I think that if I would have a brother with autism I would understand him. I would tell him to keep trying to do the things that are hard. I would remember that it is important to have people who believe in us even when things seem impossible. I would be just like my brother Sami. \n \nOliver: I have a question for Sami. Do you think it would be better to have a brother without autism? \n \nSami: Sometimes I think it would be easier. But I like you just the way you are. \n \nOliver: Do you ever feel embarrassed by me? \n \nSami: Well, sometimes it does come up.  \n \nOliver: Like when? \n \nSami: You know, sometimes you make noises and people look at us. I get embarrassed because they probably think you are weird and don't know that there is a lot more to you than that. It makes me mad and I don't want them to look at you like that.  \n \nOliver: I think maybe I am just as embarrassed as you are.

{"date": "January 09, 2014", "body": "\n In what way can we say that we know another person? When your child cannot speak you mostly go on observation and intuition. But these are so intrinsically tied to our own belief system that it is easy to see how our assumptions about what we think we are seeing can lead us to the wrong conclusions about why someone is acting a certain way.  \n \nIf you love a kid like my Oliver, one with \"High Octane\" autism (a term coined by  Leo's mom) , you might find that, more than the average kid, yours does things that you don't understand, things that are destructive, dangerous or harmful and no amount of explaining or consequences or replacement strategies or tears or even raging in frustration can get your kid to stop. Instead, you might come to believe as I did, that aside from your best efforts to keep your kid safe, you might really have no choice but to examine your  own  way of thinking about these challenges. \n \nWhen we talk about the challenges of autistic people and their \n\"behaviors\" we might think of them in one of two ways. Either: \"He \njust wants to do it. He knows he's not allowed. I've told him a million \ntimes not to do it. But he finds a way to do it anyway and just doesn't \ncare that he is causing damage.\" Or, we might say: \"I just don't think \nhe understands how much damage he causes when he does that.\" So the \nperson is either uncaring or unintelligent. But maybe there is a third, more respectful, way to think about it. And having arrived at this third way of thinking in my own personal parenting journey, I can also advise that it is incredibly helpful to read the words of autistic people and then try to integrate their \nexperiences with what we see happening in our own house.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nI say all this knowing full well that the most common thinking in autism circles is that an autistic person's actions are considered \"behaviors\" (I word I don't use in relation to my own guy because of it's negative connotation) and that these can be \"shaped.\"\u00a0 And here's where I always felt like such an enormous failure. Because I read all the parenting books. I read the Dr. Sears Discipline book. I read 1,2,3 Magic. I read behavorist manuals. I searched the internet, read blogs and talked to friends. And if some of those strategies were successful with your child, you're lucky. Only rarely did any of it work for us and then in a very limited fashion. Because if Oliver really wanted to do something there was just no way I could get him to stop in a way that allowed us both to retain our individual rights and emotional health. \n \nEventually I grew tired of the battle lines, frustration and negativity. Maybe that sounds like I just gave up, but really I see it as giving in. I allowed myself to give in to a much more expansive and active love than I ever practiced before.  \n \nAt the end of the day, the only thing that really worked was to believe that Oliver wanted to do the right thing but wasn't yet able. To love him, to not take his actions personally, to forgive him for the destruction or hurt, to understand that this was just part of his internal daily struggle. What worked was to express myself lovingly, to not shame him or feel guilty that I wasn't doing a better job and then to move on. Messes can be cleaned up. Material things can be replaced. Feelings can be mended. But self-esteem once it is damaged takes a long, long time to heal.  \n \nDespite Oliver's brilliant new ability to express himself and the incredible intellect revealed through his words, we still struggle with many of the same things that occupied us before our boy learned to type. T his post  from 2008, aside from the particulars, could have been written today. Though today I might find it simplistic to tell someone who is struggling to just make the right choice. Especially if I put that logic into the context of things that  I  struggle with on a daily basis. Anyone who has tried to stick to a diet understands.  \n \nLast week we found ourselves having one of  those  kinds of days.\u00a0 It was the kind of day that makes it difficult to practice the kind of love I'm talking about. It was the kind of day where, if you told me to \"just make the right choice,\" parenting-wise, I would have laughed at you. Or hit you. Or invited you to shut the hell up. I was struggling, you see. \n \nThe next day, Oliver wrote this (published here with his permission):  \n \n When I do things I'm not supposed to I know it makes you feel sad because you think I don't care about you. But I really can't stop myself from doing those things. It makes me feel so hopeless and frustrated with myself.  When\nI feel sorry my body and face might not show it and I can\u2019t tell you but I really\nwish I had not done what I shouldn\u2019t have.  I\nknow I should be able to behave myself\nnow that I am older. I will keep trying not to do those things. When you find\nyou want to be sad don\u2019t forget that I really love you. And know that I am trying really hard.\u00a0 \n \n \nOur kids need us to believe in their goodness even when faced with sometimes spectacularly trying circumstances. I know this is hard. Really, really hard. But let these words be a reminder that we can never know another person's struggles. If your child can't tell you why he did that thing that you've told him not to do a million times, remember Oliver's words and trust that your child would say the same if he could. And when you just don't know what to think or do anymore, giving in to love is always a good choice. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.squidalicious.com/", "http://www.daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2008/10/any-belief-that-i-am-in-control-is-pure.html"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2014/01/giving-in-to-love.html", "title": "\nGiving in to love\n"},

Nik and I paused what we were doing, looked at each other and smiled, both thinking the same thing. When he returned a minute later to deposit three bowls in the sink, we remembered that there was a time, not so very long ago, when we could not have imagined such a request being such a simple every day thing.\u00a0  \n \nThere was a time when Oliver was much younger and the list of things he couldn't do seemed so very long and I wondered if I would have to teach him everything. When he was young I felt in such a rush to beat the ticking clock of development. It felt like a race. And then, we decided to step off the race track and it was scary. \n \nI won't say that there weren't plenty of moments along the way when I questioned what we were doing -- or rather, what we weren't doing: the OT, the intensive speech therapy, the behavior therapy. We didn't have a lot of models to look to. Most of the people we knew in our community with kids similarly affected by autism were doing their best to fill their days with all sorts of therapy while we chose a radically different way of life. We chose going to the river, baking muffins and working in the garden over schedules and routines.  \n \nI also can't say how our life would be different if we had made other choices along the way, if we had chosen the more well-trodden path. But I can tell you that the most important thing we learned along the way was to balance issues of person-hood and quality of life with \"progress\" -- whatever that means. In this, we were lucky to have found a host of role models and advocates. Today I look around the internet and see that alternative ways of looking at what it means to be autistic are everywhere and how happy this makes me!! \n \nI often remind my kids that we are a team. That when one of us needs something, the others are there, ready to give. We each have challenges and we each have strengths. And what a joy it is to see Oliver, who sits at the very center of our family, fully inhabit his place on the team. So many years ago when I struggled with Oliver's diagnosis, I wish I could have envisioned the day when Oliver would turn, at the last second, to grab the lid to the box of raisins so he could close it before putting them away without me having to say a word. I wish I could have immediately grasped that these things would happen as a matter of course, without having to be taught, because we all learn as we go through life. I wish I could have imagined a time when Oliver would go each morning and sweetly cajole his late-sleeping and perennially grumpy brother out of bed and down the stairs for breakfast as I flipped pancakes in the kitchen waiting for my boys to take their seats at the table.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2016/04/simple-every-day-things.html", "title": "\nSimple, Every Day Things\n"},

Besides, Oliver had the last two cookies while I was at soccer practice and I'm still hungry even though I ate all of my dinner.\" \n \nThis is a version of a conversation I have with Sami everyday about a million different things. He asks for something, I say \"No\" and then he gives me a hundred reasons why I should change my mind. \n \nOne of the things that must have been hard for Oliver, being mostly non-verbal and unable to communicate for most of his life, had to have been watching his brother get away with things, get out of things and work the situation to his advantage through the delicate art of negotiation. (And yes, sometimes this means that the kid just hammers away at me until I give up or give in out of frustration.) When you stop to think about how much of life is really open to negotiation you begin to see how much time we spend navigating those grey areas. When you realized that you  could  actually have another cookie if only you could get your mom to agree, when you understood that there was something between the \"Yes\"and the \"No\", you probably also began to develop your skills of bargaining, negotiation, wheedling, whining and pleading. \n \nBut lets face it: if you are non-verbal, you are at a tremendous disadvantage in this department. You might want another cookie but if whining or repeatedly saying \"cookie\" is your only way of getting what you want, you are at a distinct disadvantage.\u00a0 I know this because both of my kids are master whiners, but when Sami follows it up by promising to eat two servings of vegetables for dinner if I let them have another cookie, I'm much more likely to give in. I've been conscious of this for years and try to remember to be more flexible when Oliver's desires are in conflict with what I think is the right thing to do, like say when he he wants to have a snack before bed even though he's already brushed his teeth. It's much easier to just say \"no'' to a kid who just can't talk back, to one who can't argue or negotiate, and then chalk his frustration up to the autism.  \n \nSo I'm thrilled to report that my boy is starting to assert himself through the fine art of negotiation. And given that he has a fine role model in Sami, I'm pretty sure I'm doomed. Two days ago when I told him that he absolutely, positively could not go and play in the water AT ALL TODAY because of something he had done, he waited until we were finished with school and then wrote: \"Maybe I could go in the water for a little bit now?\" The \"maybe\" did the trick and in five minutes he was in his bathing suit and in the water.  \n \nThen today I told him that he absolutely could not have another cookie until he finished all of his math work for the day, he picked up the pen and instead of writing out the answer to the question at hand, wrote: \"How about if I have another cookie and then finish my math?\" \n \nSo just like that, at the ripe age of ten, Oliver pulled up his chair to the bargaining table and served himself a cookie.  \n \n(It was actually me who ate the last two cookies. I did it when Sami was at soccer and Oliver was in the shower. And I didn't have to argue or negotiate with anyone. It's good to know how to pick your battles!)  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/09/what-lies-between-yes-and-no-cookie.html", "title": "\nWhat lies between Yes and No?

That I don't have anything to say to anyone anymore. That I'm not a real writer, it doesn't matter if I make the effort today or not.

{"date": "October 16, 2015", "body": "\n\"Thank you so much for asking me!\" This was the earnest reply of a friend \nwhom I had asked for help a number of years ago. \n \nAsking for help didn't \n(and still doesn't) come easily for me. My mother was a strong woman \nwho raised five children on her own. She often could have used help but rarely asked for it. She knew how to live on next to nothing and modeled it throughout my childhood. And when she did\n ask for help, because food and electricity aren't free and winter makes no concessions for poverty, I think it probably shamed her. She was born just after the Great Depression, the product of mid-western baptist farmers\u00a0 -- a proud sort of people. They were all the product of the \"Pull yourself up by the bootstraps\" American ethos. My mother taught us, as her parents taught her, that one must never let others know about our failures, our weaknesses or \nstruggles. I can see why she believed that and why asking for help then brought her shame. Laying your weaknesses out \nfor the world to see leaves you vulnerable and open to criticism and that can be frightening. I'm sure she would have been mortified by this blog, making a private journey public. But from where I sit, \ntoughing it out can sometimes require less bravery than putting your \nvulnerabilities on display and demanding acceptance. It takes a lot of courage to not be ashamed about needing help in a society that prizes independence, mistakenly conflating it with an individual's worth. \n \nBut my friend's remark was genuine that day. I can still hear how she said it, as though I was honoring her by asking her for help. In that simple sentence, she taught me a truth that I've been unraveling ever since. And in the unraveling, I've come to question assumptions about independence that I didn't even know I had.  \n \nFor instance, independence in communication is always a goal for people who type, but I think it is imperative to reflect on why this is the case and the value we place on it. \n \nShould Oliver work towards independence so he won't have to rely on another person for help to express himself? Well, yes. But there are other reasons for focusing on independence that are a little less benign. \n \nFirst, there is the issue of public perception. Sadly, I've recently come face to face with the fact that if one learns to type through facilitated communication methodology, there will always be some questions of authorship. In our experience, these questions (accusations) come from people who have never met Oliver. People who have never bothered to read more than a few slanted studies, have never bothered to try and understand why there might be truth on two sides of an issue and ask why that matters. Instead, users of facilitated communication like my son are dismissed as another sad case of a person being utterly manipulated by his caregivers. A human Ouji board. ... Don't get me started! \n \nTruthfully though, I'm glad that people are asking the questions of authorship and validity. When a vulnerable person is communicating something, it is right and good to always look at the circumstances and ask if the person is genuinely and freely communicating his or her thoughts. I always want there to be safeguards in place for this, to protect Oliver. All of his facilitators (he has six of them) are taught how to build these safeguards into their work together.\u00a0 Influence can and does happen. And the layers of influence can be complicated and not immediately obvious. Just as they are when I hear his brother Sami, who was born with the gift of gab, say something that I know is influenced by something I've said to him. Truthfully, I am more worried about this kind of influence than I am about someone moving Oliver's hand to type something not reflective of his own thoughts. Because of our long ago history with ABA and the violating use of full-physical prompts, Oliver knows that it is never OK for someone to force him to do something he doesn't want to do. He's not a toddler anymore and he's stubborn like his mother and his grandmother. \n \nIt strikes me as so absurd that the general public finds it acceptable, even considers it best practice, to physically move a person to complete the desired action (compelling a person forward) and call it a teaching strategy while also being completely against using physical touch to provide backward resistance (pulling away from the target action) in communication. To me, this is reflective of general attitudes towards the intelligence of non speaking people. \n \nWhen the ABA therapists forced Oliver's hand to retrieve the icon from his visual schedule, despite his very vehement objections, it was because  they didn't think he understood  what they were asking him to do. \n \nWhen Oliver first learned to type and required backward resistance, I lent him my hand because  I knew he could do it  and understood that he needed support, that is, touch to help him anchor his body in space. \n \nSo, while I do hope Oliver will someday be completely independent in his typing, I'm less and less inclined to push for it based, even in part, on my desire for him to be believed unequivocally. I don't want to lay that burden on my hard-working boy. Oliver, and many of those who type, know these are the stakes and the emotional toll can be very heavy. He feels that he needs to prove himself every time he sits down to type.\u00a0 It is wrong to complicate his struggles based on the prejudicial perceptions of others. Pushing for acceptance is the better fight.  \n \nAnd finally, I think it is important to examine our deeply held belief that independence, in all things, is the pinnacle of achievement. When Oliver was diagnosed with autism he was just three years old and among my first concerns was: Will he ever be able to be independent? This is still a concern but not because I think there is anything wrong with being dependent on others. After all, who among us is really independent? Most of us are just able and privileged enough to put supports in place to mask the fact that being part of society makes us  inter -dependent. And, having parented Oliver now for 13 years, and having recently cared for my very strong minded mother before she died, I've come to believe that caring for others elevates our lives and lets us tap into what it means to be human on a very deep level. This was the lesson in my friend's gratitude. My son is part of the fabric that connects us to each other as humans. That's no small thing. My concern over his dependence on others is rather due to his vulnerability and my fear that in this world where independence is paramount, the prejudicial cards are stacked against him. \n \nIn the end, I've come to think of independence as a kind of phantom pursuit. I don't really know what it means anymore or why it is seen as such an important goal. Where would we be if we didn't need one another? What a less full and textured life we would all lead! I think in many cases the desire for independence is fear-based and that isn't a healthy way for me to approach goal-setting. I want Oliver to know that it is always OK to ask for help and rather than diminishing his value it elevates us all if we let it. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2015/10/thoughts-on-independence.html", "title": "\nThoughts on Independence.\n"},

I've got a lot of secrets and so, in a self-preservation kind of way, I'm comfortable with them. But just let me be clear: I don't keep things to myself because I'm particularly secretive, it's just that the kind of things I'm talking about rarely come up in conversation. I spend a lot of time in polite company. And I learned early on that it's more than secrets that make people uncomfortable. Sometimes it's truth. So to save everyone I just keep a lot of things to myself. \n \nAs I've said before, so much of our truth comes down to the stories we tell ourselves. This week I marked the day, three years ago, of my mother's death. Her leaving released me from my long held desire to protect her from having to bear the weight of the damage done. It was better to just pretend that we had all escaped, but in truth, that just made the reckoning of it even more inescapable. For me, anyway. And at this point, I'm the only one left.  \n \nMaybe my rememberings aren't exactly correct. It's \ndifficult to look at the situation from outside of the girl I was. To \nget another perspective on those years when I was mute, you'd have to \nask my mother but she's dead and anyway I don't think she noticed much. I don't think anyone else did either, we were all only trying to get by. And if you don't count the people living in the house, that leaves exactly no one who knew what was going on or would remember. The \nonly guests I ever remember having at 737 were loud Uncle Auggie and his wife, Sissy. It was just that once when we all \nate a meal together on the good plates in the dining room and my father \nleaned over and said about the roast beef:  Put some salt on it, it'll taste better .\u00a0\n Eating was another thing I didn't do much of, but it was the only \nadvice I ever got from him so I took it and still remember the feeling of choking back that dry, salty meat.

{"date": "April 14, 2016", "body": "\nWant to hear something funny? \n \nI've been doing a lot of advocacy work in my community around Inclusive Education. It's a subject that deserves a post of it's own. Or several, really. But this post is more of an interesting aside. \n \nYou see, in order to advocate well, I've been reading a lot of documents, reports and studies related to educational outcomes for kids with disabilities. Several months ago I was reading something that described a kid very much like the boy who lives in this little green house. The author used the boy like Oliver as a case study for his central thesis. The paper concluded that this other child -- the one so much like my own -- and others with Significant Disabilities, could benefit from being included with their non-disabled peers in the general education classroom. \n \nHuh. \n \nThe funny part of the story is that my boy is thirteen, and for the first time upon reading this study, I came to understand that by any commonly accepted measures, he is considered  Significantly Disabled . \n \nThis kinda blows me away -- almost like somebody told me he had a third eye somewhere that I didn't know about.  \n \nIt blows me away because I would never, not in a million years, describe him that way. I don't  think  of him that way. Oliver is just Oliver. And yes, he's disabled. Autism is a central part of who he is. But  significantly  disabled? What does that even mean? \n \nSo it got me thinking. \n \nOne of the benefits of stepping outside of the system and homeschooling for so many years is that we were free to create opportunities and experiences for our boy. We made sure that we always found ways for him to be competent and successful. We didn't put him in situations where his challenges weren't compensated for by his strengths or supports. So, while  of course  the challenges of his autism have always been a central consideration, even a  significant  consideration, they were just  part  of the balancing act. \n \nBut the balance has been precarious this year. \n \nSchool has not been smooth sailing for my boy -- hence all of my advocacy work. In fact, since the beginning of the new year, I have been spending a tremendous amount of time at school with Oliver. Many, many times we have considered taking him out altogether and retreating to a place where balance is more easily within our grasp. \n \nSo when I read those words,  Significantly Disabled , it was like that feeling you get when you first try on a pair of glasses with your new prescription and everything shifts slightly into focus. Because over the last few months I have watched my boy flounder and fail in a way I'm not used to seeing. And now I understood: in a classroom where he is consistently asked to overcome his challenges in order to succeed, where they are not also pitching to his strengths. ... well, he is indeed  significantly disabled . In fact, I don't think I've ever  seen  Oliver as disabled as I've seen him in the classroom this year.  \n \nHuh. \n \nWhat a revelation. \n \nNow I finally understand some of those awkward silences around the table during school meetings! All along we've been talking about two different kids. \n \n Significantly Disabled. \n \nI won't adopt this new lens of disability. I won't think of my boy as less able than I know him to be and I won't use those words to describe him to others. \u00a0But, wow: What a lesson about words and context! And also about why people -- educators, doctors and therapists -- have the perspective they do and why advocacy is so, so important. \n \nFor a very brief moment I saw my boy through their lens -- I just like my vision better. And it's a vision that's worth fighting for.

This golden slant of sun and blue October sky is fleeting.  Last night, we gathered around a fire in the back yard, eating chili and listening to Dylan -- the boy's pick -- remind us that times they are a changin'. As if we need the reminder. Pumpkins congregate, waiting; squirrels squirrel away; and I grudgingly make room for more sweaters. Oliver spends large chunks of time flipping through family photos on his iPad, nostalgic as I am for the things that have come before. \n \nFor the second year, Fall is making followers of us. We follow the schedule, follow the rules, follow rhythms not our own. But in the quiet, in-between moments, we make room for the making of our narrative. We tell each other what we remember, what it means, how we felt about it. Remember Christmas Eve last year when we didn't know the tent leaked? I was already angry because you were hiding out in the car reading the newspaper and eating the cheese I was saving for later. Then, racing against the departing sun, I took up my spot at the Coleman stove making fish tacos for our Christmas Eve meal and the skies opened up. Everyone looked to me.  Hurry up,  I said.  Eat ! Soon even I could see that it was ridiculous to eat in a downpour and we picked up our plates, rushed into the tent, laughing. Then we discovered that our borrowed tent leaked and we laughed some more. What else could we do? As the storm raged on, we sat in the only dry spot, drinking sparkling cider and eating cheese and crackers. I didn't mention that half the cheese was gone already and we spent the rest of Christmas Eve using the dryer in the bathroom shelter and hoping our quarters would last. Earlier, when we were using beach towels to catch the rain that was falling  inside  the tent, Sami, you very magically and with great love said:  This is the best Christmas ever. \u00a0 And it was because that was the story we told ourselves.  \n \nI was at the grocery store early Sunday morning. A rare trip without The Boy Who Loves To Shop. I found myself wondering what it will be like when Oliver has a life of his own, one that doesn't involve weekly grocery shopping with his mother. Remember when we used to practice tossing the groceries to each other? How it felt like we were doing something wrong but I told you boys that it was OK because we intended to buy those items anyway? And then it got out of hand because Sami started throwing things to me when I wasn't looking and I feared we really would get kicked out so I said  Let's not do that anymore . For the first time yesterday I could see how others might not find grocery shopping to be the adventure we always make it. \n \nStanding in line I watched an indigenous woman -- from where? Peru? Ecuador? Guatemala? She navigated from one aisle to the next, her tiny daughter pirouetting in a wide circumference around her. Her own private moon. Their orbiting a primordial truth on display right there next to the Libby's canned pumpkin. I squinted at them as I learned to do when I was in love with the painter and he was trying to teach me how to see the shape of things more clearly. Adjusting my gaze, I wondered if I would see my own reflection, a tiny boy by my side, in their journey past the cakes. No, we had been something different altogether. Oliver was a comet, not a moon. Their neatly prescribed orbit was never part of our story, I told myself. \n \nOr maybe, I sometimes wonder, it simply wasn't part of the story I told myself. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DhmKy4TPHpE/ViVPC9fwDoI/AAAAAAAABQI/jbxayjyMLvU/s1600/IMG_1465.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2015/10/our-stories-ourselves.html", "title": "\nOur Stories, Ourselves\n"},

Now we were profoundly free from the apron strings of mother-love. We could go anywhere. Turns out, I would take us home. \n \nMy mother was the happiest I ever saw her, those years in Maine. She still worked the long, hard hours of the barely getting by, but there were fewer children at home; life was easier. And then there was the beauty of the place. The landscape, our constant companion, allowed us to participate in her sometimes surly, always generous, beauty, for nothing more than the cost of walking outside. Poverty reduces your expectations in life, bearing witness to extravagant beauty expands them, makes you feel like you deserve something. During those years we all expanded into beauty unimaginable at the beginning of our story. My mother most of all. When she died, we found a note among her papers suggesting (never asking or directing, as was her way) that her ashes be spread in a place of beauty where the rocks meet the sea.  Maine , we said. \n \nIn a mean twist of fate, my mother's ashes were stolen, along with the rest of the contents of her house. The getting over, the bitter moving on -- I was born to it, raised to it. So I was my mother's daughter once more and did both. Yet, two years after her death I found myself planning a visit to the place that had called to her. The place where she found the happiness that had so often escaped her. And more, I planned that we should keep going to the place she had dreamed of. Cape Breton. \n \nI had already booked passage to Yarmouth on the western shore of Nova Scotia. I mapped a route to Halifax, then up to Louisbourg, northward to Cape Breton, on to the Bay of Fundy, then crossing to Prince Edward Island before heading home via New Brunswick, then Maine.  My mother would have loved this trip , I said. The words spoken uncurled long forgotten conversations, the subconscious imprint of a place I'd never heard of.  Cape Breton , she had said. From that moment the trip became about saying good-bye to my mother. \n \nDuring July and August we had our   adventure, camping for five weeks, discovering ourselves, discovering beauty, learning to tell new stories about the kind of people we are and hope to be. At night, fire embers glowing, we curled ourselves together in the tent, a snug family cocoon, and I told more stories. I wove together the past and the present teaching my children who they came from so they will know how to weave their own. And each day when we climbed the rocky shoreline or looked to the distant blue horizon, my mother was there with me.  Look at this, Mom. We made it.  And each day, I'd look for the most beautiful place I could imagine, the place where I'd say good-bye. \n \nWhen I found the spot where I thought my mom would be content to meet the wind and the seas, I took a small green composition book from by pack. Words written some twenty years before her death, neatly spanning a hundred or so pages. She wasn't one to share her private thoughts and feelings. She never told us how she felt about us, never remarked affectionately about anything of our character or personality. That she loved us was indisputable but I would have liked to know why, apart for the accident of our birth. Maybe to her that was all that really mattered. We were hers and she was ours. That was enough. The journal, forgotten, was not destroyed with the others in the backyard fire pit after she sensed something was wrong and before it became inescapable to us all, was a difficult read. She wrote her stories, her truth, and I found the words and meanings my mother was never able to say when she was alive. \n \nI placed the book on a rock on a high plateau overlooking the sea and offered it fire. The wind made a show of it, which I think she would have liked, sending whole pages alight and aloft, floating out over the ocean, burning paper ghosts, dancing on unseen currents.\u00a0 In the face of it, I no longer held regret for the ashes of her body, nor of what was unsaid. Her stories, consumed by the fire and by me, were enough. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vqpT8rE5mQA/VibmHODjB6I/AAAAAAAABQk/uBPMAD2z4kE/s1600/IMG_1646.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rgfm_aAmucM/VibloFcQkrI/AAAAAAAABQc/S6WpK0fG-qU/s1600/IMG_1647-1.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2015/10/how-to-say-good-bye-in-cape-breton.html", "title": "\nHow to Say Good-bye in Cape Breton\n"},

His struggles with impulse control cause frustration for both of us. The trick is to get through it and to a place where we both feel OK on the other side. It isn't always easy. But I'm learning how to slow down and wait until I can get to the place where my responses only come from a place of love and empathy and deep gratitude for this little guy whose struggles are often misunderstood. I'm making progress. \n \nLast week it occurred to me that it was I who should be asking Oliver for forgiveness. I have so many words at my disposal and they are easy to come by. I can explain why I misunderstood the boy for so long, why I didn't parent from a place of presuming competence even when I thought I was, why I said what I did and how I made choices along the way. But none of that probably matters so much to a little boy who couldn't make himself understood and who only needed my wide open love, acceptance and unshaken belief.  \n \n\"Did you care about how I felt before I could type?\" \n \nThe answer should have been unequivocally, \"Yes!\" But it's more complicated than that. So much of Oliver was unknowable before he could make himself understood through typing. Of course I  cared  how he felt! But somehow I had also allowed myself to be moved from a place where I thought I might understand the world from his perspective. I had \"othered\" my own child and I didn't even know it. Whoever started the story that Autistics lack empathy, the thing at the very core of our humanness, drove a wedge between us so slight that I couldn't even see it.\u00a0 The wedge reverberated: \"He can't understand so I can't understand.\"\u00a0 Over the years I knew the empathy story was a false one; Oliver felt  more , not less. But the wedge was already there. Wrong ideas about autism are pervasive and sticky like cobwebs across this path we're traveling. You carry them with you long after you've broken through to the other side. \n \nI couldn't answer Oliver's question the way I should have and he didn't offer me forgiveness. But I stand now in a place of light where the webs of wrong ideas are plain. I can't change the past but I can promise to drive out the wedge between us that falsely led me to believe that he stood so far from my own understanding. And I can join my voice with his, though it often seems small and unheard, leaving it here along the path for others who might follow. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2014/03/sticky-webs-of-wrong-ideas.html", "title": "\nSticky webs of wrong ideas.\n"},

{"date": "March 10, 2015", "body": "\nOliver's piano playing is a revelation to me. Seriously! When will I stop being surprised by this kid?  \n \nI know we are always exhorted to \"Presume Competence!!\" these days -- and it is a welcome shift in the autism rhetoric -- but frankly, I'll be really honest with you: I don't always know how to do it. I'm getting better and now that Oliver has the means to communicate it is a thousand times easier. A million, trillion times easier!! But before Oliver could communicate, before I understood that  apraxia  played a significant role in his ability to demonstrate his competence in almost all areas, I found it hard to understand that the support he needed was largely for his  physical  abilities and not cognition. At the age of nine, no professional had  ever  mentioned the word apraxia to me. \n \nSo, for example, when Oliver was nine and we were  still  working on 1:1 correspondence, he was unable to demonstrate to me that nine objects equaled 9. If someone had told me that I should just assume he understood and move on, I would have objected. I would have told you that if he can't demonstrate such a simple understanding how could he demonstrate anything more complex? Maybe a better teacher would have known how do it but I certainly did not and I'm guessing that the teachers in our local ABA program wouldn't have either.  \n \nIf only I had understood that everything about a motor pattern -- initiating, maintaining and stopping -- required tremendous mental focus for my boy! I would not have endlessly come up with new ways to teach him the concept of counting without factoring in the actual physical ability to execute the task I laid before him.  If you had told me to presume competence I wouldn't have known how to do it!  That's why you won't hear me use those words very often. At one time they would have seemed very hollow to me. But I also believed -- truly, truly believed -- that my boy had endless untapped potential. I was doing everything I knew how to do, I just didn't know how to tap into it. I think this is the maddening part for most parents. So if you are one of those people frustrated by the phrase, I want to tell you:  I get it! \n \nPresuming competency works if a person is given the right supports. That is the critical missing part of the \"Presume Competency\" mantra. Providing the right support means understanding the nature of a person's challenges and it isn't always self-evident. So this is where I fell short. And, I'm guessing, where many, many others fall short. When autism as a motor difference is more widely acknowledged, I'm guessing that teaching strategies and research agendas will show that Oliver is special only in his luck and circumstances. I believe that there are many, many other Olivers out there silently waiting! \n \nSo, anyway, back to the piano! One of the first things Oliver told me when he began writing (nearly three years ago!!) was that he wanted to be a pianist and learn to compose music. \n \nSo, um, yeah. Where to begin?!  \n \nMy knowledge of music is limited to a mental picture of black squiggles on horizontal lines and the phrase Every Good Boy Does Fine. That's it. But by that time I  did  know certain things about Oliver: He has a photographic memory. He has trouble locating his body in space. He learned to read by deciphering patterns, not through phonics -- which I understood to be whole to part learning rather than part to whole: Gestalt learning. And that he would not tolerate masking tape on the keys of the piano. Things must not stick together in this household! \n \nArmed with these bits of information I spoke to several local piano teachers. All of them looked back at me blankly. None seemed overly enthusiastic at the prospect of a student like Oliver. One agreed to give it a try. I knew we were doomed when he showed up with a roll of masking tape. We gave up at the end of the second lesson. Sometimes it's good to know when to call it a day! \n \nI put the idea of learning piano on the back burner for awhile, which was easy given the amount of time and energy that has gone into this year's great Public School Adventure! But it was always in the back of my mind. When Oliver tells me he wants to learn something, I'm not bound to give up easily. And then, one day last December, I read about a piano teacher that made me think it was time to try again. \n \nSo we did. And, Friends? I'm back to where I started this post because it has been a revelation. A revelation in what a person can do when he is understood and given the right supports. My boy is playing the piano! He is on his way to achieving this thing that seemed so out of reach just a short while ago. And without the right physical supports, and the right teacher, it would have been just that: out of reach!  \n \nThere is so much to tell you, really. How I found this awesome, incredible teacher. How she recognizes his strengths and teaches to them. How she effortlessly assumes his competency  even when I'm still not sure!  How she totally gets how he processes information. How I always leave a lesson thinking: Well, this next step is going to be hard! And then how it totally isn't even a fraction as hard as I imagined! Just thinking about it makes me want to explode with happiness. Happiness for Oliver in his achievement and happiness that I could finally help him do something he has wanted for so long. \n \nI never dreamed that learning to play the piano would wind up being such a powerful force in our lives, but it is shaping up to be as significant as when Oliver first started writing. As significant as  learning to ride a bike!  \n \nI can't even begin to tell you! But I'm going to try: so don't be surprised if my next couple of posts are about the music.  \n \nIn the meantime, here are two short clips.

{"date": "February 21, 2015", "body": "\nOliver has made tremendous strides in his ability to communicate over the past three years and can now generally tell us what he needs to, if given the right support. But for most of his life -- nine and a half years -- this has not been true. And during those years I thought, as you can imagine, how much easier, how much better, life would be if only Oliver could communicate. And surely it is. I'm not here to say that his ability to express himself, to become much more of an agent in his own life, has been anything other than life changing for all of us. But there have been some surprising revelations along the way that I want to tell you about. Because although life has changed profoundly, it has also stayed very much the same. And if you are a person with a non-verbal child who is comparing what our life looks like (via this blog) to what your life feels like, you might not get the full picture.\u00a0 You might not guess that I'm as happy about what has stayed the same as I am regretful about some of the profound changes. \n \n If you've read any of Oliver's contributions to this blog, you might think many things. You might marvel, like I do, that they are there at all. Happily, Oliver is one of a growing number of non-speaking people who have found the right supports and are now able to express themselves. But the numbers are still frustratingly small and are often seen as \"special cases.\" You might read the insights he shares and wonder how they apply to the person you love who hasn't yet found a way to express himself. You might be impressed with his clarity and his gracious way of reflecting on the world around him. But what you won't necessarily know just by reading his words is how much they cost him. You might not know that composing a paragraph might take him all afternoon. Or how emotional it can be for him to wrestle with words that label and explain things he has little practice expressing or that he experiences quite differently from everyone around him. And, unless you know him well, you might not see how much his physical ability to type varies from one day, one moment, to the next. You might not also then understand why Oliver is sometimes a reluctant typer.  \n \nWhen Oliver began to communicate, first by hand-writing and then through typing, I pestered him a lot. I asked him a million questions a day, with little understanding for how much it was costing him. There were so many things I wanted to know! I'd waited so long! In all the circumstances of the past when I thought life would be easier if Oliver  could just tell me  what he wanted or what he was feeling or what was wrong. ... it was his ability to express himself using  language  that I pinned all our troubles and hopes to. Now that he had language, I was eager to move into the next chapter of our lives together. \n \n Somehow, in my wild imagination, I thought that  language  would make everything come together so that our lives would be a version of some other story, not the one we had created together for more than 9 years. Instead, what I came to realize is that when a person is in crisis, or having a taxing moment, those are precisely the same moments when hard-won communication is not always possible.\u00a0 When you love a non-speaking person, you get pretty good at reading body language and moods and vocalizations and facial expressions. You know what sensations they seek and which ones they avoid. You become incredibly attuned to that person, and whether you realize it or not, that person is equally attuned to you. Yes, when Oliver began to type I learned some things I couldn't have   known otherwise: his favorite color is blue, he would like to learn to \ncompose music and he is quick to pick up abstract concepts. These are \nrevelations more valuable to me than gold. But more importantly, in the \ndays since Oliver has learned to type, I learned that so much of what I \nneeded to know to parent Oliver well  I already knew . And although we have shared some incredible moments together revolving around words, so so many of our finest moments have been  wordless . I could post a million pictures here of bike rides we have taken or the two of us drinking in the richness of the forest or the ocean, times when it seemed only right that no words were spoken. Those being-in-the-present moments, before typing and after, were full and perfect just as they were.  \n \nI don't want to insult anyone by suggesting that Oliver's ability to communicate his thoughts and opinions has been anything short of amazing. This gift allows for a level of self-determination that will be key to our boy's future and allows me to hope that things will be easier for him. And certainly it makes some things easier in the present but maybe not as you might expect. Without a doubt, the kind of communication with Oliver that is now part of our lives is an enormous gift.\u00a0 Yet without a doubt, I will also tell you that the thing that changed the most profoundly, the thing that made the  most  difference in the day to day living of life, was my own mental shift as both his mother and his advocate. And what I most want to tell you is that it was in my power to make this shift before Oliver ever wrote a single word. \n \nYou see, the things that were hard before he could type are still very hard. The many strategies we developed over the years to make life easier for my boy are the same ones I still rely on. He still needs support with a lot of the things that have always challenged him. Oliver likes doing the same sort of things now that he did before he learned to type. He still resists doing things that make him anxious (which is a lot) and we still support him to try anyway. Not much has changed about how we make our way through our lives together and this makes me incredibly happy because I think it means we were doing a lot of things right from the start. Sometimes it can be hard to know. \n \nSo not much has changed; but  everything  has changed.  \n \nEverything has changed because of the way people treat Oliver. And as hard as it is to admit: I'm talking about me. Oliver demonstrates competencies and understanding now more than ever,  because I allow him to .\u00a0 And I insist that everyone else does it, too.\u00a0 Despite the fact that his  \"behavior\"  is the same as it ever was, he succeeds in a classroom of his peers because I insist that he be there. It is a bitter lesson to learn, nine years in, that when your child fails you can simply choose to believe that you have not yet found a way for him to be successful and that in the choosing  you will change everything . Believe me, when you are looking for evidence of competency you will find it just as surely as looking for the opposite is true. Believing in Oliver is my most valuable IEP weapon.  \n \n When Oliver was much younger, people encouraged us to always treat him as though he understood everything going on around him, to not talk about him in front of him. And I'd like to say I did. I wanted to. I  tried  to, anyway. But I also vividly remember moments like the time when Oliver was about 7 or 8 years old and I was tired from being up with him all night and I didn't want to get off the couch and turn the damn light on. He was spinning round and round in the living room like the cost of staying up all night every night for a week was nothing to him. So I asked him to turn on the light, indicating the wall switch across the room. I would like to tell you that I wasn't quietly devastated when, by way of response, he picked up random things around the room, looking at me as though asking: \"Is this what you want?\" It was so obvious that he didn't understand what I was saying to him in that moment. ... Wasn't it? Because he loved to turn light switches on and off so I knew he knew  how  to do it. In that moment, though, he couldn't and I thought it was evidence that maybe he  never  would. I made an assumption about  why  he was failing. As it turns out, I endlessly made assumptions without being aware of it. Those assumptions diminished what I expected of him. They diminished my power to be the mother and advocate that he needed me to be. And they were  wrong . \n\u00a0  \n \n Friends, if I could go back in time, I would do it in a heartbeat. I would get my tired ass off the couch that day, pull the boy in close to me and tell him that it was all right, that it wasn't a test, that we would do it together. I would tell him that I would be there for him without judgement anytime he needed my help.  And I would mean it . I would find a way to help him be successful in these small things so that in the future, when he was faced with bigger challenges, he wouldn't be afraid to try. I wasn't a complete failure in this regard, but I didn't completely get it right, either.  \n \nSomeone once advised me that you can't pour language into a child, and that's true. You can do all the right things and still have a child who struggles with being able to speak, for whom all communication is a struggle. But you  can  pour your confidence into your child by choosing to believe that he or she understands everything. You can see your failures as steps on the path to getting it right for both of you. You can assign value to all the silent, beautiful moments that you share together. You can allow yourself and your child some grace when things don't go as easily as you'd wish because these are the moments that build the bonds you are so afraid aren't there. \n \nLast week, I was frustrated with Oliver. He was vehemently against practicing the piano for a few days so I asked him for advice on what to do when this happens. On the one hand, I know he wants to learn. On the other hand, he was so distressed by just sitting at the piano. Do I push him? Do I take a step back? It's hard to know, right? Even now, with all his beautiful words, it's sometimes so hard to know. I think his response is an appropriate end to this post because it is both so individual and so universal. Who hasn't felt this way in their life? I have the luxury of being able to ask him now, it's true. But it's almost like I already knew the answer: \n \n \"It takes so much work to succeed at even the easiest things sometimes. I get really frustrated with myself and I don't think that I want to keep trying so I get angry at whoever is helping me. Please understand that sometimes you have to forgive me so I can forgive myself.\" \n \u00a0- Oliver \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uELNlQEX8Zk/VOjAO1W1NFI/AAAAAAAABHk/VrJUCSZ3E-Y/s1600/IMG_125.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2roIKzDUsc8/VOi_7sLl7aI/AAAAAAAABHc/fliD1NAlDnU/s1600/IMG_0542.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YlwLoh-eQRY/VOfqWp8IKfI/AAAAAAAABGw/7W88rqp-k3s/s1600/080.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LIG96UQqkLU/VOfq3_txDqI/AAAAAAAABG4/H7u2ah1sRww/s1600/IMG_0678.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9B2yrOeAneI/VOfq6HwOh6I/AAAAAAAABHA/sDyanPjfRMI/s1600/IMG_0316.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2015/02/my-lightbulb-moment.html", "title": "\nMy Lightbulb Moment\n"},
{"date": "February 26, 2015", "body": "\nI just realized that I've been writing in this space for nearly ten years.  Ten years . I've only gone back and read older posts on occasion. I don't like to be reminded of the fear that underlined my first year or so of posts. But yesterday I indulged in a little trip down memory lane and found myself surprised that in some very basic ways my thinking hasn't changed all that much. Overall, I feel pretty thankful for the road I've traveled, despite how rocky it felt at the start. \n \nHere's a post that I wrote back in the beginning of 2009 when Oliver was seven. I might now have chosen slightly different language, but the message is one that I still need reminding about from time to time! \n \n \n A Spoonful of Carrot\n \n \n\n \nIf I could go back in time and tell my early-diagnosis-self a thing or \ntwo, I know just what I'd say: don't sweat the small stuff. Of course \nI'd probably also want to take my shoulders in my more wizened hands and\n shake good and hard. I could have used that back then. But this \nbusiness about the small stuff? So important.  When I look back over the\n countless things that occupied me, that took up emotional space that I \nwas borrowing from something more important, well, I see that those \nthings weren't worth the amount of upset that I caused myself, Oliver, \nand the rest of the family. The list is long and varied: wearing shoes \nand socks, wearing a coat, eating with utensils, biting fingernails, \npicking the nose, licking this, that and the other thing. ... um, that \npoop thing. ... well, you get the idea.  Some of you may know that while\n you are in the midst of these things they feel like such a very big \ndeal. In the midst of it there were times when I felt at war. I felt \nthat I needed to conquer or -- in the terms of ABA -- to  extinguish . Now\n I can only shake my head at myself. This was my child, not my enemy. I'm\n reflecting on this lately because Oliver is newly interested in \nutensils. Yes, you read that right: spoons, forks, knives, ladles, \nwhisks -- you name it. At first I didn't really pay much attention, \nOliver just seemed to always have a fork or a spoon in his hand. But we \nspend a lot of time in the kitchen together.

Sure, I knew other parents of autistic children, but not one of those kids looked like Oliver. I was tired and alone. And everything I read --  everything  -- was fearful. So yes, I had a good bit of anxiety about what I could expect from life after we  learned to say autism . But even from the start, I nurtured a small seed of optimism and I questioned everything. Writing this blog was what helped me to frame my own thinking. Often I don't know what I think until I write it down! Reading other blogs and finding voices like my own, a chorus that I could join, helped me grow that seed of optimism into a giant tree of belief in my boy. Ten years ago it seemed there were so few positive voices available to parents like me. Today, happily, there are an enormous number of autistic advocates who have rightly taken charge of the conversation. There are also other allies who write eloquently about topics that have often interested me here. \n \nHere are a few of my favorite this week:  \n \n http://autism.typepad.com/autism/  -- Kristina Chew was the first person I found who wrote about life with her son, Charlie, in way that I could identified with.

Would he be able to \ncommunicate when he needed to? And please God, if in this new adventure \nsomeone could just befriend my boy? Would that be asking too much? \nBecause it's a big, scary world out there and knowing that you've got \nthe support of your friends really matters! Not surprisingly, perhaps, the need for \nfriendship and connection has very rarely come up in the many discussions with his educational team. But it's always on my mind and, although building connections is embedded in his IEP \ngoals, I think all of us tend to focus on the  how  of communication so much more than the  why  of it. \n \nAnd\n then came the day last week when Oliver shifted my thinking once again \n-- what would I do without this boy??\u00a0\u00a0 He reminded me and everyone around him that we must \nalways, always believe he is capable of being an agent in his own life.  \n \nIt\n was a cold and blustery Thursday when his teacher met me just outside \nthe school as I picked Oliver up following his last class. As she braved\n the weather I could feel myself bracing for the inevitable, thinking: \n\"Oh no, what has happened now!\" But I certainly wasn't expecting what I \ngot. Emotionally, she recounted the story of my boy's day. Another \nstudent was having some difficult moments and so she decided to put some\n space between the two of them. Oliver is very attuned to the emotional \nstate of those around him and I guess they didn't want two kids in \nemotional high gear at once. After the other boy went to another room, \nOliver started a conversation with the teacher, asking what had happened\n and if there was something he could do. Then he asked if he could see \nthe other boy. With a fair bit of trepidation, it\n was agreed that Oliver could sit with the other boy. When the two boys \nwere in the same space again, a kind of calm settled between the two of \nthem, much to everyone's surprise. Oliver then typed with the other boy,\n letting him know that he understood how hard school can be sometimes. \n \nLater\n his mother sent me a note saying how much she appreciated what Oliver \nhad done for her son and how happy he was to have a friend like Oliver \nwho understood him. \n \nFolks? I had it all wrong: No one needed to 'befriend' Oliver.\u00a0 Why? Because he is fully capable of  being  a friend. Of course he is.  Of course he is!  When he has the right supports and opportunities he will forge his own connections. Just like the rest of us, he wants to write his own story.  \n \nAnd this is why I will fight for him to be included in the great big scary world around him every day.

{"date": "July 08, 2013", "body": "\nIn just a few days I will pack up the car with probably far more than we will need, point the front bumper North, and hit the road. Oliver and I will be attending the  2013 Summer Institute on Communication and Inclusion  at Syracuse University. This conference has loomed large in my mind since I first considered attending.  Could  we attend? How would that work? How would Oliver respond to being in such an environment? Would he be overwhelmed? Would I be overwhelmed helping him navigate? What would he get out of it? What would I get out of it? As I wondered about these things I started trying to find out as much as I could about Facilitated Communication (FC), because, I discovered, that's how the world understands Oliver's ability to write. He still needs support to get his words down on paper. Without another person's touch he cannot locate his hand properly in space and the effort of writing becomes an exercise in frustration.  \n \nWhen I first heard about FC, at about the time it was getting lots of negative press, I dismissed it almost immediately. I wasn't interested in anything that was controversial. There were far too many other topics to get smart about and I wasn't going to waste my time on some kooky \"therapy\" that promised things that seemed too good to be true. I never thought about it again. Not, that is, until a little more than a year ago when I discovered that Oliver could both read and write. And let me be clear about this: Oliver is no ouiji board, as one commenter here once suggested. He writes, with the assistance of three different people, in his own idiosyncratic way. He is on his way to being independent, but basically I don't really know how to be helpful in any kind of systematic way. So I'm looking for help. \n \nLucky for me, I discovered that there are many amazing individuals out there who have succeeded in making their voice heard through FC.\u00a0 Together, Oliver and I watched an amazing documentary,  Wretches and Jabberers , about two autistic men who travel internationally connecting with other non-verbal autistics who communicate through writing. Oliver sat, uncharacteristically rapt, through the entire documentary. The next day we watched it again. Surprised that Oliver was paying such close attention, I asked him about it and he replied that he didn't know that there were others like him in the world.\u00a0 That's when I knew that there was something important that needed to be done for Oliver. I needed to find a way to connect Oliver with other people like himself. And I needed to start educating myself about how to teach Oliver about self-advocacy. Because I don't know how much support Oliver will need in his future but I want him to have both the self-awareness and the confidence to ask for it when he needs it. \n \nSo Oliver and I are both registered participants for the Summer Institute. The  schedule of events  features an impressive lineup of speakers and workshops. My goal is to come away with strategies for helping Oliver to become more independent in his communication and for making it more integrated in our lives. \n \nWhen I asked Oliver what he was looking forward to he said: \"I might be able to meet other men with autism like me.\"  \n \nI am giddy with excitement! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMile 25: Something tells me our little biker dude has the makings of a strong self-advocate! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://soe.syr.edu/centers_institutes/institute_communication_inclusion/Summer_Institute/default.aspx", "http://www.wretchesandjabberers.org/", "http://soe.syr.edu/centers_institutes/institute_communication_inclusion/Summer_Institute/schedule_2013.aspx", "rtsp://v6.cache5.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQmfc0zQ8wp2shMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2013/07/finding-our-way.html", "title": "\nFinding our way\n"},
{"date": "November 02, 2013", "body": "\nI don't like to advise people. I don't like being in a position of telling others what to do. But I  am  a person of strong opinions. And just this once I'd like to tell you to do something. And by \"you\", I especially mean those who love and support non-speaking autistic people of all ages.  \n \nI want you to promise that when you find yourself explaining to someone that you have no idea what your loved one knows or understands that you will also quickly add a sentence to explain that you believe he understands everything and just hasn't yet found a way to let the world know. \n \nWhen you observe your loved one behaving in a way that you don't understand and he can't explain, promise me that you will believe that he is trying the best he can and that he is as frustrated -- probably more so -- than you. \n \nWhen you see that she can't master skills that come easily to others and that dark fear that it will always be this hard creeps into your heart, promise me to believe in her ability to learn and achieve.  \n \nPlease, just believe. \n \n It's the most important thing you will ever do for the person you love.  \n \nBecause if you don't believe that's just one more hurdle for this person to overcome. And believe  me : they have it hard enough already.  \n \nOnly 18 months ago I was working on 1:1 correspondence with my son, who was nine. When I asked him to hand me 4 plates each night before dinner to set the table, he would hand me plate after plate, counting each as he went: 1....2....3.....4....5....6..... and he would have kept going if I didn't stop him along the way. Each night it was the same. I assumed, wrongly, that Oliver didn't fully understand the 1:1 concept.  \n \nNow that Oliver can communicate I see that his difficulty was in another kind of processing. Maybe he couldn't simultaneously process the counting and the physical actions. Maybe he just felt too much pressure to get it right when his body and brain weren't working together. I now understand that his true challenges were masked by how hard he works to compensate for a body that doesn't cooperate. And even though my boy and I are pretty much inseparable, and I like to think I'm pretty observant, I had  no idea  that he had so much trouble controlling his body. I mean, if you're ever lucky enough to see this boy on a bike you'll know why. On two wheels he is grace personified. \n \nIt never occurred to me to load his iPad with math apps geared towards fractions, decimals and algebra but now that I see how easily he navigates them I regret that they weren't there to explore alongside the colorful counting apps that I thought he needed. I regret that I didn't give him the opportunities to display an interest in things that I assumed he wouldn't understand. I regret that my assumptions limited him when they should have been expanding his world. \n \nI regret. \n \nSo now promise me that you won't also feel this deep regret at some point in the future. \n \nGo now to that person you love and tell him that you believe.  \n \nEven if this person you love can't eat with a utensil. Even if she hasn't mastered toileting. Even if she can't manage the simplest communication system and even Yes and No are hard. Even if he never seems to be paying attention and can't sit still for a second. Tell him that you believe. And keep saying it until you are both convinced. \n \nAnd on the days when it's hard, say it even louder.  \n \nFill this person's life richly with thoughts and ideas. Read aloud what interests  you  and share your thoughts and opinions as though your words are a life line  because they very well may be   what is feeding his spirit . Play audio books before bed, choose classics that appeal to people of any age. Listen to the news together, NPR, TED talks, documentaries, and then talk about it at dinner time, even if yours is the only voice. Both of your lives will become richer. \n \nOnly 18 months ago I wasn't sure my son knew his last name or understood, exactly, the concept of birthdays or anything abstract, really. \n \nTwo months ago he wrote these words:\u00a0  I couldn't tell \npeople that I understood everything. People treated me like I just \ndidn't think  but that is all I did .\u00a0 \n \n So promise me that you will believe this also to be true of the person you love. Sustain your belief even on the hardest days -- because yes, it seems impossibly hard some days -- and say it loudly for everyone to hear.\u00a0 \n \n Because by making this promise the only thing you risk losing is regret.\u00a0  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2013/11/do-me-favor.html", "title": "\nDo me a favor\n"},
{"date": "July 09, 2013", "body": "\nWe haven't focused on Oliver's autism for quite a long time now -- a few years, maybe -- unless you count a real and concerted effort at living in the moment, which is more my therapy than his. \n \n\u00a0Surprisingly, we don't \"do\" anything especially aimed at remediating what I used to think of as his \"deficits.\" We are, in fact, very close to giving up on speech therapy. Our focus has shifted from remediating to educating. \n \nThis is partly because I came to feel that a lot of approaches or programs set us up for failure. Well-meaning therapists trying to \"get\" Oliver to do something just kind of freaked him out and it ended up looking like the poor kid was really much more impacted by autism than he is in environments where he feels less anxious. Unfortunately his fear stems from those early days when I shamefully let adults \"do\" things to him in the name of therapy. The result is Oliver's abiding distrust of adults who try to get him to do things.\u00a0 At home and in the community where he is well known and loved, Oliver is happy and thrives. So we go with what works. \n \nWe even abandoned RDI because, although I spent years training in the approach, it no longer worked for us. I didn't want to spend all of my time figuring out what \"skill\" we should be working on. I just wanted to enjoy my boy and, most importantly, spend my time being in the moment with my family. So I kept all the important things I learned from RDI about being a good guide to my kids and threw out all the programmatic stuff that was layered on top. And I read parenting books that made sense to me, like Alfie Kohn's book  Punished by Rewards , which gives one great food for thought about how a child naturally learns and develops through intrinsic motivation and how parents and educators inadvertantly subvert this to the child's detriment. So much of autism \"therapy\"focuses on how to\"motivate\" the autistic child, which I think is an incredibly harmful way to approach education. But when our educational system doesn't even trust typical kids to develop their own motivation for learning and for growing into good, solid people, then imagining this to be possible for autistic children who supposedly lack  any  kind of motivation, well, that seems beyond the pale! But I have come to believe in it so much for both of my kids.  \n \nSo yes, we're taking it easy at the moment and I let Oliver spend quite a lot of time doing what he wants, even if I sometimes wish he would make different choices.\u00a0 And yet? Oliver  is  thriving! The kid takes my breath away. Daily I see him accomplishing things that would undoubtedly be somewhere on the long list of \"skills\" that any therapeutic approach might have told me that I would have to teach the boy. Examples? Showering,\u00a0 dressing, searching for a lost item, figuring out how something works, getting someone's attention, making sure that his partner understands his intention before proceeding with a joint activity, even his language is increasing as his writing becomes part of our everyday life .... Well, the list goes on and on. And none of it was even on my radar as something I should be working on at the present time because mostly I'm just focused on other things: like gardening and executing my mom's estate and planning our next vacation. It's a year of deep breathing for me and since I let so much fall away while caring for my mom before her death, I'm being slow and careful in what I pick up again. \n \nI have a lot of regrets about things that I did in the past in the name of \"progress\" for Oliver. I wish I had never agreed to some of the things I did or allowed when Oliver was still such a little guy. Those months when our school district implemented an intensive, in-home program, the speech therapist who employed the \"verbal barrage\"technique, the whacky diet. ... I was always so afraid to just let Oliver be his autistic self. Now, I find myself embracing it. I see that \"progress\" (or what we would call growth, maturity and learning for any  other  child) is just part of being human, autistic and otherwise.  \n \nSo for now, I'm content to sit back a little bit and see how things unfold. ...

The last thing I want is for my MOM to go to school with me on the first day!\" Secondly, I don't think I can ever fully convey what it feels like to see this kid setting his own goals.  I  didn't tell him that he had to type independently before enrolling in school. That was his idea from the start. And now that he can do it? He wants to tackle the world! And I don't blame him. He has earned this fair and square. \n \nThen, last night when we were typing together, with great teary sadness he wrote: \"I don't want you to go to school with me.\" So we tried for him to type on his own a little, meaning I stood in the hall, saying words of encouragement because even though I don't touch Oliver anymore when he types I DO sit next to him for moral support. But for every letter he got correct, he hit five or six wrong ones. I was so proud of his determination, despite the fact that it was anchored in a deep desire to, you know, not spend that extra hour today with me! In the end he was terribly disappointed that he couldn't manage on his own.  \n \n \nThen: \"You told me I would have someone to help me.\" \n \nSo, I explained that he doesn't yet have an aide and that he would have to practice typing with that person and so for this week, anyway, and maybe a little longer I would have to go with him so he can participate. \n \n\"So,\" I asked, \"are you OK with me going with you tomorrow?\" \n \n\"Yes. I think that knowing that it is just for a little while helps.\" \n \nYeah.

{"date": "September 25, 2013", "body": "\nI used to dread meeting new therapists. The dread came for a number of reasons but mostly because I knew a certain question was bound to come up.  \n \n\"So, what kind of things does Oliver like to do? What are his interests?\" \n \nI knew, of course, that he or she was looking for an \"in\" -- a way to engage my boy, to  motivate  him to want to participate in the session. Let's just forget for a moment that I always kind of thought it was absolutely absurd to imagine that one person could \"motivate\" another to do anything. Encourage, yes. Interest, yes. Motivate? I don't think so. But that's beside the point, really. \n \nI disliked the question so much because until recently it was so very difficult to answer. Communication has opened up a world of knowing my son that wasn't possible based solely on observation., interaction and doing. And I suppose that's what this post is all about -- how we cannot ever truly know what another person is thinking, feeling and imagining unless they are able to tell us. \n \nBut previously, if asked, I would have said that biking and hiking, were among his favorite things to do. Those were safe bets but hardly transportable to the therapy room. And the other thing he likes? The water play? Well, let's just say that if you ever decide that you want to vary Oliver's water play in some kind of unpredictable and disruptive fashion? You will be the loser.  \n \nI used to worry a lot about Oliver's unusual relationship to the water. For a time I even saw water as the enemy. After awhile though I just came to accept that this is a non-negotiable part of my boy.\u00a0 In RDI we talked a lot about static vs. dynamic, with the idea that the more time a person spent engaged in an activity that was unchanging and repetitive by nature the less time he had available to engage in the dynamic world around him. I agree with the idea that there is much to be learned from navigating dynamic situations, especially social ones, but I have come to question the idea of labeling another person's interests as static even if it might seem highly repetitive to the untrained, unautistic eye. How can we really know what is capturing another person's interest or imagination, especially when that other person is non-speaking? And what gives us the right to make that judgement? \n \nI've linked before to Barb Rentenbach's book:  I Might Be You . Have you read it yet?\u00a0 You must read this book! She writes about experiencing the sensory world in a way that sounds magical, beautiful and multi-dimensional. After reading her descriptions of color and light I began to watch Oliver interact with the water in a new way and wonder what kind of experience he was creating for himself.\u00a0 If water and air were paint and canvas, I suspect we would call it art. I will probably never know but opening my mind to acceptance and understanding has helped me see the beauty in my son fully engaged in something he loves. That right there is worth the price of learning to shift my perspective. \n \nOliver had a birthday a few weeks back and this video was my gift to him. He's a hard guy to buy for but he loves a home video!  It's home is on the desktop of our computer and he watches it whenever we can't get to the water. It's a poor substitute, I think! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Might-Be-You-Exploration-Connection/dp/0988344904", "http://www.blogger.com/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-things-we-love.html", "title": "\nThe things we love\n"},
{"date": "September 23, 2013", "body": "\n\"Did you cry?\" \n \nThat was question Nik asked when I described today's appointment with the speech therapist.  \n \nThe answer was \"Yes!\" but let me back up a little bit before I tell you what all the tears were about. \n \nOliver is setting some goals for himself. Two months ago when we got back from Syracuse he began to tell me daily that he wanted to go to school. Not only did he tell me that he wanted to go to school in every which way he could, but he let it be known that he wanted to go to school \"when I can type on my own.\"  \n \nSure, I thought with a rising sense of panic, middle school is  great  time to begin your public school journey! But also, I consoled myself in the beginning, it might take a long time until he could type on his own. Naturally I want to support Oliver in whatever he sets out to do, but  geez , talk about the most anxiety producing prospect ever: 6th grade! It wasn't even on my radar. \n \nAnd then? He did it. \n \nWith a great deal of concentration and effort, Oliver moved from needing my support at the elbow, then shoulder, then a light touch on his back to no physical touch at all. And  My God , the pride on his face as he laboriously types out a sentence, slowly, carefully, one letter at a time! \n \nI have never witnessed anything quite so magical as this boy, who at the tender age of 11, has grabbed a hold of the reins with such giddiness and determination. He knows what he wants and he is making it happen one letter, one word at a time. \n \nI realized back in August that Oliver would likely be typing on his own much faster than anyone might have predicted and began conversations with our local school district about the enrollment process. It will take a while to sort everything out, which is good, because this Mama isn't maybe as quick to embrace change as is the Boy. But hold onto your hats, folks: this kid is full steam ahead! \n \nIn the meantime, we carry on with homeschooling and have started again with speech therapy. Longtime readers of this blog know that Oliver and I have suffered through our fair share of terrible, terrible encounters with speech therapists. There was a time when we abandoned speech therapy altogether because I just wasn't willing to subject Oliver to another therapist who probably knew a LOT about autism and who spoke TOO LOUDLY and who complimented him with the phrase: \"Good sitting!\" \n \nBut at the beginning of August when I asked Oliver if he wanted to continue with speech given how well he is doing with his typing, he replied: \"I want to talk\". \n \nAnd when we met with the speech therapist last week and she noted that new goals need to be written in light of Oliver's incredible progress with his typing. We talked about goals involving typed communication. Then I asked Oliver what  he  wanted to work on and he said: \" I want to talk.\"  \n \nSo today, the speech\u00a0 therapist asked Oliver directly: \"Why is talking so important to you?\" \n \nAnd he replied: \"Because then people will see that I am just like everyone else.\" \n \nAnd yes, I cried. \n \nBecause who among us wants to be thought of as so very different from everyone else? \n \nAnd who doesn't remember 6th grade when something as benign as the color of one's shirt can make one feel SO out of place? \n \nAnd who wouldn't agree when I say that this remarkable boy is unlike any other person that I've ever met in my entire life and utterly perfect just the way he is?  \n \nWho wouldn't admit that this brave, incredible kid is \"More like you than not?\" \n \nOliver is an autistic 11 year old, non-speaking, boy. He is not some theory of mind, mind-blind or a set of deficits and behaviors described in a manual. Your 12 credit Autism Certificate that tells you all about what makes him so different won't help you understand this kid unless you get one thing perfectly straight: \n \nHe understands the assumptions you are making about him. He sees through your behavior towards him even if you can't see past the way his body works and doesn't work. And he wants what everyone wants: To fit in. To be accepted. To be Equal. \n \nLike everyone else.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2013/09/like-everyone-else.html", "title": "\nLike Everyone Else\n"},
{"date": "November 02, 2014", "body": "\nThere are a lot of things I haven't done very well this year, I'll tell you right now. I've wasted a lot of time and spent a good bit of energy feeling bad about stuff. As I go about the business of this rush-around life I've had to shush the little voice inside my head that keeps listing all the things I should have gotten to, the things that I felt deserved more attention than I had or wanted to give. My garden for instance? What usually looks like this:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u00a0Ended up looking like this: \n \n \n \n\u00a0And when I say it \"ended up\" like this, you should know that I planted it and then completely became unable to care for it. I didn't harvest a single thing from this usually productive space that I can see from my kitchen window. That takes some effort, my friends, because I seeded it  abundantly . I literally watched from my kitchen window as the invasive morning glory vines strangled every thing out there. That is, until I couldn't take it anymore and began keeping the blind on that window drawn all the time so I wouldn't have to watch the take over.\u00a0 But every day when I passed through the yard on my way to the shed where I keep my bike, I willed myself not to look in the same way one does when passing a highway accident. I saw a groundhog out there one day and instead of chasing him off, I cheered him on, glad that someone was enjoying those tomatoes. \n \nYou might be surprised by how much energy it takes to shush that little but persistent voice. Or maybe you wouldn't be. I suspect that this little voice pesters the hell out of a lot of people.  \n \nThis blog is another thing the voice has nagged about. Six months passed, seven, nine. ...\u00a0 Once in awhile I half-heartedly started a draft and then gave up after a pathetic paragraph or two. During that time I was constantly drafting sentences in my head but they never went anywhere.\u00a0  What do I really have to say to people, anyway , I'd think. In the years since I started writing we had somehow emerged from our long stay in that uncertain place we landed after Oliver's diagnosis when I wrote: \" We're not quite the family we were and we haven't yet found how all of these pieces will fit together to create the family that will see us through. And as individuals: mother, father, brother, we haven't yet learned how to fill those roles in this new context .\" I remember those feelings vividly but I'm not that person anymore. Today, I feel confident and strong in my role as Oliver's mother. Mothering has come to feel so  ordinary . Nothing to write home about, really. Why bother? But then Issy Stapleton was on everyone's lips again and I was reminded of why I've kept writing all these years. My voice is small but it is my job to do what I can to amplify the message that  my son deserves the same basic human rights as everyone else .  \n \nI've also let the cooking and cleaning slide, I can't be bothered planning meals, I never know what's for dinner, the laundry is always piled up somewhere, I have no idea where the shin guards or the long pants are, sometimes the recycling piles up for weeks before I manage to remember to drag it to the road, I'm pretty sure the dust bunnies have started a campaign to take over the house and heaven help you if you get a whiff of Sami's feet. Guilty. I feel guilty about it all, because I used to care about these things but I haven't done them very well this year. And if I look at the list of things that I used to put my energies into that I don't anymore, it's really quite long. \n \nBut if I'm going to be fair to myself there are a few things I did very well this year: \n \nI began to make my own health a priority by working out regularly and addressing my chronic exhaustion. Because really,  no one  wants to be around me when I'm complaining about being tired all the time! I supported Oliver in his quest to become a public school student, because he is awesome and he deserves it and because I really, really missed sitting through three hour IEP meetings! I also made being present with my boys a priority this summer by packing them up for two long and incredibly wonderful road trips -- in which there was  camping  -- that taught us at least as much about ourselves, each other, responsibility and fun as we might have gotten in a year's worth of gardening, cooking and doing the laundry together. During those six weeks on the road with my boys I faced a lot of fears and learned that each of us was far more capable than I had imagined in so many ways. That alone was worth the great lettuce and tomato sacrifice of 2014! \n \n \n \n \nSo, I did a lot of things not very well this year, a few important things very well, and I'm counting myself lucky because it is only November 2nd so I still have time to even the list up a bit before we close the books on 2014. And hopefully, I'll be back here writing about it a little more regularly. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MXhuaLzCrDc/VFacu2Aj-nI/AAAAAAAABBk/vlsucFmc6Ac/s1600/IMG_564.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q7hZt_mZ1S8/VFad86kNnyI/AAAAAAAABB8/r2UicrxqBSU/s1600/image-1.jpg", "http://www.daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2005/10/im-stuck.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6CYHFT5NQ1Y/VFaopSm3l0I/AAAAAAAABCQ/oE13dmgGdlo/s1600/DSCF0195.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-great-veggie-sacrifice.html", "title": "\nThe Great Veggie Sacrifice\n"},
{"date": "October 13, 2012", "body": "\nI stepped into the hallway for a moment, trying to warm my extremities by walking the ten steps from the bed to the automatic doors directly across the hallway. The broken thermostat and the constant blowing of cold air from the vent above my chair was just one more thing to bear but at least it kept me moving. Over the course of four days, my short walk across the hallway had become a ritualized escape from the monotony of trying to find rest and solace in a place where none was offered. At this moment, though, in the not-quite-middle of the night, I stood listening to the hums and beeps all around me and I looked in to the room at you, sister, and watched as you folded one of the many blankets that we had scavenged and hoarded. Your features are gifts from our father, possibly the only one he ever gave you, but in this moment I saw the echoes of our mother traced in your profile. It was something about your determination salted through with resignation that made you the sum of her in that moment. \n \nI looked down at my own hands, in the unloving florescent glow of way past midnight, and saw my mother there, too. I had always been ashamed of my hands, scored as they were with lines and the appearance of age even as a young girl. I thought with regret, too, about how I had often been ashamed of my mother. By how I judged her for being so injured by life, for losing the ability to trust and to give of herself freely. Not for the first time, I regretted that life had not been easy for her, that it was too straight a line between ugly events and violence to a young wife and mother who otherwise might have been quite different. Living with fear for more than a decade will change a person. My mother is the strongest person I know but her need for strength came at a cost to her and her five children. I\u00a0 don't think I have her strength, but I will finally appreciate these hands I inherited from my mother. To be reminded of her in years to come I will have to look no further. \n \nIt's not often that my siblings all gather in one place, and still rarer when our gathering is not punctuated by the endless pushing of buttons and rankling of nerves. But in that moment I saw reflected in our unity at her bedside what we must have looked like as children, when our lives were lived in a state of perpetual fear and uncertainty and we simply held onto each other and trusted. This is what she taught us under the very worst of circumstances. Raw emotion and a deep, abiding love for each other was what sustained us then and, thirty years later I see it will be the same. If it is true that one can only know deep sorrow for having also known great love then I am thankful my life has been rich with the gifts of the heart. \n \nMy mother left the hospital bed around which we had kept vigil. She returned to her own home with the mass in her brain that is quickly taking her from us. It is one more thing that we, her children, have to watch her endure. And it hurts like no other grief I've known. \n \nMy hands will go on to nurture and love. They will caress my children and soothe them through what is to come. They will get dirty in the act of gardening, a passion once shared by my mother. They will be entwined with my husband's hands as we face old age and, eventually, death. And they will remind me, forever, of a strong and proud woman whose gifts to me I'm only just beginning to fathom. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/10/for-my-mother.html", "title": "\nFor My Mother\n"},
{"date": "October 16, 2015", "body": "\n*** This is the second part of a post that needed to be broken up. To read the first part first, click  here .\u00a0  \n \nIf you are reading this blog and want to know a little bit about the actual mechanics of typing for Oliver, this post is for you (and written with the consent of my fair boy). Oliver is moving along incrementally. His abilities on any given day are inextricably tied to his mood, how well he slept, how anxious he is, how much he is anticipating what lies ahead of him in his day. ... you know kind of like the rest of us. But I think it is worth pointing out because Oliver's performance, like everyone's, is so context driven. \n \nI'm using a couple of videos to augment some of the points that I made in my last post concerning independence and why it is still preferable for Oliver to have physical support when he is typing despite the fact that he can and does type without it.  \n \nOliver has decided that he would like to learn to type with two hands. Because we are sort of off the grid a bit when it comes to support for his typing (meaning we don't have easy access to professional guidance), we generally end up just making it up as we go along. These videos reflect our trial and error process of trying to determine what kind and how much support he needs.  \n \nOliver tends to practice his independent typing off and on throughout the week. We don't work on independence everyday choosing instead to spend our time engaged in exchanging thoughts, opinions and ideas. ... you know, conversing! The fun stuff!! By practicing independence, I'm referring to the motor planning skills that go into his communication. When we do this, I ask him to spell single words that are known to both of us so I can coach him more easily. It is easier to understand the mistakes a person is making if you know the context. In the case below, the word is \"popcorn\". \n \nI had not planned to tape the exercise but on the spur of the moment decided to have Sami stand nearby with the iPad to record so I can try and keep a better record of what Oliver's typing looks like as he tackles this new skill. Watching him struggle so much with his apraxia (see the constant over-shooting and under-shooting) as he typed I was reminded again of the principle of Presuming Competency. I wondered if someone who doesn't know Oliver's capabilities, might have watched Oliver type and quickly come to the conclusion that he didn't know how to spell. Perhaps they would think he was just typing gibberish and not let him finish. I know that in Oliver's life there have been many, many times when I didn't understand the true nature of the challenges I was seeing. \n \nSo then, after I made the popcorn he was asking for, I asked Oliver if he would type again for me. This time I stood behind him and rested the tips of my two index fingers on his shoulders. Occasionally I reached down and tapped his left hand if the letter he needed should be typed with the left hand. The difference between that little bit of support and no support is fairly obvious in his level of accuracy, I think.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \nThis video shows Oliver typing the word 'Popcorn'  \nwith no physical support and some verbal prompting. \n \n \n \nThis video shows Oliver typing the word 'Popcorn' with  \nminimal physical support and some verbal prompting. \n \nAn even greater level of support would have resulted in more fluent typing with fewer errors.When Oliver types for communication, I give him the maximum amount of support he needs to make the least number of apraxia-related errors (currently this is four fingers placed firmly on his right shoulder.) When he works on developing his independence, we work to reduce the amount of support he needs without taxing him to the point of causing frustration. It is a process that we negotiate together and it looks different on different days. \n \nMost importantly, Oliver is setting the goals and the pace, based on an inward desire to achieve the next level in his skill set and not, I sincerely hope, out of a sense of fear or inadequacy.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2015/10/thoughts-on-independence.html"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2015/10/thoughts-on-independence-part-ii.html", "title": "\nThoughts on Independence, Part II\n"},

I would not have gotten through those early years without it. But I have always written with an eye towards privacy and I don't share everything, although I try to give an honest picture of life with our version of autism. Its a picture I'm proud of. \u00a0As Oliver gets older, though, I am more and more uncomfortable with the idea that I am sharing things about him that he may not want shared and so I have leaned more towards generalities and topics concerning my own personal growth and understanding.

{"date": "October 30, 2013", "body": "\nLast week Oliver and I drove three and a half hours to a city in our region for his twice yearly appointment with a developmental pediatrician. I really like this doctor for a lot of reasons. She is thoughtful in her approach to medicine. She is always available to me by e-mail or phone. And I know that she cares about Oliver. However, I also really dislike that we have to drive such a great distance to see her and incur the extra cost of gas and an overnight stay. \n \nWe started traveling there a few years ago when we decided to see if medication might help Oliver manage his anxiety. There are local doctors who could have helped us but medication is enough of a trial and error game that I wanted to ensure our doctor had lots of experience managing medication for autistic clients. I got what I was looking for and feel lucky to have this doctor on our team.  \n \nBUT. \n \nBut, she's a doctor and that influences how she sees things. \n \nAnd even though I really like her as a person, I don't always like her point of view. \n \n A few words from her once put me in a downward spiral of depression . Maybe she thought she was being kind when she gently told me that maybe I shouldn't expect much from Oliver in life, or for his future. She works with many families and, I suppose, she sees that the real challenges of autism can sometimes be insurmountable. \n \nBut I didn't want to hear that. I still don't.\u00a0 I worry as much as any parent but I have to put my effort into thinking about the present. I have to keep believing that he will go as far as he is able and that the future is not yet written. If I don't believe this how can I tell Oliver to keep trying when things seem insurmountable?  \n \nStill, this appointment was the first since Oliver had started to type in July. I was eager for him to show off his brilliant new ability to communicate. I was eager to give her a reason to revise her opinion about what is possible when someone is so greatly challenged by autism. \n \nHe typed a few things for her. He concisely explained how one of his medications made him feel. He answered a few questions for her and at the end of the appointment he asked a very poignant question of his own. She laughed it off at first -- I think it took her by surprise -- so he then added a sentence of clarification and she gave him a direct, appropriate answer.\u00a0 It was a wonderful exchange and I was so proud of him. \n \nAnd then she turned to me and asked if I had given any thought to signing up for the Intellectual Disability waiver. \n \nWhat?  \n \n\"He doesn't have an intellectual disability. He has  autism .\" And then, to quote Larry Bissonette of Wretches and Jabberers fame, I added: \"His disability is of experience, not intellect.\" \n \nI wanted to add a few expletives. And also list his accomplishments: He taught himself to read and write. He has never spelled a word wrong. He has a photographic memory, can explain the big bang theory, and how gravity makes time relative. He taught himself math and can do algebraic functions in his head. He found a way to communicate despite all the odds against him. \n \nIf he could speak no one would think to suggest that he had an intellectual disability. If you or I could list these as our own accomplishments we'd call ourselves goddamn rock stars.  \n \nHer report, which we received a week later, contained this sentence: His mother perceives Oliver to be smart and feels an intellectual disability is not an appropriate description of his potential. \n \nDamn straight, doctor.\u00a0 He's a non-speaking, autistic rock star.  \n \nAnd I think he's going to change the world.  \n \nI know because he's already changed mine.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/04/flying-by-seat-of-our-pants.html"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2013/10/ableism-is-alive-and-well-in-medical.html", "title": "\nAbleism is alive and well in the medical community\n"},

{"date": "November 05, 2014", "body": "\nWhat is there to say, really? Seventh grade for Oliver is a vast improvement from the fiasco of last year. It all came down to finding a supportive person in the administration at our local school district. That's all it took to get things moving in the right direction: one person who really saw Oliver. A person with the power to make a difference who  listened  to him. I hope to write more about that, and also more about the HUGE adjustment it has been to send my boy off to public school each day. People? I miss my boy! Truly! So often during my homeschooling life others remarked to me that they could never homeschool. But homeschooling is about a 100 times easier if you ask me. AND, I got to spend my time leisurely doing things with my boys. Oh, how I miss those days!! My hat is off to all of you who chose the school route from the beginning. It involves a level of stamina that I'm not sure I could have mustered back when Oliver needed so much more support with everyday life.\u00a0 Anyway, the most important thing is that Oliver is happy. Happy with a capitol H!  \n \nI'm uploading here a short video of Oliver using his Math Paper app. He is included in Algebra I this year and, because it is an advanced class, for which he will receive high school credit, the pace of instruction is fairly rapid. It takes Oliver quite a bit longer than his peers to complete the work, even with all the modifications that they have made for him. I searched for quite some time to find a math app that would accommodate Oliver's movement differences and still let him perform all the same calculations that other students would do with paper and pencil.

{"date": "September 15, 2009", "body": "\n Have I mentioned here that Oliver is a bike riding superstar? Yes? Ok, I know I have. But you can't stop me from saying it. And listen, every single time I get on the bike and ride somewhere with my kids my heart nearly bursts with pride and happiness. I can't help it. It just swells and swells and I have to marvel that there is actually room in my chest for it. I get giddy. I can't stop smiling. So I'm just warning that there will be more bike riding blog posts in my future. .. We've taken the bike riding to a new level: commuting. Sami has pre-school three mornings a week and my boys and I ride over there together. It isn't far, just about a half mile, but we have to cross two very busy roads -- one of them 4 lanes. The whole thing causes me some anxiety: I'm just one but I have to keep track of two boys while watching for traffic. But the boys? Well, they are fantastic. They follow directions, they stay as far to the right as possible, they ride cautiously and smile the entire way there and back. So anyway, we've been spending a lot of time on the bikes the past few weeks. But tonight, well, tonight did not go so well. Oliver is experimenting a bit with physics and likes to see how long he can coast without pedaling. He is also working on mastering some kind of trick ride where he takes his feet off the pedals and rides with them on the top bar of the frame. Makes me crazy but what can I do? He is a boy on a bike, after all. The coasting thing results in lots of falls or near-falls. And, if he does it while he is on the street and as far to the right as possible, it was bound to happen that he would Fall.Into.A.Car.  And that is what happened. Oliver fell into a parked car. I wasn't with him but Nik tells me that Oliver jumped right up, hopped back on the bike and off they went. Nik was relieved that Oliver was OK and cautioned him to stop playing games. Unfortunately, Nik was soon called back to the scene by an irate car owner who pulled up beside him and scolded about the hit and run. Yup, Oliver's crash left two, 6-inch long, scratches on the side of the dark blue car. Nik, very apologetic, gave the man his business card and told him to get in touch to work out the damages. Nik also described how the man became noticeably less angry after he asked Oliver a few questions and noted that he did not respond. He was silent for a minute or two while Nik looked over the car and then allowed how he might be able to fix it up so the scratches wouldn't be so noticeable. In the meantime, we're wondering if our insurance covers bicycle-car accidents. At first glance, Oliver is just another boy on a bike. But look a little closer and you start to notice that there is something pretty remarkable about our little guy. Tomorrow is a school day and so we will saddle up by 9am as usual. I'll still remind both of my guys to keep as far to the right as possible, but also, now,  a little to the left. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SrBX2f0WamI/AAAAAAAAAdA/trBwTWlnCwc/s1600-h/031.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/09/learning-by-doing.html", "title": "\nLearning by Doing\n"},
{"date": "February 18, 2015", "body": "\nWhat is  with  me?? I've drafted about a dozen posts over the last four weeks or so and have trashed every single one of them. There is no shortage of activity around here. ... I've just lost my blogging mojo. Maybe my season of blogging has ended, but somehow I'm still attached to the idea of keeping this journal alive. ... So, in an effort to kick-start some activity here I'll share a little window into our past holiday season -- which is really just a bid to make you look at my vacation pictures -- and then quick, publish it before I self-consciously delete it! \n \n \n \n The Griswald family adventure about to begin! \n \nI have a love-hate relationship with Christmas. Growing up, it was a very special time for me. My mom  loved  Christmas and although I have boxes and boxes labeled \"Christmas\" in my attic, it's just not the same without her. It will never be the same. But really, if I'm honest, it was never the same for my kids as it was for me as a child. The holiday traditions that I grew up with just didn't work for my family and after a season or two (or five!) I realized that traditions are meant to support people, to connect them and to give meaning. If the cost of maintaining tradition is too high then it is far better to create new traditions and new meanings. So that's what we did. For the past three years we have eschewed Christmas and all the trappings and focused instead on doing something as a family; instead of gifts, we shared an experience. We took our time. And because we are who we are, the experience  had  to be centered around water and bicycles. None of you are probably surprised!  \n \n \n \n The calm before the Christmas Eve storm \n \nThis year we headed South -- destination Florida! And I don't know why, but coming off of some really great camping experiences with my kids over the summer, I insanely thought: why not spend Christmas camping? So that's what we did. And? Even though a lot went wrong, like our Christmas Eve feast of fish tacos eaten at a picnic table in the pouring rain and the lesson in rain-fly management that resulted in spending the entire rest of the night at the campground laundry hoping our quarters would last. ... well, a lot of it also went right. And in the words of Sami, it was: \"The Best Christmas Ever!\" Yes, there was the camping, which was an adventure. And yes, the ocean! What can I say about the joy of watching Oliver in love with the ocean? He is the kind of happy in the ocean that people search for their whole lives!  \n \n \n \n Gainesville:  \nOliver tolerating yet another photo! \n \n \n \n 40 miles on the West Orange bike trail, Wintergarden, Florida.  \n \nBut it's the biking that I want to tell you about because I can hardly say how amazing it was to watch Oliver navigate the world by bike on this trip. It's hard not to forget those early days on a bike with Oliver. It's hard not to forget how many months we spent just teaching him how to  pedal.  And then how scary it was to take Oliver from the sidewalk in front of our house to the street! For months I was so terrified that he would get hit by a car that I couldn't even go along when Nik took him for a ride. Every time they left the house I strained my ears for the sound of emergency vehicles! Fast forward a few years and a thousand miles later and Oliver is able to capably navigate riding everywhere our bikes can take us. And what can I tell you? After a half year of public school under our belts, it was good to be reminded that my boy excels at something that many people can't or won't even try! Watching him and trusting him to be able to navigate in a city where everything is unexpected and new? Where a mistake can have tragic results? Well, it kind of put being able to sit still and silent in a classroom for an hour in perspective in a way I didn't anticipate. So, here is the rest of the photographic evidence:  \n \n \n \n \n 32 miles in: Oliver has had enough! And so we wait. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This is what happiness looks like at Castillo de San Marcos \n \n \n \n Biking St. Augustine means never having to look for parking! \n \n \n \n Biking and bridges -- what could be better! \n \n \n \n Expoloring St. Augustine by bike. \n \n \n \n \n Biking Savannah!  \n \n \n \n \n Biking  and  fountains? It can't get any better! \n \n \nI could never have anticipated that persisting in our efforts to teach Oliver to ride a bike would have such a profound impact on our lives. We have biked in seven countries and countless cities. Biking has allowed us to see and do things that would otherwise be very difficult. It has given Oliver a measure of independence that must feel incredibly exhilarating to him. And it serves as a great reminder that we are really only limited in our imaginations.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bVBx4Z-gK48/VOSXcXHKDDI/AAAAAAAABDc/d5SmDE5VXjk/s1600/IMG_0277.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8wqTOV0iFTo/VOSZdy0SN4I/AAAAAAAABEQ/YyTYxBXUYqQ/s1600/IMG_0613.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A2Vro0pTf8E/VOSX0pMyx5I/AAAAAAAABDk/o72jHvCE0ak/s1600/IMG_0441.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eeX3y-Kgojo/VOSYk7RTbnI/AAAAAAAABDs/Pz9PueeC7hQ/s1600/IMG_0888.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_jkeEetakQw/VOSY0UvPlfI/AAAAAAAABD0/eQoklGT_zyA/s1600/IMG_0971.JPG", "rtsp://v5.cache6.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQmVNlb13cjpbRMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IsA71IrG-Ng/VOSZnZ6hiLI/AAAAAAAABEc/GitksRPYlTQ/s1600/IMG_1040.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oSaSx8F34nA/VOSZ2QncW_I/AAAAAAAABEs/-L9VenQZrO8/s1600/IMG_1094.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_n5TSEAlyUo/VOSaEr4lPZI/AAAAAAAABE0/eT2_sKwfdkM/s1600/IMG_1079.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--3qYFnKm5UM/VOSZQFWDPZI/AAAAAAAABEA/KqcA2fQ1ois/s1600/IMG_1138.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bodKKp0MJTc/VOSZcDJcrOI/AAAAAAAABEI/gkZpGPuVUQU/s1600/IMG_1150.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2015/02/pedal-adventures.html", "title": "\nPedal Adventures\n"},
{"date": "August 16, 2010", "body": "\n \nOne of my favorite people,  KAL of Autism Twins , recently suggested that I put together a post about teaching your child how to ride a bike without training wheels. Over the past two years I have been regularly conducting bicycle clinics in my community and have picked up a couple of tips and tricks that you might find useful if you want to teach any young child to go from training wheels to two wheels. It is a very low anxiety method and good for kids with all kinds of challenges. I put together these clinics mainly for kids with disabilities but normally there is a pretty good mix of kids who show up and parents are always so happy that they don't have to spend many back-breaking hours teaching their kids.\u00a0 And I don't have to tell you how important I think learning to ride a bike is for any kid!  \n \nSo, here is a brief run-down of things you should do and think about: \n1)  Make sure that you have a properly sized bike for your child.  The child should be able to sit comfortably on the saddle while both feet are flat on the ground. Adjust the seat if necessary. Many parents buy a bike that is too large thinking that the child will grow into it, but this will make it very challenging for a child to make the transition from training wheels. If your child's bike is too large, see if you can borrow a smaller one. \n \n2)  Remove the pedals and the crank arms from the bike . This is usually not difficult if you have a pedal wrench or even just a regular wrench. If you aren't tool savvy, you can probably take it to your local bike shop and have them removed. It only takes a second and they probably won't even charge you. (**note: some children's bikes can be slightly more complicated, requiring removal of the chain and chain guard. This is also pretty simple but might warrant a trip to the bike shop if you don't feel confident that you can put it back together again :-) \n \n3)  Teach balance.  The next step is to teach the child to use his or her feet in a gliding pattern that move them forward .  The goal here is to teach balance. Eventually, you will want your child to be able to take long strides, building a gliding pattern as he goes. Some children start off very slowly, almost at a walking pace. This is fine. Remember, you can't make your child discover how to balance on the bike! Let him take it at his own pace. I have known kids who get this in a half hour and others who have worked at this stage for 3-4 months. \n \nIf your child is really struggling with this, try finding a place where there is a very,  very  slight hill for him to practice on. Gravity will help with the momentum. \n \nAlso, it always helps to demonstrate rather than explain -- especially if your child has any kind of processing disorder! When I teach a clinic I always bring Sami and Oliver along so that kids can see what this gliding technique is supposed to look like. A child who already knows how to ride a bike would work well.  \n \n4)  Change his center of gravity.  When your child is able to consistently glide over long distances (15-20 feet), challenge him to raise his feet up and place them on the frame of the bike, lifting his center of gravity to where it will need to be when you add the pedals back on. Many kids start off in the gliding process by keeping their legs straight down in a kind of downward \"V\". This is fine in the beginning but eventually they should be able to place their feet on the frame.  \n \nDon't be afraid to spend too long on this stage. Parents frequently want to rush to the next stage of putting the pedals back on the bike. But gliding (balancing) is a new skill for your child -- and it is FUN! Let your child develop confidence here -- it will make it easier to incorporate adding the next skill: pedaling. Also, it will save you and your child any frustrations if you realize that you've put the pedals on too soon and you have to take them off again! \n \n5)  Put the pedals back on . When your child is comfortable gliding and can do so consistently, it is time to put the pedals back on. The transition from balancing and gliding to balancing and pedaling is usually pretty quick. You will want to make sure your child knows how to use the brakes. If he doesn't, don't worry -- just be prepared to do a lot of running :-)\u00a0 When the child starts on the bike with the pedals for the first time, you may have to help him get started by resting your hand on his back and possibly pushing a tiny bit. At this point it is generally a confidence issue -- he has already demonstrated that he has the ability to balance. Now it is a matter of adding in another kind of movement with the pedals. \n \nThe whole process is probably much easier than you've feared it might be. But just remember that the most important this is to have fun! And don't forget to be safe: make sure your child always wears a helmet. If you don't have one, many communities have free helmet programs for kids; check with your local police station or bike shop to find out what is available in your area.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TGn7-eQS7NI/AAAAAAAAAtA/WScYSlg-XMg/s1600/Imported+Photos+00049.JPG", "http://autismtwins.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/08/from-training-wheels-to-two-wheels-how.html", "title": "\nFrom training wheels to two wheels -- how to teach your kid to ride a bike without breaking your back\n"},
{"date": "August 19, 2010", "body": "\nSomeone asked me today why I think the words -- the sentences -- are coming easier for Oliver. And there is no doubt that it is getting easier for him. When Oliver becomes distressed during the course of any day I remind him that he can tell me what is wrong and then there it is: \"I want a turn.\" \"I feel hungry. I want to eat.\" \"I want to go upstairs and get dressed.\" \"I want to have that.\" \"I want Sami to stop it.\" \"I'm full. I don't want to eat that.\" \"I want to put my bathing suit on and I need help.\"  \n \nI don't know, really, why everything seems to be coming together for my boy. But I do know that his receptive language has reached a point where there is no doubt that he understands almost every single thing that is said to him. I am sure of this because I have purposefully grown less careful in how I communicate. I am less explicit. For example, the other day we were collecting our milk from the farm, I had taken about a dozen steps from the milking shed with my arms full when I mentally noted that I forgotten to close the door behind me. \"Oh, shoot!\" I said. Then, pointing with my pursed lips in the direction of the door, I asked: \"Oliver, could you get that for me?\" Without missing a beat Oliver walked back to the building and closed the door. Then, later, Oliver closed his car door and started to buckle himself in without noticing that the door didn't latch all the way. From  outside  the car I said: \"I don't think that did the trick!\" In one fluid motion, Oliver looked up, saw what I was talking about and closed the door more securely. There are more examples, I'm sure (like telling him to skootch over when I wanted to sit, then having him do just that!) but these are the ones that come to mind. \n \nOliver is also -- unbelievably -- still sleeping through the night. We had a couple of rough weeks this summer when I wondered if our lucky streak had ended. But I think that had more to do with the copious amounts of pool water that Oliver was drinking every day! It took us some time to get that sorted out and soon we were back to sleeping all night every blessed night. It feels like we've won the lottery. Seriously. \n \nI don't know what to think about all this wonderful language that we've been hearing. Obviously, Oliver is still greatly impaired when it comes to his ability to communicate. He still struggles. A lot. But hearing these words, these sentences, come forth has allowed a little blossom of hope to grow and I can almost imagine the day when we will have a conversation.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/08/little-homefront-update-language-and.html", "title": "\nA little homefront update: language and sleep\n"},

But for us it was all about the biking. \n \nI'm not sure what I imagined, probably a little something like Switzerland where just about everything is linking by biking and hiking trails and where every small village has it's fair share of restaurants, cafes and bakeries where you can stop and refuel along the way. This was not that. The tourism office was closed (under renovation) when we visited and when I asked several residents where we could find the city center, they directed us to the main shopping area which was a series of giant, swank, outdoor malls -- not the kind of place I'd visit ordinarily and definitely not the kind of place I'd visit with kids on bikes.  \n \nStill, there was a gorgeous lake, lots of parks and green areas and we had no trouble finding all kinds of places to explore. Once I figured out that we would not be stopping at cafe's along the way for refueling I simply packed lots of energy food and we were good to go. The boys had a ball. One day we biked for more than four hours, stopping now and then for breaks along the way, and neither one uttered a word of complaint. And best: we discovered the Peachtree City BMX track! Sami and Oliver were in bicycle heaven, riding each day until we dragged them off the track! \n \nIt took us two days to drive to Georgia and we opted to stop frequently along the way to see what we could discover. I was amazed -- truly amazed -- at what a beautiful, friendly country we discovered.\u00a0 In Radford, Bristol and Damascus, Virginia, and in Athens, GA, we discovered miles and more miles of bicycle trails. In Buchanan, Virginia we found the Rhine River Inn just as the clock was striking hungry for lunch. In Centerville, SC, we lucked upon a small, beautiful, entirely empty beach on lake Hartwell where the boys could forget the six hours they just spent in transit.\u00a0 And in Athens, again, we discovered Jittery Joe's Coffee -- which fueled our drive home and has kept the vacation memory alive each morning since we returned with it's special aroma.  \n \nI can't say enough about my two boys. They were phenomenal. Superstars, really -- so go with the flow, up for anything, that I sometimes forget that they are only 5 and 7 years old. \n \nAll in all, it was a phenomenal vacation. We'll miss our good friends but something tells me that there will be more road trips on our horizon this summer. And Georgia? She'll be on my mind. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TAxkqkcxmzI/AAAAAAAAAmA/xTHWd7wgMGI/s1600/Imported+Photos+00064.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TAxkXl9lTOI/AAAAAAAAAl4/EzePEouSyAE/s1600/Imported+Photos+00058.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TAxj3kr2nbI/AAAAAAAAAlw/mawlexewKkc/s1600/Imported+Photos+00056.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TAxjZNs9YgI/AAAAAAAAAlo/B-CVDV6jnDY/s1600/Imported+Photos+00040.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TAxjJWnYcnI/AAAAAAAAAlg/lw3y72Z1RYU/s1600/Imported+Photos+00036.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TAxitmfNSaI/AAAAAAAAAlY/bP635e1Xsa8/s1600/Imported+Photos+00030.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/06/on-road-and-biking-with-boys.html", "title": "\nOn the Road and Biking with the Boys.\n"},
{"date": "May 05, 2016", "body": "\n \n I'm not a natural at advocacy work. Public speaking gives me hives. And making time to meet with community leaders and citizens is a huge effort. But I see it as a necessity as I send my boy forward into the wider world. And the more I advocate, the more I see that one person can make a difference and that keeps me going. That, and the boy with the Hope.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Last November I met with our superintendent of schools to discuss what I see as systemic obstacles to including kids like Oliver in the general education classroom. It took me a few weeks to get up the nerve to make the appointment but I was rewarded with a sympathetic ear and I left with an invitation to address a meeting of our city's school principals. Below is a transcript of the remarks I made back in February.  \n \n **** \n \n I\u2019m here today out of my desire to see [Our] City Schools embrace a model of inclusive education for students with disabilities.  \n \n I\u2019m the mother of a 13 year old boy, an eighth grader at [Our Middle School]. I\u2019d like to tell you a little bit about Oliver and what I\u2019ve observed and experienced as we, together, navigate the public school system.\u00a0 \n \n Oliver is an extraordinary kid. These days he loves Bob Dylan and Biking. And now I\u2019m going to brag a little bit and tell you: Oliver has ridden his bike more than 3,000 miles (since we started keeping track a few years ago), He has biked in 7 countries and many major cities including, Zurich, Halifax, Buffalo, Richmond, Charleston, Savannah and many more. Oliver is also significantly challenged by autism. He doesn\u2019t speak. He struggles mightily with impulse control. He battles anxiety. And the motor differences that come with apraxia mean that he often struggles to get his body to do what his brain asks it to. To give you some idea of what this means for him: It took 6 months for Oliver to learn just to pedal his bike.  We chose to homeschool Oliver back in 2007 rather than place him in a self-contained kindergarten classroom, where we were told he would receive specialized services so that he could learn the skills that he would need to be able someday manage in the regular classroom. At that time, he was 6, he had no functional communication and his IQ had been assessed to be about 70. And as far as I could tell, these two things kind of drove the train when it came to deciding his educational placement, because when I asked about a regular classroom, I was told that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up, it would be too confusing for him and that he would get very little out of it. \n \n At the time, these seemed like reasonable assumptions to make, and I didn\u2019t know about the decades of research on inclusive education that showed that all children have better social and academic outcomes when kids like Oliver are included alongside their non-disabled peers-- so I didn\u2019t advocate for a different placement. But on a real, visceral level, I also wasn\u2019t comfortable with the segregated environment of a self-contained classroom. I felt I had little choice but to homeschool and I did so for seven years.\u00a0 \n \n In 2012, when Oliver was 10, he finally achieved a means of reliable communication. Over the period of a year, he learned to type and we learned a lot about him in the process, including that -- according to newly administered IQ tests, Oliver was much smarter than both of his parents. And one of the first things he told us was that he wanted was to go to school.\u00a0 \n \n \u201cPerfect\u201d I thought! \u201cMiddle School is a great time to begin your public education!\u201d \u00a0And to be honest with you, I tried to talk him out of it. But when your child, who has never really been able to ask for anything, says that he wants to go to school like everyone else, the thing to do is to set aside your fears and find a way to make it happen.\u00a0 \n \n I was prepared for the experience to be akin to navigating an emotional black hole. I fully expected that I would give it my best shot, find it impossible, and end up homeschooling Oliver again within a year. But that\u2019s not what happened -- and this is where you all come in -- because it speaks to the committed professionalism that you foster in our schools. Because what I found instead was that Oliver was supported by an incredible team of professionals who wanted to see him succeed. They work very hard and care very deeply. And, importantly, they include me as part of that team. \u00a0Now we all know that parents are supposed to be part of the team but it doesn\u2019t always work out that way and so I was very appreciative. It also gave me some insight into the troubleshooting that goes into helping Oliver succeed in a regular education classroom. We\u2019ve done a lot of troubleshooting over the last year and a half. It has not been an easy road.\u00a0 \n \n As time has passed, what I\u2019ve come to understand is that the challenges we face are consistently due to system-wide obstacles that prevent the use of \u00a0best-practices in including kids with disabilities. And by that I mean co-teaching, building lessons based on the principles of Universal Design for Learning, Collaborative planning and multi-tiered systems of support.\u00a0 \n \n Let me be really clear: Universally Oliver\u2019s teachers have expressed a desire to have him in their class, they have a willingness to work with him and they want to see him succeed. They care and they are trying very hard but they need more support. They need training and they need time built into their days for collaborative planning and they need to have a vision for understanding that what they are doing in the classroom ties in with building a culture of belonging. How do I know this? Because I get emails that say things like: \n \n \u201cI use a lot of games in my classroom but I don\u2019t know how to include Oliver in those activities. Do you have any ideas for games that would work with him?\u201d \n \n \u201cA lot of my difficulty is because most of our assignments involve writing and reading through text to learn new skills; both of these take Oliver extra time. I\u2019d love to discuss how to include him in the classroom activities.\u201d \n \n \"I would like to involve him more in the social aspects of the class. Please let me know if you have any advice.\" \n \n \"I do a lot of lecturing in my class. We have a lot of material to cover and it\u2019s hard for him to sit and listen to long blocks of lecturing so he asks to leave. I\u2019d love to talk about how to help him so that he doesn\u2019t miss so much of the class.\" \n \n Well, the truth is, I can share ideas and resources with Oliver\u2019s teachers but I\u2019m not an educator. And besides I think you can see that it takes more than that. \u00a0It takes thoughtful planning, it takes collaboration across fields of expertise, it takes a vision and it takes a commitment to creating the kind of school community where there are real opportunities for meaningful inclusion. \n \n I constantly wonder if sending Oliver to school is the best thing for him. He wants to be there, learning alongside his peers. But he has experienced a lot of failure in his life and putting him in a classroom and expecting him to be like everyone else and do the same things as everyone else means that he will fail. He is failing. Often and in very public ways. Not academically. Academically he manages As and Bs. But he spends all day trying to do the things that are the hardest for him-- sitting still, being quiet, filling in worksheets -- instead of playing to his strengths -- and there are many. And for what reward? All of the things that you and I loved about going to school just aren\u2019t available to him. He isn\u2019t really a part of any classroom or school experiences that make learning about more than the grades and assignments.\u00a0 \n \n Let me share one more example with you. At a progress meeting in November, some 12 weeks after school began, the resource teacher who works with Oliver excitedly described how she was able to pre-load some choices into Oliver\u2019s communication device before class one day. She was able to do this because she happened to be in the class with another student that morning and so she knew what they were going to talk about. So when the teacher began asking questions, Oliver was able to raise his hand and, using his text-to-speech application, answer a question. When she finished sharing this story, which she did as a celebration, the classroom teacher added how all the other kids in the classroom turned around, surprised. \u201cHuh, so that\u2019s what that thing is for\u201d she guessed they thought [Meaning his iPad]. \n \n That\u2019s when it became clear to me that 12 weeks into the class, Oliver had not been able to share his thoughts, opinions, ideas or even answer a question. I think we can do better than this.  \n Inclusive education is about understanding that every child -- not just those with disabilities -- do better socially and academically when we create learning communities that don\u2019t leave anyone out. Inclusion is about understanding that we can all learn from each other no matter what our skills and abilities. \n \n I want to share just one more story with you, if I may. Last year, Oliver was taking 7th grade science class. It was very early in the year and the photographer from the newspaper was there to take some pictures. Oliver happened to be out sort of taking a lap around the school to regulate himself at the time. When the students realized that Oliver wasn\u2019t there they insisted that they be allowed to go and look for him so that he could be photographed with the class. They wanted him in the picture. He belonged there. \n \n It\u2019s stories like this that make me want to keep trying for Oliver. Because the kids get it. They know when a child is being meaningfully included vs. just sitting at the back of the room trying to sit still and be quiet. They know that all means all and they want to find ways connect. They just need help from the adults in the room. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2016/05/advocacy-portrait-1.html", "title": "\nAdvocacy Portrait #1\n"},

Our days have been filled, filled to the brim, with all sorts of good things. Someone gave us one of those large blue pools that are now a ubiquitous part of neighborhood backyard life. Setting the thing up and learning how to keep the water clean was a LOT more work than I anticipated, but it has been really worth it. Sami learned to swim within  one day  of getting the thing, and Oliver couldn't be happier than when he is in the water. Also, it has been a great magnet for neighborhood kids, making our house THE place to hang out when the mercury is hovering around ninety -- which is most of the time this summer. That has been great for all of us, including yours truly, who now can actually sit pool-side and chat with the other mothers.  \n \nAnd then there is the biking. A new bike rack for the car plus hot, hot temperatures have pushed us towards the woods, exploring local mountain bike trails. And the only thing that Oliver loves more than the water is riding his bike. Combine the two? Perfect! \n \nAnd then there is the garden. I know, I'm a total dork to take pictures of our garden -- and even more so since I'm posting them on my blog -- but, but, check out these grapes! \n And these beets? I didn't even plant them!

No words are actually exchanged): \n \nMe: Oliver, I think I found a piano instructor for you. You can start next week. Do you still want to learn to play? \nOliver: Yes! \nMe: Is there any particular kind of music you would like to learn? \nOliver: Dobussey. \nMe: Where did you hear that?! \nOliver: On the radio. \nMe: Do you think it will be hard? \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: Well, I think you are going to be a wonderful musician! \nOliver: Thank you.  \n \nSo there are moments like this punctuating our day nearly every day.

Today, for instance, we had the following exchange: \n \nMe: Oliver, why are you so upset? \nOliver: I'm mad. \nMe. Why are you mad? \nOliver: I don't want to type anymore. It's hard! \nMe: Do you think it will get easier with practice? \nOliver: Yes. \nMe: So are you willing to practice again later? \nOliver: Yes.  \nMe: What do you want to do now? \nOliver: I want to read a book. \nMe: With me or by yourself. \nOliver: By myself. \n \nOf course, I probably could have figured out that Oliver was upset about the typing. He had worked hard and needed a break. But it felt so wonderful to be able to say something that directly, for sure, addressed what he was feeling: This typing thing is hard!!!

In the past I might have made all kinds of assumptions about why he was upset and what would make him feel better: a snack, a walk, some other activity.

But now he can tell me: I just want to be left alone. \n \nAnd here's another little bit to the story that I love -- He lied! He did  not  want to read a book. He just wanted to be alone and zone out on his bed but I'm assuming he thought that it would be more acceptable to me if he, you know, took a book with him!\u00a0  \n \nSo, yes, the world feels pretty upside down at the moment. It's not all rosey. There are some bumps along the way. We've all got nine and a half years of learned behavior to consider and reconsider. But overall, I'd have to say that upside down feels pretty alright.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RPfoSPM0xzM/T5nx-D__7KI/AAAAAAAAAuw/aEAEtUtYcQQ/s1600/ipad+pictures+258.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/04/upside-down-and-feelin-alright.html", "title": "\nUpside down and feelin' alright\n"},
{"date": "April 19, 2012", "body": "\nThe more time I spend with Oliver trying to figure out what he knows the more amazed I become. Amazed isn't even the right word. There is no word big enough to describe what it feels like to \"discover\" anew this kid who has been by my side practically every day for the past nine and a half years!  \n \nIt seems that the boy has a photographic memory but I'm still not clear what that means in terms of what he understands about what he is viewing. If you hand Oliver a book and open it to any page he can summarize the content after a mere glance at it. I wondered what kind of texts this would work with so I have given him a variety of things from books of children's poetry to dense children's encyclopedias about dinosaurs. In every case he has been able to summarize or paraphrase what he has seen.  \n \nSo, why am I only now discovering that my boy can read? It's a question I've been thinking about and trying  not  to think about for the past couple of weeks. I feel a huge sense of failure for not realizing this sooner. In our homeschooling this year we've focused on the Bob Book series and truthfully I felt so good about Oliver's growing ability\u00a0 to read these. Now I see that his real work wasn't in  reading  the books, it was in reading them  aloud . How frustrating this must have been for him!! His ability to read far exceeds his ability to speak. Even now, once he writes something he cannot usually go back and read aloud what he has written. Speech and decoding written language apparently call on two different parts of the brain. I'm only just beginning to understand this.  \n \nI'm also a bit amused and chagrined to think of all the times I wished that Oliver would just sit and look at a book. Many, many times I scolded him for not really looking at a book when I asked him to. I can hear myself now: \"Oliver, will you please just  look  at this book for five minutes while I (insert some inane cleaning activity here)?!\" Then I would become frustrated as I watched Oliver flip through a book at the speed of light. He probably wondered why it takes everyone else so LONG to look through a book!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2012/04/theres-more-than-one-way-to-read-book.html", "title": "\nThere's more than one way to read a book\n"},
{"date": "December 02, 2010", "body": "\nAs you might know, I've been scheming about how to get the boy an iPad since the summer when I started to read about how much other kids were able to do with this new technology. Oliver has made such great strides this year and I'm thrilled with the learning and growth that he's achieved, but I'm ever on the lookout for ideas that might make that learning easier for him -- and the teaching easier for me! Then, just in time for the holidays, a local donor made my dream a reality. \n \nInitially I had planned to download and experiment with the apps in the evening after the kids went to sleep, then wrap it up and put it under the tree for Christmas morning. But I just couldn't keep it to myself and on Thanksgiving day, two days after I had it in my hot little hands, I decided that it was the  spirit  of Christmas, not the day, that mattered. And? Oliver  loves  -- LOVES -- his iPad! And for that, I love it, too. And for me, a self-proclaimed and proud Luddite, that is quite a statement. \n \nWhat do I love about it? I love that Oliver can easily do things with the iPad that are hard for him in other ways. For example, one of his favorite apps is a one that features Tangrams. We have a couple of boxes of Tangrams here that I pull out from time to time and, while Oliver does like them, it is hard to sustain his interest in them as they get more complex. He also tends to get distracted by the many pieces involved. Not so with the Tangram app -- watching him persist in solving even the most difficult ones just makes my heart happy. \n \nAlso, writing has been hard for my boy. When he holds a pen or marker or crayon, he dearly loves to just scribble. Asking him to control his strokes is like asking him to sit still -- he just can't do it. But with the iPad? He can do both! \n \nThe other thing I love about the iPad? Early mornings. Oliver wakes up fairly early everyday and then he is most happy to use his boundless energy. I, on the other hand, need to sit still and drink a cup of coffee and not have a kid jumping on my bed. Our new routine with the iPad involves sitting quietly in my bed, me with a hot mug of coffee and Oliver with any number of diversions. \n \nOh, and did I mention the sharing? Turn-taking? Interest in what a partner is doing? The iPad is one of the first things that has really motivated my boy to do these things. I love watching how he engages with his brother over a simple bowling app or a puzzle. \n \nFor all the great things, there are a few that are not so great. The biggest is that I can see how it could turn into a really static exercise if I am not careful. Oliver could get very hung up in doing the same things over and over again. For example, his favorite app of the moment is iWrite Words -- and I love it, too. But if I'm not careful to engage with him over what he is doing it could just become a static exercise that doesn't really promote any sort of thinking. The other thing I dislike about the iPad is that it has become an obsession for Sami. The first thing he said to me this morning upon opening his eyes was: \"Where is the iPad?\" \n \nOverall though, I'm thrilled with this new tool we have in our hands! I'm so, so incredibly thankful to those who made it possible. I'm surprised to find myself a qualified skeptic of technology, and I'm excited to see what possibilities are around the corner!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TPfDGXkCQvI/AAAAAAAAAtk/fvgaaoTjz1k/s1600/IMG_2300.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/12/i-think-its-beginning-to-look-lot-like.html", "title": "\ni think it's beginning to look a lot like iChristmas!\n"},

{"date": "April 01, 2010", "body": "\nI'm not much of a joiner. I tend to shy away from groups and causes. I was once a girl scout and I joined a book club a few years back but I can't think of many other joiner-type activities that I've been involved in over the years. I did not join the Special Olympics drive to ban the r-word, either. At least not in the sense that I signed the petition. It isn't that I disagree with the concept. You know, let's all try not to use words that are hurtful to other people. I can get behind that. I can stand up for that in my everyday life. And that is what I think it will take: many people taking action in small ways in everyday life. The petition is nice because it awakens everyone to the need for conversation about the topic and I suppose that is as good a place to start as any. But for autism awareness day I also won't be posting on my blog with blue text or sending blue e-mails or wearing blue clothes. It isn't that I don't agree with the sentiment -- that people need to be more aware of autism, what it is, how it affects people -- it's just that I wonder what exactly it is that we are trying to accomplish with these efforts at awareness? Because awareness without knowledge and meaning doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  \n \nAlong these same lines, I would like to know why, in the autism community, we haven't examined our own terminology a bit more because I think it impacts the message we are trying to get across. The whole campaign to 'ban the r-word' had me thinking about how we describe people with autism. In my last post I referred to what it felt like to have one's child on the receiving end of another descriptive term that I find equally objectionable. I can't imagine anybody, ever, feeling good about having themselves or their loved one referred to as \"low-functioning.\" But I also can't tell you how many times I've heard a professional use it or how many times a parent has told me that his or her child is \"high functioning.\" And every time I hear it I wonder why in the world one would choose to describe a child in terms of his  functioning.  How do these words influence our expectations for those individuals we are describing? And what does this language convey to someone who might not know a whole lot about autism? It seems to me that it somehow starts the discussion by putting the person with autism in the category of \"other\" and \"different\" in a way that has very little meaning. It doesn't exactly tell anybody anything useful as far as I can tell because it often does not reflect real world challenges that these individuals might face. I also find it incredibly de-humanizing. My refrigerator  functions ; my child lives, loves, laughs, is challenged, is creative, is playful, is silly, is persistent and cooperative. He is a brother and a son. He rides his bike better than most adults I know. He is incredibly easy going. He has a lot of anxiety. Communication does not come easily for him. Ask me how he functions and these are the things I'll tell you.  \n \nWhen I was in graduate school I took a linguistic anthropology class in which we studied how language and thought mutually influence one another. You see, it is very hard to figure out the chicken and the egg with respect to language and thought, but it is clear that each would remain fairly static without the other. Words and ideas shape each other. In terms of the r-word and now the f-word ( functioning , that is, high and low), it is pretty clear to me that what needs to change is not just our use of these words but, importantly, the thinking that goes with the use of the words. So simply saying: \"Don't use the r-word (or the f-word),\" is not enough because it doesn't do much to change how people  think  about individuals with disabilities. And \"Let's be aware of autism,\" also doesn't do enough to shape a person's thoughts about the issue. And that, my friends, is a tall order. If there were an awareness program that would help everyone to see that my son, and others like him, are full and complete beings, valuable to family and community, loved, loving and full of worth, then I would surely become a joiner. \n \nIn the meantime, I'll keep doing what I do every month, every day, of the year: I won't limit the opportunities I offer Oliver simply because he has autism. I will go with him everywhere our feet take us, even if I worry, even if it may be uncomfortable for Oliver, for myself, or for other people. I will keep trying to find our\u00a0 place in the world. I will talk to people about autism. I will talk to people about Oliver.\u00a0 I will use words that humanize, not pathologize. I will try, with my words and deeds to influence what people think about Oliver and about autism so that finding our place in the world won't be so bloody hard. \n \nAnd I'll wear every color of the rainbow while I'm at it. It seems only right.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/04/why-im-not-blue-about-autism.html", "title": "\nWhy I'm not blue about autism\n"},

{"date": "September 17, 2006", "body": "\nI haven't been very cohesive in my thinking lately and I think it shows in my writing -- and lack of it -- in this blog. Rather than fight it I'm just going to go with the flow here and write a very random list of updates and thoughts. Here goes: -- Add Baby Beluga; The Wheels on the Bus; Row, Row, Row, Your Boat, and The Good Morning Song (by yours truly) to Oliver's repetoire of songs. The Wheels on the Bus is something I haven't sung to him for probably two years and tonight I started singing and then stopped mid-way through the first line and he just jumped in and finished it off for me. He has also been sitting down at his piano more frequently and tapping individual keys rather than just banging it like he used to. Makes me wonder if I should be doing more with music. -- Sam is SO incredibly verbal and I think it is because of Oliver's verbal behavior program. He is only 18 months old but is already speaking in complete sentences. Short but complete. Of course Oliver was too, at that age, but I don't remember him being so darn persistent in his desire to  communicate , which is something entirely different. -- The playgroup that I organized met for the first time on Saturday and only one other Mom showed up with her children. I wasn't disappointed with the low turnout though because I had only finalized the details two days prior. I think others will try to make it in the future. Our kids played for an hour and we chatted, then we left and I called her up and we talked for another thirty minutes. It kind of reminded me of when I lived on an island in the Philippines where there was only one other ex-pat couple. I  craved  talking to them and during the times when we could get together none of us could get a full sentence out without someone else interrupting because one person's thoughts could take you places, could send your mind off reeling in another direction, in a way that can only happen when two people speak the same language and know the subject from the inside out. That's the way I felt on Saturday. -- If I had a TV I think I would have -- at one time -- really liked to watch This Old House. Because I like to do things with my hands. I like to fix things. I like to say: \"Wow! Look what I just did.\" But now I live in This Old House and after four years and two children what I mostly do is sit around and say: \"Wow! Look at all the stuff I should be doing!\" I love this house. It is a 102 year old Victorian with incredible light. But it needs work. -- The fish tank that I bought for Oliver's birthday was probably a mistake. I'm the only one who really ever watches the fish and every chance Oliver gets he climbs up on the table where it sits, takes off the top, reaches all the way to the bottom and creates a mini tsunami by swooshing around all the pebbles at the bottom. The fish, however, are miraculously still alive.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/09/random-update.html", "title": "\nRandom Update\n"},

{"date": "December 28, 2006", "body": "\nHappy New Year, Everyone. I had planned to post a bit more over the holidays but as it is I am enjoying the extra time with my boys and haven't gotten to the computer very much. Christmas this year was just so wonderful in our little green house. It was quiet and relaxing and full of sweet little moments.  Oliver, who in the past didn't really \"get\" the part about opening gifts, has started to realize what a wrapped package means. And Santa brought my little guy two special gifts. The first was a coveted Jack-in-the-box. Our neighbor owns one exactly like it and there have been many times when it has been difficult for Oliver to say good-bye to the toy at the end of a visit. The second toy was a top, the kind where you pump the top of it up and down and the bottom part spins. Inside the clear plastic top, a toy train then is propelled around the track, letting out a whistle each time it passes the gate. Having unwrapped these items there wasn't a happier little boy anywhere on this green planet, I'm sure. After so many occassions when I searched and searched for something that might interest him I was delighted to have succeeded. But I very nearly derailed my own delight as the day went on and I realized that playing with these two toys was ALL he was doing. But I took some deep breathes and decided not to worry about it until there was something to worry about.  And so far it has all been OK. He has even, on occassion, allowed Sammy to play with each of them. We have continued to implement the exercises in our HANDLE program and Oliver continues to sleep through the night. Let me just say that again: Oliver is sleeping through the night!  May the Gods continue to smile on us!  We are also finding as many ways possible to re-orient our lives according to RDI principles. There is just so much \"un-learning\" to do! For instance, our ABA lead therapist encouraged us to say: \"Take it!\" whenever we had something that we wanted to give to Oliver. So now that is what we do. Instinctively. Even Sammy does it. But what is the point of that when nobody outside of our family and his therapists will ever actually say that to him? So now, we might say nothing at all when we offer him something. Or we might say: \"Wow! This orange smells good.\" Or \"Let's wear shoes!\" or \"Ta Da! Your pajamas!!\" I am also trying to find little ways throughout the days when Oliver and I can do something together and to structure the activities in such a way so that he has many, many small successes. And the result? Oliver's willingness to do things with me has blossomed. In the past, anytime I wanted Oliver to do something -- even if it was something I knew he would LOVE to do -- he would take off running in the opposite direction. I spent 90% of my time chasing him down. And I'm not exaggerating. Now, I simply hold my hand out and call his name and then wait. It might take him a minute (or two or three) to disengage but there is no more chasing. And I attribute this to two things: Oliver now trusts that 1) no matter what, we are going to have FUN together; and 2) he will walk away from our activities feeling good about himself. And the best part is that I DO TOO! I am SO ready for the new year. I am ready to jump into 2007 with both feet. And this year, as opposed to last, I feel so confident that I will hit the ground running.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2006/12/ready-for-new-year.html", "title": "\nReady for the New Year\n"},
{"date": "November 04, 2010", "body": "\nWhen you are a parent of a child with extra needs, or just a parent, when you homeschool, or just deal with the homework  after  school, it is pretty important to also think about where  you  fit into the equation. Lots of times I sit down at the end of a particularly sucky day and just shake my head and think: \"What was going on with him today?\" Then, usually a day or two later I feel my mood shifting and realize that  I  was the one who had been in a funk and that Oliver was, in many ways, responding and reacting to me.  Of course  he is! But sometimes in the thick of things it is hard to be so full of insight. \n \nI bring this up because mid-October to February is a particularly hard time for me to parent through. I've never been a person who loved the winter months but only after I started my second career as a stay-at-home-work-at-home mom, did my seasonal mood issues become a real issue. It was intense and I just wasn't able to be the kind of mom I wanted to be. Last year I focused on maintaining my diet and exercise regimen but that offered only the slightest relief. This year I bought a light therapy box. And guess what? It is remarkable! \n \nEach morning while waking I turn my head towards the little palm-sized box next to my bed. I wake up feeling rested and full of energy (that is, I don't want to hang myself at the thought of getting out of bed), I have my morning coffee and don't even think of another cup all day, I don't feel like I'm going to die without a nap by late afternoon. And, since I was never able to nap, there was also the binge-eating of high calorie foods: also, not a problem now (Well, mostly, I mean:  Halloween  didn't help!).\u00a0  \n \nLast year I thought about getting a light box. I even talked about it with my family doctor. But ultimately I didn't want to spend the money and figured I could tough it out. Again.

If I had known how amazing it would be I would have gladly paid 5x the amount! \n \nThe thing is: we parents are mostly alike in that we'd do just about anything for our kids. We spend all kinds of money on therapies and therapeutic toys and special this and extra that -- you know: having a kid with extra needs is expensive and time-consuming. So I guess what I want to say is: YOU are the most important part of what your kid needs! Don't forget to make time for yourself. Figure out what you need and then find a way to make that happen. Even if you are the sort of person who is never able to make yourself a priority (this is you, right?) -- do it anyway. I promise you won't regret it.

{"date": "May 04, 2016", "body": "\n I told you recently that I am advocating for our school district to develop a model for inclusive education that will help Oliver, and other students in our community, to thrive both in and out of the classroom. Sending my boy off to school each day, knowing that things are not best-case scenario, has left me feeling powerless. And as a mother, that is the last thing you want to feel. Advocating is something I can do. And so it is what I do. That is, it's what I do when I'm not worrying (which is a real strength of mine). I'll be honest with you: this year has been hard on me, on our family, and most especially on Oliver, who is the real hero of this story. He is the hero because no matter how difficult his days are at school, he is always ready to go the next day and try again.\u00a0 \n \n I have wondered why my boy is so willing to keep trying when I feel certain I would give up if the choice were mine. During the worst of it this winter, I found myself asking him daily if a return to homeschooling would be a better option. I couldn't understand what he was getting out of going to school and he could never really articulate an answer that made much sense -- just that he wanted to go. Partly I chalked it up to his nature: he comes by his stubbornness honestly. But also to his gentle, accepting way (a gift from the other, more relaxed half of his DNA). But I'm also reminded of something I learned, so many years ago, working with refugees in Thailand. I spent my off hours interviewing my students who would soon be resettled in the United States. I was teaching cultural orientation to the elderly, 55 and over, which makes me laugh for several reasons now, thankyouverymuch. They were primarily Hmong, most of them didn't read or write, they were used to cooking over a fire and had a rich tradition of hunting and gathering. They smiled and laughed. A lot. (Frequently at me).\u00a0 \n \n \n \n It was all fun and games till someone pulled out a camera -- then \nthe joke was on the lone, smiling American. \n \n Even then, (my calendar says 20 some years ago) I was interested in understanding the stories we tell ourselves. How these stories influence who we are and who we will become, how we knit together our understanding of where our feet touch the earth right now, in this moment, with our expectations for where those same feet will carry us down some yellow brick road of the magical future.The marriage between the real and the ideal. And those refugees who were kind enough to share their stories and their dreams with me? They knew a lot about what is real. They knew about war and fear, frustration and boredom. They knew about what it was like to be caught in a system where you can't stay and you can't go back. And I think they also knew how difficult life in this far away country was going to be. Maybe they knew about the very high rates of depression and suicide of those who went before them. Surely they knew that an entirely new way of life awaited them. A life where chicken  parts  are sold wrapped in sanitized plastic wrappers so you can't even smell it or rely on your own senses to know what is what!\u00a0 And yet, despite the odds being so firmly stacked against them, their stories always made room for the chance at a happy ending.They found a way to balance their very real struggles and fears with the only thing they really had . ... Hope. This was one of the great surprises in my life -- that even amidst the most difficult circumstances, there was joy, there was life and there was Hope. \n \n For obvious reasons, this isn't much of an analogy. But years ago, when I was in the camps as a teacher, I quickly ( quickly ) found that most of the lessons would be mine to learn. I've never been a very good student, often taking years to learn basic truths, so maybe it isn't such a surprise to find that Oliver is now teaching me a very similar lesson and  that it's one that I still have to learn.\u00a0 \n \n Sometimes in this life, you can't go back, and staying where you are won't work. The only choice that makes any sense at all is moving forward, holding tightly to hope, and telling your story in a way that leaves room for a happy ending.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cxczqga3Yek/VypNeSoGw2I/AAAAAAAABZM/m6cVFT1BCLk-p6Y8EOj11WNa2vb3tISSQCLcB/s1600/Scan0004.jpg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2016/05/this-story-is-brought-to-you-by-hope.html", "title": "\nThis Story Brought To You By Hope\n"},
{"date": "November 02, 2010", "body": "\nSo, I've mentioned that Sami is going to a non-traditional, democratic school and it has been quite a learning experience for the both of us! Sami's cohort at the school is a group of seven children between the ages of five and ten. It is a very small school with three activity rooms, two bathrooms and a kitchen, plus a large-ish piece of property that includes a play area, a garden and a giant, wild meadow. The kids are pretty much involved in every part of the decision-making process at the school, which includes developing the school rules, determining what classes will be offered each year, and dispute resolution. This year the weekly classes include: cooking, gardening, science, art, reading, circus, gymnastics, video making, dance and the Native American stories. There is also a daily class on nonviolent communication and a daily meeting in which students, teachers and volunteers can discuss any issues and concerns. \n \nI chose this program for a couple of reasons. I'm not wild about how \"academic\" kindergarten has become. It still seems to me that at five years old a child's primary learning should be done through play. And even though Sami is mature for his age, a full day of school, five days a week, at his age seemed too long. Oh, and did I mention that recess is only 20 minutes long in our district? In Virginia, Kindergarten is optional so I figured that I could keep him at home with me for another year. But since I also work from home, a program like this, where I could send him just two or three days a week, seemed to fit the bill.  \n \nWhat I had not planned on was how much time and thinking I would devote to re-examining my own thinking about the meaning of education and how I measure success for my kids. A big part of the philosophy at the school is a belief that kids are intrinsically motivated to learn when they follow their interests and that it is not the job of the adults to mold and shape the learning experience of the child. Guide and mentor, yes; Control and organize, no. Wow! Fantastic, I thought! Just what I was looking for! But then I found out that Sami was consistently turning down the chance to work on his reading in favor of other activities. You see, each day there is a schedule of classes that are offered but each child has the opportunity to attend or not. So I did what any control-freak mother would do: I nagged him. But even that didn't work -- and I didn't feel good about doing it -- so I did what I should have done all along: I dropped it all together. \n \nInterestingly, Sami is learning to read even without formal instruction. When he comes home from school he often finds a quiet place to go and sit down with a book, then he'll come to me triumphantly sounding out a whole page of new words. \n \nAnd on any given day at the school you'll see all sorts of planned and unplanned activities. One day last week the kids built an enormous spider web that spanned the entire playground. On another day they created a short play complete with costumes and a set. Yesterday, a gorgeous fall day, they spent a few hours making up games and creating an imaginary landscape in the tall weeds of the meadow. One observer skeptically asked me if this was a typical day. The answer was that there are no typical days. Grasping that has been, for me, revolutionary. \n \nThe thing about Sami is that he has always been so interested in learning about his environment. He wants to know what that bug is, what it eats and how. He wants to know what melts and why. He wants to figure things out, develop plans and make things work. When I think of how I will measure success for Sami I've realized that it has a lot to do with these qualities: if he can maintain this incredible enthusiasm for discovering all that the world has to offer, if he keeps his eyes open and full of wonder, then I will feel that his education has been a success. I'm still evaluating how this school fits in with all that. I like the freedom but I'm afraid of the freedom. \n \nI plant to write more about this: how it has affected how I think about what I try to accomplish with Oliver and how I am beginning to see my role in helping my kids understand their place in the world. Overall, I just find it interesting that I'm having these kinds of conversations with myself. I never imagined how much this job of parenting would require me to examine and question so many assumptions. Is it like this for you?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/11/since-you-asked-post-about-samis-school.html", "title": "\nSince you asked: a post about Sami's school.\n"},

May is the time when I kick into full speed ahead mode in the garden, planning and planting and already thinking ahead to what I can set aside for the long winter months. Today I picked, cleaned and set aside 20 quarts of strawberries that will somehow magically become pie, ice cream and cobbler when we need a little a little extra sunshine at the end of the year. I even saved a few from the freezer bags for strawberry margaritas this weekend. \n \nSo, I'm telling all this to you now by way of explanation for what is bound to be a pretty paltry post. All I have to share tonight is the image of a boy and his mom, at dinner time, sitting at a table in a local restaurant, passing notes back and forth. \n \nMe (passing the menu to the boy): What would you like to a eat? \nOliver: A bagel, toasted with butter. \nMe: What kind of bagel? I see there is a list there. \nOliver: ev. ... (meaning an everything bagel) \nMe: And what about to drink? \nOliver: Lemonade \n \nThen, later (regarding the live music at the restaurant; the musicians being friends of ours with whom Sami the banjo boy frequently \"performs\"): \nMe: I like this music. It's different than they usually play. Have you ever heard this kind of music before? \nOliver: Yes. You have a CD. \nMe: But I haven't played it in a long time! \nOliver: I know. \nMe: It's called Klezmer music. \nOliver: I know. \nMe: If you like it then maybe Bruce and the others would feel happy if you told them. \nOliver: OK \n \nThen, on a new sheet of paper: \n \nDear Bruce, \nI really like the music. \nOliver \n \nBefore we left, Oliver and I walked to the small stage and Oliver held up the notebook so the band could read it.

{"date": "January 09, 2008", "body": "\nI must have said these words to Nik a dozen times or so lately.  I'm just so happy.  I wasn't so sure after returning from Houston. I felt nervous. Anxious. Stressed out. All in a very general way. And I suppose it was very natural -- Big Changes were afoot. But then I started digging in and doing what needed to be done and before long I was coming up to the surface for long gulps of cool, satisfying air. Slowly but surely I'm shedding the stress of my soon-to-be former job and I'm circling the wagons around what is most important to me: my family.  The most immediate improvement is my sense of rhythm. Not in a musical way. Mercy, no. That would require some kind of act of God. This is more of a coming together with my kids in a synchronized way. And now that I am becoming practiced at it I see how much it had been lacking in our lives. Nik and I have always prided ourselves on managing our lives in such a way that we were mostly home with the kids -- one of us or the other. But the trade-off to this commitment was the logistics of it all. It was exhausting.  Imagine, for instance, that Oliver was on one of his no-sleep benders. Night after night of not anything like a full night's sleep, Nik and I jockeying to see who could squeeze in an extra half-hour of sleep before the alarm clock went off. And anyway you looked at it, I would still have to be to work by 7:30, Nik by 9:00. But, as I ease out of my job, I have had the luxury of ignoring the alarm clock. When Oliver woke in the night I could let Nik sleep. Oliver, Sami and I, could stay in bed until 9:00 if we wanted to. We weren't marching to anyone's drum but our own and we were setting the tempo. And when it was a particularly difficult night, we could pile in the car and get a bagel or go to the pancake house: none of us cranky, none of us rushed. It has been Mar-ve-lous!  I'm also allowing myself, more and more, to give Oliver the gift of time. Not more of  my time -- he already has most of it. But rather, processing time. Do you know how hard it is to wait for 45 seconds? 45 seconds is a ridiculously long time to wait for  a response. But sometimes that is what he needs. And if I'm in too much of a hurry to get some thing or some where then I am surely losing something in the process.  Anyway, I'm just so very happy these days. Big Changes are afoot.

{"date": "June 05, 2010", "body": "\nUgh. I'm so tired right now I could puke. Or maybe I feel that way because I just inhaled three Klondike bars. I tend to go for the high-fat, high-sugar foods when I'm exhausted. But no, no, don't worry. I know what you are thinking and Oliver is still sleeping to the tune of 12 hours last night thank you very much. No, I'm totally wiped out because, oddly enough, I'm lucky enough to have someone help me look after the kids these days and so I can finally scrape out a little time for myself. It has been years since I had this kind of luxury.  Years . My world is expanding and it is a little exhausting but mostly exhilarating.  \n \nI've been taking a yoga class once a week for the past 6 months and yesterday my instructor decided to kick it up a notch and take us through a Kundalini series designed to target the lymphatic system. She said it was the easiest one and if that is true I'm going to consider dropping out because my ass has been kicked. I felt pretty good during the session even though I kind of sensed I would be sore afterwards. Sore is a complete understatement. I'm on the second floor of our house right now and I can't even contemplate going downstairs for another Klondike bar because I doubt I would make it back up again. \n \nAnd if that weren't enough, I volunteered to help out our local autism group which had a table set up to do face painting at an event today. Sure, I said gamely, not realizing what I was getting myself into. First, the place was packed and since we were right inside the door every kid passed right by our booth and ended up in line if he or she could talk his insane parents into standing in one of the the  90-minute long line s. (I mean seriously: who would wait that long to have their kids face painted?!) Secondly, there weren't enough chairs to go around so I ended up squatting in front of all those lovely, squirmy kids for four hours. Yes, I said  four hours  -- at the end of which I got chewed out because I had the nerve to tell some lady that yes, I really was too exhausted to paint even just one more grubby little cheek even though she didn't know there was a face painting table until just now when I was packing up to go. Then I cursed myself for biking to the event despite the fact that I was congratulating myself for it on the way there. I barely made it home and when I did the ingesting of the Klondike bars started. I took a short break from sucking in the calories to paint a rocket and a lightning bolt on the most goregously grubby cheeks framed by red hair that I know. Then I kicked everyone out of house -- I mean, I politely asked hubby to take the kids to the park -- grabbed my third and I swear my last Klondike bar and came upstairs to blog. I've been missing this place! \n \nI may never again get out of this chair. And that would make me very happy because then at last I would have a chance to write the post I've been meaning to about the extra super spectacular vacation that we took last week. \n \nSo even though I'm tired, I hope I never paint another cheek, I'm not sure my abs, arms or ass will recover from the yoga (or the ice cream), I still feel pretty good. I feel wide and full -- and not just from the Klondike bars. After years and years of contracting, of pulling in and focusing on the closest, most important things -- it feels pretty damn good to feel myself exhaling into the sweet, sweet expansion.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/06/sweet-expansion.html", "title": "\nSweet Expansion\n"},

{"date": "June 26, 2010", "body": "\nToday was one of those days when it really felt like summer vacation -- and not just because the calendar says it is the middle of June, but because our attitude says so. We're busy finding our groove and trying to beat the heat. We don't have air-conditioning and with a week of temperatures in the mid-nineties, it has been a challenge to keep  myself  the kids from being too cranky. Lucky for us, we live within just a few miles of some gorgeous swimming holes, which is where we spent a few hours today ignoring the heat. Unfortunately I remembered my camera but forgot the memory card. The heat will make you think you're losing your mind like that. So you'll just have to picture two giddy boys and their mama frolicking in the ice-cold river. And trust me, it was all that and more! \n \nOnce home again the kids and I engineered this awesome pirate/space ship by hanging all the sheets, blankets and towels from the clothesline. \n \nSami dragged his sleeping bag out there, declaring that he was going to sleep under the stars. Then the two kids spent a few hours lounging out there with books while I tried to figure out what to do with a staggering amount of laundry that had somehow spontaneously generated in my laundry room and which I now could not dare to hang on the clothesline. At bedtime tonight Sami lasted about three and a half minutes out there before throwing open the back door and indignantly telling us that the rabbits were making too much noise. Then he went upstairs, dragging his sleeping bag behind him, and climbed into bed with his brother.  \n \n Also in some weird twist of events, Oliver has taken a sudden liking to a basket of Little People that has been sitting in the corner of his room. I just don't even know what to say about it, really. Oliver has never much been one to play with toys and suddenly I find him zooming cars back and forth.\u00a0  \n \nAnd, as if all that weren't enough to make this a really great summer vacation kind of day?

{"date": "August 15, 2010", "body": "\n \nIf you're reading this because you love a person on the spectrum, then you might also know that among the heroes in any story about a family affected by autism are the siblings. Our family is no exception; Oliver's brother, Sami is quite definitely exceptional. \n \nSo, last spring Nik and I noted aloud to Sami that by the time his next birthday rolled around, in March 2011, he would be ready for a bigger bike. If you are a long time reader of this blog, you also know that we do quite a lot of biking as a family. Almost everyday you will find us out and about on our bikes. This summer some of our rides have been as long as 6-8 miles. That might not sound like a lot until you consider that little Sami rides a bike that probably comes up to your knees. For every revolution of my pedals, Sami was cranking out two or three rotations. It was exhausting to watch him but he never complained. Sami is quite a good sport that way. \n (And yes, please don't tell me that tomatoes is spelled wrong -- I ran out of room and that apostrophe? It is NOT an apostrophe but a very small \"E\".) \n \nSomehow, as Spring progressed, Sami and I agreed that if he wanted a bigger bike before his birthday then he would have to earn the money and buy it himself. It was then that the idea of a vegetable stand was conceived. Together, we planted almost 20 tomato plants in our yard with the idea that when they started to bear fruit, Sami could sell them on the sidewalk by the corner. The vegetable stand was a great impetus for all sorts of homeschool lessons and the more Sami learned about money the more excited he became. We went to a local bike shop and Sami chose a nice, used Trek, similar to the one Oliver rides. It cost $120. Calculating in my head how many tomatoes the boy would have to sell to earn that much I estimated that it would be a long, long while until he was wheeling away on the new bike.  \n \nThe first day of the vegetable stand was dismal. Sami made fifty cents and we sat on that hot, hot street corner for ninety minutes. I was loathe to go out the next day and thought briefly about working out another way for him to earn the money. But Sami, for his part, was so enthusiastic and optimistic. After all, he had earned fifty cents!! \n \nWe never had another day in which Sami only made fifty cents. In fact, it was often the case that Sami made $10 in ten minutes. Something about home grown tomatoes? Or a red-headed boy with a banjo? Who knows! But he learned to pick the best sales times: Saturday mornings and afternoons between 4:30 - 5:30 when people were heading home\u00a0 from work. And when he saw how well the tomatoes were selling he asked about selling green beans. He could buy them from the farm stand and sell them for twenty-five cents more a pound than what he paid. Cucumbers, too. Sami, it seemed, was turning into quite an little entrepreneur.  \n \nTo make a long story short, and to leave out a lot of long, hot hours on the curb, I can tell you that Sami earned the money for his new bike in just about two weeks. You have never seen a prouder five year old than when he sat on the counter of the bike shop and counted out all those ones and fives. And you would have to wait a week later to see a mother even prouder of that boy.  \n \nYou see, a week after Sami\u00a0 purchased his new bike he began to pester me to revive the vegetable stand. Every time I walked in from the garden with a load of tomatoes he begged me to give them to him for his vegetable stand. Every time we picked up a load of green beans destined for the freezer he tried to talk me out of a couple two-pound bags. It was ridiculous. And finally, exasperated, I asked him: \"Sami, you already have\u00a0 your bike, what  else  do you want to buy?\" And he responded with the best, most amazing thing I ever heard a boy of five say. He said: \"I want to buy Oliver one of those computers that will help him learn.\" \n \nIt took a moment for the enormity of what he said to sink in. I asked him, \"What do you mean?\" And he said, \"You know, the one where you just have to touch the screen that will be easier for Oliver and will help him learn to talk.\" \n \nWe talk pretty openly in our house about just about everything, including autism and including our finances. We talk to the kids honestly about what things cost and what we can afford and about the spending choices that we make. When Nik and I talk about money we don't wait until the kids are out of earshot. And Sami, evidently, had heard me talking about wanting to afford an iPad for Oliver. Lately I have seen and read so many exciting things about it -- from watching Oliver use one with his speech therapist to  this article  -- but with a price tag in the hundreds of dollars it is just not something that we can afford without planning and budgeting. You know how it goes.  \n \nBut clearly I did not factor in the value of brotherly love or the power of home grown tomatoes.  \n \n\"So,\" Sami asked, \"can I have a couple of bags of green beans for my vegetable stand?\" \n \nI couldn't trust myself to speak at that moment so I simply slid two bags across the table to him. \n \nThen, he leaned in on his elbows and said, \"And you know what, mom? You know all those tomatoes that you used to make the sauce today? I'll sell them to you cheap.\" \n \nSo if you see a red-headed boy with a banjo on the street corner selling tomatoes? That's my boy. And I couldn't be prouder. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TGddwBBAw9I/AAAAAAAAAs4/INSLgh4pt_Y/s1600/Imported+Photos+00252.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TGdc-C4d4lI/AAAAAAAAAso/n107ZvRaRcI/s1600/Imported+Photos+00292.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/TGddZiypBoI/AAAAAAAAAsw/OaxPc9GpCVM/s1600/Imported+Photos+00293.JPG", "http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2010-08-11/news/autistic-children-new-ipad-effective-portable-device-for-teaching-communication-social-skills/"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/08/story-about-boy-bike-some-vegetables.html", "title": "\nA story about a boy, a bike, some vegetables and a brother\n"},

Frankie the Walk \u2018n Roll Dog tells the tale of a dachshund who is adopted early in life by Gail and her husband. He has a good life with his adopted \"mother\", seeing the world, or at least Elkhart Lake, from the basket on the front of Gail's bike. But soon life changes dramatically in Frankie's house: a spinal cord injury leaves her hind legs paralyzed leaving her unable to walk. Operations, physical therapy and a lot of love and persistence follow as Frankie heals from his injury but is still unable to walk. Gail, not one to give up easily, finds a way to help Frankie to have the best possible quality of life. A specially made wheelchair gives Frankie the mobility he needs to continue seeing the world with Gail.  Together, Frankie and Gail have become a registered therapy dog team, visiting the elderly and hospital and hospice patients.  Frankie the Walk \u2018n Roll Dog, is a beautifully illustrated children's book that will appeal to people of all ages.  OK, now for the backstory of this review. I have to admit that when I was asked to write a post about this book for the Virtual Tour a few thoughts crossed my mind. Like: A  Dog  book?  A Dog in a  wheelchair  book? But I was also a bit curious, so sure, I said: sign me up. When the book arrived I barely had time to glance at the cover before shoving it into my suitcase to read while on vacation. And there the book remained, guiltily reminding me of my obligation every time I opened my suitcase to throw in another pound of souvenir chocolate. Finally, on the day before we were to depart for home I sat down to read the book.  What I found between the pages of Frankie The Walk 'n Roll Dog, was a very touching love story. It reminded me that there is no possible way to place a value on love. Love inspires us to create possibilities where others might see only limitations. Love inspires us to keep on moving forward even when our very own legs cannot carry us any further.  And there are as many varieties of love in this world as their are varieties of people. It is what makes life so interesting.  About Barbara: She is the author of the multi-award winning Frankie, the Walk 'N roll Dog. She wrote the children's book to give hope and inspiration to all who face challenges. Her lifetime love of animals led her to realize that Frankie's paralysis was an opportunity to spread a positive message. Frankie the Walk \u2018n Roll Dog, her first children\u2019s book, was awarded the 2008 National Best Book Award (children\u2019s picture book soft cover) by USA Book News, the Merial Human-Animal Bond Award by Dog Writer\u2019s Association of America, and the Editor\u2019s Choice Award by Allbooks Review. It was also a finalist in the 2008 Indie Excellence Awards. Frankie has been inducted into the 2009 Wisconsin Pet Hall of Fame.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.joyfulpaws.com"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/06/virtual-book-tour-frankie-walk-n-roll.html", "title": "\nVirtual Book Tour: Frankie the Walk 'N Roll Dog\n"},

But sometimes I  forget  that it is important. Slowing down, doing less, spending more time paying full attention to what we are doing: it is SO important. For Oliver, I think it is one of the more important things that we do to help him get on in this world without a whole lot of frustration. I've also come to believe that it is a vital part of my own mental health. And it just plain helps me to be a better parent. I mean, just because women are good at multi-tasking doesn't mean that we can and  should  multi-task. At least not every waking moment.  \n \nSo that's what we've been doing this past week, a whole lot of living moment to moment. In retrospect I see that it took a few days to calm down. It took some time to just relax into the stillness of the world around us. Today was day six of our snow-bound program and I think we got it just about right. Nothing was rushed. I wasn't obsessively checking my e-mail, desperate for outside contact. And I'm so far from feeling cabin-fever that I was disappointed today when we didn't get all the snow they had warned about.

{"date": "October 04, 2009", "body": "\nI had two bad Sundays in a row. Days when I had to talk myself out of crying. Days when I gripped the steering wheel and forced myself to think of all the good and positive things that we have going for us. On both of these days we went for long bike rides and that helped. I see Oliver holding his body straight as his strong legs pump and the bike sways from side to side beneath him. I watch as he languidly coasts on straightaways, steering his bike so precisely this way and that. I see him aware of and reacting to all the potential dangers in his environment. And I see the look of joy and competence on his face. He is capable, more so than I dared to hope a few short years ago.  \n \nBut on each of these Sundays I also have had to witness Oliver struggle with even the simplest of social interactions. I see him unable to stay sitting through the circle-time song in the Sunday School classroom where I have brought the two boys and then crying out for the box of Legos that he has spied on the shelf. I see the other kids looking at Oliver as he vocally comforts himself, also seeing when I have to leave the room with him. I see them appraising him and thinking to themselves: there is something  wrong  with that boy. Later, during the closing prayer -- after hours and hours of elapsed time which only read as 30 minutes on the clock -- as I stand close to Oliver, quietly urging him to stay with the others, the girl next to him refuses to hold his hand. \"That's OK,\" I tell her, \"I'll hold his hand.\" And it  is  OK, I remind myself, he will learn and she will learn. And I have to believe it to be true because as I say goodbye to the Sunday school teacher and her husband I tell them: \"See you next week!\" in what I hope is a cheery tone. And she must believe me because she hands me a piece of paper with her phone number written on it and says \"Call me. Let's talk about what we can do to make this a good experience for Oliver.\" I have my doubts. Lots and lots of doubt. But I will call her. And I will try. \n \nAnd I grip the steering wheel all the way home.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/10/driving-under-influence.html", "title": "\nDriving under the influence\n"},

It took us essentially two weeks to wean Oliver from the medication that we had hoped would help us solve the ever-present sleep problem. The decision to try a sleep medication was a long time coming. Oliver is seven and a half now and has never slept well. To put it nicely. I suppose we always thought -- hoped -- he would grow out of it. But the impact of lost sleep for our whole family is just so great that the time had finally come when we were willing to try just about anything. We initially experienced moderate success. Two, three, four nights in a row strung together in solid ten hour blocks. But no matter how many adjustments we made in his nightly dose, it just didn't seem to completely solve the problem. Not only that, but it introduced a new problem. With every increase in the dose Oliver began to rebound to greater and greater effect every afternoon. It wasn't pretty and I won't describe it here because it remains one of the more difficult things that we as a family have gone through. What little sleep I was getting ultimately seemed to come at a pretty high price for my sunshine boy. And no matter how many apologies I make to the heavens the guilt remains.  \n \nIt's hard, this business of parenting, isn't it? There are no for-sures and an awful many lets-sees and\u00a0 maybes.  \n \nBut we haven't given up. We won't give up. We've found a new developmental pediatrician (and only five hours from home!) who said all the right things when we met with her two weeks ago.

{"date": "January 06, 2010", "body": "\n \n I'm a bit of a luddite when it comes to technology. I might just be the only person left on the face of the earth who has never carried a cell phone. I just recently threw out the last of my old cassette tapes and switched over to an MP3 player. I have never even seen an instant message and the chat feature on facebook scares me. But I will admit to you that I do, frequently, turn to the Internet to find information and connect with people. \n \nMy internet activity is mostly spurred by autism-related need. There is good and bad in this. It isn't just about the sheer amount of information out there, though that can certainly be daunting. But having access to that information requires that we act as our own filter. If we aren't very good at critical thinking already, we must become so. Not all research is good research. What questions are being asked? Are these the  right  questions? Not all opinions, no matter how persuasively stated, are worth my time and attention.  \n \nProbably like most of you with children on the spectrum who might be reading this, I spent my fair share of time at Google University that first year post-diagnosis. But I was raw and vulnerable and I wasn't very good at using my filters. When I look back on that time now I still get angry about all the crap I had to work my way through. Especially I am pointing my fingers at the popular media portrayal of autism. Reading story after story of autism horror and pain and sorrow and tragedy made me feel as though I was about to drop over the edge of a cliff with my beautiful boy in my arms. \n \nEventually I managed to find my way. It all started by reading a blog (Kristina Chew's old MSHA blog) and seeing that there was another way to look at it all. From there I connected with a group of mothers and writers who were also finding their way. Mothers who weren't willing to accept the life of pain and sorrow that the newspaper and magazine articles were sentencing us to. If I was ready to drop off the edge of a cliff these other mothers threw me the lifeline. I will forever be grateful and inspired by these women and their families. \n \nNow, Kyra Anderson and Vicki Forman -- two of my favorite writers -- have crafted  Gravity Pulls You in: Perspectives on Parenting a Child on the Autism Spectrum.  The blurb about the book at  BiggerBooks  says: Each piece has been included because, as the editors requested, it offers a perspective that avoids \"the image of the parent feverishly scraping the autism out of her child or serenely offering up platitudes about life's roses among the thorns of hardship.\" Gravity Pulls You In gives voice to what's hard about raising a child with ASD without feeding the stereotype of the devastation of autism. There are stories of discovery and enlightenment, of perseverance and humor that forge a deeper connection among parents by broadening the perspective on autism and attempting to dismantle the fear. \n \nNow that's what we need more of, isn't is? Words that validate, inspire and enlighten. Because words have that power, don't they? We each have that power and thanks to Kyra and Vicky, maybe the right kind of words will find their way to other parents who feel themselves standing at the edge of that cliff and needing something to hold on to. \n \nI'm excited that one of my essays is included in the book. Having not read the book in its entirety though, I'm even more excited to read the rest of it when it is released in February. Because after all, who can't use a few words that validate, inspire and enlighten every now and then?  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/S0S4QJqlXbI/AAAAAAAAAdk/KeJhSCeqo1M/s1600-h/Gravity.jpg", "http://www.biggerbooks.com/bk_detail.aspx?isbn=9781606130025"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/01/gravity-pulls-you-in.html", "title": "\nGravity Pulls You In\n"},

So when all my facebook friends are posting that WooHoo! It is the last day of school!!! We are in full swing homeschool mode. You see, December through February really is no time for me to try and teach anybody anything. During those long, cold winter months I'm lucky if I can get everyone's teeth brushed. So for us it just works out better to capitalize on the light and energy of these extra long summer days.\u00a0 I'm also happy to report that I've had more fun with our schooling endeavors this Spring/Summer than ever before.\u00a0 As with the sleeping, or maybe because of it, something has shifted for Oliver in the schooling department. Learning is easier. Teaching is easier. And overall, the whole thing seems a lot less stressful for both of us. \n \nWe have also decided to homeschool Sami at least for his Kindergarten year. If you had told me pre-kids that I would be doing this I'd wonder what you had been smoking. But I also would have been surprised to learn that I actually  like  having my kids with me so much. And I love watching them learn. There are other reasons, of course, like 7.5 hour school days with just 20 minutes of recess for five year olds. ... but I'll save that for some other post. Or some other blog. \n \nIn the meantime, here's a little of what we did today in our little green school house: \n Sorting and counting. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQuantity -- this is something that has been especially hard for Oliver but he's getting there!\u00a0 (I cut the numbers out of sandpaper and they are great for all kinds of activities) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Adding and subtracting -- we're using the counting trays for this and Sami is learning to check his work with a calculator. He is very motivated to learn math at the moment because he's planning a vegetable stand where he can sell the stuff he's grown in his little plot out back.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe game hang man has been a big hit with Sami. He is constantly on the lookout now for words he thinks I won't guess. Do you sense a bit of competitiveness? Don't know where he got it! \n \n \nWe're also working on creating, continuing and reproducing patterns. Both boys really love this activity that is probably also great for fine motor skills -- I just hooked chopsticks together with rubber bands and filled a box with different kinds of objects and the kids use the chopstick tongs to pick things out of the box. \n \n \nAnother thing about homeschooling? It has made me very crafty.  \n \nAnd, of course, there is also recess.

{"date": "April 05, 2009", "body": "\nSo, for those of you who aren't living on planet autism, April is Autism Awareness month. And apparently, April 2nd was Autism Awareness Day. Don't get me wrong. I'm all for awareness. The more people who know about the challenges that Oliver faces and who are willing to look on with understanding, the better. But I kind of feel like every day is autism awareness day around here. Every time I go someplace with Oliver, every time we meet someone new, it falls to us to help make that awareness happen. April is no different from May, June or July. But it just so happened that on April 2nd, I was sitting down for lunch at our kitchen table with a man and a woman whom we had hired to do some carpentry work for us. I knew them both well enough to greet them whenever we saw them at local community spots around town, but I'd never had more than a superficial conversation with either of them. So as they ate their sandwiches, Oliver and I kept them company and chatted. During a brief lull in the conversation, I noticed that the man was looking at Oliver, who was intently laying out a design with a large stash of toothpicks. \"So,\" he said, \"Oliver has autism, right? I mean, I know he does, but what does that mean, exactly. I don't know much about autism.\" Wow, I thought, how great that he wanted to know more about my son so that he could understand my remarkable little guy. I always find it refreshing when someone asks a question like that head on. But oddly, I found myself at a loss for words. I mean, how do you sum up autism over lunch? Also, Oliver was sitting right there so I knew I had to choose my words carefully. I told him how, for Oliver, autism meant that he struggled to communicate with other people. That he understood just about everything that was being said but that it took him a long time to be able to process his own language in a meaningful way. At that point, the woman described her own struggles as a child with stuttering and how frustrating it was to want to communicate and not be able to get the words out. I also described how Oliver's sensory system receives input in a sometimes extreme way. Both of our guests could describe sounds and textures that really bothered them from time to time or at different periods in their lives. Since that day I've been thinking about what I want people to know about living with autism. Because it isn't that easy to just say: \"I want people to be aware of autism.\" Autism means different things for different people. What I want people to know depends so very much on the person and the context: stranger, family member, teacher, doctor, policeman. It is fluid. Its complicated. Sometimes I want people to understand his behavior. Sometimes I want people to understand that his behavior is very specifically a response to something that can only be understood in terms of his thought process. And sometimes I want people to understand that despite whatever they are observing, Oliver is not so very different from anyone else. I'm not so sure I did a stellar job of raising anyone's awareness on Autism Awareness Day. But I was glad to have the conversation. And I was glad to have it with Oliver sitting there at the table. Autism is a word that gets used in our household but I'm not sure yet what Oliver understands about it. The best part of our conversation was that each person at the table related to Oliver's challenges and shared their own stories. This is the kind of awareness that I want to think more about fostering -- in both my own home and my community.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/04/human-awareness.html", "title": "\nHuman Awareness\n"},

February 1st and this is the remainder of the foods that we put away over the summer to carry us through these long cold winter months when the farmers market tables look so bare. If we were pioneers we probably wouldn't make it through the winter! Four bags of pesto, pickles, three kinds of salsa, green beans, jam, and some tomatoes. Actually, we still have quite a few more jars of tomatoes and a few bags of frozen zucchini and two bags of hot peppers. Oh, and the canned corn that nobody likes. Next year I will definitely skip the canned corn and just freeze all of it. The same with the green beans. It is less labor intensive and tastes waaaay better. Both are OK in stews and soups though. We also still have about 20 potatoes, two quart bags of blueberries and one of sun-dried tomatoes.  \n Overall I feel pretty proud of the changes we made this year. We didn't eat  entirely  local but we did a pretty good job. Better than I imagined. During the summer and well into the fall there were lots of weeks when I spent less than $20 at the grocery store. As we moved into winter though I found myself shifting back to my old cooking habits which include lots of staple items bought at the oriental food market and some, but very few, processed foods. It was funny how all of my philosophical ideals quickly went out the window when I had to prepare a lunch for Sami to take to school last week and found myself at the grocery store face to face with a box of granola bars!\u00a0 \n We started our little adventure almost a year ago and I have to say that it was more fun and less difficult than I imagined. I'm lucky to have a few Mennonite friends who actually grew up living this way -- making everything from scratch, growing things and buying what your neighbor had to sell. Anytime I felt stumped I could just pick up the phone or call over the fence.  \n The hard part was not having a ton of snack foods on hand to pull out when the kids needed something to tide them over until dinner. This was especially true after apple season ended in the Fall. I would just give them bread with jam and butter but it would have been far easier to just rip open a bag of tortilla chips or open a can of pineapple.\u00a0 \n So, in honor of the groundhog tomorrow I'm turning my thoughts towards the sun. I'm dreaming of my garden, the crisp snap of a green bean, and the satisfying heft of a tomato. At the end of last summer I wondered if I would ever try such a thing again.

I had just about decided to give up on the whole thing. The anxiety that comes along with experimenting with a medication just didn't seem worth it if we weren't getting consistent sleep.

Since then we found a wonderful professional and the resources to contract with her. Oliver has been seeing her twice a week for a few months and we're happy with the whole scenario. Thrilled. He isn't making any huge strides that I can attribute, exactly, to the work he is doing with her but he is calm, cooperative, focused and happy to be there. For the first time in his little life he is not totally and completely distressed about working with a professional in a therapeutic setting. So, we took a break and now we're back at it, so far so good, right? But what I want to make note of here is what happened during that in between time because, in my gut, I think it made all the difference between disaster and success.          We took a break. My kid couldn't talk and yet we took a break from speech services. Kind of counter-intuitive, right? Yes, I thought so, too on some level. But it felt right and sometimes you just have to go with your intuition.          During that year there were many times that I despaired over Oliver's almost complete inability to understand what we were saying to him. He got some of it -- the rote, everyday kind of stuff. But if I threw something new into the communication loop it was met with a deer in the headlights look. I remember one particular episode when we were working in the garden -- I had piled a bunch of cardboard in the corner and Oliver's job was to bring it to me as I needed it to cover the paths between the rows. He got the idea and was game for his part but it was slow going and at one point, when he was at the pile and I was in the garden, I called over to him and told him to bring both remaining pieces of cardboard with him. He didn't get it. I tried again and he still didn't get it. I used different words and still, he didn't get it. Finally, I had to go over to him, we worked on it at close range and finally he got it and carried both pieces across the yard, but I was distraught. I remember reading that parents of non-verbal children should be careful of what they say around that child because it is likely that they understand a great deal more than we might assume. But I'm pretty sure that was not the case with Oliver. Someday I hope to be able to ask him.          Because Oliver had such limited receptive language ability I had a lot of techniques for helping him to understand what my words meant. I normally kept him within arm's reach if I wanted to communicate with him. I made sure there weren't a lot of other distractions around. I used lots of gestures and facial expressions, and I kept it pretty simple. I also gave him lots and lots and lots of time to process what I was saying. It wasn't easy. I couldn't just call to him from across the room and ask him to do something. I couldn't be in a rush. I had to focus all of my energy on helping him to understand what I meant. But I did it and pretty soon it became my habit.          During that time when we took a break from speech therapy I learned to worry less. Looking back now I wonder if my worry grew less because his ability to understand was also increasing. There was no point in time that I can refer to and say: ah yes, then he started to understand. It was a slow, slow, gradual thing.          Today, I can't believe how well Oliver processes receptive language. Really, I find it so amazing. I can find ten novel ways to tell him something and he will always understand. I can ask him to get something from another room and he can do it. I can give him novel, multi-step directions and he gets it more often than not. And gradually, I've had to pay less attention to how I communicate. I don't have to get up and move across the room to where he is standing (something that makes me totally blissful since I DO like to sit down, read the paper and have a cup of coffee now and then!). I don't have to eliminate distractions like I once did and I don't have to wait nearly as long for him to process. And remarkably, I have even started using adverbs to describe things and have been amazed to see that it has helped clarify meaning for him. How great is that??! Oliver is still verbal-lite as I like to say. He is a boy of few words, for sure. But his words are slowly, slowly coming more easily and his sentences are getting longer. And this kind of makes sense, doesn't it? How can you use language to communicated if you don't understand the very meaning of words? I don't have a whole lot more to add, except that I feel like we are in a much better place than we were even a year ago. Our lives are starting to feel normal. I'm less anxious. We laugh more. Life has gotten gradually, easier. We still have a long way to go, of course, but somehow the journey is lighter. And tomorrow is a speech therapy day. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/09/what-happened-in-between.html", "title": "\nWhat Happened In Between\n"},

Many of the offerings of Syracuse University's Institute\nfor Communication and Inclusion are probably equally worthwhile, but since\nwe've just returned from the 3 day Summer Institute, that's what I want to tell\nyou about. The experience of being part of this gathering was profoundly\nmoving.\n\n \n \n \n \nFor three days, Oliver and I were among nearly 300 other\npeople coming together to talk about how to better support individuals who\ncommunicate primarily through typing. As I wrote in an earlier post, I was\nmaybe like some of you reading this, skeptical about the whole concept of\nsupported typing. And maybe if Oliver hadn\u2019t shown me the way last year as we\nworked it out on our own with handwriting, I might never have looked at\nfacilitated communication seriously as something worth exploring. What we did\ntogether was organic and intuitive if incredibly low-tech. But it was clear\nthat Oliver would need to type if he ever wanted to communicate and be\nunderstood by a broader audience. \u00a0  At\nhome I quickly realized that typing would not, at first, follow the same\norganic, intuitive path by which handwriting unfolded for us. By the time we\narrived in Syracuse, we were ready to embrace whatever support we could find\namid a group of people who have spent their lives helping people like Oliver to\nachieve their full potential through communication and from the many, many\nindividuals who have found a way to make themselves heard despite the inability\nto speak. I came with an open mind and I left with a grounding in a specific\nset of skills based on widely accepted teaching philosophies and an enormous\nrespect for everyone I met. \n \n \n \nPresuming the competence of all individuals to be\nintelligent and to be capable in determining the course of their own lives is not\njust an idea, it is a fast-held belief and constant practice for the people I\nmet in Syracuse. The most profoundly moving part of the three-day experience\nfor me was to be surrounded by professionals and parents who treated those\nindividuals with disabilities that they supported with respect and the\npresumption of competence. You might ask what I found so moving about actions\nthat most probably agree is the standard for how we should treat all people without\nquestion or regard for ability. Who among us thinks there is an exception to\nthe Golden Rule? But the truth is that it is too easy to treat someone in a\nmanner consistent with our assumptions based on nothing more than that person\u2019s\nappearance and behavior. \n \n \n \nI know this to be true because (and here is my first shameful\nconfession) I am as guilty of it as anyone. Before Oliver gave me a reason to\nquestion the assumptions I formed about people with disabilities I\u2019m sure that\n without any real consideration , I assumed that if a person could not speak or\nif they behaved in a way that I didn\u2019t understand, that they somehow innately lacked\nthe ability to express themselves in an equal and reciprocal way. In short, I\ndidn\u2019t expect much of them.   And further,\n because of my assumptions  I was so\nuncomfortable about  my  inability to interact in a way that was prescribed by social norms that I\nnever spent the time trying to consider that other person at all. Ironically,  the impairment was all mine , because if\nit had occurred to me that the solution was simply a matter of presuming\ncompetence, then I would have had a basis for embracing my role in the\nsocial interaction as I would with any other person I meet. Had I done this, my discomfort is likely to have evaporated,\nopening a whole world of possibilities for friendship and growth.  \n \n \n \nParenting Oliver gave me a sharply distasteful dose of what\nit feels like to be on the receiving end of this kind of thinking. Or perhaps I\nshould call it non-thinking. No words of assurance from me would convince\npeople \u2013 doctors, teachers, therapists, friends, family -- to abandon whatever\nassumptions they made about Oliver\u2019s intelligence based on his behavior or\nperformance. In all the years of his life, I can think of hardly anyone who\ntreated him with the presumption of competence. I was very lucky, in that one\nof the very first books I read after Oliver was diagnosed was Douglas Biklen\u2019s:\n Autism and the Myth of the Person Alone . Although there were a lot of ideas\ncompeting for my attention in that first year of knowledge building, the idea\nof Presuming Competence that is the basis for this book, thankfully, stuck with\nme throughout. \n \n \n \nAnd yet. \u2026 \n \n \n \nA funny thing happened in March 2011. Over the course of\njust a few short days Oliver demonstrated to us that he could read and write\nand communicate to a much higher degree than we imagined. My second shameful\nconfession of this post is to admit that, although I had always believed in\nOliver, during that period the way we treated Oliver changed virtually\novernight. \u00a0  Let me say that again:  even though I thought I was parenting from a\nplace of presuming competence, the way we treated Oliver changed once he\ndemonstrated his abilities in a way that we valued . Oliver was the same kid\nhe always was but the subtle shift in our behavior was noticeable enough that\nit became a frequent topic of late night conversation and self-flagellation for both Nik and me.  \u00a0 Our assumptions about what Oliver was\nprocessing, thinking and feeling turned out to be inadequate and misleading.  \n \n \n \nOliver is now typing every day. He is telling us his\nthoughts (sometimes not always what we want to hear) and helping us better\nunderstand what kind of support he needs and it is getting easier for both of\nus. He now has an e-mail buddy \u2013 another boy of the same age who types. And I\nhave connected with other parents who have had the same experience watching\ntheir non-speaking child of varying ages finally find their voice. I was\nsurprised to find just how many of us there are out there.  \n \n \n \nI can\u2019t tell you if the people we met in Syracuse were any\nbetter at presuming competence from the beginning than we were. But each and\nevery one of them is a role model for me as I continue on this journey with my\nson. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://books.google.com/books/about/Autism_And_The_Myth_Of_The_Person_Alone.html?id=c4lY1yymx-sC"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2013/07/presuming-competence.html", "title": "\nPresuming Competence\n"},
{"date": "February 21, 2010", "body": "\n \nTwelve years ago I was invited to crew on a 42-foot wooden sailboat in the South China Sea. I was living at the time on a small island in the Philippines and already contemplating my return to this side of the world in the year to follow. I was young and free and ready for the next adventure. So even though I had no sailing experience and I didn't know what lay ahead of me, I was ready to step aboard and let the wind carry me into what was yet unknown. The owner of the boat, one of four ex-pats living on our small island, was ready to retire and wanted to take his boat from where it had been docked in Manila to his home port in Europe. I signed on for the first leg of the journey, a trip that would take us south from our island in the middle of the Philippine archepelego, past Palawan at the southernmost tip of the island nation, through open sea then skirting along the coast of Borneo, north through the legendary straights of Malacca, finally reaching my stopping point at Phuket, Thailand in the Andaman Sea. We had no schedule, only charts and maps that looked mysterious to me and a sense of purpose and adventure.\u00a0  \n \nI spent my first afternoon aboard The Bird of Passage below decks where I made myself useful cleaning and scrubbing and trying to find storage for the foodstuffs that we would need for the next couple of weeks. The boat moved gently with the small swells that entered the protected cove where the boat was anchored and I fought to to keep from vomiting as I worked. Exhilarated by the thought of what lay ahead I refused to let my lost sense of equilibrium get the better of me. By the time everything below deck was ship-shape I had succeeded in convincing my body that it could ride the waves without argument. When I came up for air my ship mates, all seasoned sailors looked at me approvingly. I suppose that all sailors have lost and found their equilibrium in times past and they remember. \n \nFrom my perch here on dry land, in vastly different landscape and circumstance, I have to remind myself that it really happened. We passed close enough to Palawan that I could make out the beaches and trees and I was sorry that I had never made it there to dive as I had planned. Dolphins followed in our white churned wake. The first glimpse of Borneo, rising like a green gem out of the water, after a few days stuck in the uncertain monotony of the doldrums certainly felt like the great adventure I was after. When it was my shift at the wheel, I learned to stay the course in the dark of night by picking out a star in the heavens and using it as a reference point. When we headed into the infamous Straight of Malacca where piracy is a real threat, I learned to watch the other ships we encountered and to be on the alert if they seemed to be charting the same course. It was magical, all of it.  \n \nI don't think of this period of my life very often and when I do, it is not without a bit of yearning. In some sense, I will never be that free and ready for adventure again and how I do wish I could have it all back again!\u00a0 Thoughts of this extraordinary time in my life came to me a few days ago when I felt that old stuck feeling and was angry and frustrated for not knowing what to do about it.\u00a0 There are many times when it quite simply feels as though we are treading water, not going anywhere, making no progress toward any of our goals; not unlike the doldrums that drove sailors mad in the days before gasoline powered engines.  \n \nIt just so happened that I was feeling this way when I moved a photo album aside so I could make room for a few more books. By chance I opened it and found the photos from my adventure aboard the Bird of Passage and in a bright moment it all came back. One photo of two crew-mates reminded me that they weren't having the wonderful time that I was on our little boat. They had taken a few weeks vacation from regular jobs in Germany to help crew this leg of the journey and they had a booked return flight home. They had a schedule. They planned to see something of Thailand before flying out. They were impatient. So when we found ourselves just sitting there, in the middle of the South China Sea, waiting for wind that wouldn't come they weren't content to scan the water and sky\u00a0 to see whatever might distinguish itself from all that blue. They didn't find the bird perched on the tree growing from a solitary rock that jutted from the sea when no other land had been in sight for two days to be worthy of the only thing that really happened on that day. They wanted to move along, thanks. They wanted to get what they planned on from the start.  \n \nAt the time I was so enthralled by everything that I barely noted my crew-mates discomfort.\u00a0 As a novice sailor the absence of wind didn't seem like much to complain about when I was surrounded by such beauty. Imagine being on a sailboat and not caring at all about the wind! But now when I think of these two, now that I am mother to a boy who might need a gust now and then --\u00a0 I have a lot more sympathy for them. Feeling like you are stuck anywhere is hard, especially if you're anticipating the place you'll be getting to. Still, I wonder if they remember that bird and that rock? And that amazingly improbable tree? \n \nIt WAS an amazing journey; once in a lifetime for sure. And this IS an amazing journey; one for a lifetime. Wind or no wind, it's good to be reminded of that sometimes. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/S4IEbssb5MI/AAAAAAAAAgg/oW_sYeomWKg/s1600-h/borneo.jpeg"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/02/waiting-for-our-wind.html", "title": "\nWaiting for our wind\n"},

Well, let's just say they fall into the category of \"Things I never thought I'd be doing as a mother.\"  \n \nLast week Oliver chipped a tooth. At first, I was nearly distraught. When he smiled it seemed half his front tooth was missing. And Oliver has a gorgeous smile. I wanted it fixed, like, right away. Could there be a  bigger  dental emergency? Unfortunately, the on-call dentist that Saturday didn't see it that way. And, I'll admit, the longer the weekend lasted the less catastrophic it seemed. By the time we got in to see our super-ultra-incredible dentist the following Wednesday it looked relatively  minor  -- just a small U-shaped chip. \n \nMr. incredibly wise dentist told me it wasn't worth fixing. The machine that files teeth down, apparently, is loud and vibrates. \"Ultimately, we don't want him to be frightened about sitting in that chair.\" He was right and I knew it. But still! I wanted that perfect, beautiful smile back!! And when I mentioned this totally superficial sadness, Mr. Dentist said he had an idea.

{"date": "April 07, 2009", "body": "\nCan I tell you how many times in the past we have worked on trying to teach Oliver to point to things? Our approaches have been many and varied. And pretty much pointless (pun intended). Oliver could gesture in the direction of something -- usually using his whole hand -- but the point was elusive and clearly had little meaning for him. And then? Well, we started working on our current RDI objective, the one where Oliver discovers that he can see something that I don't; that our perspectives are often different. And right from the beginning it was clear that something started to click for him. He is suddenly pointing all over the place. Within a week we went from no pointing at all to pointing for everything. Watching Oliver point emphatically at something is glorious. Another step in our communication journey. I've been thinking about why the whole thing has been successful this time around. Part of it has to be that I've learned how to help him make this kind of discovery more easily. But part of it, I think, is that he is now developmentally ready. We are clearly working on the edge of his competency. And that is why this whole RDI thing feels like magic to me. All of the time and energy that we spent working on pointing in years past wasn't effective because Oliver didn't have the developmental underpinnings that made the gesture meaningful. Now he does and so he can be more competent at discovering that, oh, if I don't show this thing or that to my Mom she doesn't necessarily see or understand what I am thinking. And I see him working to make himself understood. I knew it was clicking last week when we visited a friend and the kids were playing on the bridge leading to her property. Oliver accidentally dropped a stick (of licorice) that he had been playing with through the planks of the bridge. I didn't see him drop the stick but he came and got me, telling me to \"Get it! Get it!\" I had no idea what he was talking about so he had to really work to direct my attention to the piece of licorice. We worked together for about five minutes to locate the missing prize, the whole time Oliver pointing then looking at me to make sure I was following the line between the end of his finger and the licorice. At first, I didn't even know  what I was looking for!! Then, when I put two and two together, I marveled at how he hard he was working to get me to see something from his perspective.  He even sometimes moved my head so that I could see between the planks in the direction of the licorice!!! When I finally retrieved the licorice from the brackish water under the bridge I cringed at the thought that he might eventually want to eat the thing (he did not) but there was no way I was going to let him fail. For the moment, Oliver is mostly pointing to things that he wants -- he has dropped something and can't get it or he can't reach something that he'd like to have. Ultimately  I hope that he can use this discovery to point out things that he notices about the world around him that he would like to share with me. As in, \"Hey, look at that bird!\" We aren't there yet. But we're working on it. When we first started working on this objective I said to my consultant that we were in it for the long haul. My previous attempts to teach pointing were so dismal that I couldn't imagine the day when he easily, readily, pointed out objects. Now he does it many times throughout the day. Just like that. It seems like this is the way of things with Oliver. We go through periods of time when I think that I might have to reconcile myself that he won't ever be able to do this thing or that. And then suddenly he is doing that very thing and I'm reminding myself that I should never underestimate my little guy. He's got his own timetable, his own trajectory.

I used to have quite a collection of his music on cassette tape but I left all of that in an act of catharsis at the Salvation Army before one big move or another. I\u2019m a real sucker for some of his earlier stuff:  Suzanne, So Long Marianne, Bird on a Wire  and of course, my favorite, the painfully melancholy  Famous Blue Raincoat . Cohen\u2019s music    transports me to the soul of my early twenties when I was deeply involved in an angst-filled love affair with an older man. An  artist  no less.    Our affair was doomed but painfully exquisite. And perfectly suited for a Leonard Cohen soundtrack. But life has changed a bit for me since those days.    I don\u2019t have a lot of time for free listening and when I do, Leo rarely suits the mood.       Fast forward a couple of weeks and you\u2019ll find me listening to Cohen again. I\u2019m on vacation in an unbearably beautiful spot but my mood is undeniably melancholy. The setting is ripe. Now that the children are older we\u2019ve graduated again to the attic apartment in the old farm house owned by my mother-in-law. Normally a boarder lives in this small garret apartment but he has decamped to Southern France for a few months and so the apartment is ours for three weeks. The boarder is an intriguing fellow. In his mid-fifties, he has no regular job and by all accounts never has. He lives, as far as we can tell, on a small government pension. He owns next to nothing and his asceticism is evident in the things he has left behind: a small hot plate and tiny refrigerator, a cupboard pantry filled with the bare essentials: sugar, red table wine, instant coffee, saran wrap. His pillow and an extra set of shoes are covered in the corner of the outer room by a threadbare blanket. A sheet, roll of paper towels and a pair of scissors sit on a counter and a bare light bulb hangs above what must serve as his table but now holds my laptop -- a device that seems wholly out of place. The heavy wooden eaves and insulation hang above my head, moonlight streaming in from the skylight. A clothesline with sentential    pins hang from the rafters in the far corner. A poster from the Spaghetti Western, Once Upon A Time in The West, hangs on one wall and a Political Map of the World hangs on another. The rest of his life is in whatever luggage he took with him to the South of France.    I met Vernie on our last trip to Switzerland. He was quiet and unassuming with a gentle, self-assured smile. He helped my Mother-in-law with the weeding and yard work, he had extravagant patience with my children and he spoke English, German, Italian and French with equal fluency. He is the kind of person I always want to know more about because of the simple peace that he exudes.    I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m struck by this melancholy now when I finally have space to breathe; to just be. Such a change it is from the last few months.    I don\u2019t know why but I feel lost.    If I go back to those earlier Cohen days I remember that the painfully exquisite feelings came from wanting intensely to inhabit a being that could capture the love of this person that had captured me so thoroughly. But a person cannot become a decade older, wiser and more confident just by wishing it so. And so it is for me with parenthood I suppose. Try as I might I have not become the person I want to be, the mother who accepts her role and her children in the simplicity of the moment.    I want. If only. Why. I cannot seem to find the asceticism that makes living in the moment possible.    I\u2019m curious about Vernie because he apparently has what I lack: the ability to appreciate the gifts that come from the simplest of acts of living.     I am now a decade (or so) older than I was when Cohen was on regular rotation in my cassette player and hopefully I am also wiser and certainly more confident. But those traits only came by way of living. I had to earn them.     The greatest gift I can give my children is to accept them wholly for who they are, to not want and wish for them to be otherwise, even as I rejoice as they continue to learn and grow each day. I know this and yet the melancholy persists. I want. If only. Why. Is this part of the process? Is this the way I have to earn the next decade of wisdom?     Probably.     I\u2019m not sure.     But Leo?    I think you\u2019ve served your purpose. And you can take this melancholy with you!        \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/Sirbr6mZ0jI/AAAAAAAAAWI/jByB0p3Gzvo/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00019.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SirbrPIf2iI/AAAAAAAAAVw/_ZznObZKMq0/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00022.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/Sirbrj--iuI/AAAAAAAAAWA/OcUDwM3_1hE/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00018.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/Sirbrb476VI/AAAAAAAAAV4/t57Hsx_LvmA/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00020.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/06/notes-from-attic.html", "title": "\nNotes from the attic\n"},
{"date": "January 31, 2010", "body": "\nSome time ago I wrote that I had come to realize that in my subconscious mind there was always an after-autism. In this after-autism time we would look back and laugh at how much we worried. No, don't get me wrong. I knew from the start that autism is a way of being. A  life-long  way of being. There's no curing that. There's no changing that. But somehow in my magical way of thinking, there was to come a time when autism wouldn't hog center stage quite so much. When I held this thinking up to the light I saw a vision of Nik and me, sitting -- no,  lounging , in the Adirondack chairs on the back patio. This was way off in the future because these weren't the crappy plastic chairs that we have now but the real deal wooden ones. And also, we don't have a back patio. (That is on the ten year plan and we are now only in year nine.)\u00a0 But besides that, Nik and I were holding a long, cool tea and were deep in conversation. Also, there were  no children  nearby. And while there was nothing explicit about this vision that would tell me, I knew that the children were off doing their own thing. And that everything was alright. \n \nIf I could have imagined what those older versions of us were talking about it might have been some version of a conversation that we have from time to time. \"Remember the 'Year of the Poop?'\" or: \"Do you remember when Oliver woke up screaming at 6am every morning for a year?\" one of us will ask the other. The other sort of replies with a slow shake of the head and an exhaled laugh that pretty much says: Nobody would believe it if we told them and I'm sure glad that is over. Because at the time it felt like it might never end.  \n \nThe part of the vision that I like to think about is how utterly relaxed Nik and I seem to be. Our faces are without worry. We look well rested. Turns out, I think, that Oliver is inside the house. Maybe he is on his bed reading a book. The point is, I don't appear to be worried about him even though I cannot see what he is doing. Everything is just alright. \n \nThe problem with magical thinking though is that it won't get you anywhere. Nowhere in that little vision is there a clue as to how we got there. And I don't really believe in magic. \n \nI've been in a bit of a depression lately. It's pretty standard fare really in terms of a depression. I can't seem to focus. All I want to do is sleep. I've lost interest in things that I used to enjoy. I put off doing things I should be doing and absentmindedly surf the web. And did I mention the great, great, overwhelming desire to sleep? Oh, yeah right -- that part is normal for me.  \n \nBut maybe in my depressed and sleep deprived state I'm overly susceptible to suggestion because today I was watching a music documentary and one of the old time musicians said something like:\u00a0 \"Enjoy life. You only come by this way but once.\" And I found myself annoyed at how wasteful I have been with mine lately. I don't know exactly how the things I'm worried about right now are all going to turn out in the end. But maybe it isn't the ending part that really matters.  \n \nThis afternoon I found myself drawn to the kitchen. I wanted to cook something but there wasn't much by way of ingredients. Cooking was one of those things I had kind of lost interest in. But, aha! A bag of lentils and a butternut squash. Onions. Rice. As I pulled together a pot of soup I thought about the conversation that Nik and I will have one day when we sit on those real deal chairs on the back patio. It's the worries of today that we'll be shaking our heads over by that time. New ones, different ones will probably replace them. But by then maybe we'll just have the good sense to know that those worries will also be replaced one day. \n \nNot too long ago Mom-NOS asked readers to post the name of a song that represented them. I chose \"To Live is to Fly\" by Townes Van Zandt\u00a0 - a song that I've listened to quite a bit this year. The lyrics kept coming into my head as I wrote this post tonight: \n \nDays up and down they come \nLike rain on a conga drum \nForget most, remember some \nBut don't turn none away \nEverything is not enough \nNothin' is to much to bear \nWhere you been is good and gone \nAll you keep is the gettin' there \nTo live is to fly \nLow and high \nSo shake the dust off of your wings \nAnd the sleep out of your eyes  \n \n(and because Gretchen found TVZ's version depressing I'm linking to the Steve Earle's version :-) \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/01/what-you-keep-is-getting-there.html", "title": "\nWhat you keep is the getting there\n"},

I'm still struggling with a sneaky kind of grief that crops up when I'm least expecting it. I was ready for her to go that Saturday evening when she took her last breath, surrounded by all her children and grandchildren. But knowing that the end is at hand and being ready for the suffering to stop is different than being ready to lose my mother. She was 76 years old and I honestly thought we had another ten or twenty years ahead of us. I wanted more time. Neither of us were ready for the finality of good-bye. \n \nIn the immediate afterwards, I was relieved. Caring for my mom those seven months was beautiful in a way that I hadn't expected or even imagined but also intense. Everything else but caring for my mother fell away. I slept just feet from her bed so I would hear her in the night. We spent our mornings watching the birds out her window while I massaged and soothed, coaxed and encouraged. I can still feel her hot breath on my neck as I helped her move from chair to wheelchair to bed to toilet; I can feel the weight of her as I learned to help shift her from side to back to side when she could no longer get out of bed. But I was exhausted and I knew that she was too.  \n \nMy mom was an amazing woman. She single handedly parented five children, enduring years of relentless poverty while managing somehow to never make us feel inpoverished. She couldn't give us material things so instead she gave us a deep curiosity about the world around us, a library card and permission to walk the two miles there and back as many times a week as we wanted. She never spoke of her hopes and dreams for us but she instilled in us a belief that we could truly do anything we wanted and, in fact, that we would be foolish if we didn't.\u00a0 She was a good role model for lifelong learning, she was trained as a teacher but she was always reading and teaching herself new skills. She could spin the hair of a llama into beautiful yarn which warped her loom or kept her knitting needles busy, churning out beautiful works of art. She could repair furniture, lay ceramic tile, and tackle just about any home improvement work with expertise, if not the enthusiastic support of her children who often grew tired just watching her. \n \nShe is greatly missed but remembered in just about everything I do.

Little did I know how useful that hole was going to be or how much I would learn to appreciate it: just another instance of things not being what we expect in autismland. Because, you see, the heart is a muscle -- a sometimes unobliging muscle in my case, prone to arguments with my head and not easily influenced by my better judgment. And as a muscle it grows and gains strength when the fibers broken in times of stress are repaired. When the holes and tears in a muscle have been healed it is capable of doing more than it once was able. \n \nThe process of gaining a stronger heart has been, shall we say, difficult. The sometimes seismic effect of circumstances have ripped gaping holes at the most unexpected moments. Yet, as it turns out, the holes I've endured not only help that blessed muscle get stronger but make it periodically easier for things to come and go as needed. \n \nThe first things to go were false pride and a healthy dose of ego. Later, I learned that anger, resentment and fear could also be ushered out whenever they threatened to upset the balance of things. \n \nThe holes, too, created space for things to happen. It created a space that was open enough for me to re-consider my proclivity for judging other people.

The event is sponsored by a local, parent-run organization and the money raised is then given out to families in the area in the form of scholarships, meant to cover needs not funded by some other means.  \n \nWhat I hadn't anticipated, however, is that Oliver would be with me. We had conveniently forgotten that Sami's first soccer game of the season was that same morning and, since Nik is coaching, that meant that Oliver and I were unexpected partners for the morning. We do a lot of walking so I wasn't too worried about the distance, but I didn't know the route, how many people would be there or how much support there would be along the way. So, at the last minute I decided that Oliver and I would bike the route. We had to bike to the event anyway since Nik had the car so, I reasoned, why not just stay on our bikes? \n \nThe main challenge to biking the route came from navigating safely around walkers and cars since the roads were not closed to traffic. But really, I must say, Oliver did beautifully. He adjusted his speed to mine, dodged people moving unexpectedly into his path and stayed to my right or my left depending on which side of the road we were traveling. \n \n The absolute best part of the walk came about mid-way through the course. We were nearing the crest of a small hill, Oliver standing up to pedal, the bike swaying from side to side beneath his powerful legs, when I looked over to our right and saw a woman that I had hoped I would never run into again.  I wrote a post about her sometime ago . That post marked the beginning of pretty big learning curve for me in which I discovered that professionals are only just people and some of them are full of shit. And I'll admit it: I am still quite bitter. Quite bitter. The kind of ABA that this woman and her organization practice cost us a lot, emotionally speaking. Her low-expectations for my son were manifest from the beginning but it took me a long time -- too long -- to figure out. By the time I walked away from the whole thing, Oliver had developed a phobia for adults. I think I did, too. But I walked away having learned some important lessons. And a resolve to never classify a living being according to any perceived notion of \"functioning.\" So, to have this woman suddenly appear in our path, when Oliver was so beautifully managing, so gorgeously coordinating with me, so utterly competent and graceful -- well, it made my heart soar. \n \nI'm sure this professional in our community wasn't the target of the awareness meant to be raised last Saturday. But I hope that when she saw my boy and I riding past her, skillfully navigating our way, past all sorts of obstacles, that maybe, just maybe, she revised her assumptions about what she thinks she knows about people with autism. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/S7NfKq_oIMI/AAAAAAAAAig/IAa7DQRsH8w/s1600/Imported+Photos+00317.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/03/taking-awareness-on-road.html", "title": "\nTaking awareness on the road\n"},

{"date": "September 08, 2010", "body": "\nRecently a friend and former teacher came to visit just as I was putting away the homeschool lesson for the day. Oliver and I had been working hard on one-to-one correspondence for a number of weeks and still, he wasn't getting it. I was having a hard time not being frustrated, mindful that I can't teach effectively once I start in with the pessimism: \"He's NEVER going to get it!\" But still, after trying everything I could think of to get the concept across I felt myself heading in that direction. Dangerous territory for the whole family! I said as much to my friend and her reply startled me with its clarity. In essence she said: \"Then put it away. If you are trying so hard and he isn't getting it then he isn't ready. Do something else for awhile and come back to it. He'll get it eventually but don't make yourself -- or him -- crazy.\" I think I really needed for someone to say this to me because taking the long view of things often gives us such needed perspective. \n \nHer advice made a lot of sense to me and it is something that I practice regularly with Sami without even thinking about it. You know, with Sami it is pretty easy to trust in the developmental process. Not ready to potty train? Fine. Let's give it some time. Tying your shoes? Reading? Who cares! We'll try again in a couple of weeks. And really, it has been as easy -- as  not worrisome  -- as that.\u00a0 With Oliver, however, trusting in the developmental process hasn't been so worry-free. But after years and years of mothering Oliver you would think that I might be just a tiny bit more relaxed about it. After all, I've seen astonishing growth in my boy. I've seen his plateaus followed by bursts of development over and over again. I spend a lot of time being amazed by him. He and Sami just have a different rhythm to their forward momentum.  \n \nSo we abandoned our lessons for awhile. I still incorporated numbers and counting into everything we did but I didn't try to sit down with him and match numbers with quantities again. Until today. Today was Sami's first day of school and so I figured it might be a good time to break out the numbers and counters again. And do you know what? It was like he had been doing it all along. He still had trouble remembering some of the names of the numbers, thanks to his aphasia, but he very clearly matched them with quantities. And each time he counted out the right quantity he proudly turned to me and said: \"You did it!\" \n \n\"No,\" I reminded him: \"YOU did it!\" \n \nA couple of nights ago I listened to a speaker who reminded the audience that we cannot \"pour language into our kids.\" This has kind of stuck with me because I like the image and because it is so true for just about everything. I mean, as much as we might like to, we can't pour anything into our kids (and here I'm also thinking about Resident Teenager!). Language, development, learning, reason. ... these are things that our children have to come by naturally  through the course of living . What we can do is support them (with the right environment and teachers and all that), pay attention to their own individual rhythms, create lots of learning opportunities, and find a way to trust in the process.  \n \nAnd sometimes, I remind myself, the process of living and learning can even stretch well into a person's fortieth year!  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/09/why-im-glad-my-friends-are-so.html", "title": "\nWhy I'm glad my friends are so insightful\n"},
{"date": "September 14, 2010", "body": "\nI cannot tell you how glad I am that garden season is almost over. I am exhausted. I already called it quits for the season. But then for some pathological reason I brought home a half bushel of sweet red peppers and eight pounds of green beans. We WILL have pickled beans and roasted peppers all winter even if my husband is seriously considering an intervention for me over my compulsion to preserve vegetables. And I don't even want to tell you about the pumpkins, Charlie Brown! So, if I haven't responded to your e-mails? If I haven't sent you that money I owe you? If I haven't sent you that box full of baby stuff that is all packed and sitting by the front door? (But it's coming this week, I promise!!) Well, please don't think badly of me. I have a serious vegetable habit that I'm trying to kick. \n \nBut, there ARE a few things happening here that are unrelated to the vegetables: \n \n1. Sami's new school rocks! It is a Sudbury-type school with about ten students ranging in age between 5 and 11. I love watching the kids plan, create, negotiate, debate and just plain have fun. (All these things, by the way, I would have totally taken for granted if not for Oliver's autism because these are the very things that don't come easily to my boy. Watching it happen naturally, easily, it just blows me away.) Every Monday there is a circus class and Sami is thrilled to learn how to juggle, which is very funny because pre-, pre-school he somehow got it into his head that one learned how to juggle in school. Go to school. Learn to juggle. That's just the way it worked in Sami-land. And Lo and Behold!: a circus class! So awesome! \n \n2. I have decided that I can no longer really, truly say that Oliver is non-verbal. I finally feel like I can have a kind of, sort of, conversation with my boy. It seems like kind of a funny thing to put waaaay down here in the post -- it is a such a Grand Statement, isn't it? -- but it has been happening so gradually over the course of this year that it doesn't feel like such a huge Ta-dah! kind of announcement. But definitely an awesome for the Oliver column! Of course, I feel the need to qualify this a bit: we still have a loooong way to go. I would love it if Oliver was able to offer a comment or ask a question. But he can answer questions, tell me how he is feeling, and let me know what he wants. Plus, his echolalia is skyrocketing and I finally feel much more secure that we will get there someday -- which is an awesome in the Mama category.  \n \n3. Resident Teenager (RT) has moved in with us full-time. Life is a roller-coaster that ends in squeals of delight every evening when two little boys are tucked into bed by the biggest boy -- an awesome for the entire house o' boys! \n \nThat is all for tonight. Dilly Beans are cooling, peppers are roasted and I've hung up my apron for the season. \n \nI hope. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/09/why-i-cant-even-put-decent-post.html", "title": "\nWhy I can't even put a decent post together\n"},
{"date": "July 01, 2009", "body": "\n Spend enough time with Oliver and you will come to find out that the boy likes to live life on the edge. Literally. If we are walking down a sidewalk he will position himself so that he can touch whatever wall or fence is adjacent. In the woods he will walk with one foot on the path, one foot in the forest. If there is a ledge or berm or line, he will walk as close to it as possible. I've known this about him for years but while we were on vacation I began really paying attention and I learned something new about how Oliver navigates life.  Going places with Oliver is relatively easy these days. He smiles easily, seems to understand so much more of the world around him and is just, generally, an easy-going kid. But he still needs quite a lot of help and support because he can sometimes be impulsive and often will do things that might be considered  inappropriate  or that make  me  uncomfortable . So I am hyper-vigilant when we are out in public and I rarely let him stray out of my arm's reach so that I can reign him in if necessary. One thing, for example, that has often perplexed me and caused some stress is that Oliver is very likely to walk straight into other people. For instance, if we are walking down a street or an aisle at the  supermarket  and someone is advancing towards us from another direction, Oliver will visibly change course so that it would seem he is trying to collide with the other person. It stresses me out and confuses the other person -- why is this kid banging into me when the whole street is otherwise empty? In Switzerland there are many streets closed to automobile traffic and lined with outdoor cafes, people sitting close-by to foot traffic, sipping their coffees. We spent a lot of time walking these streets and I began to notice a pattern. No matter how often I re-directed Oliver, he would always try to change course and walk straight to these clusters of  unsuspecting  people or towards the nearest pedestrian coming our way. It frazzled my nerves. I wanted to give him the freedom to walk  independently  but often found that it was easier to take his hand. When I had his hand he walked comfortably beside me.  But after taking so many pictures of Oliver keeping to the outermost edge of the environment, it suddenly dawned on me that he probably wasn't trying to collide with those people at all, he was trying to anchor himself by aiming towards the next closest thing in a moving world. I tested my little hypothesis a few times to see what would happen if I didn't re-direct him and sure enough, he simply brushed by the advancing person and continued on his merry way down the street. I would love to simply be able to relax now that I've figured this out -- and wow! It feels like such an important insight -- but I can't let him go around letting him constantly brushing against people and things all the time. Even in the woods this was a problem: the paths that we hiked regularly were all crowded by stinging nettles -- I've never seen so many! So every time I saw Oliver veering towards the side of the path (constantly) I had to remind him to stick to the middle. It was frustrating for both of us. Oliver is almost seven and he's been doing this for almost as long as I can remember. Finally figuring this out -- putting two and two together -- feels a little bittersweet. I can't believe it has taken me so long!!! It also makes me wonder how different Oliver's perceptions of space must be from my own and what I can do to help him feel more comfortable navigating the world. Ideas anyone? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SkrViGdaJ0I/AAAAAAAAAXQ/uzp3djhMjHE/s1600-h/IMG_0479.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SkrVh14R4YI/AAAAAAAAAXI/SA0AlOgCdv4/s1600-h/IMG_0469.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SkrVhpoglEI/AAAAAAAAAXA/kfqIDuYIGGc/s1600-h/IMG_0464.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/07/living-on-edge.html", "title": "\nLiving on the edge\n"},
{"date": "July 08, 2009", "body": "\nI was enormously happy -- thrilled, in fact -- with the level of care that we received at U.Va. this week when Oliver had his  little quarter- ectomy  (confused? See previous post). Every single staff member that we interacted with was  professional , helpful and caring. I loved that everyone, the surgeons, the nurses, the medics and the orderlies, all addressed Oliver and included him in the  conversations  about what was happening to him. I was relieved that every staff member noted Oliver's special challenges and asked what they could do  to make it easier for us. I knew that Oliver would have difficulty accepting an IV and so they made every effort to avoid making him get one until the last possible moment and then they discussed all of our options for making it as least traumatic for him as it could be. When it became clear that we would be discharged soon, I started to think of how I might communicate my  thankfulness  to the staff and was happy to learn that a  satisfaction  survey would be mailed to me. The discharging attendant told me that the feedback they get from these surveys is important to them and it helps them to make positive changes in their procedures. Alright, I thought! Rock on. I hope I never have to go back there but I'm happy to give them my input in case I do. So, I'm soliciting thoughts on the best way to express the one, tiny, little complaint that I have. When we were first admitted to the pediatrics emergency room the nurse, upon learning that Oliver had autism, asked me: \"So, how severe is his autism?\" This is a question that I often struggle to answer because, honestly, I think it has little meaning. And in this case I couldn't grasp what  relevancy  it might have. So I looked at her with my mouth open and totally at a loss, stammering: \"Um, well, he has trouble  communicating . ... I'm not sure I understand your question. ...\" \"Oh, you know, they have those scales,\" she said drawing the shape of an inclined plane in the air with her finger, \"where does he fall?\" So I asked: \"What exactly do you want to know?\" I wasn't being  pissy , I just didn't get what kind of information would be helpful for me to share with her that might have relevance to what was about to unfold.\" \"Well, how cooperative can we expect him to be?\" OH!! OK, now it is all clear. \"He is really cooperative and has been handling everything great. I think it helps for him to have me with him but otherwise I'm so pleased with how he is doing. He's been very cooperative. \" So here's the thing: severity of a person's autism has no bearing on how well that person will deal with pretty much anything. Every single person on the spectrum has challenges that are unique to that person. A better way of asking the question might have been: What special challenges do you think we should be aware of with your child  in this situation?\" That would leave the door open to talking about sensory challenges,  communication  limitations, stranger anxiety, trouble with transitions, etc.  And it would definitely give them more useful information than any number on an autism rating scale would provide. I'm looking forward to filling out the survey and sharing this with the staff because I think it is a small but vitally important point to make.  And I'd like to ask: If you had the same experience and were filling out the survey is there anything that you would add to my statement above?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/07/satisfaction-survey-looking-for-input.html", "title": "\nSatisfaction Survey -- looking for input\n"},
{"date": "July 12, 2009", "body": "\n I got it into my head earlier this year that what we really needed was a rabbit hutch with a worm composting pit underneath it for our garden. Sounds like a really homeschooly kind of thing to do, don't you think? Mostly it was for me, but I knew the kids would go along with it too. And what do you know? Nik didn't even object -- normally he is the one who puts the kibosh on my random, out-there, ideas.  But soon after he gave his thumbs up, (like the next day because I was worried he would come to his senses) we built a de-lux rabbit hutch in the back yard. The only real hitch to the plan was that we didn't have a rabbit. Or worms. I went to the SPCA but they would not let me adopt since it turns out they consider rabbits more of an indoor kind of pet. As soon as I told the woman we had an outdoor hutch she literally grabbed the application form out of my hands. Pet stores wanted $50 a piece for rabbits that were \"guaranteed for three weeks.\" So that was out, too. I had about as much luck finding worms. I made about 10 phone calls to every sort of environmental and agricultural service I could think of. Strangely enough, if I wanted to keep the worms indoors then I wouldn't have this problem. Apparently worms are also indoor pets. Then, as luck would have it, a neighbor told me that another neighbor wanted to get rid of her rabbit. Ah ha! A lead!!! I quick visit revealed a nice brown rabbit in an outdoor hutch. I asked the woman why she wanted to get rid of the rabbit and she answered vaguely: Oh, I want to spend more time on the garden. It didn't occur to me to wonder about that until much later. The rabbit -- Bo-Bo, put up quiet a fight as the husband and wife both tried to grab him so they could put him in our box. When the woman finally pulled him out she quickly thrust him into the box and shut the lid, as she was doing so, I gasped to see that her arm was covered in blood. \"Your arm! It's bleeding!!\" \"Oh that? Um, it  was  bleeding.\" she told me, as if to imply that she had just been walking around that way before we got there. As if this wasn't a  rabbit  induced injury. But anyway, I had my rabbit and the kids were thrilled. All the way home I heard the guy thumping loudly against the walls of the cardboard box. It sounded a bit menacing. Aren't rabbits meant to be docile? I should have thought about turning the car around. But oh well, I had my rabbit. And he was free!! Unfortunately, as you might have guessed, Bo-Bo isn't the friendliest of rabbits. In fact, if rabbits could growl I'm sure this one would. But he  is  old after all. And he does poop a lot so I'm getting what I want from him. ... still, I started wondering if I shouldn't have been more selective when a friend told me that she used to have a rabbit that her kids could  hold . Not long after that I happened to be at a local hardware and lo and behold, I found that they were selling baby rabbits. Timidly I reached in to pick one up -- my only experience so far had been growling, scratching Bo-Bo. But this little guy just practically jumped into my hand then curled up in a ball and went to sleep as I pet him. Ohhh, this is what we had been missing. So you guessed it, the new guy came home with us. But there was only one problem: I was afraid to put this dear, sweet, baby in the same hutch as Bo-Bo. The last thing I wanted was for my kids to witness violent scenes from the animal kingdom. So I let the new guy: Digger, stay inside. We put him in his box at night and whenever we had to go out but otherwise he had the run of the place. The kids were beside themselves with Joy. The only problem? Hop poop, Hop poop, Hop poop. That's pretty much all rabbits do. I spent a LOT of time picking up little rabbit turds. Bo-Bo was beginning to look a lot better. Digger had to go. Armed with a water squirter, we gently introduced Digger to his new companion. But here's the other thing I learned about Bo-Bo: he is, um, rather affectionate if you have long ears and fur. It also didn't matter to Bo-Bo that Digger showed no interest in returning his affections. It also didn't matter which end Bo-Bo tried to, um, investigate. He was just  really  happy to see another rabbit, let's just put it that way. Digger seemed unfazed and unhurt. Sami and Oliver seemed utterly fascinated. I was just happy there was no bloodshed.

{"date": "July 08, 2009", "body": "\nMonday started out like any other day and ended 48 hours later unlike any I can remember. It began with a small group of my friends and their children who gathered in my kitchen to participate in a chemistry experiment that, if we were lucky, would yield Mozzarella cheese. As we heated four gallons of milk to 90 degrees I counted small heads and realized that one was missing. Oliver was quiet upstairs and with a bit of apprehension I climbed the stairs to check on him. One too many apples had caused a bit of intestinal distress and, well, there was some kind of mess to clean up. I gave Oliver a quick bath, closed the door on the smelliest room and brought him downstairs to join the cheese-making fray. Later, after we had all eaten our share of fresh, yummy cheese and the last of our friends bid adieu, I loaded Oliver and Sami in the car to rent a carpet cleaner. We also stopped by a local shop and bought a new rabbit to add to our fold. 10 week old Digger would join old and crotchety, not-much-fun Bo-Bo in our rabbit hutch. Once home again, I told the kids to play in their room with Digger while I set to work cleaning the carpet in the other room. Mid-way through my work Sami tugged on my elbow to tell me that Oliver had another accident in their room. Sighing heavily I stripped him down, put him in the bathtub and set to work cleaning my second carpet of the day, telling Sami to play with Digger in RT's room. While I was busy, Oliver finished his bath and went to play in bedroom A again and -- you guessed it -- had another, explosive, accident. I put him in the bathtub for the second time and set to work again on carpet A, only to be interrupted shortly thereafter by Sami telling me this time that Digger had pooped all over RT's room!!! Oh well, I thought: might as well clean ALL the carpets. When I was  finally  finished I plopped down in my desk chair thinking to myself: well, at least I had the carpet cleaner. I had put in a full day's work in just a few hours and was, well, pooped! As I thought this to myself I heard first the sound of Oliver gleefully jumping on his bed and then the distinct sound of something hard clinking against his teeth. A coin? A marble? I quickly ran through the probable list, inwardly groaning that I don't get a moment of peace, but sat for another second reminding myself to have patience. I'm working on patience. In that final second, as I sat there, Oliver began choking on whatever it was in his mouth. I was almost to his door when he bolted out, ran past me and in to the bathroom with a wild look in his eye. By the time I stood next to him he was wheezing and struggling to breathe. Then, a breath, followed by gagging and retching. I guided him to my desk chair then and watched for signs that would indicate what I should do next. At this point he was breathing fine but acting somewhat subdued. I called our pediatrician and the nurse recommended that we head to the emergency room. Kids swallow stuff all the time, right? Probably he would just poop it out, whatever it was. Going to the ER would just reassure me that everything was OK and make me feel like an alarmist, right? Wrong. The x-ray showed a very obvious round object about the size of oh, a quarter, lodged in his esophagus just behind his heart. Oliver, they told me, would need surgery. What? Surgery? Are you kidding me? I just couldn't get over the enormity of what happened in the time time it took me exhale a tired sigh. A few phone calls to the hospital staff yielded more news: Oliver would need to be transferred by ambulance to a larger hospital, over an hour away, where they had a pediatric surgical staff. We were finally admitted to a room at U.Va. a little before midnight and Oliver promptly fell fast asleep. The next morning, another series of x-rays told us that the object had not moved and that we would have to follow through with the surgical procedure. Around noon, a quarter was retrieved from Oliver's irritated esophagus, which was promptly soothed by 7 popsicles in rapid succession. On the way home from the hospital we were involved in a three car, one 200lb bear, accident. I'll save that story for another day but I'm just throwing it in here now to reinforce my claim that this was quite a day. ... The good news is that Oliver was incredible. He was a superstar. He handled the whole thing, from start to finish, without a bit of fuss. He was cooperative, calm and didn't complain one time. He was poked, prodded, pinched and shuffled from place to place and he handled it all better than his mother, who was bitter tired and a nervous wreck.  A year ago, or two, and this whole episode would have been unbearable, the stress 100 times more intense. But Oliver surprised me with his resiliency and maturity. And although the circumstances weren't a bit pleasurable, he was a pleasure to behold. I want to end this post by saying something about how this experience made me realize how different life with Oliver is today compared to how I imagined it was going to be three years ago when we just struggled to get through each day. I can't quite think of how to express the huge difference between the future of my imagination and the reality of my boy at the present. But as I am at home again, settling back into our routines with a boy who is one quarter lighter, I know that anything is possible. The future is bright and completely unwritten and I, for one, can't wait to see how it all turns out.

{"date": "July 20, 2009", "body": "\n Back when Oliver was first diagnosed at the age of three, back when we had teams of people regularly meeting at our house to discuss what could, should, be done to help him, someone thought to ask me what I would most like to address through therapy. I remember the surprised, not-quite-understanding-if-they-heard-me-right looks on their faces when I told them that I would really, really, really like for Oliver to learn to ride a bike. Ok, ok, he had barely any language then and their tests and ratings and scores and whatever showed all kinds of deficits and here I was talking about bike riding. But here's the thing: life as we had known it was gone. Therapists, schedules, food choices, friends, relatives, terminology, language, relationships, expectations. .... all of it. Changed. And the future? Our hopes and dreams for what our life might hold? For what Oliver's life might hold? Changed, too. Or at least under revision. So asking the therapists to help us teach Oliver to pedal a bicycle wasn't as frivolous as it might sound. Prior to having children, Nik and I did quite a bit of cycling.  Not only did we both do a lot of our commuting (I even did laundry and grocery shopping by bike) on two wheels, but we logged countless miles on the weekends exploring our county together.  You could even find me on my bicycle around town in the week before I gave birth to Oliver in late August. It was natural for us to dream of the day when Oliver might join us on two wheels. The therapists gently told me that we could work on the pedaling thing during \"down time\" and I got the message that they thought maybe I should re-examine my priorities. Still, every day for months we worked on helping Oliver understand how to coordinate his body with his little tryke. Eventually he got it and later balanced on two wheels easier than we expected. Our biggest hurdle was teaching him how to use the brakes. After nearly a year of trying to help him understand how he might back-pedal to slow or stop, we decided to change tactics. A few weeks ago, with a generous gift from his God parents, we bought Oliver a beautiful green and black Trek with a hand brake. He is slowly, slowly getting the hang of squeezing the brakes, with frequent reminders from us.  (He still prefers to drag his feet -- we've now gone through two pairs of shoes!) Buying Oliver a larger bike has had one unintended but wonderfully anticipated consequence: larger wheels = speed, and Nik and I, who are both -- ahem -- not as young as we used to be, can no longer keep up with him on foot. The day when we ride together as a family has finally arrived. It feels like a landmark. An accomplishment that makes my heart soar. There are no words for it. There are some tricks to the whole thing, of course. We choose our routes and times to avoid traffic. Nik rides next to Oliver, always careful to keep him within arm's reach and to his right. The sight of them riding together makes me think that Nik would have made a good cowboy the way he corrals his spirited two-wheeled boy. We've been on several five-milers over the past week or so and each morning when Oliver wakes up he searches for his helmet and declares: \"bike ride!!\" It makes me deliriously  happy and reminds me again that there is simply no telling how far this boy will go. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SmRtUxqxrXI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/ZF6WelQpCcw/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00034.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SmRtWCfB_JI/AAAAAAAAAaY/_hxL8_76xtE/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00033.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jCA_u0s-Ekw/SmRtVqjCcKI/AAAAAAAAAaI/WK3bh7PBSqo/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00035.JPG"], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/07/and-were-off.html", "title": "\nAnd we're off!!!\n"},
{"date": "September 08, 2010", "body": "\nSami started school yesterday and had three major meltdowns over the course of the next twelve hours. I'm  not used  to my kids having meltdowns. Normally both are go-with-the-flow kind of boys. At first I was a little put out: what is  wrong  with this kid? But being five is hard. Starting a new school, a new routine? It's hard. Learning to negotiate with a whole roomful of new people? Hard, hard, hard. And truth be told, I sometimes forget that Sami is only five. His language and his thought processes are pretty sophisticated. He's the kid who sits down to do something and immediately starts talking objectives and strategies. But he is still such a little boy, after all. And though he is ready to step away from me, into this wide, exciting world, I remind myself that it takes a lot of courage to chart a new orbit, one that that takes him so much further into the unknown. \n \nSo apparently all the extra energy he spent at school yesterday meant that he didn't have the emotional reserves to deal with the fact that I asked him to find his socks or to discover that, say, a  vile plum  was packed in his lunch box for the second day of school. \n \nPlums have been banned from the lunch box for good. Because when you're going off into a new orbit for the first time you should be sustained by the fruit of your choice. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2010/09/plum-was-very-vile-on-second-day-of.html", "title": "\nThe plum was very vile on the second day of school\n"},
{"date": "July 09, 2009", "body": "\nDid I tell you that we got a new speech therapist and that I love her so much that if she wasn't married I'd ask her to move in with us? She is so positive and optimistic and has such a wonderful way with Oliver that I would give her RT's room in a heartbeat just so I could get my dose of good cheer and warm optimism every morning on my way downstairs for coffee. RT would probably put up a fight because that would me that he would have to bunk with the munchkins but Lara would just smile at him a few times and then, I feel confident, he wouldn't mind so much. Besides, she is very pretty. How, you might ask, can we afford to send Oliver to a private speech therapist twice a week? Well, I'm glad you asked because I still can't believe my good fortune. For some reason I very happily came across the website for the United Healthcare Children's Foundation and decided to apply for a grant on Oliver's behalf. Within a month we were approved and busy rearranging our schedule so that I could take Oliver half-way across town twice a week for forty-five minutes. If you have a modest income and a medical need for your child that is only partially covered by insurance -- or in our case -- not covered at all, then I urge you to look at the website to determine if you might be able to apply for a grant. It was easy as pie. Honest. Anyway, back to Lara. She is the very first adult (outside of family) that has successfully built a report with Oliver and it took her a relatively short amount of time. She fully embraces the total communication approach that we use with RDI and she somehow knows when to challenge Oliver and when to give him a bit of time and space. She is also really good at listening to my input and incorporating that into her work with with him. Imagine how grateful I am that Oliver not only jumps out of the car but happily takes his communication book with him, swings open the door to the office and then rushes happily back to the therapy room without a second look back at me. I can hear small snippets of sound coming from behind the closed door -- mostly because Oliver can be quite loud -- but I rarely, rarely, hear sounds of distress. There was a time, not long ago, when Oliver reacted with quite a bit of anxiety whenever I put him in any kind of therapeutic situation. It was hard for me to see any good coming from any activity that always resulted in such acute distress for my boy. Taking Oliver out of school, stopping speech therapy, these were not decisions that we came to easily. I don't worry about it everyday like I used to, but on occasion I am reminded that our path is pretty unconventional and, well, I worry about that now and then. But twice a week when Oliver and Lara come out of the therapy room all full of smiles and bounces, I feel, in my heart that we did the right thing. The right thing for us was to wait, to not try and do everything right now, to build self-confidence, believing, knowing, that for Oliver this was the key to helping him accept greater challenges down the road.  When Lara says to me with a little bit of genuine surprise in her voice: \"We had another great day!\" and then lists all of his accomplishments during their session we both trade little hopeful, surprised smiles because we are both thinking the same thing: this kid is really taking off!!  He is interested, engaged, focused and. ... using real language to communicate. Tonight at dinner, we slid into our booth at the Mediterranean restaurant and Oliver promptly began a little demanding mantra: \"chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken!\" Playfully I smiled and asked with a bit of surprise in my voice, \"What?\", to which he responded: \"I want to have some chicken!\" with a tone of voice that said I wasn't the brightest bulb in the pack! I craned my head to see if the waitress was nearby because you'd better believe I was suddently mighty motivated to get the boy some chicken! Luckily she was on her way so I didn't have to steal any from our neighbor's table!  And later, when we went to the pet store to find a rabbit feeder he grabbed Nik's hand and said: \"I need to use potty.\" We all came home a bit giddy. I hesitate to say that we are on the road to becoming completely verbal. I suspect that speech will always be a struggle for my boy. We'll take it one step at a time, finding our way together. What I am most excited about is his new willingness to experience and participate in so many things. The scope of what is possible is growing wider and wider.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/2009/07/get-boy-some-chicken.html", "title": "\nGet the boy some chicken!\n"}
