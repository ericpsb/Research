Dan Woodman, according to his \" About the Artist \" page, is \" ...mildly autistic. The process of creating SOIL is intended to be therapeutic as well as humorous. Dan identifies with SOIL\u2019s characters \u2014 especially Cory \u2014 who illustrates many of Dan\u2019s own personal challenges.. .\" I read some of Dan's comic strips and found them to be wry, and funny, and very good at representing specific challenging aspects of Asperger's Syndrome. Regardless, it is very nice to see the culmination of the effort and creativity that Dan is applying to this comic strip.    I would be thrilled to see \"SOIL\" make it in to a mainstream setting such as a major newspaper so that more people could be exposed to Dan's work.  If you explore the website you will see that \"SOIL\" has been seen in some local papers and has some nice reviews as well.  There is even a  book , cited as \"A massive collection of SOIL in one volume!\" So kudos to Dan Woodman and \"SOIL\", which now ranks as my second favorite comic strip on the subject of autism.  My absolute favorite?

{"date": "Wednesday, February 2, 2011", "body": "\nOh my gosh.  Oh my, oh my.  It appears that it has been about one year, 5 months, and 5 days since I last wrote here at One Dad's Opinion.  Pardon me a moment while I stretch and yawn... Ahhh, much better.  And now, back to it. You may wonder why I have chosen this moment to return to One Dad's Opinion. The reason is simple - I want to share a story with the one group who is most likely to appreciate its value.   A group who I admire and feel a part of to this very day, despite the fact that I have been a dusty old member of the archives for well over a year now.  Heck, some of y'all might not even know me at this point, might not know that I was part of a great team that represented the Autism Hub on several different occasions at the highly respected University of San Diego Autism Insititute. I relented from my blogging for a long time.  Partly it was because the constant controversy and attack/defense made me feel a bit mean.  Partly because my real life demanded more attention than I could provide in any given 24-hour period.  And mostly, mostly because my favorite topic of conversation at the time - my son J - had matured to an age that I no longer felt like I could write about him without his consent.  Big, ethical issue that I decided must go in favor of least possible harm and most possible respect.  So I quit.  And here I am back again.  And now you will see why. Following is an excerpt from the blog of a very dear friend of mine and my family's.  Someone I know and respect very much: MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 2011 some words to chew on Today I wore this to work out... Except half way to gym, which is 30 minutes away, I decided that the lil' guy in the back was hacking to much to bring him to the kids' club. No work out for mama: Bummer. Sick kiddo: Bigger Bummer. Solution: Do Zumba on the wii at my friend's house after I tutored her third grade son. Simple enough, right? Well, clearly not so much. Her son has autism. Just like my Luke. And no they are not like Rainman (written with a smile). Autism is a spectrum of behaviors that range from very mild to very severe. My friend's son saw my shirt and asked me one of the most difficult questions I have ever had to answer in my life. \"Why would they want to  take down  autism?\" For him and all the others with autism, finding a \"cure\" doesn't make sense. They are quite content being who the are. They don't need to be changed. They need acceptance. So I explained to him that autism makes his brain see things differently from others in the world and that it makes him  extra  special. I also explained that each one of us has traits that are different from others. We each have talents and we each have weaknesses. Autism or not. I spent the 1st few years of Luke's diagnosis desperately trying to cure him. Shame on me. Having Asperger's (mild form of autism) gives him incredible talents. Why would I want to cure that? Instead I want to spend my energy fighting to make the world know that  different is okay. As my friend's son so simply asked, \"Isn't autism part of my personality?\" He couldn't understand why I'd wear a shirt that wanted to  take down  who he is. This is a 9 year old. Amazing . Instead of  taking down  autism, I want to  take down  discrimination. I want my friend's son, our Luke, and all the other spectrum kiddos to know that they are loved and accepted for who they are . We don't want to change Luke and we certainly don't want to  take down  his autism. After all, we don't want to  take  down  Luke. We don't want to  take down  his amazing talents and perspective. He was put together and perfectly made. We don't doubt that for a minute. The power of words is mind blowing. And the insight and question from an introspective 9 year old, made me think harder than I have had to for a long time. I hope you think about it too. Much love, Perhaps I lack the flair of a Hollywood screenwriter in creating tenuous drama, but can you guess who the 9-year old boy is in her story?  Yes, it's J, my son.  I am so freakin' proud of that kid I could burst.  It's not like I have sat down with J and expounded on the social model of disability ... the kid has never even heard the word Neurodiversity.  Can't you see?  J's comments simply make me proud of his intent to carve out his own indivuduality.  That's it.  I'm damn proud of him and I'm absolutely thrilled that this amazing kid counts me as a member of his team.  I'm not so sure that this Dad has the gumption to return to blogging.  But I'll tell you this - while J's assertions (and my friend's resulting change in worldview) are most definitely not a  result  of any tangible outcome that has been created by the years and volumes and transcendent quality of those of us who have participated in the combined output of the Autism Hub, they sure as hell stand as  evidence  that our message rings sound and true. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://minivandiva.blogspot.com/2011/01/some-words-to-chew-on.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uXTynVmB5Qw/TSy6PQNx7sI/AAAAAAAABNo/crLrCPFD34M/s1600/DSC_0001.JPG"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2011/02/bit-rusty-very-roud.html", "title": "\nA Bit Rusty, Very Proud\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 27, 2009", "body": "\nThough I haven't had adequate time to organize my thoughts prior to writing a summary of the really great day we had at USD's Summer Autism Conference, I have to refer back to my write-ups of previous experiences there and arrive at the conclusion that only an  inadequate summary  is possible anyway.  To actually grab a hold of and present to someone who was not in attendance the overall tone of this conference would be exceedingly difficult. Fortunately, veteran Hub blogger Dad of Cameron (Do'C) has provided an excellent  blow-by-blow  of our 2-hour presentation, including links to some of the video and written media that we utilized in our presentation.   Do'C also added a palpable energy to the presentation that would be sorely lacking without his contribution. I couldn't be more pleased than to  count Bev as among my friends and allies, as she is quite simply one of the most elucidating people on the subject of autism that I have had the pleasure to encounter.  Bev gives of herself in many ways - far moreso than myself or Do'C - in terms of the personal commitment required to carry this all the way through.  I respect that immensely, and I think anyone who has seen Bev's presentations would agree that there is something -  a very nebulous, abstract something - that is pervasive during her presentation and that creates an intensity that is difficult to describe, but easy to buy into.  I think the word I am looking for here is ...  Honesty . Two amazing people that I am proud to be associated with. I want to extend a personal invitation to any new blog readers who may be visiting after seeing or meeting us at USD to shoot me an email or comment on this post if you would like any further information from our group beyond that which we talked about during the conference.    Please also look at the archives or maybe some of the \"Best of One Dad's Opinion\" on the right sidebar if you are interested in other things I have written. One SLT asked us during the panel presentation what resources may be available to get our message of dignity and respect to the group that she works with at her site, many of whom speak Spanish, Kumeyaay, or Filipino as their first language.  I mentioned the  Exceptional Family Resource Center  as one possibility for a local resource, and so have included a link to their website (click the underlined words).  I would take a personal interest in assisting the EFRC to archive and offer some of the resources that are available via the Autism Hub, if you choose to initiate this contact.  Stephen Hinkle also mentioned  Babelfish  as a posible resource for such families.  It also so happens that I am a passable Spanish speaker, and Do'C is quite fluent. I'd also like to thank, once again, conference organizer  Dr. Jodi Robledo  (whoe husband and infant daughter were also diligently spreading sunshine all around the conference environs) and , of course, Dr. Anne Donnellan.  Of Anne Donnellan I have often said before, she was \"ND\" before \"ND\" even knew itself existed.  Of the other presenters; among them Stephen Hinkle,  Martha Leary , Nan Negri,  Diana Pastora-Carson , Jacqui Thousand, and others - I simply can't say enough good things. Thanks also to Steven Kapp for his contributions, and also to Daniel Lightfoot from Autism Speaks - a research scientist who wanted to  - and I believe did! - learn some new things from the autism community that go far beyond cell behavior.  And to the teachers, administrators, SLTs, aide workers, and parents who took the time to attend the conference - thank you!  I hope you benefitted from the time invested and that you will recommend others attend this great conference in the future.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=344", "http://www.efrconline.org/", "http://babelfish.yahoo.com/", "http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ804824&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ804824", "http://www.abilityawareness.com/dnn/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/06/way-beyond-awareness.html", "title": "\nWay Beyond Awareness\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2009", "body": "\nAfter Tae Kwan Do class today - a sport in which both J (age 7) and T (age 6) have achieved their \"Camo belt\" status (which bugs me - I am a military history aficionado, and I'm making an educated guess that \"camo\" was not one of the color choices made by the originators of Tae Kwan Do).  T was snapping his side kicks and giggling during stretching as always, but J was clearly dragging tail throughout the session.  Physical fatigue did not seem to be an issue - his heart just wasn't in it today.  S'ok - kids are allowed to \"check out\" sometimes in This Dad's Opinion.  I'm not raising a Commando force, just a few kids. Moving to the point - after class I took the boys to Baskin Robbins.  Baskin Robbins throws J a little off his game since they  advertise  31 flavors but  sell  42 flavors.   I have to agree with J that the universe is slightly askance due to this unsettling factoid (a factoid that is rediscovered immediately upon every visit as J re-counts the flavor labels to make sure they  still  offer the  ridiculous  sum of 42 flavors).  But this time, on today's visit, there was no re-count.   J was thrown a curve-ball immediately upon entering the door.  You see, someone said, \"Hi, J\". J froze in place, clearly torn between counting the flavors and becoming  invisible .  He grabbed me around the thighs with both arms, looked up with an obvious and unabated look of bewilderment in his big eyes, and whisper-shouted, \"I don't know who that is.\" (Aside:  I must define the whisper-shout.  This is J's verbal channel that he deploys when he is trying to speak 'under his breath'.  The thing is, J doesn't modulate that very well and ends up over-compensating his voice volume to make up for the whisper-effect that prevents a voice from carrying distance.  So he winds up with a very loud, throaty whisper-shout that he honestly believes is only heard by the person he is oriented towards at that exact moment.)  The boy who accosted J (well, actually he only said 'hi') was sitting with, presumably, his Dad and older brother.  The boy was probably 9 or 10, the brother probably 18.  All in all, and leaving out some of the \"small talk\" that surrounded this fragmented interaction, they were a perfectly friendly bunch. I peeled J off my leg and encouraged him to pick a flavor.  He picked chocolate (no surprise there - read  this post  I wrote back in 2007 to see the consistency of J's taste for chocolate) and went to his favorite position of flipping through the B-R catalog to hone in on his favorite characters represented in the fashion-forward genre of frozen ice cream cakes. At one point he moved closer to the table with the boy who had said 'hi', and the same boy leaned over and said, 'J - you remember me!  From Vacation Bible School!\"  ( VBS was last week - not a long time ago )  J grabbed my hand and whisper-shouted to me \"I think I can't remember him.  I think he has different clothes!\"  Once I had paid up, I walked over to him and crouched down to have a \"man-to-man\" talk.   I said, \"J - on the way out of here, I want you to walk up to the boy who said 'Hi'.  I think you should tell him you are sorry you don't remember him, and thank him for saying hello.  The reason I think you should do this is because it is the polite thing to do. Do you agree?\"   \"Yes, Dad, I will.\" So we walked over to the door and the boy.  Jason grabbed on to me tight and whisper-shouted (the boy could definitely hear, as could everyone else around) \"I'm scared!\"  I told him he would do fine, and we could just leave if he wanted to but that he should try to be polite.  \"But I'm nervous!\" We stopped in front of the boy.  J looked at his feet and  whispered  - not whisper-shouted,  whispered  - \"I'msorryIdidn'trememberyouthankyouforsayinghello\" and we left.  The boy was responding, but we left in a hurry.  As we crossed the parking lot, I asked J if he felt like what he did was the right thing.  \"Yes\".  I asked if he felt better to have done it, even though it was hard to do.  \"Please don't ask me about that right now!\" was his reply.  Okay. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/08/autistic-superpowers-invisibility.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/07/awkward-moments-are-okay.html", "title": "\nAwkward Moments ...  are okay\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 18, 2009", "body": "\nI am a  very poor blogger these days.  Blogging requires somewhat of a repetitive tempo, and my internal blogging metronome has seemingly ground to a halt.  This despite a veritable wealth of fascinating goings-on in the microcosm of our family, and in the macrocosm of the autism community.  I feel like opportunity after opportunity to write some thoughts on things like the IACC, like the new movie  Adam , like the shutting down of fraudulent autism cure peddlers \" Care Clinics \", like some new and fascinating research and how people are incorporating its results, like so many other things. So why today?  Well, I've been shamed into it.  First, I notice that my friend Do'C has posted a new blog entry over at  Autism Street .  Next I notice that my friend Bev has done the same over at  Asperger Square 8 .  The three of us make up the triumvirate that has spoken several times to large audiences about blogging and autism, but here at One Dad's Opinion there was just the sound of crickets chirping.  Then, I log on to the good ol' Autism Hub and see a post by  Sharon  in which she names little ol' me as a guy who writes things about autism that she likes to read.  Okay, so when called out by \"Best Family Blog in Ireland\", one tends to want to respond.   So on to the point of this post, which is to describe a recent camping trip.  Here in our neck of the woods, we hang out with a group of 4 or 5 families on a regular basis.  When we all converge, as we recently did at a campground surrounding a few lakes here in SoCal last weekend, the tally comes to 10 adults, 13 kids.  23 of us (one family was absent this time due to a new baby arriving a few weeks ago).  Of the 13 kids, 5 have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum.  If you want to see a classic, moving, changing representation of the  topographical model of understanding the autism spectrum,  join us for a weekend sometime! This group, I'd like to mention, is NOT a support group.  This is a group of families who enjoy spending time together, no matter anyone's specific circumstances.  We are also a heterogenous group in terms of our views of autism etiology and treatment, and it matters not one whit.   So how, with this many different people of different ages and interests and, yes, neurological profiles, does one ensure that everyone is a \"Happy Camper\".  Easy answer:  One simply cannot.  But one can describe several circumstances of Happy Campers, as well as some simple and general observations, so here goes: In the campground's pool, my son J was doing his typical pool routine after playing with friends for a while.  He will break away from the group and just kind of \"be\" in the water.  This consists of swirling around, inverting himself, periodically floating and treading, eyes closed most of the time, tuning out minor nuisances and most noises (I think), and reveling in the weightlessness of being water-bound.  But this time, he had a silent and unintentional partner.  One of the other boy's Moms pointed out to me that her son, who is three years older than J and very similar to him in a lot of respects, was doing EXACTLY the same thing about 12 feet away.  Neither one seemed aware of the other, but their movements, and tempo, and intent seemed identical.  It was Autistic Synchronized Swimming. One of the boys, though he will never come right out and say it, is qualified at age 8 to be President of the Audobon Society.  Upon watching some ducks (apparently a newfound 'special interest' for Baby C) one Mom asked another what kind of duck was that peculiar one with black feathers and a white beak.  This boy, who was otherwise silent as he watched the ducks (and was keenly aware of all other surrounding wildlife) piped up and said, \"That is NOT a duck, but it IS a Fowl.  That is a  Western Coot .\"  Later as, he walked along side me in his trademark skip-step with windmill arms, he stopped and whacked my arm with his.  \"Look!  2 Grey Herons!\"  And he skipped off.  His identification abilities do not stop at birds - he intently studies any and all animal info he can and is an expert in recognizing virtually all birds, critters, and bugs in Southern California.  He is 8 years old. Several of the campers found great solace in enjoying some time around the campfire.  Some of these campers enjoyed cigars,  Black Bush whiskey , and a game of Dominoes.  These rare and elusive creatures are called DADS, and can be viewed in their natural habitat sometime after 11:00 p.m. One of our goals was to get J to learn how to ride a bike.  This he did, for at least 20 feet without anyone's assistance.  Hooray for J!  Physical coordination is not one of J's long suits (as I wrote about  here ).  Meanwhile, my middle son T quite literally drove his bike into the lake.   When I came along with Baby C strapped in behind me (and limited in my ability to react as a result of that), one Mom had jumped off her bike, and was diving in after T who at that point was just seen as a floating safety helmet.  She retrieved the child and the bike.  T, once he shook off the initial shock, turned to me and said - and I quote - \"That was AWESOME!\" Baby C likes ducks, Baby C likes water.  Baby C does not respond to his name very well when interested in other things.  Baby C will walk well over 100 yards without ever looking back to 'reference' Mom or Dad.  Baby C has the autistic child's trademark lack of a sense of \"danger\".  Baby C was watched very, very closely every minute of the time.  Baby C's parents, One Dad and One Mom, are looking forward to Baby C becoming plain ol' C.  The terrible two's started in our house 6 years ago and haven't stopped yet as the baton has been passed form child to child.  Do we get an award for all of this?  Oh yeah,  we did :) Ya know .. this wasn't so bad to get back at it.

{"date": "Saturday, August 1, 2009", "body": "\n Wow - we had a lively day around here today! Firstly, two of our boys - J and C - rode horses in the REINS \"Fun Day\" Horse Show.  REINS is where people with disabilities are able to ride horses in a supportive environment.  I've written a lot here on One Dad's Opinion about REINS, as it represents one of the gravitational centers of our family's community involvement and deserves much mention. This was J's fourth time riding in the \"Fun Day\" contest and C's first.   It's called \"Fun Day\", but the annual event that precedes REINS' monthly summer break in August groups the students together by skill level and judges their riding performance against each other.  Its all in good fun, and creates a tremendous sense of pride amongst the students (ranging from the youngest - Baby C, at 2 years old -  up to riders in their elderly years).  See  this post  for a look at their oldest rider, Millie.  She is 93 years old.  Wow. Of our boys, C was the first rider of the day.  He acquitted himself marvellously well, and brightened his own day and the rest of our days as well with  his bright smiles and obvious  affection for his horse and instructor. He was particularly impressive when completing the \"Round the World\" move that he always looks forward to. (Spare me the \"Horse's *ss\" jokes please...) C won the pink 5th place ribbon - we couldn't be more proud of him!. After C dismounted and we gathered around him to share the moment, J pointed to the ribbon pinned on C's chest and gave C a little nudge and said, \"Congratulations\".  Both Kaitlyn (the wonderful instructor for both our boys) and me overheard this and commented to Jason how nice it was for him to say that.  He very matter-of-factly  replied \"I was reading his ribbon actually.\"  All-righty. One could almost imagine C riding off into the sunset like John Wayne... So after a while waiting in the heat and dust, it was finally J's turn to ride with his group of 6.  This was a particularly exciting competition for J, since it would be the first time he would ride independently, without Kaitlyn holding the horse's lead.  He mounted up on trusty old Betsy, who he has been riding since day 1, and prepared for his turn. In a word: Success!   J completed the entire dressage routine without any assistance from Kaitlyn. Note in this picture the separation between J/Betsy and Kaitlyn - this is an independent performance.  Oh, and that look on J's face?  Nervous self-satisfaction.  J's excitement-meter was running very low today, so it is difficult to know how he felt upon completing his routine.  But when the ribbons were presented, all that changed.  J won first place and received a BLUE ribbon!  This is dually awesome as blue is J's favorite color - a preference that borders on obsession and influences a large array of J's decisions in life.  Blue rules J, and so you can imagine his elation at receiving the Blue Ribbon. One Dad even got to share the moment with him and Betsy.  What a great moment. After 3 hours of tramping around in the dusty, hot environs at REINS, what better way to cool down than a swim in the pool? NOT SO FAST!  Today, our pool had in interloper that had to be addressed before we could go in.  I bet you didn't know this post would include - Tarantula pictures! I realize it is difficult to grasp scale in a small internet picture, but this spider's body was about 3.5 inches long, with a full leg-span of around 6 inches.  Here he is walking along the edg e of the pool-skimmer I used to retrieve him from the water. Once we moved our hairy friend to a more spider-friendly neighborhood - ya know, somewhere other than our freakin' pool - we dove in to escape the summer heat.  One Mom and I are pleasantly surprised by C's progress in branching out his experiential tolerances.  But remember - autism consists of developmental  delay , not developmental  stasis  - so it should be no surprise that C is jumping in the pool now all by himself and generally having a rip-roaring time trying to keep up with his older brothers. That includes being thrown into the pool. Hey, give me a big sloppy dog and a smilin' 2-year old \"chunky monkey\" and I'm One Happy Dad. I hope you are all having a great summer like we are - and that you are not finding Tarantulas in your pool or anywhere else. Next week ...

{"date": "Friday, June 5, 2009", "body": "\nStrangely, for someone who has only sent a handful of text messsages and who is woefully unacquainted with the \"shorthand\" techniques widely used for that purpose, just such a phrase jumped to mind when titling this post. \"IRL\" means \"In Real Life\", and this post is to perhaps explain to ongoing as well as potentially new readers of One Dad's Opinion that life has been going full speed ahead despite my uncustomary lack of attention to the blog.  Writing this blog in many ways has been a transformative experience,  in that it creates a de facto personal journal, public (though shaded) record of the early years of our complex family, a window to One Dad's thoughts and how those thoughts shft and change over time, and a self-proclaimed cul-de-sac in the online neighborhood of autism parenting.  So I always end up regretting not dedicating the time to keeping up.  Apologies, and on with it then! Okay, so back to Real Life.  L (my lovely wife) and I were thrilled when, in the mail a few weeks ago, we received notice that we had been nominated for - and in actuality had won - an award for \" Excellence in Special Education \"!  Hooray for us!  Hooray for J!  Hooray for Baby C, who will be soon entering the selfsame system that has awarded us for our efforts!   I have written several times about our great school district on this blog -  here , for example, is a post from May 2007 detailing what seemed then to be (and indeed turned out to be) a successful IEP development process.  It provides a glimpse at the type of marvelous people we have had the pleasure to work with, as well as how we have approached the sometimes-contentious process of requesting services for J. As it turns out, the same Special Education Director has worked with us since the first day J was brought to the school system.  She was the one who nominated us and gathered a consensus from within the school district to present their case.  The award we won was for \"Collaborative Parents\".  Upon first being informed of this, the skeptical side of me was like \"so, collaborative means Pushover, right?\"  When I had some time to think about it, I realized that there is power in that word.  Collaboration is \"the act of working together, in unison' ... for a common goal.  Despite all the \"autism wars\" being fought on so many fronts out there, we had somehow found a groove in which our son's needs were best met through cooperative, mutually advantageous scenarios.   Upon receiving the award, I couldn't help but include in my brief words on stage (as L stood in the background, not at all comfortable in the spotlight) that this award really is for  her .  Look, I may write a decent blog post now and then, and autism advocacy has led me from  presentations at academic conferences  to  interviews on NPR,  but nothing I have ever done holds a candle to the work that my wife has done.  She is the one who built these strong bridges, she takes him to school everday, she has shared a zillion small successes with him that so many moms and sons would take for granted, she has helped him in more ways than I can invent to write about.  So here is One Dad's Opinion that One Dad's Son has One Great Mom.  And now?

You mean we\u2019ve come 100 miles for this momentous occasion, the first official visit from Joaquin\u2019s community support staff (the people who are going to take him away from all this madness and facilitate him having a real life, one with meaningful experiences, choices, and enjoyment) only to walk into a noisy, windowless room where a good-hearted, but clueless \u201cpsych tech\u201d actually boasts of Joaquin\u2019s ability to put large, colored, plastic pegs into a peg board for no apparent reason other than to seem productive and to be compliant? In this second millennium, the absurd and unbelievable scenario where a professional in the most highly funded state agency working with people with developmental disabilities offers a peg board to my brother, a 40-year-old man who loves walking, riding bikes, and socializing\u2026not peg boards, defies all reason.  In what seemed to be slow motion horror, I watched, and even encouraged Joaquin to sit down and try, knowing he would understand what I was doing and would forgive me as soon as we had humored his instructor.  I just wanted to get it over with and show a cooperative spirit so we could get the hell out of there. The poetic ending of this story is that Joaquin refused to perform the task.  He sat down at the table in front of the peg board, wrinkled his nose and looked at us as if to say, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d and then put his hand on his head as if fighting off a headache.  When prodded, he shook his head, clearly communicating that this was not his idea of fun\u2026or life.    \u201cOkay, Joaquin.  You\u2019re telling us that you don\u2019t want to do this.  It\u2019s okay,\u201d I assured him. It was actually great! But what if he HAD done it?  Would it have meant that he was content?  Or that he had finally grown to be compliant after endless years of \u201ctreatment.\u201d  Would it have meant that he wanted to live in an institution?  Or would it have meant that he knew no alternative? But he had not complied. Did Joaquin know that his act of committed defiance was the perfect metaphorical statement of empowerment?  Did he understand that he was actually saying, \u201cI am my own person and I want to live my own life?\u201d  Did he know the implications of his action?  In my mind, he understood, and he\u2019s a badass genius.

Last year, Ms. D'Nealian created an opportunity for  The Best Story Ever  and even sent  postcards  to our little guy.  This year, Ms. Potato continued the string of superior educators, and was integral in fostering an atmosphere of patience and respect for J in his first grade classroom.  Along with the help of J's classroom aide, Ms. Kathy, J had a good year in which he developed some friendships and had strong academic success. It is amazing to think I wrote about J's Preschool  graduation  here just two years ago, and now he has graduated first grade. J has a lot of struggles with transitions, and he was fully aware yesterday that the school year was coming to an end.  Even before we left the classroom, his eyes were misty and the corners of his mouth turned down as he anticipated the end of his time in Ms. Potato's class.  By the time we finished his afternoon session (and his little brother's too) at  REINS , and headed off to dinner, he was downright morose.  Not to worry - Ms. Potato is just a phone call away, and after a brief phone call J was feeling marginally better.  Today, J will write a letter to Ms. Potato - an exercise that always seems to help him sort and settle things out. Here is the message the Ms. Potato had for us parents.  If you had ever met this wonderful teacher, you'd know that she means every word of it. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/06/another-grade-another-great-teacher.html", "title": "\nAnother Grade, Another Great Teacher\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 25, 2009", "body": "\nAfter a 6 week hiatus from blogging, I am moved to write today by the stark contrast in emotions I experienced from two separate sources on the internet today. The first set of emotions were caused by  this despicable opinion piece  on the website Opposing Views.   Titled \"Its Time for an Abortion Pride Movement\", it is penned by one Jacob Appel, who claims to be a bioethicist.   After having my interest piqued by the title, it took me a few paragraphs of reading to realize that Mr. Appel  is not kidding .  He actually believes that aborting children's lives during pregnancy is not only perfectly acceptable from an ethical standpoint, but also something its participants should be proud of and build an identity around, much like being Irish or being gay.  Some excerpts, in case you would rather not read the article: \"In contrast to women who have foregone abortion, women who have chosen to terminate their pregnancies are rarely encouraged to take pride in their decisions. That is unfortunate.\" \"In the current political  climate , deciding not to bring a fetus to term, if a woman is unready to parent, or  if that fetus is likely to lead a life of great physical suffering , is a courageous and noble moral choice.\" (I added the bold emphasis above, simply to point out that many readers of this blog understand where this type of reasoning comes from and where, in turn, it leads). \"In short, women should not merely have the right to end unwanted pregnancies, they should have the right to be proud of having done so. Surely, there is enough suffering in this world already without adding infants with Tay-Sachs disease and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome to the mix.\" (I wonder where autism fits in this bioethicist's ( sic ) spectrum of suffering?) \"Our message should not be merely toleration or resigned acquiescence, but genuine joy that someone has made a decision for their own and  for the collective good .\" (There's that elitist mentality again.  Does the collective good include stopping an \"epidemic\"?  Does it factor in Special Education costs? ) I could go on at some length about the unbelievably bankrupt arguments this fool is putting forth about Abortion Pride, but it is not really necessary.  I think most readers will see where this type of reasoning leads.  And it certainly raises the spectre of the possibility that a prenatal \"Autism Test\", should one ever be developed, could lead people who support this type of thinking to opt for the abortion. And this leads to the other item I came across.  It is related from the standpoint of abortion's impact on the population of people with Down Syndrome.  I don't know the exact figures, but suffice it to say that prenatal detection of Down Syndrome has resulted in the deaths of huge numbers of unborn infants.  I would hope that misanthropes such as Mr. Appel of \"Abortion Pride\" infamy would consider learn a lesson in life from  simple, true stories such as this one. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.opposingviews.com/articles/opinion-it-s-time-for-an-abortion-pride-movement", "http://www.opposingviews.com/questions/is-global-warming-a-crisis", "http://www.stservicemovie.com/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/03/stark-contrast.html", "title": "\nA Stark Contrast\n"},

{"date": "Friday, April 17, 2009", "body": "\nAutism is a diagnosis made by observation.  Specific behavioral criteria are set forth in the DSM-IV-r and the ICD-10 that are used to define the disorder. It has been my experience as someone who has now met numerous autistic people of many ages and, more specifically, is a parent to two young autistic boys, that any attempt to boil down such a vastly complex thing as human behavior to a 12-point checklist is an exercise in futility.  At the same time, I respect the need to have a \"neutral\" description for autism that can be referenced universally. Autism, moreover, is  described now as a spectrum .  By definition, this means that the Autism Spectrum Disorders include Autism Disorder, PDD-nos, Asperger's Syndrome, CDD, and Rhett's Disorder.  I have come to recognize that 5 \"classes\" of ASD are probably not enough, though I think they satisfy clinical needs for the time being. What I have come to realize over time is that mini-spectrums exist within each category that is used to describe autism.   Here is the official list  of diagnostic criteria for Autism from the DSM. To illustrate my point, take item 1.a., which reads: \"marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal        behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression,        body postures, and gestures to regulate social        interaction\" In the case of my older son, this category would describe his former tendency to emphasize use of peripheral vision over direct gaze.  Or his habit of dropping small objects from his forehead down to the floor so they would rapidly pass through his field of vision.  To this day, he still points using his middle finger (awkward in western society to be sure).  He frequently touches people's faces to get their attention - a definite faux pas for someone over the age of 3 or 4.  My youngest son does none of these things.  Instead, he does things like walking with only one arm swinging in time with his gait.  Or always averting his gaze when he is handing something to you, but stares right at you all other times.  He regularly scrunches his cheek down towards his shoulder, his head askance.  Point being, there is a huge range of things that classify as item 1.a.  Exponentially apply that variance by a factor of 12, and you might begin to sense the range of autistic individuality. Which leads me to a story about my oldest son, J.   This story strikes me as a great example of how subtle, but at the same time stark, differences can be.  This specific instance relates to communication. J has armed himself with some pretty strong communication skills over time.  But one must at times set aside convention when understanding J's particular way of approaching things. Last week, my wife L was busy around the house when J approached her and tapped her on the shoulder.  \"What is it?\" she said. \"Did you hear something?\" cames J's reply. \"No - why, what do you hear?\" \"I think it sounds like Thump-Thump-Thump!\" Puzzled now, L asked him where he had heard that.  Where was it coming from? J poked rapidly at his chest.  \"I think its my heart.\" Mildly alarmed, L asked \"J, honey, is your heart thumping? Are you okay?\" \"I think its because I am nervous to tell you somefing.\" *Sigh*  \"What do you want to tell me?\" \"Well ..... tsk ....  well .... IthinkItouchedthechairanditkindoffelloverinthekitchen!\" L, of course, was relieved on several levels that this minor thing was the cause of J's guilt trip. Point being, this is a highly atypical and roundabout approach for a 7-year-old kid to take.  But it is J's particular way to do it, and we embrace that.  Time will tell how Baby C develops his own style of communication.  No doubt it will be other than typical.  Equally doubtless is that it will have his own personal stamp on it, and that we will strive to support him in his efforts to develop it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/overview_diagnostic_criteria.htm"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/04/forms-of-communication.html", "title": "\nForms of Communication\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 18, 2009", "body": "\nI am really interested in a rather unexpected (to me) and quite possibly major shift in the course of autism research funding and guidance that was announced today. The Autism Science Foundation  launched its existence  and posted a  website  today, amidst significant media hoopla and statements made by several important directors and members. You will, of course, see numerous analyses of this new development over the next few days and weeks.  Here's mine:  I hope they dedicate themselves to research with tangible benefits to autistic people today and in the future.  The people involved (founding members?  Board of Directors?) could not be a more interesting ensemble.  I find a lot to like, and frankly an equal amount that makes me nervous. Begin with Allison Tepper Singer, the former Executive Vice President of monolithic autism charity Autism Speaks, who co-founded the new org with Karen London, formerly of NAAR. Ms. Tepper-Singer uttered one of the most notorious lines heard in autism documentary film history when she expressed her urge to drive herself and her daughter off the George Washington bridge - with her daughter in the room with her.  This, as some will recall, was an early rallying point of the Autism Hub itself - a galvanizing moment that some of the original Hubbers might tell you went a long ways towards cementing the Hub's eventual activist-style approach to controversial issues.  Allison Tepper-Singer left Autism Speaks last fall over a hubbub relating to an IACC vote over funding vaccine research.  She stated that her intent to vote against further research in that area clearly opposed the will of the powers-that-be at AS, and resigned as a matter of principle.  The new org's initial media statements assert a continuation of that foundational belief:       The Autism Science Foundation's mission is premised on the following facts and principles: Autism is known to have a strong genetic component. Research must aim to discover the mechanisms of action that trigger autism, as well as safe, effective and novel treatments to enhance the quality of life for children and adults currently affected. Early diagnosis and early intervention are critical to helping people with autism reach their potential, but educational, vocational and support services must be applied across the lifespan. Science has a critical role to play in creating evidence-based, effective lifespan interventions.  Vaccines save lives; they do not cause autism. Numerous studies have failed to show a causal link between vaccines and autism. Vaccine safety research should continue to be conducted by the public health system in order to ensure vaccine safety and maintain confidence in our national vaccine program, but further investment of limited autism research dollars is not warranted at this time. I agree with the entirety of that triumvirate of statements, though they do fall short of covering the full range of things I'd like to see flow from our scientific community for autistic people.  Its a heck of a start, though, and provides a spectrum (ahem) of goals that can be worked towards. Also on the Board of Directors is one Dr. Paul Offit.  I was extremely pleased to see Dr. Offit's inclusion with this new science group, as he has certainly earned his stripes in the vaccine-autism conflict and has emerged as a knowledgeable leader with great perspective on the science, the media's interpretation of the existing science, and the (quite frankly) dark nature of the more extreme anti-vaccination autism activists.  Dr. Offit's book, \"Autism's False Prophets\" should be required reading for all young parents worrying over vaccinating their kids, for parents of young autistic children who may be considering some of the more dangerous, bizarre, or expensive snake-oil treatments sold as autism cures these days, and for any and all members of the medical and treatment communities that relate in any way to vaccines or autism.  Furthermore, Dr. Offit's inclusion, as well as the bold and direct vaccine-related statements made by the Foundation, provide clear focus for their donors and decision-makers, eliminate the political minefield that is vaccine/autism debate, and further marginalizes Generation Rescue (a group that doesn't seem to stay on the fringe despite its junk science and vulgar set of personalities). Further perusal of the  Leaders  of the Foundation turn up some other very interesting names. Catherine Lord  is considered to be perhaps the pre-eminent expert in autism diagnostic issues.  She is the developer of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS) which is the most well-supported diagnostic tool currently used.  Interestingly, she is (or has recently) released an ADOS-I for infants.  When my son Baby C was diagnosed back in August at age 19 months he just missed the release of the ADOS-I.  Harold Koplewicz  is well-known around these (Autism Hub) parts for his leadership role in the Ransom Notes campaign, which was utterly despicable.  It took tremendous media pressure for him to accede that the campaign was misguided and harmful, but ultimately he did just that.  At the time, I recall feeling stunned, in that he essentially owned up to a mistake that totalled  probably to the tune of several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  He then initiated a series of town-hall meetings to hear more from the ND community - in coordination with Ari Ne'eman as I recall.  I'd like to hear from Ari as to what he thinks we might expect from Dr. Koplewicz' involvement with the Foundation. At the risk of downplaying their obvious strong credentials, I'll omit going into detail on each of the other members.  Suffice it to say that I am just fascinated looking at the group that has been assembled, and I feel they have established an extremely strong group to help guide research. Bottom line, folks, is that autism research is a rushing river these days.  It is a strong current forced between two steep banks forming a very, very narrow channel of success.  As I have grown weary over the past few years of watching the constant grind that is the vaccine-autism war and its resulting removal of resources towards truly benefitting autistic people (especially those needing more assitance than my own children), I can only begin to guess at the frustration felt by well-meaning researchers, science leaders, and most importantly autistic people and their loved ones.  Here is One Dad's Opinion - no, hope! -  that the Autism Science Foundation is successful at navigating that narrow channel.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/04/prweb2333904.htm", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/leadership.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/04/strong-current-narrow-channel.html", "title": "\nStrong Current, Narrow Channel\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 26, 2009", "body": "\nI am a supporter of the concept of Neurodiversity as I understand it.  After a few years of striving to improve my working knowledge and understanding of autism, I think I have a pretty good grip on this concept.  I can assure you that my understanding of Neurodiversity varies significantly from the ideological strawmen extended by ND's detractors.  Perhaps the most common such strawman is the one that roughly states \"The Neurodiversity crowd will have you believe that autism is simply 'beautiful' and that we should do nothing to mitigate any challenges for autistics since it is, in their view, just part of their personality or something\".  This, of course, is patently wrong. I am a supporter of the concept of Neurodiversity and I fully acknowledge the challenges and negative aspects that can and, in many cases, do plague autistic people.  In a radio broadcast to 10's of thousands of Southern Californians, I was asked about this and answered the same way I am answering here.  In presentations to audiences at the University of San Diego Autism Institute, I have made the same statements.  Where am I going with this?  Well, I read an essay today.  A really powerful, deeply disturbing essay.  And after I read it, I couldn't help but think to myself how quickly the knives would be drawn by the ND detractors out there after reading it.   The Monster Inside My Son Above is a link to the essay, penned by Patricia Ann Bauer for Salon.com.  In it, Ms. Bauer bares her soul and describes a shift from the type of mentality I currently espouse and write about and talk about (in her own words:  \"For years I thought of his autism as beautiful and mysterious. But when he turned unspeakably violent, I had to question everything I knew.\")  If you are autistic, or if you love someone who is, brace yourself before reading this.  But please do read it. You see, it is fairly easy to predict the outcry once this essay makes the rounds.  From the ' vaccines cause autism ' crowd over at, for example, Age of Autism, there will be a cry of \"Hurry up and cure your kids now before they become raving lunatics!  Just click on our sponsors tab and order enough vitamin supplements and natural chelators to save your family!\"  Don't believe me?  They've already done this,  just last week . From the ' autism is horrible and don't dare try to tell me otherwis e' camp, you might see a reaction that tries to paint Ms. Bauer's experience as the inevitable endgame for \"shiny happy people\" parents like me who simply refuse to give in to the rhetoric revolving around how devastating autism inevitably is.   You might see a call for us to pull our head out of the sand and acknowledge that our lives really have been demolished by having autistic kids.  You will of course see the tired, old accusation that we are neglectful in not treating our kids!  All of this is incongruous when oriented towards people like me and just about every parent-advocate I know who identify with the neurodiversity concept, all of whom carefully guide their children through various forms of available therapies, supports, and services in an effort to provide the best possible outcome for their kids. Guess what?  Nothing always works.  This is a powerful, overriding message that I get from Ms. Bauer's essay.  Was her son provided adequate supports, services, love and affection?  I think it is a pretty sure guess that yes, he did, judgng by Ms. Bauer's long standing record as an admired and knowledgeable disability advocate and her very clearly expressed affection for her son.  In her own words, \"It happened no matter how fiercely I loved him or how many therapies I employed.\"  It is chilling to me to read the following, \"Andrew started life as a mostly typical child. But at 3 and a half he become remote and perseverative, sitting in a corner and staring at his own splayed hand. Eventually he was diagnosed with high-functioning autism, a label that seemed to explain everything from his calendar memory and social isolation to his normal IQ ... We got him into a good program and there was a  brief, halcyon phase  of near normalcy -- a time I long for still so ardently that I feel hungry for it at a cellular level ... I occasionally even referred to him as 'cured'.\"  Chilling because this could be one of my sons.  We have used the sam terminology at times for both boys, saying to ourselves on some days, \"Gosh, its almost like he's 100% typical\". Then there are the days that one comes home with clothes destroyed from cutting them, or chewing them.  Little outburts of anger that, when asked about, are simply answered in a low, monotone voice \"Why do you ask me about that I don't want to answer that.\"  Or my youngest, who we jokingly referred to as \"The World's Angriest Baby\" prior to our understanding of how his neurological development was affectng the way he dealt with us and his surroundings.  He is a little force of nature, to be sure. So there you have it.  A \"neurodiverse\" dad, expounding on the difficulties that autism can entail, the fears that we have as the future seems less far away than it used to.  And all this in response to a poised, respected autism advocate who has been rocked and brought to her knees in the last few weeks and months by the tragic changes experienced by her son. I am not attempting to advance the concept that autistics are more likely to become violent, not am I trying to create fear that this type of outcome is inevitable in some individuals.  I am simply stating that gut-wrenching descriptions of problems such as the one on the linked essay have a powerful and essential role in helping to form my view of the many potential challenges that lie ahead for my own sons and all autistic people out there.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2009/03/26/bauer_autism/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/the-sky-is-falling-autistic-boy-arraigned-in-mothers-murder.html#more", "http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/07/19/fargo/index.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/03/challenging-beliefs.html", "title": "\nChallenging Beliefs\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 25, 2008", "body": "\nI just read a mind-bendingly offensive  post by pop-journalist David Kirby  over at the Huffington Post.  This guy has some serious gall to write such things as: \"It serves to remind us all that, no matter what \"causes autism,\" no matter what, if anything might \"cure\" it, children affected by the disorder deserve all of the honor, love and patience that we, a nation consumed by our own attention deficits, can muster.\" or \"They deserve more than our compassion, our love and our dollars. They deserve our respect.\" What, you may ask yourself, is so wrong about these statements?  Well, by their own right, nothing at all.  The rub lies in the dissonance between the source and the content.  In other words, David Kirby has utterly no business taking on the mantle of \"let's respect autistic people\" at this point.  Has any single person done more to damage the likelihood of positive outcomes for autistic people in our society today?  Let's review exactly what David Kirby has done for autistic people since Evidence of Harm was published in 2005: *He has helped to turn the conversation away from \"how do we help autistic folks at all ages to thrive?\" and pointed it towards \"where do we direct our anger that autistic people exist?\". *He has, through his sensationalist, wildly accusatory book created a pocket of conspiracy theorists in the autism community.  A few certainly must have existed before he came along, but he (along with Andrew Wakefield) is the one that brought the anti-vax/toxic child brigade.  An example of how bad it has gotten lately on the internet:  One person - who is perhaps the most frequent commenter on virtually every site I visit that discusses autism - is not related in any way to the autism community.  He is not autistic, is not a parent of autistic children, is not a researcher or physician who works in the field, is not a therapist, nothing (much like David Kirby, come to think of it).  What he is, is an anti-vaxxer who was drawn to the autism community due to the controversy created, in part, by David Kirby.  This illustrates that fact that Kirby's influence on the autism community has  nothing to do with autism , and has everything to do with creating controversy.  *He has, through his promotion of the completely false notion that autism somehow resembles mercury poisoning (it doesn't), even created a whole new set of terminology with which people can refer to autistics.  He even mentions one in this post, \"...there is some talk about vaccines, environmental toxins and 'damaged kids.'\"  Yup, that's right -  damaged kids .  Pardon my French, but thanks a lot, a**hole.  My kid is not damaged, despite your honeyed tongue convincing thousands of parents that their kids are. *He has, by influencing a change in the national dialogue about autism, helped to create a situation where funding must be dedicated to grasping after theories long-since discredited.  Not only with regards to Hg=autism, but also with MMR=autism.  You see, we live in a world with limitations.  Among these limitations are funding limitations.  When a given community has a finite amount of dollars that can be used for research and direct support, then resources must be budgeted.  Ideally, they will be budgeted towards areas that will be of most immediate and direct benefit to autistics through research, treatment, and occupational/educational/functional supports.  Not so in the autism community, where we continue to throw good money after bad with call after call for more research into the mercury/vaccine causation theory.  *He has caused good parents to go after each other's throats by causing the focus in the autism community to rest on causation.  A brief visit to the  Autism Speaks message board  will provide you all the evidence you need for this.  I myself have dusted it up a bit over there, nothing I am proud of to be sure.  Please note, while you visit there, that within the \"Autism Science\" category,  12 of the most recent 20 topics directly discuss either vaccines or mercury.  For contrast, see in the sidebar of this blog - under \"Autism SagePub Feed\" - how many other areas of research can and must happen in the field of autism.  In the \"Autism in the News\" category,  also 12 of the most recent 20 posts focus on vaccines and/or mercury.  For contrast, read the  Autism Hub  to see essay after essay, day after day, discussing all kinds of news items that have nothing to do with vaccines or mercury.  *He has spurred on the growth of the DAN! movement, with all of its unregulated AltMed practices and complete lack of ethical or professional oversight (read more about specific DAN! practitioners  here) .  I would argue that DAN! has done more harm than good, when one factors in a family's time and money as an \"opportunity cost\".  In other words, even the treatments that do nothing are not copacetic. So here we have a guy who has just one \"inroad\" to the autism community - that he wrote a widely discredited book about a failed causation theory about autism.  And yet here he is, again, opportunistically using the debut of \"Autism: The Musical\" documentary on HBO to get his name back in the discussion.  But now the  Doppleganger  tries to take on the mantle of peacemaker.  He comes out with lines such as: \"Here, I hope, is a movie that everyone can watch and appreciate.\" and \"This all-too-real movie lifts the heart up and then slams it right back down on the pavement -- and we love every minute of it.\" But his true colors belie his ability to conceal them.  Throughout his post, he peppers the reader with his real view of autism - something to be held at arm's length, something that may actually produce a good feeling amidst a sea of anguish and despair.  And, stunningly, he now takes the tactic that if kids are not as he describes them, maybe - just maybe - they aren't autistic at all.  Observe: \"Others might worry that the portraits of the two high functioning boys -- so bright and charismatic you want to hang out with them for hours (though their peers shun them into a lonely world of their own) --  will leave the mistaken impression that most children with autism are like this.  If they were, then the epidemic might be slightly less painful to bear.\" (emphasis mine) or \"Please watch this film: You will be treated to an achingly accurate portrait of  what autism is, isn't, and can be. \" (emphasis mine) \"Divide and conquer!\" once spoke Julius Caesar.  Apparently David Kirby was listening. Only JC was building empires, while DK was just selling a book. One last breathtakingly offensive remark David makes that cannot escape notice; \"Sadly, however, most kids with autism are more than just a little \"quirky.\" And as much as we truly adore all the children in this film, few, if any parents of \"typical\" kids could honestly say, 'I wish my child were like that.'\" So, for my autistic readers, in case you haven't been kicked in the proverbial teeth enough times by people like this , here's a final blow by this guy that tells you that we should all feel sad about you being more than just quirky, and that parents of typical kids sure are glad you don't belong to them. If I could apologize for David Kirby, I would.  In the meantime, consider me a proud member of the autism community and a proud father of a son who is not damaged and does not make me sad.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/hbo-and-autism-perfect-t_b_93291.html", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/community/forums/index.php", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/dan-doctors.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/03/leopard-cannot-change-his-spots.html", "title": "\nA Leopard Cannot Change His Spots\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 16, 2007", "body": "\nIn another fascinating glimpse at his relentless attempts to attack and degrade anyone who identifies with the concept of Neurodiversity, Harold Doherty has recently expounded upon the evils to be found at the National Autistic Society. In their own words, \"The National Autistic Society provides a wide range of services across the four nations for people with autism, their parents, carers and the professionals who work with them.\" So why is the NAS under attack by a prominent autism advocate in Canada? Because of this  article  in the Independent. In it, a parent of an autistic child - one who aligns herself with Treating Autism, a \"rival organization\" according to the Independent article - casts disdain upon the NAS for their attempts to promote public awareness of autism via the recent \"Think Differently About Autism\" Campaign. Please read the full article for details on what the journalist feels lie at the heart of the debate. So, in classic form, Harold Doherty saw an opportunity to use this article as a means to attack \"Neurodiversity\". From his post on the topic: \" In the United Kingdom parents fighting to help their autistic children overcome the deficits of their autism disorders, fighting to help their children as all parents do, face opposition from a National Autistic Society ...\" and \"...saying that society should change how it views autism will not help those autistic children who need help for the more serious symptoms of autism, a neurological disorder.\" and \"Neurodiversity ideologues are not human rights advocates. They are in fact suppressing the human rights of autistic children...\" Fascinating stuff. Here's the thing - Harold once again is walking away from his own stated beliefs - that people who have Autism Disorder should be supported by Evidence-based treatments/interventions - because of the expediency of being able to use this platform (the Independent article) to launch another attack on Neurodiversity. Perhaps someday Harold could clarify exactly who \"Neurodiversity\" is, as the group seems to grow all the time by his definition (The NAS involves over 100,000 people). Harold, by supporting this particular pair of people and the group they represent - praising them as \"Autism Heroines\" - is supporting a group that endorses numerous biomedical treatments that are backed by no evidence. This group also fails to endorse any behavioral treatments, including ABA which Harold claims is the Gold Standard in Evidence-based autism treatments. This  link  shows the list of treatments endorsed by Treating Autism, the organization that includes \"Autism Heroines\" Lara Hawkings and Sally Eva. Does this look like an Evidence-Based Approach to you? This page includes such gems as Chelation, \"Gut Bug Treatments\", and a link to Lupron Protocol (look under \"New and Promising!\"). To make matters even worse, Harold does a follow-up  post  that features a quote from one of the \"heroines\" mentioned in the first post. One line from that quote is: \"The NAS employs people with autism so it is over-influenced by those at the mildly affected, employable end of the spectrum. \" Maybe its just me, but I think this person is clearly indicating that the NAS employing autistic people is a  bad thing . Can she be serious? Maybe I am jumping to conclusions, though. Maybe what she is really saying is that its ok for the NAS to employ autistic people, as long as they shut up. Amazing. So let's review how many  strawman  arguments and self-contradictions Harold Doherty can perform in the brief span of two short posts: \"In the United Kingdom parents fighting to help their autistic children overcome the deficits of their autism disorders, fighting to help their children as all parents do, face opposition from a National Autistic Society which has drunk deep from the kool aid of the neurodiversity 'movement'.\" Here, Harold offers the strawman that 'Promoting Autism Acceptance' = 'Opposition to Helping Children'. \"In the UK the National Autistic Society has adopted the \"autism is beautiful\" ideology and frowns upon parents like Lara Hawkings and Sally Eva who fight to help their own children overcome and recover from the sometimes debilitating deficits of their neurological disorder.\" Strawman: That not supporting unproven biomedical treatments for autism equates to 'frowning upon' parents who pursue these treatments for their kids. \"Neurodiversity ideologues are not human rights advocates. They are in fact suppressing the human rights of autistic children; their right to be treated for their neurological disorders. And they are suppressing the rights of parents to help their own children.\" The fallacy here is that biomedical interventions are a legitimate treatment for neurological disorders. Also found here is a contradiction to Harold's stated beliefs that only Evidence-based treatments should be considered. His profile on his blog states: \"Evidence based treatment, education and residential care by properly trained service providers are required to help the 1 in 150 persons who have an autism spectrum disorder.\" Nothing there about Low-dose Naltrexone or Urecholine. \"...NAS should be ashamed of itself for imbibing this topsy turvy ideology and for helping suppress the human rights ... of autistic children in the UK.\" Ok, I don't even know how to classify this ludicrous statement.  The NAS is helping to suppress the human rights of autistic children in the UK.  How?  By asking people to take some time to improve their understanding of autistic people? (From the comments section) \"Anecdotal evidence is evidence, it is just not as strong as other forms of evidence. An evidence based approach looks at the various types of evidence in support of an intervention and ranks them according to the quality of the evidence with anecdotal ranking very low.\" This is where Harold begins to realize that the position he has taken over the years - that Evidence-based treatments are the only way to go - creates a trap for him. How can he attack Neurodiverse-associated scientists who oppose bogus biomedical treatments due to their lack of evidence since he also opposes such treatments? The statement I just quoted answers that question. So this one falls under self-contradiction. (From Comments)\"The real issue with NAS v parents, and it is a general issue between neurodiversity generally and many parents, is whether treatment and cure should be sought for autistic children at all.\" Okay, this is the ultimate strawman. In this one, Harold claims that ND advocates believe that no treatment, intervention, or support is appropriate for autistic people. I can't believe people still hold on to this one. Please, will someone show me somewhere, anywhere, that anyone having anything to do with Neurodiversity has made this statement? Even if you were to find one instance, which I doubt, I could offer hundreds of instances where people have said the opposite. This is one argument that has worn awfully thin. (From comments)\"ABA is an effective intervention based on the quantity and quality of the research although it is not a cure.\" Another contradiction, in that Harold has held up as \"heroines\" two people who support an organization that has nothing to do with ABA promotion or discussion. It is strictly a biomedical group. The NAS, on the other hand, has information about ABA  right there  on their website. So how does Harold justify supporting Treating Autism over the NAS? (From comments)\" Neurodiversity advocates, including NAS, oppose attempts to treat or cure autistic children.\" Whoops! There's that silly argument again. And, finally, Harold says of this quote that it \"...summarizes nicely one of the most intense points of discussion in world autism debates:\" \"The NAS employs people with autism so it is over-influenced by those at the mildly affected, employable end of the spectrum.\" As I stated above, this is a deplorable statement. Harold, as an autism advocate, is being highly self-contradictory for supporting it. Wow. Normally I am a pretty soft-spoken blogger who does not get too deeply involved in blog wars. But when I read this nonsense from Mr. Doherty, well, some things you just can't take sittin' down, as they say.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.independent.co.uk/health/article3166420.ece", "http://www.treatingautism.ik.com/", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2007/11/real-autism-argument.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1390"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/11/contradictions-and-strawmen.html", "title": "\nContradictions and Strawmen\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 27, 2008", "body": "\nIn keeping with the style of an  earlier post  of the same bent, here is a summary of how the D's spent our day.  Everything I put on this list is true. Today, I breakfasted on a homemade fruit salad of Kiwi, Mango, and Nectarine with a squeeze of Lime.  I gave Baby C (14 months old) a taste of Kiwi and watched a transformation from normal baby to Kiwi-jonesing baby before my very eyes.  He loved it so much, I won't be surprised if his first words have a New Zealand accent. Today, I drove over 120 miles. Today, I watched a calico cat traverse a tightrope approximately 40 feet long and approximately 30 feet off the ground, all to the theme song of \"Jump!\" by Van Halen. Today, I listened to J in the backseat repeat the phrase \"All Hail Plankton\" for about 7 or 8 minutes.   Plankton , most commonly recognized as a drifting organism that inhabits the pelagic zone of the ocean and is a key component of the oceanic food chain, also happens to be the nefarious (though tiny) arch-villain in Spongebob Squarepants' world.  Try sitting in Southern California traffic and listening to \"All Hail Plankton\" in chant-like monotone to test your sanity sometime. Today, I devised a plan - with the help of a local carpenter/contractor - to possibly rebuild a workshed on our property.  This outbuilding was partially crushed when an ancient California Coastal Live Oak tree collapsed on it last year.  With a new wall, a new roof, some window coverings, and a coat of paint we could have ourselves a nice new shed. Today, I brought home to my wife her very favorite treat - peanut butter/dark chocolate ice cream from our tiny local ice cream parlor.  We all deserve a treat sometimes. Today, I spent a few minutes hoping that a shipment was going smoothly for one of my best customers.  I am on vacation  this week, and pre-arranged a large, important order for a wedding in Arkansas.  It consisted of over 1200 stems of Tulips and French Tulips in pinks and whites, along with  Asparagus Myerii  and white roses.  If anyone reading this likes flowers and wants to know more about the business, check out  The Human Flower Project .  I have been in contact with them about doing some writing contributions.  Its a really good blog/interest site. Today, I introduced my boys to the musical genius of  Rage Against the Machine .   Some may disagree with me (most?), but I think this band is artistically and technically among the best I've ever heard.  Despite their ear-crunching sound (hey, its an acquired taste!). Today, I watched a young girl of about 7 years old perform a rendition of \"We Are Family\" by the Pointer Sisters, complete with over-emoted arm movements and a seemingly fully choreographed spins and hip-swings.  This done on a raised platform of a Jungle Gym, and the only audience (besides me sitting at a distance, unnoticed) was my middle son T.  He was enthralled. Today, J won an Orca that he named Shamu and a Dolphin that he named Miss Dolphin.  T, on the other hand, won a Penguin that he gave as a gift to his Mom.  He also won a Manta Ray that he gave to Baby C.  He's a sweet kid. Today, I sank 63 of 100 free throws.  On the last one, I was imagining myself dropping the winning basket to advance University of San Diego to the Sweet 16.  I bet no one's ever imagined  that  before, right? Today, I opted for the Caesar Salad instead of the Slow-Roasted Beef Sandwich.  Good for me, bad for my taste buds. Today, I had a late dinner.  I took the opportunity of eating alone to start Children of Hurin (by JRR and Christopher Tolkein).  I've been wanting to read this book as a way to continually feed my utter fascination with the world that sprung forth from the mind of Tolkein.  He is a literary treasure, in my opinion. Today, J waited in lines for the first time without a \"disability pass\" allowing us/him to enter an attraction without waiting.  I think it is a good step, though I fully support that accommodation for those who need it. Today, I fed a Dolphin by dropping fresh fish in his/her mouth.  Ever felt a Dolphin?  They feel like hard-molded rubber, not unlike a really smooth tire. Today, I drove by two of my old College residences.  One was in the \"Dogpatch\" near campus, the other was in Mission Beach.  Very nostalgic.  Instead of me and my punk friends driving by, it was older me and my great kids. Today J and T and I unsuccessfully tried to find the  \"Sunny Jim\" Cave  in La Jolla.  Next time, we'll find it.  Today, I am going to finish the night by watching  No Country For Old Men .  I am drawn to this movie due to the fact it was written by Cormac McCarthy, whose \"The Road\" I recently read.  \"The Road\" is one of the bleakest, most difficult novels I've read.  McCarthy gives substance to emptiness, if that's possible.  Therefore, I expect  No Country For Old Men  to be of the same vein. Today, I prepped tomorrow's dinner as follows:  Mince together onion, garlic, basil, pancetta, dried oregano and marjoram, olive oil.  While continuing to mince, add some Balsamic Vinegar.  Once you create a paste, take a while chicken and butterfly it.  Stuff paste under all the skin, then rub remaining paste on the outside of the skin.  Refrigerate overnight.  Tomorrow, I'll arrange it on a pan surrounded by baby Yukon Gold Potatoes.  I'll drizzle Balsamic over all, then a sprinkle of Sea Salt.  Bake until crispy.  Meantime, steam some cauliflower partway.  Saute Red Onion in olive oil, then add and brown the cauliflower florets.  Add some lemon rind and black pepper and serve with the chicken.  Its a meal fit for a Tuscan prince!  (And here I give a shout out to new Hub bloggers - the  Buongiovannis!   Benvenuto, Angelo e familia!) Today, I realized that my life is less and less resembling what I thought it was going to when we received J's autism diagnosis.  This realization runs concurrently to little signs we are seeing in Baby C - just enough to keep us on our toes and watching and wondering...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton_%28SpongeBob_SquarePants%29#Sheldon_J._Plankton", "http://www.humanflowerproject.com/", "http://www.ratm.com/", "http://www.inetours.com/San_Diego/Images/LaJolla/Sunny-Jim_5981.jpg", "http://www.montag.it/theratrace/archives/2008/03/28/i-barbari-a-barbania/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/03/another-day.html", "title": "\nAnother Day\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 11, 2008", "body": "\nThis is the second installment of  Snippets . Two posts on the Autism Hub today reminded me of the topic of speech, of the sometimes fleeting nature of speech and autism.  My son, though definitely a late-bloomer in the speech category, has really come a long way in his ability to talk.  Not only is he overcoming some of the mechanical hurdles to speech, but also he is perpetually becoming more comfortable with using speech to interact in typical circumstances.  His little brother, by comparison, is light-years beyond him in speech development despite being 14 months younger.  But in all, Jason is quite pleased with his ability to use his words to interact with those of us who share his space. As in the first post, I think when having some fun talking about 'Snippets' of speech, it is important to consider other perspectives on the speech issue as it relates to autistic people.  Here, then, are two very interesting posts that hit the Autism Hub today on the very same topic. Adam and Estee Bev Here, then, are some snippets heard recently around the D household: Licensing Issues We have a wonderful puppy in our house.  His name is Marley.  One must only glance at some  pictures of Marley  to know that he is the cutest puppy the world has ever known. Those pictures were taken in July, when Marley was about 4 months old.  Now, Marley is close to 11 months old.  Still a puppy, right?  Yes, if you consider  90 pound  dogs to be puppies.  And still growing... Back on subject, Jason has a thing about Marley.  In Jason's opinion, Marley is good from afar, but far from good.  Its a love/hate thing.  Sometimes Jason can have fun with him and sometimes you'll even catch them laying together while Jason reads a book.  But most of the time the big puppy is a bit too rambunctious for Jason.  When this happens, Jason grabs the \"short leash\" (a 18\" rope attached to Marley's collar for training purposes) and leads Marley to the nearest adult.  The dog, knowing what the boy is attempting, fights him all the way which kind of pisses Jason off.  So the other day, Jason led Marley over to me and tried to put the short-leash in my hand.  \"Take him!\", Jason says. I told him that, \"No, you need to learn to play nicely with Marley and I can't always take Marley away when you are not playing well together.  You need to learn to play together!  Marley is our dog, not just my dog.  He is your responsibility too!  Try some of the commands we've taught you.\"  Jason, looking rather peeved with me, dropped down to his knees.  He grabbed Marley's collar in his hand and fiddled for the tag, focusing as best he could while our elephantine puppy twisted and slobbered and danced in place and I watched him wondering what on earth he was trying to accomplish.  Once he had successfully grabbed the tag,  he turned it to the other side and read the words, \"Steve D......   the license says you.  Your license.  Your dog!\"   So, I guess Marley is  my  dog now. Life in a Fishbowl I have occasionally mentioned how great the various therapists have been that have worked with Jason over the last few years.  Jason's current helper is no exception, and even took the time to see the  Autism Hub presentation  last month. One of Jason's former helpers, who remains, like the others, a good friend of our family, gave Jason's little brother a fish for his birthday (is there a pet theme running through this post?)  Tony is a bright blue Betta fish.  Actually, he is staring at me at this exact moment. It is Tyler's responsibility to feed Tony and provide whatever TLC is necessary to sustain the emotional needs of a fish (not much, to be sure). One night after all other D clan members were asleep, Jason and I were still hanging out.  I believe this was one rare night that we forgot to give Jason his melatonin (see  recent study ), so he was going to be lively for a while despite bedtime having come and gone a while before.  So while I am catching up on some reading, he is busy cutting some paper with his safety scissors.  He eventually comes to me with a cutout.  He holds it out to me, as if to say \"Behold what I have created!\"  I think to myself, \"Wow, what a remarkably amorphous blob of paper.  I wonder what it is?\"  Jason wastes no time in telling me that it is ...........  Tony the fish! \"Great job!\"  I say.  \"That's one spectacular rendition of Tony.  Did you show it to him?\"  So Jason trots off, presumably expecting to show Tony his paper counterpart.  Next thing I know, I hear water running in the other room.  Being a parent of three young'uns, I am attuned to the sound of unexpectedly running water.  So I drop my book and dash in the other room. Jason has grabbed a bowl, placed Tony inside, and filled the bowl with water.  That's pretty cool!  He made a fishbowl!  So he then asks me for some fish food.  I declined, saying that the food was for the other Tony.  No, Jason, indicated by grabbing the scissors and cutting in short bursts.  I had it all wrong, his actions told me.  As his little clips resulted in small, confetti-like paper bits accumulating on the counter I realized his plan.  Paper fish eat paper food.  He was making fish food! When my wife found Tony's pulpy remains in his watery grave the next morning, she must have been wondering what the he** we do after 10:00 at night. Clues But that's not the only unusual thing my wife ever wakes up to.  Sometimes Jason has things all planned out... Last week, like any other morning, she came downstairs.  She entered the kitchen and immediately noticed a note on the counter.  \"Find me in the Family Room\" it said in shaky D'Nealian script.  Hmmmm. Entering the family room now, her every sense was honed in to finding the mysterious hint-dropper.  There it was!  On the table, another cryptic note. \"Find me under the table\". Well, with a clue so enigmatic, a mystery so deep and impenetrable, one must wonder how my wife figured out where to look next!  Until ... a giggle burst out from under the table.  Success!  The little leprechaun was found, and today's mystery was solved.  All in a day's work for - Mama D! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/2008/02/adam-speaks.html", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/02/again.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182647?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/02/snippets-20.html", "title": "\nSnippets 2.0\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 2, 2008", "body": "\nThis is a story of my first Autism Conference.  This conference took place in Pasadena in summer of 2006.  The plan was for me to go and for my wife to stay home with the boys (who were then 4 and 3, respectively).  Since Pasadena is a solid 2.5 hours drive away, I decided to get a hotel room for a night (it was a 2-day conference).  That way I could spend the in-between evening perusing and disseminating any info I would glean from the various sessions instead of fighting Southern California traffic. I went with the highest of hopes.  I would see Temple Grandin speak!  Carol Gray, the creator of Social Stories, would be there!  All kinds of service providers would set up shop!  And, best of all, there was to be a \"Dad's Luncheon\" the second day.  Dad's only - a chance to mix it up with people experiencing and adjusting to some of the same things I was.  Perhaps I could have the satisfaction of either receiving or giving some incredibly useful piece of advice or wisdom.  I was thrilled! Temple was very interesting and informative, as I'm sure she always is.  I was surprised and a bit unsettled at her endorsement of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds as being essential to her well-being, but who was I to judge?  I was wondering if these things were in Jason's future as well.  Carol Gray was marvellous.  Other presenters were not so impressive as I had hoped.  I recall Doreen Granpeesheh speaking, and getting a feeling of 'detachment' from her.  I'm not sure how else to describe it.  It was as if she was talking about automobile repair or something.  The conference was hosted by Jim Adams (who I now am familiar with due to his involvement in a seemingly failed  chelation study  in Arizona.)  I had no idea that what I had attended (I was unaware of the divisions in the autism community at the time) was basically a cure-oriented, biomedical conference. A turning point in my approach to parenting happened during that conference, and it happened during the Dad's Luncheon - the thing I most looked forward to attending.  We all settled in for lunch, probably about 30-35 of us.  We were given a cold box-lunch.  The usual - a soggy ham sandwich, a small bag of chips, an apple, a cookie.  We were sitting at various round tables dispersed through a medium sized room.  As some stilted, uncomfortable small talk took place, we all munched away at our little lunches.  After a short while, 2 guys stood up and introduced themselves.  They apparently travelled with this conference organization regularly and had these Dad Luncheons at each stop.  As I soon came to realize, they seemed to revel in relating to all of us just exactly how difficult their lives had been made by their autistic children.  And, oh how their lives were difficult!  They were having trouble making ends meet.  One had to quit his job.  They didn't have any of their old friends anymore.  Their sex lives were non-existent.  Listening to them, one would think that they should be martyred for their long-suffering existence as parents of autsitic kids.  And the things they'd tried and done to cure the autism!  The sacrifices they'd made!  I was sitting there, just incredibly disappointed.  And I felt embarrassed for them, as I assumed the other 'Dads' in the room were feeling just like I was that the Dads' Luncheon was actually a two-man pity roadshow. Then the bomb dropped (though only two of us knew it had happened).  One of the talkers was asking questions of the group, trying to get people to interact and respond.  It was mostly falling short, until one question came up. \"How many of you guys have ever thought about killing yourself?  Or about killing your kids, just to put a stop to all of it?\" All but two hands went up in the room.  Me and the guy sitting across from me - a dentist or doctor as I recall - were looking around, absolutely agape.  Our eyes met, and we shared a moment of stunned, shared recognition of our aloneness in the room. The Q&A then continued on, and I don't think anyone noticed what had happened except for the two of us.  Here's guessing that, somewhere out there tonight, that guy and his family, I and my family, are faring much, much better than the roomful of Dads who harbored thoughts of suicide and homicide.  Immediately afterward, I remember calling my wife and telling her what had happened.  She, too, was amazed.  I mean where else is this an acceptable thought?  Imagine that same question being asked of the Dads at a little league organizational meeting.  Of the Moms at PTA.  At Cub Scouts.  At Sunday School.   Anywhere else.   It boggles the mind.  And lest one think that this mentality does not, in many cases, play itself out to the worst case scenario, please take a moment to browse this ongoing  journal  by Joel Smith.  In it, Joel provides updates of news reports of abuse and murder of autistic people.  Karen McCarron will soon be sentenced for the murder of her daughter Katie - will Karen receive a full sentence, or will she be sentenced lightly because, after all, she was dealing with the stress of trying to raise an autistic child?  If she is sentenced lightly, it is the mentality apparent in that room on that day that we have to thank for the travesty.  I think any consideration I give to the more extreme and belligerent elements of the Biomed community (because that's who these people were) and those who provide them the products and services they crave, has been tainted since that day.  It was a glimpse inside the acceptable mentality of those who have a parenting sense of entitlement.  Those who simply cannot accept that they have brought a child into the world that does not fit their preconceived notions of what is 'right' and what is 'acceptable', and their child must be fixed.  I've been waiting a few years to get that one off my chest.  My rant is over now.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=133", "http://www.livejournal.com/community/autistic_abuse"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/02/how-to-spoil-good-lunch.html", "title": "\nHow to Spoil a Good Lunch\n"},

Today, Katie looks down from heaven and smiles while we shed a tear, gather ourselves together, and stride forth into the world to enact the words of Katie's father, Paul McCarron, who today said: \"I ask all parents and especially those of children with disabilities to ALWAYS love your children and be proud of them. Cherish every moment you have with them. Love, patience and tender efforts are the best therapies.\" God bless Katie McCarron and her family.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/01/tha-autism-hub-is-community-of-people.html", "title": "\nKatie and Family...\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 12, 2008", "body": "\nToday, Generation Rescue paid for another full-page ad in a national publication.  In this case, it was USA Today. This occasion prompted me to spend a few moments reflecting on the meandering path that GR has taken since its inception in 2005.  To help the new reader digest some of the gaffes and self-contradictions that litter the snail-trail left by GR, I have assembled a timeline of events.  For those familiar with the events described here, please feel free to add your own points to the timeline. February 2005             J.B. Handley appears on a local NBC show and declares that \"There is no such thing as autism.  Autism is a misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning.\" This is the moment when J.B.'s public reputation became directly tied to the outcome of chelation therapy performed on his son.  A big burden for any son, to be sure.  Also, imagine the shock felt by thousands upon thousands of autistic adults all over the world to find out that they simply had mercury poisoning! June 2005           The Handleys launch the initial version of the  Generation Rescue  website.  Thanks to the Wayback Machine, we can see how the site was worded at that time.   Specifically: \"Generation Rescue believes that childhood neurological disorders such as autism, Asperger's, ADHD/ADD, speech delay, sensory integration disorder, and many other developmental delays  are all misdiagnoses for mercury poisoning.\"   (emphasis mine) The website also prominently features a quote from Dr. Rashid Buttar.  Yes,  that  Rashid Buttar. April 2007             The Q1 2007 CDDS numbers are released (brief analysis  here ), and the reported caseload of autistic people in California continued to rise.  This was yet another devastating blow to the mercury/autism hypothesis.  When considered in the additional light of the incredible number of advances made in understanding the genetic basis of autism, how could one continue to proclaim this?: \"There is no evidence to suggest that autism is genetic. No autism gene has ever been found and the search will be endless \u2013 how can you have a gene for a mythical condition? Autism is mercury poisoning.\" - J.B. Handley April 2007             The \"new\" Generation Rescue Website is launched with great fanfare!  There is plenty of excited buzz in places like the Evidence of Harm Yahoo! Group and the household of Katie Wright.  Yes,  that  Katie Wright.  But ...  wait!  Where is the \"autism is a misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning\" statement?  Its missing.  Instead, they  changed their story! Now, apparently autism is not a misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning.  Instead, : \"The cause of this epidemic of NDs is extremely controversial. We believe the primary causes include the tripling of vaccines given to children in the last 15 years (mercury, aluminum and live viruses); maternal toxic load and prenatal vaccines; heavy metals like mercury in our air, water, and food; and the overuse of antibiotics.\" February 2008         J.B. Handley, in his typical gentlemanly style, tells respected autism researcher Nancy Minshew \"Tough shit\" in response to her request that he keep an email correspondence between her and a parent of an autistic child private.  The email in question was not damning in any way - I guess Dr. Minshew is simply used to a bit more decorum than is practiced by people like J.B. Februrary 2008     Generation Rescue decides to throw good money after bad, and pulls another  full page ad  in USA Today.  Of course, their intention must be to continue the message established by the re-work of their website in April 2007, right?  Or, after numerous new studies being published that further discount vaccines in general or thimerosal in particular over the last few months, did they change the message again?  Yes, they did.  This time: \"Mercury.  Aluminum.  Formaldehyde.  Ether.  Antifreeze.\" Wow.  Combined with their earlier change of causation theory, one must now consider thimerosal, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, antifreeze, tripling of vaccines, live viruses, prenatal vaccines, maternal toxic load, mercury in air, water, food, and overuse of antibiotics.  That's quite a list!  And, coupled with the staunch position that genetics have absolutely no role in autism, I think JB and GR have their work cut out for them in figuring out just how all of these myriad factors (13 at last count) interplay in causing autism! I also think it must be mentioned that in this ad, whether intentional or not, GR indirectly asks the reader to discount the credibility of the CDC and AMA, while simultaneously ceding credibility to Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey.  Oh ... my ... gosh. Call me crazy, but I'm not thinking that Generation Rescue is a credible resource for knowledge about autism causation.  Oh wait, I changed my mind about that.  Oh, but I just changed it again.  And again..............    ad nauseum. This is just One Dad's Opinion.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2007", "body": "\n I thought it fitting that I open my response to being awarded by ABFH the \"Roar for Powerful Words\" by evoking an image of one of the finest fables relating to small voices being heard. In this book, the most famous line (and one that has gained traction with the Pro-life philosophy that I identify with and support) is: \"...a person's a person, no matter how small.\" Needless to say, this phrase can and should have lots of play in any discussion of disability rights, as well. So I am pleased and humbled by ABFH's decision to tag me with this award. I quite simply don't feel deserving, especially considering the other bloggers  selected by ABFH  (and ABFH herself) and their range and depth of thought on many of the same subjects covered here. If I could smile shyly in an \"Aw, shucks\" kind of way on my blog, I would be doing so right now. When I read the post of the originator of this award -  Seamus  - I saw mention of the sideways glances given to blogging by the mainstream media. In his words,  \"A Roar For Powerful Words is the chance to scream from the mountains the good news about the powerful posts that are produced every day in the blogosphere, despite what some mainstream columnists and journalists claim.\"  And when you look at the ethics (or lack thereof) and social mores of some bloggers, it is apparent that blogging is the literary equivalent of the Wild West in many ways. But to my mind that makes it all the more notable that some people exercise their right to free speech and communication in ways that reflect the responsiblity we feel to our society, our communities, our families, ourselves. These are the blogs I feel are deserving of the \"Roar for Powerful Words\" award, and that is why I feel pleased to be included in that group. With this award comes the request to  \"... examine exactly what it is that makes writing good and powerful.\"  In keeping with the title and theme of this blog, here are three things that do just that, in my opinion: *Be yourself. When writing, we all have a voice. Attempting to sublimate the natural voice that comes when the pen touches the paper is a mistake. *Choose a topic you can be passionate about. I am a person of low emotional range - a stony-faced stoic in many ways. But when my son received an autism diagnosis, I allowed my new-found passion to guide me to places I never thought I'd be. And to write about things I never thought I'd write about. *Be respectful. It is fine to be a critic, but I feel it is important to do so in a respectful way. If you want to criticize someone or something, have some sound thinking to support your position and don't be afraid to have your positions challenged by people who think differently. This award will not sit idle here on my blog. It is now my pleasure to offer it to other bloggers.Though we are supposed to pick five, I have only three to mention. For being a clear, strong, and consistent voice in teaching people what is right and wrong in autism advocacy,  Joel Smith  at NT's are Weird. For proving that actions can speak even louder than words,  Alex Bain  at Run Man Blog. For proudly and positively discussing views of multiple disabilities,  NiksMom  at Maternal Instincts. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R2C63C2mQyI/AAAAAAAAAE8/F0YLGVAXmDs/s1600-h/180px-HortonHearsAWhoBookCover.jpg", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/12/lion-roars-today.html", "http://theshamelesslionswritingcircle.blogspot.com/2007/11/roar-for-powerful-words.html", "http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/", "http://therunman.blogspot.com/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/12/horton-hears-who.html", "title": "\nHorton Hears a Who\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, October 27, 2007", "body": "\n Despite all expectations, the sun rose. Though weak, its rays slowly soaked through the roiling gray-brown skies. There was no sound but the persistent breath of the Santa Ana wind. The cloying taste of fear and ash clung to my throat, which was made raw by dry smoke and heat...... A post-apocalyptic vision? No, a description of Tuesday morning here in Southern California. Every now and then, I depart from the topic of autism to talk about something else. This is one of those occasions. This post is about the wildfires that plagued Southern California this week. This post is about how my family's life was temporarily jacked up by Mother Nature. I am highly cognizant of the fact that we did not lose our home. Perhaps 1800 families here did. We are very lucky to not be included in that number, and my heart goes out to those who have suffered terrible loss this week. Monday morning I got up at and went to work as usual. The top radio news story on the way in was that Highway 15 - the major inland north/south expressway in SoCal - was closed due to smoke and embers from a  wildfire . No big deal, as we occasionally run into this condition in San Diego County. A few minutes later, another story runs that a fire is burning behind California State University-San Marcos and is forcing the evacuation of a few neighborhoods at the base of the hill upon which the University is located. Hmmm. 2 fires now. I also recalled that the Santa Ana winds (The Devil Winds, in which an atmospheric high pressure zone migrates to the Mojave desert, forcing hot desert air to rapidly traverse Southern California in its effort to seek the low-pressure zone sitting over the cool Pacific Ocean) were expected to prevail strongly for a few days. Uh-oh. This could be trouble. But not for me! Wildfires, hurricanes, tsunamis, and \"storms of the century\" happen to other people, not me and mine. So no worries. I settle in to work, with several co-workers commenting on the fires. One office clerk leaves, as her neighborhood is being evacuated due to the proximity of the fire and she needs to tend to her kids. Okay, so we'll be a bit short-handed. At least there is no fire in the area that I live, about a 40-minute drive away. Then someone mentions that a new fire  has  been reported in my area. About 30 minutes later my wife calls and confirms this, but that it is burning on the other side of the interstate a few miles away. Close, but no imminent danger ... yet. As a precautionary tactic, she began to assemble those belongings we would take with us in the event of an evacuation. A few hours later, news reports had the fire \"jumping\" the highway. That is 8 lanes of highway with a very wide median - probably 50 yards of distance.  This is what can happen when the hot desert winds push a fire - burning embers are forced way out in front and ignite areas far removed from the source flames. This is how fires \"jump\" huge swaths of land so quickly. If the wind is travelling 70 mph like it did in gusts that day and the next, then the fire can also travel at 70 mph. Scary, if you think of it. Anyhow, with this news I was quickly out of work and on the way home. I have an excellent and trustworthy staff, a staff that was heroic in maintaining compsure and business activities in the ensuing three days. I barely avoided getting caught in a major snarl on the highway as it was unexpectedly closed due to the fire roaring around it and the resulting smoke. Since I had to get home in a hurry, I burned a U-turn into the median and drove back against stopped traffic to find an emergency access break in the center divide, I squeezed through there and headed back to the prior exit so I could wind through some surface roads to get home. Keep in mind that the area I live in is very hilly - it is actually a foothill range that includes a series of ridges and valleys. Roads are limited, usually windy, and not heavily travelled. Soon after I got home, our bright sunny day degenerated into a brown, choking haze due to the smoke from the nearby conflagration. And, obviously, since the smoke was coming our way so was the fire. We packed up my wife and kids and decided I would stay behind to watch the house and the animals. Though our area was under official \"mandatory evacuation\" orders issued via reverse-911 phone calls and door-to-door Sherriff visits, and the resulting exodus had begun in earnest, our situation was probably a bit more complicated than many others. Only if it became obviously dangerous would I leave. Dragging around 2 dogs and three cats to unknown shelter locations for unknown periods of time is not an appealing scenario, hence our decision. Plus, it is hard to walk away from your house not knowing if you will see it again. She and the boys safely arrived at their destination - the home of some wonderful friends (thank you!) up North of us, so now I only had to worry about the proximity of the fire. As night fell, I began to look for a good vantage point. I found one nearby, further down the ridge that our house sits atop, and several other \"stay-behinds\" found the same spot. Thus began a very long night of fire-watching. The fire line approached from the East. I live on the Western ridge of a North-South-running valley. From ridgetop to ridgetop is probably a mile or two. The valley is about 2 total miles in length. The firehad burned all day on the opposite side of the Eastern ridge. At that point, it had destroyed maybe 40 or 50 structures and a golf course. At home, I made pots of coffee to keep the caffeine flowing. Every hour or so I would drive over to the vantage point to watch the glow from the other side of the ridge, hoping to see it diminish. Firefighters had been on it all day, so I was hoping they would beat it. At 11:00 it was still just a steady orange glow. When I returned at 11:45 much had changed. The wind had picked up dramatically, fueling the fire. In that 45 minutes, it had crested the ridge and burned about 2/3 of the way down to the base of the valley where the road runs. It was now hard to watch as the wind was hurling embers and debris and smoke up our ridge. The crackle-pop was vaguely audible now. As the fire marched down the hill, it was the only thing you could see on an otherwise night-darkened hillside. Except ... sometimes a giant ball of fire would develop within the wall of flames. And a huge plume of black smoke would burst upwards. The adjacent flames would bend towards these intense flare-ups, drawn to them by the rush of oxygen. These were homes. Families' homes, burning to nothing in a matter of minutes. Wow. I wish I had pictures of this, but the camera was packed with our evacuation 'valuables' and was therefore, well, evacuated. At this point, the small group of us watching this happen were of a mind to get going. None of us had any intention of getting into serious danger, and none of us had any illusions about our own ability to defend our homes from fire.  We knew that if and when we left, we would have no way of knowing what happened to our homes, had no way of knowing when we could return, and had no way of knowing whether we would be able to meet up with our families in the interim. These were powerful motivators to stay put as long as was feasible. But ... just at the crucial moment when it seemed we would have maybe 10 or 15 minutes to clear out before the wall of flames reached us ... the wind died down. Then it picked up again - from the West. The Santa Ana had momentarily given way to a coastal breeze. This ceased the forward progress of the flames, though they still hungrily consumed avocado groves, homes, and ancient Live Oaks without compunction. Immediately thereafter, a stream of emergency vehicles gushed into our valley along the road that ran along its nadir. As I heard on the news the next day, this was a contingent of firefighters freshly arriving from Northern California, and assigned to our location as it was designated a \"last line of defense\". If the fire broke through our valley, authorities were concerned it would enter an estuary valley that runs directly to the coast about 10 miles away, and there would be no stopping it. I could see their vehicles wind up the narrow lanes cutting up the opposite ridge by tracking their flashing lights. They arrayed themselves above, around, and below the 2 major rivers of fire descending into the valley and valiantly defended their chosen turf. The end of the story is good - they stopped the advance and saved hundreds of homes. God Bless our firefighters. Fast forward to the next day - Wednesday. Now it is midday, and I decide to check out the area. At the time I leave home, I feel like the only person in the world. As I walk out to my car in the driveway, every footfall results in a little cloud of rising ash. I flip the windshield wipers to clear the ash and create another little cloud that will eventually settle on the driveway. I leave home and drive past the vantage point from the night before - no one there now. The radio says the fireline is still being defended at the bottom of the valley, but I can no longer see the flames since it is day. Smoke roils by in great black and brown belches stinging my eyes and throat. As I drive into various areas I see nothing but emergency vehicles. Fire trucks, Cal. Dept. of Forestry trucks, Ambulances screaming by with sirens blaring. Overhead, a chopper repeatedly goes back to the worst of the fire after refilling its water tank from a nearby pond. I am passed by two Army Hummers, complete with visored soldiers perched atop the roof with M-16's - guarding against the inevitable looters. There is no other movement or activity, just these vehicles with their missions. Truly bizarre, as this is my town, my little agricultural haven amidst the hubbub of Southern California. Very few stayed behind, and those who did were home indoors avoiding the choking atmosphere. The story, for me and my family, has a happy ending. My wife and kids were able to return home Wednesday night, just two nights after flames tore through our valley. We cleaned up the ash around the house as the fire burned North into an unpopulated river valley, and eventually burned itself out. This fire burned 9000 acres. It destroyed 206 homes and 42 other buildings.4 firefighters have been injured out of 967 assigned to the fire. And that is just my town. In all of Southern California, the combined force of the wildfires since Monday have consumed 410,000 acres and over 1,500 homes. This last picture is just one little area of my town that used to be lush, green growth. Suffice it to say that we're glad this week is over in Southern California.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/RyPwV-R9XoI/AAAAAAAAACs/mzs6Ou5fi2E/s1600-h/DSCN1609.JPG", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/RyPx4uR9XpI/AAAAAAAAAC0/ku5iLW0fjN4/s1600-h/DSCN1625.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/RyP12uR9XqI/AAAAAAAAAC8/_61IS_RLTTs/s1600-h/DSCN1629.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/RyP2YeR9XrI/AAAAAAAAADE/XA4PCAjn1EE/s1600-h/DSCN1630.JPG"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/pardon-interruption.html", "title": "\nPardon the Interruption...\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, October 10, 2007", "body": "\nMonday, for the first time, I dropped in on Autism Speaks' Message Boards. It was, predictably, the home of some rather heated conversations. So I jumped in a little bit, in a typical Steve way of trying not to step on too many toes but trying to state clearly how I felt on some issues (specifically, what is Neurodiversity's \"message\"). I was quickly responded to by one \"SamsDad\", who apparently holds a low view of Neurodiversity and those who are associated with the Autism Hub. That's okay, as he doesn't know me from Adam and I really don't care what he thinks, as we don't really know or impact each other in any meaningful way. But ... a portion of his comments gave me some food for thought. And the result is this blog post on the topic of ... responsible blogging. In response to my statement, \"The whole philosophy appealed tremendously to me - and still does - on any number of levels. Here are what I consider to be a few facets of the ND point of view as I see it. I speak for no one but myself.\" SamsDad replied: \"You speak for no one else, but blogging speaks to everyone else, including people that have not yet formed an opinion. As KevLeitch has pointed out, that's a pretty substantial audience. I know blogging isn't supposed to be as \"objective\" as the media per se, but it can be as influential. Is there a moral responsibility there then? I think so, but I'm naive and somewhat idealistic. So, like it or not, all of you that \"publish\" these blogs, are in the public eye, by your own volition, and are thereby viewed as \"representatives\", with all the trials, tribulations, criticisms and responsibilities that come with such a position, as well as the very loud voice that accompanies it. \" Which is an interesting point of view that deserves further discussion. And, yes, this will follow my typical pattern of discussion that leaves me with more questions than answers. Its a good thing I named this blog \"One Dad's Opinion\" because had I named it \"One Dad's Indisputably Known Facts\" there would be like two or three posts, and the only topic would be that I love my family. How boring that would be. I don't think I agree with the basic premise of SamsDad's statement - \"I know blogging isn't supposed to be as \"objective\" as the media per se, but it can be as influential.\" I think the flaw here is the intimation that blogging operates under the assumption of objectivity. Blogging, instead, is the epitome of  subjectivity , in that it is a person or group of people writing in a way that they feel comfortable with, unfettered by any hard-line ethical and professional codes (actually, that sounds  a lot  like today's news media). So we are responsible to ourselves, as bloggers, to keep it honest and real, and ultimately our own self-imposed code of conduct determines how we choose to use our words. I stated in the first post I ever wrote: \"It occurs to me that, years from now, these words will be accessible to all three of my sons. At this very moment these words are able to be read by the other people who I value so much in my life.\" That is my guiding principle, my own self-imposed code of conduct. My boys will read this someday. I want them to know that Dad cared. My wife reads this, and I want her to know I love and appreciate her. I also stated my goal very clearly in the title bar: \"This is one Dad's opinion of various subjects, most of which involve the reality of raising a child who is autistic.\" and in the sidebar: \"This blog is for discussion of all things related to autism. I especially welcome the input of autistic individuals.\" I don't think I have any moral imperative to forewarn my readers (all 37 of them) beyond that. Do you? At some point, someone has to read what I or anyone else on the Hub or anywhere on the Internet wrote and decide for themselves if they agree or disagree. And here are some of the topics I have covered. Maybe SamsDad can decide for himself if I am worthy of my self-appointed soapbox: Our son's school district doing a particularly  good job  of adjusting to increasing numbers of autistic students. My favorite post, in which I  compare  my three boys to newly founded cities. How great my  dog  is. What an ... unsavory guy JB Handley is and how he  changed his story  instead of owning up to his premature declarations of \"mercury poisoining is autism!\". I joined in \"Blogging Against Disablism Day\" by writing a  post  about how having an autistic son changed me as a person. Some great conversations with  Mark Twain . I wrote about my son's preschool  graduation  and included some pictures. I did a write-up of a great  conference  I attended at University of San Diego. (Just yesterday I got a response on one of those three posts - from one of the presenters, Stephen Hinkle. I recommend that people read his comments.) I examined the Autism Speaks-sponsored study on  Prozac  as a pharmaceutical support for autistic individuals. I did a three-part series on  Evidence-Based  Interventions. I posted an essay by Martha Leary about  Movement Differences . I talked about the controversial topic of  recovery  in the context of Jason's progress. I criticized a Fortune Magazine blogger who had coined the term  \"Blackberry Autism\". I posted a discussion of and, later, a  form letter  for people to use, that encouraged the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to not stop funding transportation for Special Ed students via the school districts. I wrote two posts about my feelings on how the whole  Jenny  McCarthy thing went down. I talked about  Hyperlexia  and reading comprehension. So there you have it. Apparently, upon reviewing this list, I am an extremely boring blogger. Not much controversy here! Yes, there are other topics as well, but I think it can be agreed by many that mine is not the stuff of severe conflict. Or maybe some perceive that it is. Should that be of concern to me?  Some bloggers, such as our friend Harold Doherty in New Brunswick, take a far more ideological approach than some class-B Hub blogger like myself. Harold watches news feeds all day keyed to the term \"autism\". Once he sees a good one, he quickly  spins the news  to make the Evil Neurodiverse out to be the source of all that is bad in the world of autism, then posts it. He actually uses horrible stories like the one I just linked to as an ice-breaker for another attack on the \"ND's\". He spends the rest of his online time sniping at people on their own blogs, then moderating out comments they choose to make on his blog. How does this approach fit in with SamsDad's view of responsible blogging? Also, while Harold and I agree on some things and disagreeon others, I would never want to take away his right to talk about anything he wants to. He deserves the same platform as I or anyone else has, and it is up to him to do what he wants with it.  ( I wasn't going to post a link directly to Harold's blog since sending traffic there seems irresponsible, but I only have 37 readers so I thought the impact would be minimal) And there is (at least) one more thing that I think devalues SamsDad's analogy between blogs and journalism: Unlike developing a network to compete with Viacom, anyone can write a blog! Even me! SamsDad could be a blogger within 5 minutes of reading this post if he chooses to. He can attempt to reach, to use his own words, \"... people that have not yet formed an opinion.\" If he were to do this, we would potentially provide counterbalancing viewpoints (assuming we disagree on things).  So SamsDads' point, though interesting, may have been a bit misplaced. I guess he identified me with the Autism Hub and jumped to the conclusion that I oppose all he holds dear or something, which amounts to painting a whole group with a pretty broad brushstroke. After all, when he made his comments, all I had done was identify myself as a Hub blogger and describe several aspects of what I feel are apects of Neurodiversity's message.  I'd like to hear other opinions on what constitutes responsible vs. irresponsible blogging.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2007/10/autistic-boy-one-of-11-molested-raped.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/blogging-and-responsibility.html", "title": "\nBlogging and Responsibility\n"},

That's how I feel today after reading Kev Leitch's farewell message, and witnessing the closure of his blog, Left Brain/Right Brain. Kev's reasons are his own, and for no one to question.  He is acting in the way that he feels necessary to protect his family, and I support him 100% in that.  Kev's daughter has been the target of impersonation and dehumanizing insults by John Best for quite some time now.  John is the despicable person who writes the Hating Autism blog.  His derogatory writing too often crosses ethical and moral boundaries that are easily recognized and avoided by more decent people.  Over the last three days, John has committed himself to a campaign of hate against Kev and His daughter that is unprecedented in its depravity, and Kev has reacted accordingly. Many, many people like me have directly benefitted from Kev's work in establishing a central point for autism blogging, many of whom are autistic bloggers who were able to benefit from the Hub's high traffic to get a message out to the world that Autism is not necessarily what it has been thought to be.  That autistic folks are whole persons, people deserving of our respect and admiration for abilities and attitudes that were dismissed, ignored, or overlooked by most professionals until recently. I hope Kev will still contribute his voice and efforts in other ways - ways that will provide some insulation between his family and those who would do them harm through words or deeds.  I hope the autism community realizes that we are diminishing ourselves if we let the outrageous actions of the offending person go without condemnation and censure.  I hope we can organize ourselves to continue the Autism Hub, so that there is always a place for Autistic bloggers and their allies to gather and share ideas.  I hope that Kev knows how much I and so many others appreciate his efforts over the years.  And I hope that my Autistic son grows up in a world full of people like Kev Leitch, and bereft of haters like John Best.  I will keep blogging to do my part to see these things happen. And if anything occurs that causes Kev to reconsider, I will be the first in line to welcome him back.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/hate-is-unmistakeable.html", "title": "\nHate is Unmistakeable\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 2, 2007", "body": "\nIt has been stated that hyperlexic kids often have tremendous difficulty with reading comprehension once their peers catch up to their reading level and academic expectations tighten up.  An SLT who worked very well with Jason and really helped him a lot 'warned' us of this.  I recently recall Ms. Clark alluding to this with one of her kids as well commenting on another blog.  This is not always, however, the case. My son's school began a new program yesterday called Book-It.  It works like this:  A child has one month to complete ten books. Completing a book means reading it themselves or having an adult read to them. If they successfully complete 10 books in the month's time, they receive a coupon for a free Personal Pan Pizza at Pizza Hut. Keep in mind that my son started Kindergarten just a few weeks ago.  Keep also in mind that they happened to pick a  powerful  motivator - Pizza.  Jason loves Pizza the way Pandas love bamboo, the way Spongebob loves Crabby Patties, the way ... you get the picture. It is now approximately 30 hours ( hours,  not days) since the program was announced.  Jason has read 8 books.  All by himself.  We can't keep him away from books right now.  He finds one in one of our household's kids' book stacks (they're everywhere) and races off to a quiet spot to read.  A short time later he will reappear and request that this book be added to the Book-It list. Last night he brought me an old Disney publication of \"Peter Pan and Mary\".  This book was 24 pages long, maybe 40-50 words per page.  I was skeptical that he had done more than look at the pictures, so I quizzed him. \"Jason, what is the dog's name?\" \"Nana.\" \"How does Peter Pan help them fly?\" (Excited,  flapping hands ) \"Dust!\" \"What are the boys in Neverland called?\" \"The Lost Boys.\" \"Who is Hook's enemy?\" \"Smee.\" \"No, Smee is Hook's mate.  Who is Hook's enemy?\" \"Hungry Crocodile!\" I can't wait to take Jason for his victory Pizza at Pizza Hut.  Thing is, we'll have to wait a month for his peers to finish their books first.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/hyperlexia-and-comprehension.html", "title": "\nHyperlexia and Comprehension\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, August 22, 2007", "body": "\n Being a Dad is not all fun and games. But every difficult moment is more than offset by what I consider to be - \"Dad Moments\" Here is a glimpse at a few of those moments. Dad Moment #1 My son Jason won 2nd place in the riding competition a couple of weeks ago. Regular readers will know that Jason rides a horse every week with a really neat instructor/therapist named Kaitlyn. After two years, he is quite the equestrian aficionado, and has even guided Betsy (the horse, of course) all by himself for a short distance! Dad Moment #2 After a few quite difficult travel experiences with Jason, we decided to try to make some short-hop type trips to help acclimate him to the idea and process of travelling. Last weekend, we took the boys to a small mountain town in the San Bernardino mountain range called Big Bear. Jason did well, and one of the highlights of the trip was an unexpected visit to a Fire Tower. We had gone on a short hike in the Children's Forest area, and one wise forest ranger recommended that we go a few more miles up a very windy road to the tower. It was ... breathtaking. The tower - one of several sitting along the front range of the mountains, is in place to provide bird's eye views of wildfires. It is positioned to capture views extending - literally - over 75 miles (120 km). It is hard with a photograph to convince you of scale, but here it is.  (Oh, by the way, the Dad Moment of this experience is that neither kid cared about the view - it was way too big to process. They cared about the hummingbird feeders affixed to the eaves of the tower.) Dad Moment #3 On Monday, I came home from work and got out of my car. As we are on the tail end of a heatwave, and as I live inland in a semi-arid climate, I was expecting a blast of heat as I exited my vehicle. Instead, I immediately noticed that my world was at  the perfect temperature . It was one of those extremely rare, exquisitely well-balanced moments where, given the choice and the power, you would keep the current ambient temperature absolutely the same for the rest of your life.  So I raced into the house and announced that, in light of the  perfect  weather outside, we need to go for a walk! The kids and the dogs were thrilled, but Lisa - though wanting to go - was regrettably in the middle of an uninterruptable task. So, since I had already let the proverbial cat out of the bag, I had to follow through and take the clan for a walk. This means that I - one man - would strap a papoose-style carrier to my chest for 7-month old Colin, take big ol' Chance and new puppy Marley on a leash in each hand, and still somehow have to guide 5-year old Jason and 4-year old Tyler on a walk. Just us 6 guys! Its a good thing we live on a quiet country road - only two cars passed during our stroll.  In the first picture I, as we are jammed up at the front gate, I am trying to convince Tyler to take responsibility for Marley and his leash. In the second picture, Tyler is drifting left with Marley, I am reaching back for Jason's hand. Let's just say it never became much less complicated than that moment. The best part of the walk, by the way, is when we passed an avocado grove and the boys got to pick fresh (not-yet-ripe) avocados, and then bring them home for the dogs to play with and eat. We live, by the way, in the Avocado Capital of the World. And for my last \"Dad\" moment of this post... Dad Moment #4 Coming home from a difficult day's work is pretty fun when you walk in the door and see these two characters.  If, at this moment, you do not drop down to your knees and initiate play with your adoring audience, you might be in the wrong line of work. Thanks, as always, for visiting my blog.  Someone who reads this post will be my 5,000th visitor.  Notice that I have placed a new entry on my sidebar - a place for Autism Dads.  If any Autism Dads who I did not list would like to be part of this group, please let me know.  Any readers who see this list, please visit these excellent blogs.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2007", "body": "\nIn my last  post , I talked about how great my opinion is of the goings-on the the Autism Institute at the University of San Diego Leadership in Education School. Today I attended day 2 of their Summer Conference. Here is a  link  to the program, for those who are interested. I left Day 2 feeling even better about this group of educators and presenters than I did on Day 1. Here's the thing that pervades this conference - the presenters (notably; Anne Donnellan, Martha Leary, Nan Negri, Kate McGinnity, and Jody Robledo) are a close-knit group of professional associates who made left-turns somewhere in their career backgrounds that led them down what must be considered atypical paths of understanding and accepting autism. Their combined weight of experience provides them absolutely no illusions as to how much or little they know about the disorder, and they will consistently, through words and deeds, step aside and let the opinions of autistic individuals overshadow their own preconceptions and dictate their efforts. How refreshing! This is not the Autism One crowd, that's for sure! Okay, two highlights from today. First, one of the presenters chose to show Amanda's \"In My Language\" video as the centerpiece of her presentation. The presenter was Martha Leary, MA, CCC-SLP. Martha showed the video (actually, the whole Anderson-Cooper CNN piece), then just opened up the microphone to questions from the crowd. I think the richter scale of learning hit about an 8.5 when the crowd really got down to discussing what they had watched. Keep in mind that many of the attendees are in professsions such as state service providers and preschool special day class instructors - they held very textbook-like preconceptions of autism prior to attending this conference. One person commented on Amanda's use of the term Neurotypical - which elicited much chuckling. Another wondered how much effort it must have taken for Amanda to have completed the filming process. Many just expressed admiration and respect for Amanda's videography skills and ability to accurately get her message across. All in all, it was a very positive reaction and I think many people gained some valuable perspective. I, of course, did take the opportunity to speak as well. I am not much of a \"group\" guy and tend to stay quiet and alone at these types of events. But this was too good of an opportunity to pass up, in terms of inviting people to view the Hub and learn from its various contributors the way I did. So, first I mentioned that Amanda is actually quite accessible on a regular basis, in that she writes profusely - mainly on topics relating to autism advocacy and understanding, and that people are generally welcome to respectfully comment on her blogposts. I talked about her use of the term Neurotypical and its counterpoint - Neurodiverse (lots of \"Aaaaahhh, now I get it\" from the crowd). I mentioned the positive impact her writing and videos had had on my understanding of autism, and that there are numerous other autistic bloggers who also deserve a look. I went on to mention the Hub, they wrote the address on the whiteboard, and I think overall the opportunity to plug the Hub did not pass without proper attention. Mission accomplished. Thanks, Amanda! Then came the best part of the day. Lunch came around, and I was walking out of the building toward the main cafeteria and found myself walking with Stephen Hinkle. Stephen is the guy I mentioned in yesterday's post that had been such a great contributor throughout the day. So we spent the next 90 minutes or so together, including a nice lunch in a cafeteria I had not eaten in in over 16 years (weird feeling). Stephen granted me permission to blog parts of our discussion. He is not familiar with the Hub, but might check it out. He is an outspoken advocate for disability rights, expecially in the school setting. He is passionate about this topic, and is doing a presentation tomorrow on the subject. I mentioned to him that he and Joel and Amanda have a similar focus on the issues, and I encouraged him to read their blogs. Other than that, we discussed things including the war in Iraq, highschool dances, gas prices, food preferences, his career (computer science), peak oil conditions, liberalism, Michael Moore and Sicko (which he challenged me to watch, but I refused because I abhor what Michael Moore stands for in terms of bias and propaganda), afterschool activities, play time vs. computer time, etc. We talked about the Omnibus proceedings and vaccine causation in general. I told him about chelation, which is not something he had heard of before. Bottom line is we seem to disagree on almost everything, and had a really nice time discussing all of it. He is quite a bit younger than me, so I expect he will begin to gain a more conservative slant as he grows older :) It is not every day that I get to spend any time with an autistic adult, and I enjoyed the experience. It is very difficult for me to relinquish even one opportunity to spend a moment alone reading a book or people-watching during a break, and I'm glad I resisted the urge in this case. I also got to experience some of the jeers and uncomfortable expressions and reactions that follow around a guy like Stephen first-hand, as there were many youngsters (high school and college age) who were on campus for various summer functions. It is a pity that someone rocking and speaking a bit louder than what is considered normal is enough to bias them towards Stephen's jovial and agreeable personality. If you read this Stephen, thanks for taking the time to dine with me. That's it for today - hopefully I'll have more to report tomorrow!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sandiego.edu/autisminstitute/conferences/summerconference.php"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-good-at-usd.html", "title": "\nMore Good at USD\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2007", "body": "\nAnyone who has dwelt upon the various talking points of the ongoing debate between what I will loosely refer to as \"cure\" vs. \"acceptance\" philosophies has come across this one: How does one know when a particular treatment/intervention is working? The short answer, so as not to keep you in suspense, is: One doesn't. The issue, taken in its entirety, is far more complex than the short answer implies. Before proceeding, a definition of \"treatment\" would be beneficial. For the purpose of this discussion: ABA, IBI, IVIg, Sensory Integration, Secretin, Music Therapy, ALA, Hippotherapy, Floor Time, RDI, Chelation, Auditory Integration Therapy, Seroquel, SLT, GFCF diet, Lupron, OT, etc, etc, etc... All of the above listed treatments were conceived of to reduce/moderate/eliminate behaviors associated with Autism Disorder ( a questionable goal, but that is a topic for another post). Needless to say, some are far more dangerous and invasive than others, and some far more adequately researched than others as well. There are numerous obstacles to knowing which, if any, of these treatments are effective in achieving their desired results. Among these are the Placebo Effect (applied to observers as well as subjects) and the distortion produced by applying numerous treatments simultaneously, which is most often the case.  The logical and scientific analyses embodied by these effects are legitimate, but they completely overlook the really important issue: How will a person change and develop over time in the complete absence of \"named\" treatments? Or, to put it another way, does a good ol' dose of understanding, love, dignity, and familial \"safe-harbor\" help an autistic individual to achieve all, and more, than the named treatments can? And this is where we arrive at the point of the discussion. Let's give credit where credit is due. And I would submit that credit is due to the autistic person him/herself. They are the ones who hold the ultimate responsibility for their outcome. It is through  their own efforts  that they succeed in becoming the people that they want to be! It may come as a surprise to many parents that autistic kids, just like neurotypical kids, progress through various stages of development - each one with its own set of benefits and detriments. Its called  growing up.  And \"treatment\" is not required for a child to grow up. There are many parents out there who continually trumpet  their  efforts as being the catalyst for their child's success. One mom recently, in an incredibly vainglorious display, posted a video showing her son's  \"episode\"  at the local DAN! doc's office receiving IV chelation. Regardless of what one believes of the efficacy of chelation therapy, consider the point that her cheerful, inquisitive, friendly, autistic son's changing behaviors were being attributed, in his mother's eyes, to the intravenous drip from a plastic bag - not to the boy himself. And therein lies the fallacy.  It seems to be very difficult for some people to ascribe positive behavioral changes in an autistic person to the person themself, and not some external factor.  Furthermore, many parents claim too much credit for their role in \"recovering\" their child.    This discussion is not intended to imply that the actions of parents are not meaningful, that the duties of parents are not significant. It would require a fool to believe that autistic children need any less guidance or support than neurotypical ones. And I will be the first to admit that, in many cases, a higher degree of commitment is required to guide our autistic kids through the complexities they will encounter at all stages of development. In my family, we have selected a modified version of ABA, speech therapy, and some OT to help our son gain important skills.  But ultimately,  he  is the one who has to actually  do  the work.  My point is solely this: Let's give credit where credit is due - to the kids, adolescents, young adults, and adults themselves. Not to the aforementioned treatments, which can only serve to assist the natural, human processes that will take place regardless of what neurological conditions prevail.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www..kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=529"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/04/credit-where-credit-is-due.html", "title": "\nCredit Where Credit is Due\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 17, 2007", "body": "\nInteresting day, Saturday. My wife, Lisa, had gone out for several hours to run some errands, leaving me with the boys. We were spending much of the day in the backyard. Every so often, a low-flying plane would buzz by, and it sounded as if there was some helicopter activity in the area. This is not unusual, as we live very close to Camp Pendleton - the largest Marine training base in the U.S. Lots of planes and helicopters, even heavy-ordnance weapons and machine gun fire are not uncommon. So seeing some air traffic is not unusual. Around mid-afternoon, Lisa calls. Her first question is, \"Where is the fire?\" \"Fire? What fire?\" She was driving toward our general area - we live on a high hill overlooking a spot where two river valleys join - and saw large plumes of smoke. So I went outside the front of the house and - wow! A major wildfire was burning close by. I ran down the street a short ways to get a better view, and it looked like it was burning very near to my parents' home, which is about 1.5 miles as the crow flies. I relayed this to Lisa, and she went straight for their house. My parents are out of town for the time being, but reachable by cell phone. Anyone who lives in a fire-susceptible area such as ours has a plan in place for this type of occurrence. While Lisa dashed for my parents' house, I started inventorying our own belongings. A big fire can travel very quickly, and this one looked big. I got the pet carriers out and made a list of things we would need for the kids for a few days. Lisa contacted my parents and received a verbal wish list of things of great value to remove from their home. Wedding albums, rosaries, pictures, videos, financial docs, etc. When Lisa filled her vehicle with things from their house and returned home, she told me the fire was within 1/2 mile  at most  of my parents' house (she was right), and burning hot. I immediately left for there to grab more things. I brought the video camera. I realized soon after arriving the the firefighters were throwing everything they had at it, and should be able to control it. There were three helicopters repeatedly filling their tanks and dousing the fires, as well as two air tankers (the low-flying planes I noticed earlier) dropping red powdery fire-retardant in advance of the flames. The following video is taken from my parents' back porch. For some perspective: the house is perched on a ridge over a golf course. The chopper will approach a lake on the course and hover very low over it. It is at this point dangling a hose - about 20 feet long - into the lake and sucking water into its holding tank. It then flies over to the blaze and empties the tank, then immediately returns to the lake. There is a pesky palm frond in front of my camera (let's just say I am not a world-class journalist), which I had a hard time avoiding because I am perched on top of a landscaping wall while filming, and therefore not very maneuverable. When the chopper takes off from the lake, you can make out a stream of water faling from the hose. Then, though much of its flight is obscured by the palm frond, you can see the chopper drop its payload of water on the fire (picture is not clear - look for a dense white spot under the distant helicopter). Sorry - I would have stayed and gotten better video but there was a major fire burning about 1/2 mile away and I was in a bit of a hurry.        Long story short, the blaze was extinguished, and no homes were lost. Those who live outside the U.S. may not know that each of the 50 states has an official motto, or slogan. Some examples are: Missouri, \"The Show-Me State\"; New Mexico, \"The Land of Enchantment\", Texas, \"The Lone Star State\"; or my personal favorite New Hampshire, \"Live Free or Die\". Days like Saturday often remind me why I often joke that California, currently known as \"The Golden State\", should be renamed. How about: \"California: As Seen on Television.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/06/wildfire.html", "title": "\nWildfire!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 6, 2007", "body": "\n Today I drove up to El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora La Reina de Los Angeles de Porciuncula (Los Angeles, for short. Or, most commonly known as L.A.). I am on the Board of Directors of an industry association, and today was our quarterly board meeting. In it, we discussed (among many things) whether we are delivering to our industry members what they expect based on their annual assessment (money). As my colleagues droned on about such fascinating topics as finance reports (yawn) and tax strategies (snore), my eyes glazed over and I began to think on other things. I began to realize that this  voluntary  trade association was in some ways analogous to ... the Autism Hub. And since the discussion centered on \"How are we directly benefitting those who look to us for benefits\", be it active members, associate members, or people with shared interests, I began a checklist in my mind of why, as a consumer, the Autism Hub is so valuable to me.  And here, for your perusal, it is: Sense of Community:  As the parent of an autistic child, I place great value on the exchange of information with other parents. The only thing that is of even more value is the input of autistic adults. For those who have not walked in my shoes, it would be impossible to explain the sense of relief imparted when I had my first lengthy online dialogue with an autistic adult. This was the first time I had first-hand experience with someone who had faced similar challenges to my own son and had grown up to become a thriving adult. For those of us who are active in the autism community, it is so easy to forget that, for many parents, the first time they have ever given autism more than 5 seconds of thought is the day of their child's diagnosis. And, more importantly,  parents are not told about the \"upside\" of  autism   by professionals and many first-response support groups.  Doing a Google search to find info about how to approach this as a parent, and landing softly among a group of impressive autistic bloggers and accepting parents, is about the best thing that can happen to such a parent. Depth of Understanding:  As an NT person, autism and autistic people can be challenging for me to understand. Anyone reading this, regardless of neurological makeup, is only able to take meaning from it within their own frames of reference. But in dealing with any number of autistic persons, and communicating with them in a casual format that allows ideas to originate from diverse sources, I have gained great appreciation for the depth and breadth of thought expressed by both my NT and ND friends in the community. Not only have I been placed in a better position to shed myths and misconceptions so well engrained in the popular literature about autism, but I have also been able to deftly avoid the \"parent traps\" such as Poor-me Syndrome and Cure-at-all-cost Syndrome due to the information I have been exposed to by the Hub bloggers. Leads on Other Sources of Information:  It is not at all uncommon for Hub bloggers to present info from outside sources. So instead of being a closed community, the Hub is just a jump-point for a huge range of information (most, but not all, of which is topic-specific) on the web. How to be an Ally : A common and valuable tpoic of dicussion on the Hub is: How can non-autistics be of benefit to autistics and autism advocacy? This issue waxes and wanes in popularity as a topic, but permeates much of the language and tone of most discussions. Darn Good Reading:  I have rarely seen a more diverse or intelligent group of people gathered in one spot. As literacy is the tool we have at our disposal to communicate via the internet, it is not surprising that the level at which it is applied exceeds what one would find in other environments. Humor, controversy, hard science, philosophy, emotional discourse, ethics. It can all be found here, discussed intelligently.  Take, for example, Bev's post today about  Robots .  It's a classic.  From so many standpoints.  Where else can I go for this type of post, which combines humor, education, and a personal reference for me (a man whose son is repeatedly talking like a robot.  \"I ... want ... milk.\")  Answer:  Nowhere else.  Ability to Contribute:  In my daily life, my wife and I have a full plate. We raise two young sons and recently enjoyed the arrival of a third son - now 5 months old. We have a good-sized property to take care of. I own and operate a small business that is very demanding. Lots going on. In light of these factors, it is not possible for us to be \"joiners\" in terms of grassroots community involvement. So, this forum provides an conduit for contribution. However small, I feel that adding my voice to this community can and will make a difference somehwere along the line in the life of my son and other autistic kids growing up today. Decentralized Organization:  One thing that has made many western societies great is the free, virtually unfettered exchange of ideas. The Hub directly carries on this tradition.  No one tells me what to post.  Anyone is free to chide me or encourage me for my writings.  I am free to offer opinions to any Hub blogger, and will typically receive a response.  Many people who do not blog on their own read the Hub regularly.  It is an open-exchange environment.  No moderation.  No rules.  Just a mission statement which places acceptance of autism in the proverbial Pole Position.   So, there you have it.  Some of my reasons for continuing my consumption of, and contribution to, the Autism Hub.

{"date": "Sunday, May 27, 2007", "body": "\nThis is a partial list of some things that I did today, or that happened to me today. Everything I put on this list is true. Today I added blueberries to my cereal to give it a little extra 'pop', as well as some antioxidant power. Today I encouraged my son Jason to swim \"overarm\" so he could successfully race his brother (armed with a floatie) to the end of the pool. Today I filled my wife's mini-van with gas to the tune of around $40. It was only a half-tank. Today I fed my baby boy his bottle while parked in a box-store parking lot, the a/c running, the kids in the store with their Mom, listening on the radio to Michael Savage talk about the new immigration bill passed by the U.S. Senate on AM 760. Today I fed an Australian Lorakeet sweet nectar while it was perched on my extended hand. Today I considered the fact that my autistic son may find his joy in working with animals, and may not. Today I ate a Tangelo, fresh off the tree. Next week maybe some peaches will be ready. Today I realized that I have spent over 3000 days with my wife, and just how lucky of a man I am. Today I play-acted - using action figures - Diego (Dora's cousin) hang-gliding from a glacier to save a Sloth who was stranded on a mountain, and drove him off to safety in a dogsled pulled by a dolphin. What the hell am I teaching my kids? Today I watched my dog - a black lab tipping the scales at over 100 lbs. - sitting in a patch of wispy pink flowers and lovingly savoring a fresh avocado that had fallen off a tree. How I wish I had the camera at that moment. Today I grew angry - yes, actually became angry (mildly, as I have a very long temper) at my son Colin for crying too much. Colin is under 5 months old. I should be clubbed for that particular emotion at that particular time. Today I met a one-eyed African antelope, who chose not to shun me even though I had no food pellets to offer him. He also patiently stood while my son Jason petted him roughly. Today I drove almost 100 miles. Today I realized - not for the first time - that my son Tyler's emotional enthusiasm makes him as endearing as it does frustrating. That kid is a handful! Today one of my sons fed ice cream to another one. Today I watched 1-1/2 episodes of a great sitcom called  Scrubs , and thoroughly enjoyed every hilarious minute of it. Today Tyler chose a Fox (which was actually a Lemur) and Jason chose a Rhinoceros. This is no indication of personality type - it was just random selection. Today I had a delicious, warm quesadilla of fresh Cotija cheese with roasted Jalapeno peppers, accompanied by sweet corn cake and pork carnitas, prepared Michoacan-style. Today I read a passage from a book from a wonderful author. It said,\"Love is only embarrassing to those who cannot love.\" I immediately wanted to grab my wife and kids, pull them into a town square (any town will do) and declare my undying love for them. But they are asleep. Maybe tomorrow. Today I enjoyed that special sensation of chilly night air caressing my mildly sunburnt cheeks. I love that. Today Jason said the following to just about anyone he met: \"What's your name? I'm Jason. I'm a boy.\" Have any words sounded sweeter? I don't think so. Especially when a little over a year ago we did not know if Jason would be able to speak. Today I realized that blogging is tremendously draining on one's imagination and creative furnace, and I have new-found respect for those I have read over the past couple of years. Today I realized that my life is moving forward at a hasty pace, and there is little I can do to stop it, much less slow it down.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2007", "body": "\nIt happens from time to time that I will run across two separate sources of information that somehow relate to one another, and the combination prompts additional thought. Today, one of these circumstances occurred. First was Kev's post titled  \"On Media, Neurodiversity, and Science\".  In it, Kev refers to the value of the scientific method and the value it has for ongoing progress in autism research. And, what's more, how those who espouse acceptance of Autism differ in their approach to information dissemination from those who espouse a cure for autism. Then, a few hours later, I came across an interesting opinion piece in  The Wall Street Journal.  It was authored by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former Deputy Commissioner of the FDA here in the U.S. Titled \"Journalistic Malpractice\", the article discusses the politicization of once-respected Medical Journals. He opens: \"As medical information is exploding and becoming more accessible, all of us, particularly physicians, need objective sources to interpret data and present a balanced view. Unfortunately, major medical journals that should be filling this role often put more weight on pushing political agendas.\"  Which, of course, leads to the point - not dissimilar from that made by either of my two cited sources named above. That is - the proponents of the mercury/autism connection consistently cross the boundary between rational thought and self-delusion. They arbitrarily assign validity to various positions based not on truth, reality, or data, but instead based on what most closely matches their accepted world-view. They apply their efforts more towards propaganda than towards analysis of existing information. Their weapons of choice in the ongoing debates are public relations, political pressure groups, media blitzes (witness Generation Rescue's notorious full-page newspaper  ad  or, most recently, the United Methodist Church-Women's Division  Simpsonwood Rally  to be held next week), and tort litigation. And one battleground of choice is the medical journal. The value of medical journals lie in their mission of \"informing clinical practice and maintaining standards for how rigorous clinical research ought to be conducted.\" (from Journalistic Malpractice, Gottlieb). In other words, commonly accepted standards are assumed to be in place, so that when one reads information in a journal of science, it can be safely assumed that the information has been objectively and critically reviewed by a panel of expert peers. Since the peers are doing the \"heavy lifting\" in terms of critiquing the methodology and conclusions, the reader (and eventual applicator of findings) can \"trust\" that the information is good. But wait! Even this vehicle is utilized by the mercury militia in their efforts to promulgate the ongoing, and harmful, myth about childhood vaccines and autism. An excellent description of the types of journals the maverick researchers who play in this sandbox subscribe to is found  here . This article by Kathleen Seidel illustrates that lowest of the low in medical journals - JAPandS (Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons). This journal makes no bones about its position on vaccines, stating on its website (excerpted from Neurodiversity Weblog, referenced above): \"AAPS opposes  \u201cmandated vaccination,\u201d  calls for its members to \u201cinsist upon truly informed consent for the use of vaccines,\u201d persistently questions the safety and efficacy of immunization to prevent infectious diseases, and offers dire scenarios of supposed threats posed to children by vaccination requirements for public school entry.\" So, basically, the editors have taken the position that they intend on publishing research that conforms to this standard, reality be damned. This is where one can look to find the research of such doctors as Jeffrey Bradstreet or the Geiers (well, at least the senior Geier is a doctor). In contrast, the Gottlieb piece is referring to to the New England Journal of Medicine (sister publication to The Lancet), known as a reliable, stand-up publication with strong ethical fiber. Gottlieb's article focuses mainly on last week's fiasco involving misleading conclusions published in the NEJM regarding the diabetes drug Avandia. It highlights the point that, even in the best ethical climate, politicization can and will frequently occur. It follows that in an environment such as JAPandS, editorial bias is almost assured. One interesting aspect of this article is its discussion of drug-safety testing conducted by the FDA, which is a primary target of mercury militia spite and ridicule. In Gottlieb's words: \"When it comes to the issue  du jour , drug safety, no description of medical research in a medical journal comes close to the detail level or scrutiny imposed by the FDA on study results before approval.\"  This statement jibes with a conversation I had a while back with a friend of mine who is a clinical trial director for a pharmaceutical testing company. I explained to her the theories advanced by those who believe in the whole FDA/CDC/Thimerosal conspiracy. She was astounded that anyone could believe that such a coverup was even possible. As she explained, drug testing and approval involves hundreds, sometimes thousands of people, and extremely rigorous standards of testing. If even one person of these hundreds decided to blow the whistle, the proverbial game would be over for any conspiracy. Yet, as has been shown time and time again, when the radical views of the mercury militia are contrasted to virtually any mainstream standard of epidemiology, biology, or even logic, the folly of their position is exposed. Of course, whenever the slippery supporters of this so-called theory come close to having a showdown with reality, they can ( and will ) easily reinvent their positions. And therefore the debate rages on and on and on, ad nauseum. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php", "http://www.generationrescue.org/images/052505.gif", "http://new.gbgm-umc.org/umw/news/news-1/division-examines-danger-of-mercury-containing-vaccines-drugs/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/91/", "http://www.aapsonline.org/testimony/vacresol.htm"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/05/journal-integrity.html", "title": "\nJournal Integrity\n"},

As the parent of a child with special needs, I would like to comment that elimination of transportation to and from school would create a hardship for not only my own family, but many thousands of other families as well. In reading a copy of the proposed regulations, it is clear that one prime motivating factor in making this proposal is to address the problem of excessive expenses to the CMS. The discussion of the regulations clearly implicates school districts' \"... improper billing ... for administrative costs and transportation services.\" It is unconscionable that the response to alleged fraudulent reporting/claims by the school districts is to eliminate the service altogether. Numerous alternative solutions exist, the most obvious of which is to install safeguards and auditing procedures that would eliminate the possibility of such fraudulent activity taking place in the future, thereby solving the problem while keeping the services intact. Elimination of these services amounts to an injustice against disabled students throughout the United States of America.

Tonight the  school  was  learning . Let me explain. The Special Ed Director of our district - a very small district in a semi-rural area tucked away in the middle of busy Southern California - called a meeting for all parents of students who are autistic. When we arrived, she had the white-board divided into 3 sections: Defining the format of ongoing meetings like this one, Short Term District Goals, and Long Term District Goals. The big surprise was that all that appeared under the Titles was - empty white board. Did she seriously mean to ask us  our  opinions on what form meetings and goals would take? Shock! Once we picked ourselves up off the floor, we got down to business. In attendance were 4 other moms, my wife and I, and - get this: the school psychologist, occupational therapist, and autism services consultant (a third-party provider) -  all on their own personal time.  A positively positive brainstorm session ensued, beginning with establishing the format and regularity of the meetings to be held in the future. It was decided that once every other month, alternating mornings and evenings, for 1+ hour sessions, we would meet. Additionally, one extra meeting for transitional assistance a few weeks prior to each school year. Then we got on to goals: Short Term Goals Improved collaboration between mainstream teachers and Sp.Ed. service providers, where  applicable ... Extra support for new school year/Fall transition in the form of trained \"floaters\" who are available to kids, parents, teachers, and even classmates to answer questions and help resolve issues.. Assign a permanent spot on the PTA for a parent of an special needs child (not necessarily autism)... Consider a Buddy system, wherein NT kids of same-grade would \"pair\" with students in the Sp.Ed. classroom for defined periods of time. Use this as an \"award\" for the NT kids - something they aspire to earn. (This idea makes me uneasy. I think it accentuates differences, and a caste system is implied, even if the intended outcome is positive. Any input on this would be appreciated)... Begin a \"Resource Center\", beginning with two titles -  My Friend with Autism  and  Rules Long Term Goals Sensitivity Training - many different methodologies were discussed on this topic, but no consensus reached. The idea is a good one, though, if implemented with forethought and care... Sibling Inclusion, wherein all siblings of special needs students would have some fun (bowling, swimming, etc) and be provided an informal forum in which they can share experiences and develop friendships... Fundraising for special events and services. One mom owns a skin-care clinic, and could provide free sessions. One mom makes gift baskets that could be sold. I own a wholesale fresh flower distributor, and could sell bouquets. We could make it work! Well, if by this time any of you have decided to immediately put your home on the market and move to our school district, then rest assured that you can hang out here on the weekends for  BBQ's  and a few icy cold ones. When roles are reversed like they were tonight, that's what I call PROGRESS.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/04/role-reversal.html", "title": "\nRole Reversal\n"},

Interoffice Memos do not come easily to me. When I handwrite I only use block letters, as cursive is a skill lost to me since junior high. And yet here I sit, writing. I am a husband to one, father to three, son to two, brother to one, brother-in-law to four, uncle to three (so far), and employer to around 40. I have one son, my oldest, who was diagnosed with autism about two years ago. Though at the time this discovery was a very difficult and emotional event for my immediate family, we have come to learn that my son's neurological differences are value-neutral. They are neither good nor bad. They are what they are. And I am an improved person for having been fortunate enough to have this little fellow impact my life. It occurs to me that, years from now, these words will be accessible to all three of my sons. At this very moment these words are able to be read by the other people who I value so much in my life.

This is also true of my other two boys (one of whom is 4 years old, the other 3 months), but is certainly accentuated by his behavioral and sensory differences.

{"date": "Monday, May 14, 2007", "body": "\nThere are many \"beaten paths\" in the realm of the Autism blogosphere. One path that I have found to be only rarely taken is the one that discusses the delicate balancing act performed by parents between having a successful career and having a happy family. These terms, in some minds, are mutually exclusive. To other minds, they are akin to necessity. In mine, well ... let's just say they do not conform to traditional paradigms. I have, by many definitions, a \"successful\" career. I am pleased and relieved by this. If I had to pick a word (which I don't, but for the sake of argument...), I would settle on 'fortunate' as the best one to describe my 13 years in the floral industry. I am the beneficiary, the porter, the trustee, the caretaker, and the workhorse (mind you, a workhorse is only 1/2 species removed from an Ass) of the Family Business. Our business procures and distributes fresh flowers to a very diverse customer base throughout North America. Our pleasure and pain lie in dealing with a beautiful, fickle, fragrant, perishable, emotion-driven, price-sensitive, color-saturated, margin-bereft product that would just as soon expire in the cooler as flourish on someone's dining room table. Oh, the drama! So anyway, I wake up each morning (just like you), thoughts brewing (just like yours) on the various topics of my own personal life and its inevitable clash with my professional life (schedules, trips out of town, preschool graduation ceremonies that clumsily overlap important meetings, a complete breakdown in personal energy and motivation coinciding with a complete breakdown of one of our trucks' transmissions). And, like all of you reading this, I strap on my boots (or whatever footwear applies in your circumstance) and march out to work. Now I would like to head off this diatribe by quoting a passage I just read this evening in a book by my Very Favorite Author. The Very Favorite Author is Mark Helprin. If anyone reading this blog has not yet discovered the pure joy of reading this man's literature, I suggest that you run - run! - to the nearest bookstore and purchase any one of his books. They are so damned good, they will forever recalibrate your opinion of what you  thought  you knew was good. The setting: An old man - late 70's - and a young man - 17 - by happenstance end up walking together 70 km from one spot in Italy to another over the course of two long days. The old man, full of wisdom, is just getting the measure of the young man in this passage: \"I'm going to tell you something that you may or may not understand, and I want you to memorize it and say it to yourself now and then, until, someday, you do understand.\" \"Is it long?\" \"No.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Nicolo,\" Alessandro said. \"Nicolo,\" Nicolo repeated. \"The spark of life is not gain.\" \"The spark of life is not gain.\" \"Nor is it luxury.\" \"Nor is it luxury.\" \"The spark of life is movement.\" \"Movement.\" \"Color.\" \"Color.\" \"Love.\" \"Love.\" \"And furthermore...\" \"And furthermore...\" \"If you really want to enjoy life, you must work quietly and humbly to realize your delusions of grandeur.\" \"But I don't have them.\" \"Start to have them.\" Now I'm not going to sit here and proclaim that I have gathered every hidden meaning and potential nuance contained in this short passage, but I will say this: To me, it means that no matter what you thought your goals were when you started the journey (read: career, parenting, etc), the very fact that the goal has transformed to something else while you thought you were watching intently is what, by extension, gives meaning to our day-to-day existence. I know as well as you do that to wake up, tighten the proverbial bootstraps, and head out for another day's work is not easy, but it is in our commitment (not the \"gain\", not the \"luxury\") that we find our color, our movement, our love. And therein lies the balance between career and family. It's not about reaching a career goal - how could it be, since the goal changes more quickly than we can conceive of it for even the briefest moment? The endpoint changes (movement), the value of achievement changes relative to immediate concerns (color), the joy experienced from the process shifts from topic to topic (love). Too much gain on one side, too much luxury on the other, and the balance is lost between the two. Having a child with special needs, for those of us who are so destined, means that our scales have more weight on  both  sides - the reward side, and the challenge side, and the balance struck between the two has been - at least in my case - just perfect.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/05/there-are-many-beaten-paths-in-realm-of.html", "title": "\nBalance\n"},

{"date": "Monday, May 7, 2007", "body": "\nIn my last  post , I offered part one of a two-part interview with the amazing wordsmith, Mark Twain. What follows is part two: Mr. Twain, I see that you have more than just a cursory familiarity with some of the science behind current knowledge of autism causation and treatment. But I would like to diverge from that topic for a while and discuss what autism is  really  all about. This is where your opinions as a wise and venerable ethicist and humanist are so valuable. When I first learned that my oldest son was autistic, I was, well, crushed. I well remember the ensuing days of scrambling for answers, for understanding. I have been quoted as saying that I will always regret my initial response, in that I failed to understand that the diagnosis did not rob me of the \"perfect\" son, but instead that it had rewarded me with a son who  is  perfect - in his own ways. This realization has brought much joy and relief into what was a difficult situation. Every man is a suffering-machine and a happiness-machine combined. The two functions work together harmoniously, with a fine and delicate precision, on the give-and-take principle. For every happiness turned out in the one department the other stands ready to modify it with a sorrow or a pain--maybe a dozen. But I still must acknowledge my sorrow, as it were. Though I have come to learn otherwise, it was as real and intense a feeling as I have ever known. Grief can take care of itself, but to get full value of a joy you must have somebody to divide it with. Yes, and that's exactly what happened. Not only my wife and I , but also my son's wonderful grandparents kind of banded together at the outset and determined that we would, no matter what, provide for his happiness. At the time, we weren't quite sure how to judge what form that happiness would take. You cannot depend on your judgment when your imagination is out of focus. Thank you for iterating the problem so well. I, at that point, had no \"imagination\" as to what Jason's outcome might look like. And therefore I did not know how to approach it. So there we were, trying to connect with Jason, and poring over all available literature and pursuing the list of resources that had been given to us at Children's Hospital at the time of diagnosis. Wow, what a mental exercise it was to try to accommodate all of this new information. When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain. With all due respect, that is easier said than done, Mr. Twain! But I see your point. And very soon, as we began to understand the nature of Jason's ways of interacting with the world - and how they differed from ours - we began to set aside our initial prejudices and see Jason for who he really was all along. When we do not know a person--and also when we do--we have to judge his size by the size and nature of his achievements, as compared with the achievements of others in his special line of business--there is no other way. His achievements were indeed noticeable and significant. We began to venture out with him more often, we learned to grow thick-skinned against the inevitable scorn that came from having a beautiful, physically healthy child who was apparently unruly and undisciplined to the unacquainted observer. Each man is afraid of his neighbor's disapproval--a thing which, to the general run of the human race, is more dreaded than wolves and death. Yes, well, as any parent of a young autistic child will tell you - that is a hurdle which must soon be overcome if the parents are to fulfill their role of exposing their child to fun and interesting experiences in the community. And, with all due respect, I don't believe your statement holds true for all people, perhaps most especially autistic people who may not be as \"honed in\" on gaining the approval of their social contacts. At least in the case of my son, just spending some time by himself and pursuing a favorite hobby makes him, well... ...as happy as a dog with two tails. Well said, though he probably won't express his happiness quite so emphatically. I still do worry about his future, though. Well, if the truth be known, I worry just as much about my other two boys, but in Jason's case the worries are more ... well ... targeted. Things such as bullying. Things like gaining a fulfilling job as an adult. Things like developing close friendships that will help him through the harder times in his life. Well, time will tell how each of these circumstances bear out, but we believe that if self-esteem and self-respect are in place, everything else is eminently possible. And that, therefore, will be the focus of our goals for our son. We can secure other people's approval if we do right and try hard; but our own is worth a hundred of it, and no way has been found out of securing that. I see you do understand what I mean by this, then. And also you see my ultimate challenge as a father to this great kid. Well, Mr. Twain, as opposed to an interview, this seems to have turned into somewhat of a dad-therapy session. Thank you for offering your time-tested insights, and I would like to offer you the final word on this broad subject. People are different.

{"date": "Saturday, April 21, 2007", "body": "\nI'd like to tell you about three cities. The first city is really more of a hamlet. It is known as  Colin's Landing . Colin's Landing is a quiet place, only recently having broken ground on its important buildings. As it is in its infancy, Colin's Landing has lots of development yet to undergo. There is very little hustle-bustle, and the streets are generally quiet. Strangley, Colin's Landing seems to not yet have found a schedule. It is as likely to be busy at 3 a.m as it is at noon. And even when it is busy, not a lot gets done. And many things still need to be implemented for a smooth transition to a larger village to be complete. The sewers, for example, are still under construction. As a result, backups and leakage occur frequently. This used to be easily manageable, but as the population steadily grows the problem becomes ... less savory. Fortunately, the citizens' needs are as simple as they can be - if everyone has a warm blanket, someone to snuggle with, is able to eat every 3 hours or so, and has a few simple diversions, then morale is very high. City developers are happy that manufacturing industries have been attracted to Colin's Landing's positive economic climate. Such players as diaper manufacturers and household cleaning supply distributors seem to have set up shop quickly and effectively. Mayor Lisa played a significant role in developing these industries, and manages their growth efficiently while putting their products to use on a daily basis through favorable government contracts. Colin's Landing is a simple, wonderful, comfortable place to visit. Our next city is  Tylertown . This place is a kick. The bars stay open late, even though they only serve chocolate milk and apple juice. Dancing in the streets is not only acceptable, it is  de rigeur . Founded only four years ago, Tylertown seems to have grown so fast that it faces urban sprawl soon. City planners are in a moderate state of panic about their ability to control growth while still ensuring safety for the citizenry. Some of Tylertown's most prominent citizens include the Power Rangers and Scooby-Doo (side note: recently, a crime ring was broken up that was operating out of the old cemetery. And it would have worked, too ... if it weren't for those meddling kids!) There are swingsets in every park, and the local tee-ball team, \"That's MY Ball\", is last in its division but having fun doing it. Despite the protestations of water-control advocates (named Steve), many residents have a permit for carrying a concealed squirt gun. Politics are blustery and over-the-top, consisting of one-man filibusters on citizen's rights to control their own property and to eat dessert for dinner. Tylertown, while very fun, is not a relaxing destination. Everything happens very fast, emotions run high - for better or worse - and chaos is the name of the game. Tylertown has a bright future ahead of it, and getting there is half the fun - just ask the citizenry. And last, but certainly not least, is  San Jason . San Jason is the oldest city in D county, and well-deserving of its reputation for serene beauty and measured pace. Though there really is no \"Saint\" named Jason, it was determined by city founders that the honorific would be applied due to the city's beatific nature. This city is incredible in its scope, humbling in its complexity, and somehow comforting to a degree not found in many cities its age. When driving the streets of San Jason, two things are readily apparent. First of all are the cars. Remarkably, they resemble Lightning McQueen, 'Mater, Sally, and Doc Hudson. Not just some of them  -  all of them. And, what's more, sometimes they just sit there - all lined up in perfect order. Also of note is that there are no other cars - just these cars repeated over and over.   A complete lack of diversity juxtaposed with an overriding sense of \"rightness\".  Second, although the street-map seems like a perfect grid when viewed from above, in reality the streets lead you to very unexpected places. Its as if a non-neurotypical mind designed the whole plan in an attempt to confound us NT drivers. Given enough patience, you will get where you need to go. It just might take you a little longer to get there. And don't be afraid to make a few stops on the way. My personal favorites are the ice cream shop (they serve 31 flavors, all of them chocolate) and Tidmouth Station (where Thomas, Percy, Gordon, and James sleep after Very Productive days spent being cheeky and fussy most of the time). Another interesting aspect of San Jason is that the restaurants all only serve three or four different kinds of foods. Oh well, \"...when in Rome...\"! San Jason has one very special feature - it is called  Autism Meadows . This place is a wonder, and it is the pride and joy of the city planners . Autism Meadows  sets San Jason apart from most 5-year old cities, and gives a special air, a special ambiance that other cities can't seem to match. There is a certain level of introspection, a lack of hostility, a uniqueness that is only to be found in this location. Sure, not everyone appreciates it. Some neighbors are even uncomfortable with it - they think it may reduce their property value or create \"disturbances\" in the neighborhood. But any real estate agent  who has done their research  would set them straight.  Autism Meadows  is a fine place, full of interest and wonder, and just about anyone I've met who has visited - despite the fact that it is not often listed in the tour guides - agrees that once you visit  Autism Meadows,  you realize that San Jason is one of the neatest, most special cities you could ever experience. In summary, D County has several wonderful destinations to choose from. They all have their charms, they all have their shortcomings. I hope you will visit these interesting locations and enjoy them like I have. Touring each one is a life-changing experience that is to be treasured and cherished. The best news is that every county you have ever visited has wonderful cities just like these. Don't focus on the road too much, or some of them will pass in a blink. Stop at each city, town, hamlet, or village and see what it has to offer. You never know what treasures you might find.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/04/tale-of-three-cities.html", "title": "\nA Tale of Three Cities\n"},

Also, please remind me to never enter into a logic debate with  Interverbal , as I will most certainly lose (he is probably critically analyzing my last statement, even though it compliments him). Let me not forget  Kev , that pot of gold at the end of the Google rainbow, who is the most commonly used launch pad for autism acceptance the world has ever known - literally. I know there are many of you who I have not included on this list, and no offense is intended by the ommission. I would strongly encourage any visitor here who has not reviewed the aforementioned blogs and any others that are included in the Autism Hub to do so. The question remains - what can I offer? Hence the name of my blog - One Dad's Opinion. Since I am seemingly unable to keep up to pace with the science, I am left with ... opinion. Since I am neurotypical and cannot accurately speak to the autistic perspective, anything I offer there is ... opinion. But I AM a Dad, and therefore I can speak about fatherhood utilizing ... well ... opinion. So there you have it. If you are interested in this Dad's opinions, you've come to the right place.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://notmercury.blogspot.com", "http://autismstreet.org/weblog/", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com", "http://bartholomewcubbins.blogspot.com", "http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com", "http://club166.blogspot.com", "http://joyofautism.blogspot.com", "http://momnos.blogspot.com", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/", "http://neurodiversity.com", "http://interverbal.blogspot.com", "http://kevleitch.co.uk"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/04/opinions.html", "title": "\nOpinions\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 1, 2007", "body": "\ndig\u00b7ni\u00b7ty  (d\u012dg'n\u012d-t\u0113) n. pl. dig\u00b7ni\u00b7ties 1. The quality or state of being worthy of esteem or respect. 2. Inherent nobility and worth I have come to learn that this is what its all about. It wasn't always this way for me. A little over 2 years ago, my oldest son was diagnosed with autism. At first, this was a tremendously wrenching event for my wife and I. Until that point, I had never come face-to-face with disability. Aside from the occasional encounter with a disabled person, I lived in a disability-free world. I was a disablist by default, without even knowing it. I had never even taken a bare moment of my life to consider disability seriously. Prior to judging me harshly for this admission, read on. It gets worse, and it also gets better. On the drive down to Children's Hospital for the developmental evaluation recommended by our pediatrician and the speech therapist, I was accompanied by my just-turned-three year old son. On the drive home, a mere 5 hours later, the spectre of Autism was strapped in the carseat behind me; silent, brooding, thieving the child my wife and I had conceived. Around me, on the busy highways of Southern California, thousands of people were going about their business on a typical sunny day. Meanwhile, I had been given the herculean task of raising a \"disabled\" son. And so began my metamorphosis. Little did I know at that time, in January of 2005, that my eyes would be opened to a world that had existed around me all my life, immediately within my grasp, but that I had not been aware of. The metamorphosis did not begin immediately. The initial shock was quickly supplanted by a predictable episode titled \"OhMyGodWhatDo WeDoNow!\" We filed with the state for services. We contracted with an agency for behavioral therapy. My parents immediately became involved in trying to help. We were referred to friends of family who had experience with autism. On and on it went. We were reacting to the autism, we believed that our family had the power to defeat this thing that had infiltrated our heretofore \"innocent\" lives. This went on for months, and I do not regret what was accomplished in terms of Jason's well-being (he is a very happy child who is thriving in so many ways) But what I did not realize was happening concurrently, and was most profound in framing all of our future endeavors regarding my autistic son, was that I was undergoing a metamorphosis. And here is the epiphany my wife and I had that led to this awareness: My son was born possessing dignity. He possesses \"the quality or state of being worthy of esteem or respect\". Autism did not change this. I, in my ignorance, allowed my perception of him to change in the few short moments it took for a psychologist to utter the words \"diagnosis: autism\". My son did not change in that moment - I did. And I will live my life regretting my brief lapse into self-pity. I momentarily robbed him of his dignity. Thank goodness I have recovered, and returned his dignity to him. Can you imagine the devastation I could have caused him had I not changed my views? He is a real person, and he deserves a father who appreciates and respects him for who he is. I grew up under the guidance of two parents who stubbornly and openly valued all I had to offer, no matter my shortcomings, and it is chilling when I realize just how close I came, however briefly, to robbing my own son of that same benefit. My metamorphosis in my views of \"ability\" vs. \"disability\" is one of the most profoundly positive things that has happened to me. And to whom do I owe the credit? To my son, Jason, who will someday understand that he has done as much to raise his father as I will ever do to raise my son. Prologue: On Friday last, my wife and I took the boys to the local pizza place. As we were fighting the dinner table battles commonly found in a family with two young boys and an infant (\"No, pepperoni is not a frisbee!\" or \"Sometimes lemonade is pink, please drink it anyway\" or \"The baby is too little to eat a meatball\"), in walks a man with his wife. This man was missing both his forearms - in their place he had prosthetic limbs. What was far more noticeable about him was his booming laugh and big smile. I do not believe he knew anyone in the restaurant, yet he stopped to chat with a few people on his way to the counter. A few years ago, I would remember the limbs, not the laugh. I would have unintentionally robbed him of his dignity before he ever had a chance to say \"Hello\" to me. This post is my submission to join the effort for  Blogging Against Disablism Day . Thank you to all my fellow bloggers for helping to protect the dignity of my son.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://secure.reference.com/premium/login.html?rd=2&u=http%3A%2F%2Fdictionary.reference.com%2Fbrowse%2Fdignity", "http://www.blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/05/blogging-against-disablism.html", "title": "\nMetamorphosis:  Blogging Against Disablism\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 30, 2007", "body": "\nOkay, they finally got it up and running. Generation Rescue, purveyor of autism myths, home of the \"rescue angels\", creator of false hope under the guise of biomedical treatments for autism, has reworked and rewritten their unbelievably misleading website. For those of you unfamiliar with the issue, GR sits at the epicenter of the mercury-causes-autism debacle. The founder, one J.B.  Handley , is a crass, obnoxious individual who has basically staked his entire reputation, all of his credibility, on one premise - that autism does not truly exist, that it is actually mercury poisoning. At least that's what he has been quoted as saying in print, on TV interviews, in person on  internet  forums and blogs, etc. Conveniently, they put a link to one of these interviews on the site itself (though the link is not seeming to work currently).  Here's  one that does. Over the last year or so, tremendous damage has been done to this failed hypothesis, most recently when the  CDDS  numbers in California showed that, as of Q4 2006, autism caseload was (still) on the rise, despite the almost-complete removal of  thimerosal  (mercury-containing preservative) from the childhood vaccine schedule back in 2001. Those who have all along supported this hypothesis despite a complete lack of evidence have grown more and more provincial in their defense of said position. The saddest thing about J.B.  Handley's  situation is that the behaviors of his own autistic son - absolutely promised by the father to be eliminated by  chelation  therapy (to remove mercury from the body) - can be construed as the final say-so on whether he is right or wrong, whether his credibility stays or goes. What an incredible burden to be placed on a child. So anyway, the most  noticeable  thing when first viewing the new GR site is that something is ... different. The goalposts have not just been moved, it appears they have switched to a whole new sport. The shift in thinking (read: backpedaling) is apparent in the following  statement : \"We believe these neurological disorders (\" NDs \") are environmental illnesses caused by an overload of heavy metals, live viruses, and bacteria.\" Really? And no mention whatsoever that, for years, until just today, the site's main message was \"Autism is Mercury Poisoning!\"  Hmmm . Seems like some explanations are in order. I'm not holding my breath. There is a section on Treatment. Predictably, it contains short statements on such wonders as mercury removal (DAN! protocol, Cutler protocol), Dr.  Yasko's  RNA ... stuff (more on that  here  and  here ), Methyl B-12 and  Valtrex , and Homeopathy. Wow. It reads like the who's who of unproven yet very expensive and time-consuming therapies. On the bright side,  Lupron  is noticeably absent, as are such marvelous treatments as medical marijuana and urine injections (though they list in their Hall of Fame a dealer of one of these treatments). Anyway, other  bloggers  will do a much more effective job than I of covering all of the misinformation housed on this site. My point is this - it is stunning to me that GR has \"reversed their field\" without offering any explanation of how WRONG (or, at the very least, incomplete by their own admission) their message has been for all these years. It is frustrating to me that more parents may be exposed to this crappy science, and that some will allow it to dictate their understanding of, their treatment approach to, and their attitude towards their autistic children. It is amazing to me that the same die-hard group of researchers, bogus therapy sellers, and cure-dependent parents can continue to perpetuate the untruths found on this website. It is offensive to me that my son is being referred to, in essence, as a vaccine/mercury-\"damaged\" child, when in truth he is a wonderful, amazing boy who is neurologically divergent from the norm.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?s=jb+handley+video", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://notmercury.blogspot.com/", "http://bartholomewcubbins.blogspot.com/2006/10/advertising-techniques-rna-and-autism.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/04/new-generation-rescue-site.html", "title": "\nNew Generation Rescue Site\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 16, 2007", "body": "\n This post is dedicated to the several people in my life who are about to, have recently, or might soon bring a baby into the world. For those of you who are reading this who are \"veterans\", your knowing grin will suffice as a reaction. Anticipating  parenthood consists of analyzing anecdotes, predicting sleep deprivation, planning for perfection, barely suppressed joy, and fear of the unknown. Of course, this does not capture all of the tremendous range of emotions one experiences prior to inviting a new life to join your family and, yes, the world, but it covers a few major points. Experiencing  parenthood is another thing altogether. In the first month or two, you realize that anecdotal advice only works with other people's children - not yours. You realize that the generalized fear of sleep deprivation is a pale reflection of the real thing. By around 6 months, all your plans to be the \"perfect\" parent in every way have evaporated more quickly than your diaper budget has. Your barely suppressed joy has blossomed into full elation (especially since baby's first smile). And your fear of the unknown has simply shifted forward, always staying about 2-3 weeks ahead of wherever you and baby are at this exact moment. Welcome to parenthood. Now I will summarize for you what, in my experience, is a barely adequate encapsulation of the next few years of parenting. Keep in mind two things: My oldest son is 5-1/2 years old (288 weeks, or 66 months for those of you who have young enough children to still think in terms of weeks or months), and he is also autistic.  That  never figured into the pre-parental plans, but there it is anyway! The age of my children (and therefore the experiences I have had) and the fact that I parent a child with atypical needs (and therefore the experiences I have had) color my view of parenting. Edit these biases out as you see fit. My summary consists of the following two words: Pushing and Pulling. I have found that parenting consists largely of these two acts. Both physically and metaphysically, literally and figuratively, actually and metaphorically, a hell of a lot of pushing and pulling goes on in our household each and every day. You pull the kids with you as you do \"parent\"-type things (like grocery shopping). You push them to eat things they don't want to. You pull them along to school. You push them to realize their potential - even if its only to speak a word or to create a collage of their favorite things. You pull them away from the TV to see a rarely-glimpsed Hummingbird Moth perched on a wall (ooooh, aaaaah). They do some pulling and pushing of their own. They pull you out of melancholy thoughts of a difficult day by proposing a lively game of \"Daddy Burrito\" (don't ask...). They push your otherwise-stoic demeanor into fits of near-hysteria over such things as spilling milk on the keyboard or seeing how much water they can splash outside the bathtub. They push your limits of patience while pulling you into a higher state of tolerance. You pull their little attitudes towards discipline while pushing their inquisitive minds towards ... further inquisition. So, like champions of tug-of-war and sumo wrestling, we push and pull our way through the process of parenting.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/05/pushing-and-pulling.html", "title": "\nPushing and Pulling\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 4, 2007", "body": "\nI recently sat down for the first in a two-part interview I plan to report on here on this \u2018blog. The subject of my interview was world-renowned autism expert, quotesmith, and humanist Samuel Clemens, a.k.a. Mark Twain. We covered several major topics relating to autism. Today\u2019s post will deal with one important area - the science. Causation and treatment are the main topics. What follows is a transcript of the interview. Thank you so much for agreeing to this interview, Mr. Twain. As your literary record shows, you have been quite a significant contributor in many areas of knowledge. Today I would like to tap into your expertise on a particular subject \u2013 the science of autism. For the benefit of the reader, lets start with some basic questions that will establish your position on some of the more controversial aspects of this topic. Okay, in looking at the issue in an overall sense, there seems to be a body of evidence that is driving a small portion of our medical, research, and parents\u2019 community to believe there exists a legitimate base of studies that would support the hypothesis that Mercury (in particular that contained in Thimerosal) can cause Autism Disorder. \u201cIt was just a snow-flurry on a warm day: every flake was distinct and perfect, but they melted before you could grab enough to make a ball out of them.\u201d I think I see your point \u2013 that the some of the research stands well enough alone, but that the sum of the results does not necessarily point to causation. \u201cYou can find in a text whatever you bring, if you will stand between it and the mirror of your imagination.\u201d Imagination? I\u2019m not sure I would brush it off quite so easily. After all, these are respected scientists and researchers who have publicly proclaimed that they \u201cknow\u201d this hypothesis to be true! \u201cBetween believing a thing and thinking you know is only a small step and quickly taken.\u201d But, Mr. Twain, of course you realize that the issues involved in establishing causation are incredibly complex, and certainly this hypothesis may stand as at least a starting point to really understanding what causes autism. \u201cSome things you can't find out; but you will never know you can't by guessing and supposing; no, you have to be patient and go on experimenting until you find out that you can't find out. And it is delightful to have it that way, it makes the world so interesting. If there wasn't anything to find out, it would be dull. Even trying to find out and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find out and finding out, and I don't know but more so.\u201d I understand that, but I think what the folks who pursue this hypothesis are really trying to do is determine the cause so that a cure can soon follow. Think about how miraculous that would be! \u201cThe difference between a Miracle and a Fact is exactly the difference between a mermaid and seal. It could not be expressed better.\u201d I apologize if I have overstepped my boundaries on this, Mr. Twain. I did not realize you felt so strongly on this issue. So, to clarify, it has been your opinion that the hypothesis that Mercury causes autism has no validity? \u201cIt was not my opinion; I think there is no sense in forming an opinion when there is no evidence to form it on. If you build a person without any bones in him he may look fair enough to the eye, but he will be limber and cannot stand up; and I consider that evidence is the bones of an opinion.\u201d Fair enough. Now, aside from the strict Mercury adherents in the causation/treatment debate, there are numerous other \u201cplayers\u201d. Perhaps we could branch off into discussing some of them. Since it is a current event, perhaps we could begin with a brief discussion of Generation Rescue and their new website. Until now, this organization has always proclaimed, loudly and clearly, that autism is a misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning. Now it seems they have broadened their scope to include general environmental insults, non-specific viruses, and non-specific bacteria. What is your initial reaction to this change in the message from Generation Rescue? \u201cYou are a coward when you even seem to have backed down from a thing you openly set out to do.\u201d Strong words, Mr. Twain! Though I understand you have a bit of a past with GR. Did you not once send them a letter in response to their inquiry on the efficacy of one of their recommended treatments? If so, what did the letter say?  \u201cDear Sir (or Madam):--I try every remedy sent to me. I am now on No. 67. Yours is 2,653. I am looking forward to its beneficial results.\u201d On the subject of letters, I also seem to recall you had sent one to a Mr. Arthur Allen prior to his public debate with one Mr. David Kirby, author of  Evidence of Harm . In it, you exhorted Mr. Allen to swallow his disbelief that Mr. Kirby could actually stand up before a group of scientists and proclaim that his mercury/autism theory had validity. Could you recount for us the contents of that partcular letter? \u201cMy Dear Sir: But you are proceeding upon the superstition that Moral Courage and a Hankering to Learn the Truth are ingredients in the human being's makeup. Your premises being wild and foolish, you naturally and properly get wild and foolish results. If you will now reform, and in future proceed upon the sane and unchallengeable hypothesis that those two ingredients are on vacation in our race, and have been from the start, you will be able to account for some things which seem to puzzle you now. Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.\u201d Ah, yes. But, after the debate, you must have been at least a bit impressed by Mr. Kirby\u2019s deft damage control since the 2006 CDDS figures put the last nail in the coffin of the mercury aficionados just one day prior to its occurrence. If you will recall, he immediately shifted his argument from vaccines being the source of mercury to things such as coal-burning factories in China and crematoriums in the U.S. I believe he even had some figures to back his argument up. \u201cFigures often beguile me, particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: \"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.\"\u201d My last question for this segment of the interview is this, Mr. Twain. There is a movement in the medical community known as DAN! These doctors (and non-doctors) follow the tenets of some of the theories you have so unflinchingly discredited throughout this interview. What advice do you have for parents who are considering working with a DAN! Doctor to \u201ccure\u201d their child\u2019s autism? \u201cMedicine has its office, it does its share and does it well; but without hope back of it, its forces are crippled and  only the physician's verdict  can create that hope when the facts refuse to create it.\u201d As always, a very profound insight Mr. Twain. This concludes Part 1 of this 2 part interview with esteemed humanist Mark Twain. I hope you will join us for Part 2 \u2013 Mark Twain on the Autism: The People \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/05/mark-twain-on-autism-science.html", "title": "\nMark Twain on Autism:  The Science\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 12, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday, we completed the two-month process of establishing Jason's IEP for the upcoming school year. I will make a bold statement here, knowing that many factors can effect the outcome of this IEP over a year's time: Jason has ended up with a best-case scenario. Let this process, approached in a spirit of cooperation by the school staff and administration as well as my wife and I, serve as a guide for how these things should unfold. It started a couple of months ago, with an IEP meeting intended to set the IEP goals. While my wife and I were urgently wanting to move on to the discussion of placement (mainstream or Special Ed, classroom aide involvement, etc), the administrator who headed the process would not allow the meeting to broach that topic. It was explained carefully and concisely that the content of that meeting was to consist of just one thing: IEP goals. We protested this, based on the idea that goals cannot be accurately set without knowing what learning environment our son was to be placed in. Instead of derailing the entire meeting, though, we simply asked that our objection be recorded in the IEP notes and allowed the meeting to move forward productively. Numerous goals were recommended, discussed, and agreed upon. We left that meeting knowing that the goals were good, but not knowing how they would be achieved. We then got to work on determining how best to make a case that Jason can succeed in a mainstream classroom with the help of a full-time Classroom Aide trained in topics related to Autism. Here is how the logic flows: Jason, under LRE (Least Restrictive Environment), has the right to be educated in a mainstream classroom if he is academically and behaviorally up to the task. We know that he is. Jason, once \"accepted\" into the mainstream classroom, must be provided whatever learning supports he requires to successfully complete the academic requirements of the grade level (in this case, Kindergarten). The district is required, under FAPE (Free and Appropriate Education), to provide Jason the minimum level of service required for the \"success\" criterion (completing the grade-level requirements) - no more, no less. Thus, the burden was on us to \"prove\" to the school that Jason needed SLT and OT, and most importantly (and expensive to the district) a full-time aide. The district had already stated that Jason should/would continue to receive SLT and OT services. This left the all-important aide issue. We did this by focusing on three areas where Jason needs support: Meeting his IEP goals: Since the goals had already been agreed upon by the IEP Team, we demonstrated that the goals  could not  be met without the support of an aide. Successfully Completing Curriculum: Since Jason requires such basic supports a help gripping a pencil properly, and responding to multi-step verbal instructions, he will need ongoing support from an aide to complete his classwork. Succeeding in Classroom Behavior: Jason is not the type to spontaneously engage his peers, nor is he likely to easily adapt to classroom rules and expected behaviors. Oh, sure he can do it, but not without some help along the way. For this purpose, and aide is also required. Having listened to our case, the district agreed that our submitted reasons were sufficient justification to hire (or assign) a full-time Classroom Aide for Jason next year. Without our working knowledge of the IEP process and its associated legal guidelines and student rights, without a proactive and student-oriented school staff and administration, without full cooperation among everyone involved in the process, this outcome could not have been achieved - at least not without much rancor and debate. Special thanks go to Grandma and Poppa for watching the boys and taking Jason to his horseback riding session while we conducted the meeting. I must end this post now, as my wife and I need to go do the \"IEP Victory Dance\". \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/05/best-case-cenario.html", "title": "\nBest-Case Scenario\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 2, 2007", "body": "\nThere has been a discussion taking place in the halls of the Autism Hub over the last few days.  For most of us I think this discussion has been .... uncomfortable, to say the least.  The earliest comments of the debate were here on  my blog , coming from Larry (Laurentius Rex), an autistic man who is a long-time Hub blogger, autistic advocate, and board member of the NAS in the UK, among other things.  After our brief discussion, he posted  this entry  to his blog.  This led to the most intense aspect of the debate, which took place  here .  Since then, many Autism Hub bloggers have posted their thoughts on the issue, which has turned somewhat acrimonious.  I'd like to offer my two cents on the topic. Let's start with a definition: advocacy noun active support of an idea or cause etc.; especially the act of pleading or arguing for something Advocacy seems to be at the heart of the issue.  In my view, advocacy can take many forms.  One manifestation is when a member of a community/class/group/race speaks out or otherwise takes action for the betterment of his group.  Another is when a individual does so for himself (self-advocacy).  Another, simply by definition, is when a community/class/group/race is supported by someone outside their own boundaries.  Needless to say, there are many other forms of advocacy - an almost infinite number, to be sure.  One primary point being discussed in this debate is;  Who is qualified to advocate for autistic people?  I think, based on the comments I have seen, that everyone involved in this discussion agrees that autistic people are  most  qualified to advocate for other autistic people.  By saying so, I am not indicating that I feel non-autistics are  incapable  or  should not  advocate for autistic people.  As strong (if not stronger) an ethical obligation exists for a parent to advocate for their young child as exists for an autistic person to advocate for their community.  I see it as in no way inappropriate for thoughts originating from parents of autistic kids and autistic adults to coexist peacefully on the Autism Hub.  I do, however, acknowledge that Larry is making a very important point, and perhaps the main point of the entire debate/discussion:  Whether or not the Hub is where it happens, autistic adults need to not only self-advocate, but advocate for the entire population of autistic people loudly and strongly.  Which leads me to my next definition: leadership noun 1. the activity of leading; \"his leadership inspired the team\" 2. the body of people who lead a group; \"the national leadership adopted his plan\" 3. the status of a leader; \"they challenged his leadership of the union\" 4. the ability to lead; \"he believed that leadership can be taught\" Please notice, first of all, the the definition of leadership implies the following applicable characteristics:  Activity, status, and ability.  While all of the autistic adults who I have read and enjoyed communicating with (mainly via the Hub) have all of these prerequisites, most any child does not.  Much has been commented in regards to parents \"speaking for\" their kids.  I submit that, until a certain age, parents are morally correct and morally obliged to do just that.   We must provide  leadership  in the form of role-modeling, inspiration, motivation, fulfillment of basic and complex needs, etc. to our kids.  Then there is leadership in the autistic community.  I have yet to see an example on the Autism Hub of an NT parent attempting to take a leadership role that supersedes input from autistic individuals.  The very fact that our voices exist on the Hub, and on certain days and on certain topics may be louder than those offered by our autistic fellows on the Hub, in no way indicates that there is an attempt to \"hijack\" (to use Larry's word) the Hub from autistic people.  I am working hard to not feel offended by the implication.  I will assume, unless told otherwise, that Larry's position on this assumes a lack of  intent  on part of the parents to drown out autistic voices, that instead Larry is advising that we be cautious that the contributors on the Hub do not become so imbalanced that the autistic bloggers become displaced. One message my wife and I plan to communicate carefully to our son is this:  Being autistic does not entitle him, or anyone else, to  preferential  treatment.  It is his god-given right to fight for  equal  treatment.  There is a difference.  And I, for one, hope that my presence on the Hub does not work to the detriment of the  equality  of all contributing persons.  If I were convinced it was doing so, I would cease immediately.  Otherwise, I plan to continue on.  And I plan to do so in a spirit of Fellowship, which is my last definition: fel\u00b7low\u00b7ship        (f\u011bl'\u014d-sh\u012dp')    n.    The condition of sharing similar interests, ideals, or experiences, as by reason of profession, religion, or nationality. The companionship of individuals in a congenial atmosphere and on equal terms. A close association of friends or equals sharing similar interests. This is how I view the Autism Hub in its current incarnation - a place of Fellowship.  On the home page is the following \"Mission Statement\": \"Autism Hub promotes diversity and human rights, with ethics and reality as the core guiding principles;  aspects include empowerment/advocacy, acceptance, and a positive outlook.\" I see no cases where this mission statement is violated, by any contributor to the Hub.  My summary is as follows:  If all of us who enjoy the benefits of having a place on the internet such as the Autism Hub can act in the spirit of Fellowship, understand that there are many aspects to the issue of Advocacy (all of which are valid and acceptable), and let the autistic people who choose to do so provide Leadership, I think we all will be better people for it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://laurentius-rex.blogspot.com/2007/05/four-legs-good-two-legs-bad.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=552", "https://secure.reference.com/premium/login.html?rd=2&u=http%3A%2F%2Fdictionary.reference.com%2Fbrowse%2Ffellowship"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/06/advocacy-leadership-fellowship.html", "title": "\nAdvocacy, Leadership, Fellowship\n"},

Online can be found any number of media in which autistic individuals, professionals who work with autistic people, and parents of autistic children can go to for information, conversation, debate, humor, support, and sharing. Those of us in the world today are the beneficiaries of what still seems to me to be amazing technology that facilitates this communication. And each \"movement\", as it were, has its leaders. A man who I view as a leader in the community of autism acceptance is  Kevin Leitch . Kev has been a visionary in defining formats for discussion online about all things related to autism, and one of his most recent efforts has to be considered one of his best. I am referring to the  Autism Parents' Forum . Before I go any further in describing the forum, I must also give accolades to another leader in the autism community -  Estee . Estee made the APF possible by dedicating space on the  TAAP  server. Thanks, Estee! And readers - please take the time to look at Estee's blog and The Autism Acceptance Project's website - they are wonderful. Back to the Forum. It is divided up into numerous topics, including areas of discussion such as education, current media that focuses on autism, \"Ask Autistic People\", and medical issues, to name a few. Want to discuss Home Education? Look  here . Care to talk about something clever, cute, or funny your child has done or said? Check  this  thread out. Would you like to discuss a recent news article on autism? Post comments  here  and see who joins you for discussion. Some of us proud parents just want to post a picture of our adorable child. That's what the  gallery  is for (members only!). Want to talk about a cure for your child's autism? Then find another place, because the Forum is not geared towards this type of discussion. After 1123 posts to date, there has yet to be found any rancorous debate on the APF. It was founded by Kev to be a \"safe haven\" for positive, productive discussion to the benefit of all autistic individuals in society - and to benefit parents who are more worried about their children having a positive outcome in life than whether or not they are autistic. Myself and two wonderful ladies -  Sharon  in Ireland and Bullet in England - moderate the forum, and will strive to maintain a positive, productive environment in which comfortable discussion of many topics can flourish. Looking forward is this bit of good news. Having successfully established the Forum, Kev's next ventures include the Autism Parents Hippodrome (where parents race wild-eyed stallions on an oval track - wagers are welcome) and the Autism Parents Coliseum (where parents pit their gladatorial skills against one another in battles to the death).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/", "http://www.autism-forum.co.uk/", "http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.taaproject.com/", "http://www.autism-forum.co.uk/index.php?topic=61.0", "http://www.autism-forum.co.uk/index.php?topic=114.0", "http://www.autism-forum.co.uk/index.php?board=7.0", "http://www.autism-forum.co.uk/index.php?action=gallery", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/05/forum.html", "title": "\nThe Forum\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 11, 2007", "body": "\nOne of the main questions many parents of autistic children have is, \"What will my child's adulthood look like?\" There are many aspects to this question. Topics such as marriage, children, place of residence, career, education and overall quality of life all play into it. I have recently been thinking a bit on the career side of the issue. The more I look at it, and the more I consider specific items of current research findings, the brighter I feel the future looks for gainful employment of persons with autism. Those who have taken the time to consider and understand the range of strengths that autistic individuals have I think can agree that problems in employing said individuals are job-related, not so much person-related. Autistic indivudals do not have identified deficits in reasoning or other cognitive capabilities \u2013 the differences tend to fall more in the area of social and communicative areas. In other words, given the right employment circumstance, anyone can be productive. I think that, as the digital/information age advances (providing ample technological communication/commerce formats), as global trade barriers continue to erode (forcing issues such as language aside), the opportunity for autistic people who exhibit significant communication differences from NT's will expand dramatically. Civilization has advanced in the amazing, relentless way that it has in large part due to trade and commerce. Not only has trade been one of the \"prime movers\" of ongoing development of civilization, it has also been a strong facilitator of progress. For example, look at the Roman Empire. It was built on trade - using economic motivations to expand territory, establish long-range, effective communications, defining legal and political systems in which trade disputes could be addressed, etc. Military might, though more emphasized in the context of history, was secondary to trade in ancient Rome- without the motivating factor of commerce, there would have been no need for expansion and technological advancement, and hence a lesser need for a strong military. The point to be taken from this is that a free economic marketplace is perhaps the most powerful determinant of the success or failure of any venture. Or, applying the same reasoning to autism advocacy, should autistic individuals exhibit strengths in the application or development of new business technologies, the acceptance/advocacy movement will be changed forever. And I feel that some recent research findings relating to Autism, combined with what I perceive to be a subtle, but massive, shift in focus in the world of commerce may just provide a far more level playing field for autists to display their prodigious talents. Trade\u2019s positions as motivator and facilitator may just now be crossing into areas that positively affect autistic people, in other words While recognizable historical advancements in humans' ability to trade are well-defined (stone age/colonial age/industrial age/space age), only with the most recent major changes have the most basic elements of trade been changed. Historically, a couple of prerequisite attributes which have only recently begun to be understood, have dictated who could effectively perform the front-line duties involved in commerce, attributes which do not continue to play as big a role. These attributes have recently been given labels - Mirror Neurons and Trust-Busters. Mirror Neurons (MNs), as a quick Pubmed search would indicate, have been closely studied in relation to autism. 16 separate studies are currently listed. Mirror Neurons, in essence, are typical motor neurons that are specially recognized because they not only \u201cfire\u201d when assisting the self in performing an act, but also when observing another individual performing an act. You may have a group of neurons that fire each time you grasp something with your hand \u2013 a subset of those neurons, the \u201cmirror neurons\u201d, will fire when observing a friend grasp something with their hand. While it is not currently known if MN dysfunction affects all individuals with ASD, certainly the research indicates that it is prevalent (Williams, JH 2005, Oberman, LM 2005, Ramachandran, VS 2007). It is the MN system that may contribute to some of the most apparent social differenes between autistic and NT people. Trust-Busters, as they are not yet a subject of research as relates to Autism, are less firmly established but likely also play a role in ASD. The term loosely refers to behavioral tendencies or characteristics which lead one person to a lower level of trust in another. Some examples of this would be: sarcastic tone, shifty eyes, over-urgency of communication, promising more than can realistically be delivered, etc. Trust-busters are built into the neurology of the observer, not the performer. Trust-busters, unlike MNs, are not firmly qualified in the field of science. I have to ask my readers to take a leap of faith with me here, and assume that MN dysfunction can lead to a lesser ability to perceive commonly accepted trust-busters. By not easily perceiving, via the MN system, when a person is clearly lying during an interpersonal exchange, the \u201ctrust-busting\u201d system is impaired in function as well. Business Ethics have, since the dawn of commerce, played an extremely significant role in moment-to-moment, day-to-day transactions. Business Ethics (and, accordingly, the rule of law) largely are in place to avoid the ability of one party to exert their will on another. What has long been obvious by common sense but is now, as discussed prior, being cast in a scientific light, is the role a person\u2019s cognitive attributes play in the ability to successfully negotiate and conclude a complex business interaction. And what\u2019s more, it is obvious that many of the ethics-based actions expected by both parties in business interactions cannot be controlled in an electronic environment. Take, for example the handshake. In western culture, it is traditional for a deal to be confirmed with a handshake. The strength of the handshake, the length, the openness with which it is presented, the direct eye contact while it is taking place, the smile that accompanies it (or doesn\u2019t) \u2013 all of these are powerful social cues that leave each person involved with the interaction a clear impression of the results of their efforts. Historically, those who have a lesser ability to perform and understand these social cues are at a tremendous disadvantage in the world of commerce. In a digital environment, the closest equivalent is probably an electronic signature \u2013 something that is clear and purposeful, with no room for misunderstanding or hidden meaning; not at all based on social cues, but only on a concrete basis. And that, in my view, is what is changing so much. Digital business environments, due to the need to establish new ways to enforce business ethics, are establishing platforms of trade that diminish the importance of social cues and complex negotiations. Global trade has forced individual cultures to not only force themselves to understand and accommodate the \u201ccomfort zones\u201d of other cultures, but also to build ways to conduct business that minimizes the impact of cultural and language differences. As this trend progresses to its logical end \u2013 a trade environment free of the necessity to understand the trade partner\u2019s cultural background and that ensures a transaction in which business ethics are guaranteed to be in place regardless of involved individuals disparate abilities to perceive and understand the communication of them \u2013 opportunities for autistic individuals to work in fields (such as sales or purchasing) that have previously been difficult for them to penetrate will increase. It is well-recognized (though anecdotal, as far as I know) how over-represented autistics are in certain fields such as software development and engineering as compared to other fields. These are fields that require of their workers many of the strengths that autistics possess. They also require much less of their workers of the skills that autistics tend to be weaker in. Imagine a situation where virtually all career paths are less dependent on high-level social functioning (MNs and trust-busters). This is the direction I see things going in. Take a field such as financial analysis \u2013 people who are looking to pay a financial analyst for their services are looking primarily for two things: expertise in the field (evidenced by performance) and a high degree of trustworthiness (evidenced, varying by culture, in social cues indicating that \u201cI understand your need to perceive and can mirror back to you my trustworthiness\u201d). While expertise is not an issue for autistic people who are willing to learn this trade, evidencing trustworthiness can be, due to differences in social functioning. Currently, due to this difficulty, it is more challenging for an autistic person to break into that field than a non-autistic person with equal levels of expertise. Is this fair? No, but no one is \u201cdeciding\u201d to shut out autistics \u2013 it just happens as a matter of long-established societal expectations of the behavior of this particular professional field. As technology advances, this will likely change, allowing a more level playing field for autistic people in many fields. This is a complicated topic, and I hope I am doing it justice with a proper explanation. To summarize it briefly: I think that autistic people will have an steadily increasing ability to select careers of their choice in the future, as foundational obstacles that result from social and communication differences specific to Autism Disorder are diminished in importance due to changes in generally accepted business transaction environments.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/06/on-job-opportunities.html", "title": "\nOn Job Opportunities\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 16, 2007", "body": "\n Friday after work I had the pleasure of going to see Jason's preschool graduation. This was actually Jason's second, but much more challenging of the two. The prior day he went through his special ed class graduation - a very small affair as there are only 6 kids in the class. But Jason splits time between that class and the \"typical\" or \"mainstream\" class, and Friday was that class' ceremony. Many more kids. And a group of parents generally unaware of special needs students' particular brand of ... unpredictability. It was a rousing success! They opened the ceremony by filing all the kids single file into the auditorium. Jason was 2 kids from last in line. They then performed the Pledge of Allegiance. Jason spoke along with all the kids - he definitely has this one down pat. The only notable thing was that Jason was the only person in the auditorium not oriented toward the flag in the corner behind him. No big deal. Then it was singing time. They started with a song about a turtle named Tiny Tim. Jason mouthed along with the crowd (he is not much of a singer by choice) and tried to look interested. That song came to an end and then they segued into a much longer one about rainbows and such. That song required lots of hand and arm movement (making arches and such) and, again, Jason acquitted himself beautifuly. I must mention here that one little girl was .. just .. belting .. out .. the song. It was  classic . Huge smile, dramatic movements - she was a little Shirley Temple. Defeinitely a future American Idol contestant - and winner. Last was the presentation of the certificates of graduation. This was where Jason stood out most noticeably - to us and us alone. One teacher read the names and the other handed out the paper certificates. As each one was given to a child, the child would invariably hold it out for all to see, seek his/her parents in the crowd, and beam at them. Not our boy! He got his diploma, and promptly began reading it. Never mind that he is probably the only kid in the class who is  capable  of reading it, and could have done it 8 or 10 months ago as easily as now. So, instead of our kid beaming, Lisa and Grandma and I were. It was great. Jason is in the light blue shirt. Jason's little brother Colin had a great time, too, as evidenced by his smile. Oh, and the teachers shared with us after the ceremony that the only reason they did two songs, and not the traditional one song, was that Jason throughout the year just loved the Tiny Tim song. They did it just for him, in order to make him comfortable. What a difference a caring set of educators makes! Everyone should be so lucky. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/RnSz1YF6WOI/AAAAAAAAAA8/CWhd2vATgkU/s1600-h/Graduation+June+2007+004.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/RnS0l4F6WPI/AAAAAAAAABE/nTVAV68-AAI/s1600-h/Graduation+June+2007+001.jpg"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/06/graduation.html", "title": "\nGraduation!\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 14, 2007", "body": "\nI've been tagged for the Eight Random Things Meme by Bev at  Asperger Square 8. The rules: 1. Let others know who tagged you. 2. Players start with 8 random facts about themselves. 3. Those who are tagged should post these rules and their 8 random facts. 4. Players should tag 8 other people and notify them they have been tagged. Before we begin, I must share this: I read Bev's post in which she tagged me, then told my wife about it and explained that I must share 8 random or unusual things about myself. Her response required no forethought: \"For you, that should be easy.\" So here we go: 1) I am socially, politically, and economically conservative. If there are any of you whose initial reaction is that this seems at odds with my feelings about autistic rights and providing proper supports to people with all types of disabilities, then your understanding of conservativism does not agree with mine. 2) I am a die-hard aficionado of historical fiction. My personal favorite authors of this genre are (not necessarily in this order): Gary Jennings, Jack Whyte, Mark Helprin, and Neal Stephenson. I find that presenting history in this format somehow shortens the years between then and now, and makes otherwise distant occurrences seem much more real and relevant. 3) The CD changer in my car has the following music in it at this exact moment: Rage Against the Machine, Beck, the soundtrack from  The Mission , Arctic Monkeys, Flogging Molly, and Outkast. Needless to say, I have very strange taste in music. 4) Back in college, a friend and I spent over 4 hours trying to construct our very own palindromic sentence. I would love to place the sentence here, but we never did figure one out. 5) Back in 1994, I lived with a Ferret named Freda. Ferrets are somewhat discomforting to live with, in that they constantly stare at you and you just know they are thinking, \"If I were any bigger than I actually am, I would eat you right now.\" 6) In my life B.K. (Before Kids), I used to be quite the home cook. This was before there were whole television channels about how to be a home cook. One memorable recipe went like this: Pound flat some chicken breasts. Place a combination of diced Papaya and Prosciutto on chicken, then roll up. Dredge chicken breasts in a mixture of flour, curry powder, and coconut flakes. Saute chicken in butter. Remove chicken, add to saute pan shallots and saute until soft. Add light cream, and lime juice. Serve sauce over chicken. Yummy. 7) A few years ago I figured out the Meaning of Life. But I forgot to write it down. 8) I refuse to use Spellcheck on principle. I lament the ongoing degradation of general language and writing skills in the modern world, and this is my little way of rebelling on a daily basis. So, having spilled the paint that is my quirky self onto the canvass that is the internet, I feel as if a Jackson Pollock-like result has decidedly not been the result. And now I must move on to tagging 8 more victims. There are two bloggers I really like who are not part of the Hub. I would like to learn more about them them, and this meme is a great way to do so. Therefore, VAB at  Autista  and  Alyric  at A Touch of Alyricism are tagged.. There are several folks who I read regularly, but would love to know more about and to hear their 8 things. They are:  Andrea ,  Amanda , and  Joel. I have always appreciated the \"science contributors\" on the Hub, and am therefore tagging  Dad of Cameron , and  Kev . Last, but most certainly not least, is someone who has not been very active on his blog anytime recently. Perhaps this meme will temporarily drag him out of hibernation.

{"date": "Sunday, June 24, 2007", "body": "\nChoices are funny things. When I was young, it seemed that choices were very black and white. Will I have chocolate or vanilla ice cream? Will I watch Scooby Doo or Superfriends? Will I play with Jonathon or Travis today? Because I was a simpler person, being a little kid, I had simpler choices.Any adult, I think, will agree with me that choices are just not so simple anymore. It seems that about 100 times per day I am in a position to make a choice, and that there are not just two options to go with. To draw an analogy, choices or 'tests' in life progress from true/false, to multiple choice, to word problems, to essay questions. I sincerely hope they don't become too much more complicated than they are now, because the next logical step in my analogy is doctoral thesis, and I frankly don't want to have to deal with any of those.For parents of children with special needs of any and all kinds (in my case, I have an autistic son), the predictable set of choices you will be faced with looks different than those of parents with \"typical\" kids. In our case, the set of choices we dealt with, in retrospect, followed a clear chronology, though to be sure this chronology is not true for all parents in a similar situation.Though I present our choices in X vs. Y format, this is not intended to imply there are only two choices, as I explained above. Acceptance vs. Denial When we received Jason's Dx, we entered uncharted, for us, territory. We frankly had no idea what to do first. We knew we wanted to help Jason in any and every possible way. We did not know how to do this. Jason at that point responded to us very little and had no working communication skills other than pulling us in the general direction of things he wanted and crying when something was wrong. We had no choice but to rely on \"experts\" and literature. My wife and I are not \"joiners\", so support groups and the like were not at the top of our list.Any and all information we gleaned at that time, though, was to be viewed in the light we cast on it. We had a choice to accept the Dx, or to deny that our son had been Dx'd correctly. I do not remember a time that we flat-out denied the fact that Jason was autistic. I do, however, remember that \"curing\" his autism was something we viewed as a goal. For those of us in the Western world, it is difficult to accommodate a situation that does not have a cure - that some brilliant scientist, therapist, surgeon, or inventor can put a Silver Bullet into the problem and *snap* make it disappear. So, we accepted Jason's autism and set out to help him in any way, the favored way being to find a cure. Cure vs. Treatment I am the Thinker, and my wife is the Doer in our family. I took my role seriously, and began to research autism. Of course, I went to the internet. I spent about 6 months looking at all recommended treatments and cures for autism. I parsed and supplied the info to my wife (and my parents, who were a huge help through all of this), who initiated the plans. One month after Jason's diagnosis, he was enrolled in an behavior modification/skill acquisition program (I describe it thusly because, though the agency used some ABA principles, it is in no way Lovaasian-ABA). We began to research support/funding available from the state. We had an appointment set up with a DAN! doctor. We had instituted treatments, and were working on finding a cure. I heard about mercury, and began to grow angry. I read about chelation, and began to grow hopeful. Jason would be saved!A little later in the process, a few weeks before meeting with a DAN! doc (after a bad experience with another one we had been referred to), I typed into Google for the first time \"Autism Blog\". I found Left Brain/Right Brain. As I read, I felt like I was on the verge of an epiphany. Not only, according to the author of the blog and all available links, were the proposed cures being sold not effective, they were harmful in many cases! Not only did acceptance of Jason's autism mean not denying it, but it also meant that I should accept Jason for who he is and not try to \"de-autism\" him! And this wasn't just one guy talking - it was a whole community. And most of them were autistic adults! Wow. I had never (knowingly) talked to an autistic adult before. It turns out, I realized, there are many, many autistic adults who would not take a cure if it was offered. This resulted in a whole new paradigm of thought. I have said before that we would have arrived at this conclusion on my own, we just reached it a lot faster with the help of the Neurodiversity community online. Overparenting vs. Underparenting Now that we knew a cure was not going to be found (though there were certainly plenty of people trying to sell us one), we had to decide - what is best for Jason? We settled into the following group of approaches: Behavior Modification Therapy: As I stated above, this is not really ABA. There is some record-keeping done after sessions (not during). There is no negative reinforcement. It focuses on skill acquisition, parent-training, and communication skill development. Jason loves to do it, and his therapists have become some of our closest friends. Hippotherapy: We take Jason weekly to ride horses at a very special place called R.E.I.N.S. Horseback riding is said to improve gross and fine motor coordination, provide an opportunity to \"bond\" with the horse, provide self-confidence with the skill acquisition, and numerous other benefits. To my knowledge, none of these are proven to be true. We don't care, as Jason loves it, and its a very healthy hobby to have. SLT: Jason's speech was very slow to develop, and is still very atypical at age 5. That's it. Jason's progress over the years is very comparable to the anecdotal stories we hear from all areas of the autism community, especially those who pursue some of the more extreme biomedical treatments. When deciding what to do to help Jason, we always think to ourselves \"When Jason is an adult, will he look back and believe this was something we did TO him, or did FOR him?\" This feels like a good approach. This way, we are doing everything we can to help him grow and progress (avoiding underparenting) while not reacting too strongly to his autism that we put him in situations that are unhealthy for him physically or psychologically (avoiding overparenting). By carefully listening to autistic adults, this is not all that hard to do. \"Equal\" vs. \"Special\" Probably our most current decision-making is based on how Jason fits in with the family, our and his friends, and general society. One way to look at this is in how he is treated and what expectations of him and others that we have - is he \"equal\" or \"special\". How we deal with various situations ranging from misbehavior to achievement is dictated by this difference. There is too much to discuss on this topic to include in this post, so I will leave it with this brief statement, and discuss it further next time I write: Jason, like every human being, is Special. The fact that he is autistic is simply the most easy-to-identify aspect of his special nature. But the goal is for him to be perceived as an equal by his peers. His autistic nature does not place him above or below anyone - it simply is part of his makeup. He is both Special and Equal. These are just a few of the choices we made (though they are some of the biggest ones) over the past 2.5 years. We hope we've gotten it right so far, and hope to be right more than wrong in the future.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/06/choices_24.html", "title": "\nChoices\n"},
{"date": "Monday, July 9, 2007", "body": "\nHello again! After a two-week hiatus which consisted partly of a family vacation (more on that in another post), I have returned to the blogosphere. And the reason I am writing today is that I feel just a little bit inspired. Today, I attended day 1 of three-day Autism Conference at the University of San Diego. USD is my alma mater, and today is the first time I have really spent any time on campus since I graduated 14 years ago. I even walked up and spent a few moments in front of my freshman dorm room, which is situated, like all rooms in this building, on an outdoor-corridor. I stood there for hundreds of hours making friends and discussing anything from philosophy to psychology to coeds those many years ago - it was strange to stand there today and compare myself as an individual to how I was then. In some ways I think I've improved, in others I've declined - such is life I guess. When I signed up for this conference, it was the first I has really become aware that USD had incepted an Autism Institute, and I was curious as to how they viewed Autism in general. UCSD, mind you, is the home of ARI, so our area has a somewhat dubious track record in this area. Then again, UCSD is a major research institution, whereas little old USD is a liberal arts school. The AI at USD is an adjunct of the School of Leadership and Education Science, and the conference took place in the spectacular Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace and Justice - a good forbearing of the philosophical approach taken by the organizers. I arrived expecting to find the predictable horde of cure-sellers. There were none. There was a \"bookstore\" selling all types of autism-related literature and that's it. No commercialization to tarnish the image of this group! I settled in and listened to the opening presenter - one Anne Donnellan, Ph.D. She, as Director of the AI, set the tone for the whole conference by opening with the theme \"People, not Packages\". She asked for a show of hands as she identified her audience. Parents? About 10 of us. Behavioral Therapists? Looked like about 60. Teachers? Maybe 120. OT, PT, SLT? 40 or so. Administrators and government service providers? 10 more. She mumbled something about needing to attract more parents to these conferences and was moving on when a voice in the front of the room said loudly, \"Um, you forgot someone!\" She smiled at the interloper and said, \"Self-Advocates?\" The speaker raised his hand - the only hand to raise - to everyone;s applause. I later came to find out this guy was named Stephen Hinkle. Good job, Stephen! No further discussion of the day is possible without referring to Mr. Hinkle's contributions. He was bright, funny, active, energetic, and made the most profound and salient points of anyone in the room. He interjected about 15 or 20 times over the course of the day, always starting with, \"I'd like to respond to something you just said...\" His ensuing response was guaranteed to be long-winded, well-reasoned, and directly related to the topic at hand. The paid presenters could not have asked for a better supporter of their presentations. What a classy guy, what a pleasure to have him there. I always read the autistic bloggers lament the lack of inclusion of autistic people at functions such as this, and today is a perfect illustration of why. After each response, he would pause for a while, sit down, rock back and forth for maybe 30 seconds, sometimes scan the room, and have a huge smile on his face. I hope to track him down in the next two days and ask him to look over the Hub - he could be a great contributor here if he likes to write. Anyway, back to Dr. Donnellan. In the first 30 minutes or so, I knew the USD Autism Institute was in good hands. During that span, she stated that: The \"spectrum\" is a nice way to help people discuss the issue, but it doesn't really exist and probably causes more harm than good by virtue of the fact that it puts non-verbal autistics at one \"end\", thereby isolating them from the rest and casting a negative light on their 'group'.  IQ tests are absolutely bogus, and should be ignored. She understands their significance as an existing measurement (for example, she used IQ tests in one of her published studies that concluded that ABA therapy is not nearly as effective as it purports to be), but thinks the whole idea of using them to measure general intelligence is tremendously flawed and harmful to those who do not benefit from the tests inherent bias. Autism does not truly exist. In her words \"Can you touch it? Can you see it?\" No. She views autism as a way to describe the  interaction  between typically-\"wired\" people and a large of group of atypically-\"wired\" people (enough of whom are homogenous in at least enough ways as to have been assigned a term that adequately describes some of their most recognizable characteristics). I have presented this concept way too simply here, so cut me some slack, and she admittedly only spent a brief moment on it, but I think I have an idea where her thought process is going with this. She showed a version of this video,  A Credo For Support . She asked everyone to acknowledge that she is NOT an expert in autism, and furthermore that no one person is. She says that if anyone says they are, question everything they say. She then had us do a group exercise that consisted of her asking us to repeat and therefore learn by rote memory the most important phrase those who work with or live with Autistic people should know. The phrase? \"I DON'T KNOW\". She admires and appreciates Dr. Temple Grandin, but is concerned that since Temple has so much exposure that the public is beginning to overgeneralize her particular experience with autism the \"the way autism is\". Interesting insight.  There was much more from Dr. Donnellan, but you get the gist of it. The day ended with a showing of the Autism Every Day self-documentary by Sue Rubin, followed by a Q&A with Ms. Rubin and her parents. This post is getting a bit long, so if anyone has any questions about Sue Rubin or the content of the Q&A, comment here or email me directly.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2007", "body": "\nOur son began to speak somewhere between his fourth and fifth birthday. So basically, since he is now getting on towards six years old, we have only been \"listening\" to him for about a year. As is the case with many late-talkers, once he began it was as if the proverbial floodgates had opened. In Jason's case, he has a quite large vocabulary (hey, just because he wasn't talking to us doesn't mean he wasn't listening! He knew plenty of words before he started actually saying any). At the same time, he is not really an expert at conversing. A back-and-forth conversation is, well, somewhat  diabolical  for him at this point. Following are three separate little snippets of speech heard recently in the D household. While I intend to let you decide for yourself the moral of each story, I will say that perhaps the most notable thing is that, relatively speaking, Jason has learned a lot and his Dad has a lot to learn. *** It was fairly late at night. Well past 9:00 anyway. For us, that's late. I was working on some things on the computer, and Jason came to indicate to me that he was planning to get a glass of water. Everyone else was abed, and these quiet times can be some of the best opportunities I have to \"pair off\" with Jason and communicate (I use the term communicate out of habit - we were communicating long before he was talking). For some time now, my wife and I had been wondering when Jason may become aware of his behavioral differences from his brother and his peers - how often he had heard the word \"autism\" and if he had begun to try to figure out what it meant. I took this opportunity to probe for some answers. \"Jason, come talk to me for a minute.\" \"Okay\", he spoke under his breath - a common \"tone\" during quieter moments in the house. \"Jason, have you ever heard the word 'Autism'?\" \"No\" \"Do you sometimes feel like you are different from some of your friends? Do you know you are unique and special?\" Without looking at me, breathing deeply, concentrating, \"Yes\". \"How do you know you are different?\" He looks right at me, \"You're big, I'm small.\" Okay, message received. *** When we took a vacation recently, Jason's \"stimming\" increased notably. His most common stims are hand-flapping and hand-clenching, though flapping noticeably increased while we were out of town. We weren't too concerned about it, we just noticed it and chalked it up to changes in routine. This, among other things, prompted us to produce a visual schedule, which seemed to make him feel much better about everything. So last week, Jason came to me to ask for a DVD. We keep them on a high shelf, and Jason loves to be lifted up to perch on a lower shelf so he can peruse DVD titles while I hold him in place. This goes back about 18 months, and he loves to do it. Well, when he requested a DVD I was in the middle of something and asked him to wait a minute. He immediately took a step back and started vigorously flapping his hands. He was obviously stressed by having to wait. He stopped after a moment and asked me again. I again told him to wait, and he looked at a far-off point in space and, keeping his hands at waist level, flapped again. I finished what I was doing, noting that he must be particularly stressed tonight, for some reason, at having to wait. I thought this would be a good opportunity to ask him why - after all, maybe something else was bothering him and I might find out what it was. So... \"Jason, why are you flapping your hands? Is it because you have to wait? Are you OK?\" \"I'm flying\" came the response. Duh! He was pretend-flying, which would have made it possible for him to get his own DVD and not have to wait for his lummox of a Dad!  In other words , he was being five years old, not autistic! *** Jason, like many autistic children and adults, has had significant sleep problems. Though we have helped him to solve some of the issues, one that continues is his habit of waking in the middle of the night. Fortunately for us, he is very passive during these times and he prefers to just crawl in our bed and lay between us. He doesn't chitchat or squirm (anymore), he just relaxes and in time falls back asleep. Well, two nights ago our middle boy - age 4 - had woken to bad dreams and we brought him in to lay between us so he could sleep soundly. Around 3:00 a.m., when Jason made his nightly trek into our bedroom to settle in, he found that his spot was occupied. There are a thousand possible reactions to this scenario, most of which I would never had witnessed - I just happened to be awake when he came in. He paused for a moment, assessing the situation. I heard him sigh forcefully. He stomped his foot and exclaimed: \"Oh, Barnacles!\" I jumped up and led him back to his own bed, chuckling to myself all the way.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/25/diabolical-dialogues/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/07/snippets.html", "title": "\nSnippets\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 17, 2007", "body": "\nWhy am I having such a hard time with this concept? It is a topic I've been wanting to write about but have as yet been unable to. Let me explain... I ended a  post  a few weeks ago with this cryptic statement: \"How we deal with various situations ranging from misbehavior to achievement is dictated by this difference. There is too much to discuss on this topic to include in this post, so I will leave it with this brief statement, and discuss it further next time I write...\" It is the literary equivalent of a cud - I just keep chewing on it and it never really changes. And then tonight I was reading an excellent  post  by one of my favorite fellow Dad bloggers - VAB at Autista, and the last sentence in his post kind of summed it up for me and set the ball rolling, if you will. The sentence read: \"I'm left wondering whether or not MK should want to do anything about it at all, and if he did, whether there is anything that he could do.\" And that seemed to set everything into place. The issue I want to get at could be summed up as this: At what point does our responsibility as a parent become overshadowed by our child's ability to behave a certain way? Is this not perhaps one of the most enduring dilemmas any parent of a special needs child will face? Regardless of how one's parenting style plays out, this is an ongoing process that must evolve on an almost moment-to-moment basis every single day in order to have the best chance at a positive outcome for the child. It entails decisions such as this: ...If my son is spinning in place in a grocery store and blocking an aisle by doing so, is he: Providing himself well-needed sensory regulation, in which case I should be proud of him for successfully using a valuable lifelong skill (autistic tendency); Interfering with other shoppers and needlessly risking injury by becoming dizzy and falling down (the parental concern); Pretending to be his favorite character, Harold the Helicopter, who is saving the Island of Sodor after an awful storm (5-year old behavior)? So what do we do as parents - stop him? Stop him with threats of punishment? Let him spin and ignore other shoppers? Only let him spin until we perceive physical danger? Any of 100 other possibilities? ...If my son insists on playing in his room, by himself, while a family with like-aged children are visiting, is he: Allowing himself a well-needed break from the action and \"decompressing\" in a positive, productive way by playing with his trains and talking to himself using familiar, scripted speech (autistic tendency); Being overprotective of his favored toy - trains - by ensuring that he watches all of them and keeps them far enough away from potential intruders that they will be safe (either autism, personality trait, or one being influenced by the other - who knows which?); Blithely unconcerned that other kids are there to play with him, and therefore must be encouraged to join the fun or will remain alone for the duration of the visit(is introverted, may be related to autism or may not); Is a spoiled child who emphasizes possession and dominance of his toys over sharing with other kids (parental concern) Is actually pretending to be The Invisible Man, and each moment that goes by without his being \"discovered\" is a successful minute! (5-year old imagnation at work). So what do we as parents do - encourage his imagination? Succumb to the peer pressure of having our son \"successfully\" play with the other kids? Assume he is spoiled and take away some trains to teach him a lesson? Understand that he is neurologically different from the visiting kids and allow him unlimited ability to isolate himself? Dilemmas indeed, aren't they? Much is made among the ND community of understanding and accommodating the behaviors related to the autism label, and for good reason. It has been of great benefit to me to gain first-hand perspective of what may (or may not) motivate a given individual to behave in a given way. However, as the parent of a 5-year old son, I need to draw some boundaries. The major conundrum is trying to determine when I am dealing with a 5-year old behavior and when I am dealing with something else (such as sensory integration problems or movement disturbances brought on by stressors that I cannot necessarily anticipate or perceive). And to put it that way - as one or the other, black or white, is an obvious fallacy according to just about any parent or any autistic person I know. It's just not that simple.  When I sat with the diagnosing psychologist 2.5 years ago, and she informed me of the autism diagnosis, do you know what my first question was? It was this (something the doctor said she had never been asked before immediately after a diagnosis): \"Considering that he is autistic, is there an increased chance of other problems such as anxiety or depression?\" The only reason I remember this exchange is her response, which went something like this: \"Well, that depends. If your son is of below-average intelligence - if he has mental retardation in addition to autism, then the likelihood is very low. On the other hand, if he is of average or above-average intelligence, which is the case with many autistic people, then he definitely has an increased chance of anxiety and depression. The reason is because he will know that he is different. You see, it is a double-edged sword.\" So where that leaves me is that Jason, after a few years of development, is definitely not mentally retarded. He in all likelihood would receive a \"lighter\" diagnosis now than when he was originally diagnosed in 2004 and followed up in 2005. Both times he received the \"classic autism\" Dx, but has changed a lot in the ensuing months and short years. These days, a casual observer would be hard-pressed to guess that Jason is divergent from the typical kid. Sure, any of you would know it right away, but Joe Public in the grocery store? Not likely. This convoluted path of information is actually leading somewhere. Since Jason is one who, at least at age 5, is not obviously autistic to the casual observer, guess what that means? Yes - increased expectations of \"normal\" behavior. And we, as parents, have the responsibility (and we are thankful and happy to do it) to make sure that Jason successfully walks that fine line between being true to himself and whatever that means in terms of his neurological differences and being able to function well in a society which has many prescripted scenarios which require deft social skills and just the right kind of sensory awareness to successfully navigate. For those people, either autistic individuals or parents, who may be thinking, \"Quit complaining, as your kid clearly has fewer obstacles to success than me or mine\", I will not disagree with you. But this post is not about degrees of difficulty - it is just about Jason and his specific situation. I respect the hell out of that boy for the hard work he has done to grow and develop, and I thank God for blessing him with a patient and angelic soul to help him deal with his challenges. I only hope that my wife and I can successfully resolve the dilemma of attributing Jason's behavior on any given day, 100 times per day, to the right source: his age, his Jason-ness, or his neurological differences.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aoskoli.blogspot.com/2007/07/perservating-perservating-perservating.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/07/why-am-i-having-such-hard-time-with.html", "title": "\nMultiple Choice\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 19, 2007", "body": "\nI received an interesting email from a friend today. Her career involves clinical pharmaceutical trials, and therefore she keeps a close eye on new trial information. She forwarded an article from a CNS News magazine. The article announces that Autism Speaks has entered an agreement with Neuropharm to perform clinical trials of Fluoxetine for the treatment of autism. Some excerpts: - \"The agreement, which gives Neuropharm access to Autism Speaks' Clinical Trials Network of specialist paediatric centres and key opinion leaders, will expedite the enrolment of patients in this trial, codenamed SOFIA Study of Fluoxetine in Autism.\" - \"NPL-2008 is Neuropharm's proprietary preparation of fluoxetine, featuring autism-specific dosages in a melt-in-the-mouth formulation designed specifically for those with autism.\" - \"...is a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled study comprising more than 100 children and adolescents in approximately 12 centres throughout the US,...\" This is not \"news\", per se, as information on this study can be found simply by visiting Autism Speaks' website. But there are several interesting things to note here. First of all, fluoxetine is the substance that is marketed under the name Prozac (as my friend refers to it: America's Favorite Food). Keeping in mind that I am not one of the Hub bloggers with a solid foundation in science, it seems to me that this is an appropriate place to spend some research dollars. While their stated goal: \"...to show a reduction in the core symptomatology of autism\" is not necessarily in alignment with my views of autism (I would require some clarification from them on that point), it seems to me that any safe, effective way to reduce anxiety and depression issues in autistic individuals would be just great. In other words, they might not get what they want - to eliminate autistic \"symptomatology\", or behaviors, but instead they might establish the safety of a drug that could benefit autistic people in the same way it benefits NT people. It is known that there are neurological differences between autistic and neurotypical people, and therefore drug action - particulary psychoactive drugs such as the SSRI's - may vary significantly between the two populations. Those who know me (unlike, for example,  this guy ) know that I believe that autism is not curable. They also know that I wish only the best for, well, all people really, but in particular autistic people. If it were to be shown that fluoxetine were to improve the lives of certain autistic individuals, safely, in much the same way that it does for NT's, then some real good could come of this. I expect that the autistic popluation has at least as much anxiety and depression as the NT population, and that therefore a real need may exist. Testing Fluoxetine for safety and efficacy, therefore, seems like the right thing to do. One must always exercise caution, of course, in relying on a pharmaceutical solution to an emotional or behavioral problem.  I am definitely not a proponent of automatically prescribing something like Prozac in response to an autism  diagnosis .  And certainly pushing Fluoxetine as a cure for autism would be wrong on many levels.  Instead, if a given person is experiencing difficulties with anxiety or depression, then it would be nice of this drug was available, among other choices, as a proven-to-be-safe solution. Contrast this whole idea to the horrible \"Lupron Protocol\" - another case of attempting to establish a new indication for an existing drug. I actually mentioned this to my friend, and sent her a  link  to Kathleen Seidel's thorough dismantling of the Geier's work in that area. Her response: \"Lupron is probably the single most dreadful drug ever approved by the FDA. We used to use it in the infertility clinic to shut down ovaries before starting stimulation protocols for IVF. Icky stuff.\" Yes, and the Lupron Protocol is touted by its originators as being a way to \"cure\" autism. And regarding the reliability of the Fluoxetine trial, my friend mentions that the \"raters\", or those who record the behavioral data, are a key component to achieving proper results. In her words: \"In clinical trials, those raters have to be certified (often repeatedly) and the protocols will insist that the same rater be used with the same subject throughout the trial. These types of studies depend on the rater completely.\" I introduced the additional problem of observer bias, which she indicates will level out based on the idea that any inherent bias will be applied across the board, reducing the effect overall. What is far more problematic than observer bias is anything that jeopardizes the \"blindness\" of a rater. An example here is that Fluoxetine sometimes causes a rash. If the rater knows this, and observes a rash in some subjects, the results of the trial would be severely compromised. I hope they perform a sound trial, and that the results will provide a viable option to improve the lives of autistic individuals.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2007/07/autism-newsflash-neurodiversity-and.html", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/109/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/07/drug-trial-for-fluoxetine.html", "title": "\nDrug Trial for Fluoxetine\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 17, 2007", "body": "\nI was recently given a document with a request for input. The author of the document is Martha Leary, MA, CCC-SLP. Martha has worked with autistic people and their families for over 30 years. I was fortunate enough to see one of Martha\u2019s presentations recently, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience and perspective she brings to the issue \u2013 especially as relates to language and movement differences in autistic people. This brief essay is a summary of how movement and communication differences are inherent to the label of autism, and how they affect people\u2019s perceptions of autism as a disorder. I feel this is a poignant, appropriate summary that could help interested NT readers gain some perspective in their understanding of autistic people. Please comment and let myself and the author know what you think. Movement Differences for people with autism  Martha R. Leary The diagnosis of autism is not prescriptive of the type of supports needed for assisting the person to participate, relate and communicate. Relationship is the basis for participation and communication, for all people. People with autism often communicate, behave and participate in unique, very personal ways that may be difficult to relate to and understand. Differences in the way people are able to use their bodies and focus their attention leads many people to assume that a person does not care to participate or communicate and does not desire relationship. These assumptions affect our expectations for people, the way we speak with them and the educational and social opportunities we offer to them. Our assumptions color the support we give to people. People labeled with autism move their bodies in ways that are unfamiliar to most of us. Some people rock, repeatedly touch an object, jump and finger posture while other people come to a standstill in a doorway, sit until cued to move and turn away when someone beckons. As professionals trained to believe what we see, most of us have interpreted these movements as volitional behaviors, communicative acts signaling avoidance of interaction and evidence of mental retardation. We have taken a \u2018literal\u2019 interpretation of what we see and extended it into a notion of what constitutes autism. Some behaviors may not be intentional, but an artifact of the difficulties a person may have in organizing and regulating sensation and movement. Other behaviors may be subtle signs of the desire for relationship or expressions of meaning. When we focus on our standard expectations for behavior and communication in our fast paced, super technological world, we may miss opportunities to know and understand people who are likely among the most patient and best listeners on the planet. Detailed personal descriptions of sensation and movement differences found in other disabilities have given us some clues as to what it may be like to deal with symptoms such as compelling impulses, a loss of conscious control, lack of initiation, akinetic moments and unusual ways of being in the world. Leary and Hill (1996) analyzed the literature on symptoms associated with established movement disorders and those associated with autism. The greatest difference among these disabilities was the interpretation of the symptoms. In Tourette syndrome, Parkinsonism and Catatonia, there was a neurological interpretation of symptoms. There was a social interpretation of the same symptoms if the person had a label of autism. That which is called a \u2018tic\u2019 in a person with Tourette syndrome is most often considered a \u2018behavior\u2019 (and often a conscious choice) in a person with autism. A \u2018bark\u2019 by a person with Tourette or another movement disorder is appropriately supported, in autism it is a behavior to be reduced often with a negative intervention. Humans carry inside, an image of themselves that includes reasons for and the possibility of change. We need to know that we are OK just as we are, even though there are things we may want to learn or to do better. In our journey of change, we need allies who will collaborate with us to find the most comfortable and effective ways for us to learn new ways to participate in our families, with our friends and as contributing members of our communities. Supports for people with autism should reflect the respect and dignity due to all people and address the challenges with which people struggle in organizing and regulating themselves in response to the sensory environment and their movement differences. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/08/movement-differences.html", "title": "\nMovement Differences\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 15, 2007", "body": "\nIn my third post on the topic of Evidence Based Interventions for autism, I plan to borrow heavily from an  analysis  in the BMJ authored by Kerridge, Lowe, and Henry. This document was sent to me by  Maria Lujan  after my first post on EBIs. Thank you, Maria. While I plan to use this paper\u2019s discussion of EBM as a framework, I will adapt its principle arguments to the arena of autism treatments. I want to clearly state that by writing about EBIs for autism, I am neither endorsing nor condemning them. I see this as a very ambiguous issue, full of promise and fraught with peril for the autistic children and adults who may (or may not) receive services as a result of this form of decision-making. One of the primary ongoing debates in the autism community is one of treatment \u2013 Biomedical or behavioral? Cure or remediation? Science-based or faith-based? Proven or speculative? Helpful or harmful? These are all, in my view, variations of the same argument, rephrased and rehashed over and over again. What is really being examined when these debates take place is how, when, and why we should provide supports to autistic people. What should the goals of these supports be? Who has the right to make treatment decisions, and who is responsible \u2013 fiscally and actually \u2013 for carrying them out? What value do various treatment/intervention approaches have? This, then, is a discussion of Consequentialism as it relates to EBM (I will use the term EBM: Evidence-Based Medicine as a general term and EBI: Evidence-Based Intervention as an autism-specific term). I\u2019ll begin, as I so often prefer to do, with a definition: Consequentialism: the proposition that the worth of an action can be assessed by the measurement of its consequences. There are, as the referenced article states, three main philosophical objections to EBM. I\u2019d like to explore how these objections apply to EBIs. Many important outcomes of treatment cannot be measured This is one of the most commonly encountered debates in the autism community. What constitutes a \u201cgood\u201d outcome? My family\u2019s prevailing view has typically been that our goal in supporting Jason is that he is as happy as can be \u2013 that we provide a framework of supports that are as appropriate to him as that we provide to his brothers and each other. The fact that he is autistic is simply one factor in that decision making process. Other families may take precisely the same approach, but end up with a completely different, but entirely appropriate framework for their young child. Jason, for example, has never committed self-injurious behavior. Therefore, dealing with that specific issue has not been on our radar screen. Had it been, we could have examined the evidence of various treatments to arrive at a decision as to how support Jason in reducing this destructive behavior. One possibility would have been a behaviorist approach such as ABA. Another would be a psychiatric approach such as medication. Another would consist of 24-hour oversight by people who have proven to be successful at diverting him from this behavior through other means. I really don\u2019t know, as we have not dealt with a situation of this difficult nature. In this example, though the desired Outcome may be the same as my son\u2019s current situation, the means required to get there may look entirely different. So, to establish a desired Outcome (a necessity for EBM, as it requires a definition of the goal of treatment) proves to be highly difficult. It is likely to be either too broad (i.e. maximize quality of life, which could mean different things to different people) or too narrow (eliminate self-injurious behavior) which would not apply to my son, who has a clinical diagnosis of classic autism. I can\u2019t fathom what definition would be appropriate for \u201cautism treatment\u201d as a whole, since autistic people are anything but a homogenous community. Additional to the problems inherent in defining Outcomes are the problems in measuring the Outcomes. Is the positive outcome supposed to be in effect at age 5, 15, or 50? During periods of duress, periods of established expectations, or at all times? Is success measured against a paradigm of perfection in behavior, or against a more accurate human model of behavior with all of its flaws? These are all important issues to consider as a \u201cblue-ribbon\u201d panel of experts and advocates sit down to decide the fate of our autistic friends and family members. It may be impossible to decide between competing claims of different stakeholders This is a biggie. And this is one of my main concerns about EBI. There is so little agreement in those aspects of the autism community that I have been exposed to about what are safe treatments, effective treatments, ethical treatments. Here is where I think everyone needs to bite their tongue for a moment and listen to whatever voice of reason we all have in the back of our minds that has allowed us humans to function successfully in society for tens of thousands of years. We all think we are right. This is predictable and ok, and easily understood with a basic understanding of human psychology. But some of us have either the power or the impetus to make sure that our particular brand of \u201cright\u201d is exerted upon ALL other people. Gosh, it sure would be nice to know with such absolute, unadulterated certainty that something like Chelation Therapy or Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy would clearly benefit (and, at the same time, not harm) any and all autistic subjects. If one were to know this so certainly and unarguably, then one may be motivated to make sure that all those who do not believe in their efficacy would be forced to select only from that treatment. Unfortunately, when the results of an EBM process go into effect, this has the potential to be the result. How do we guard against this \u2013 or, in other words, how do we make sure that scientific results are brought to bear in benefiting the appropriate subject group of individuals, but are not so strongly engrained in the activities and economics of the treatment community that they become the ONLY choice for the subject group? What if the best therapy for a given individual is some sort of speech therapy in a group setting? The subject herself, the subjects\u2019 parents, and the various teachers and professionals who are involved in the subject\u2019s life all agree that this is the most appropriate and beneficial treatment at this juncture. Not only will she gain some improved speech and language skills, but also some social strategies as well due to the group setting. But wait \u2026 insurance won\u2019t help cover it. \u201cWe follow evidence-based medicine protocol, and group speech therapy is not recommended by the committee\u201d. The state won\u2019t cover it \u2013 \u201cABA is the most effective therapy, according to our evidence-based medicine expert panel. We\u2019ll spend $160 per day to fund that, but we won\u2019t spend $40 per week for whatever it is you are asking for. We don't know what it is, but we do know that it is NOT an approved EBI.\u201d I also feel that it is impossible to quantify everyday \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201chandling\u201d of autistic children as relates to a therapeutic intervention. Since the simple act of being a good, loving parent holds virtually no commercial promise, the likelihood of incorporating that into the research literature is very slim. To quote the article, \u201cGiven the complexities of the issues surrounding resource allocation, the drive to seek certainty and simplicity at the policy level is understandable. However, the large quantities of trial data required to meet the standards of evidence based medicine are available for relatively few interventions.\u201d In other words, only those methods which have a long clinical history or have sufficient commercial promise to generate significant and immediate research dollars have any chance at being considered as \u201cEvidence\u201d. In my experience, the best commentator on the difference between named interventions and simple good parenting techniques has been Autism Diva, and I welcome her input/comments on this topic. EBM may lead to activities that seem at odds with common morality Uh oh. This issue can get a little hot. Please set aside all of your existing positions for a minute and consider some (personally biased) points on this topic. Point #1: I believe that morality is universal. I am not a believer in Moral Relativism, as are seemingly so many of my contemporaries. I believe that morality is quite well known and understood worldwide and that right is right and wrong is wrong. I am not referring to formulated suppositions such as \u201cIs firing a struggling single mother of two for stealing $5 from petty cash so she could afford dinner for her kids immoral?\u201d Save your grade-school moral dilemmas for another argument or the appropriate party game. What I am talking about is this: Viewing autistic people as anything less than a whole person is WRONG. Though we all must acknowledge that autism \u2013 a defined disability \u2013 presents numerous challenges to the individual, ranging from social deficits to a lack of ability to communicate or even feed oneself independently, losing sight of the individual human being due to the presentation of deficits is WRONG. How can EBIs factor in this aspect? If I were a professional working with autistic people (I am not), my compensation and ability to continue in my chosen career may depend on adhering to established EBIs. What if I know, or even suspect, that the treatment I am required to provide compromises my subject\u2019s dignity? It would then become immediately immoral for me to continue. Point #2: Trusting that the moral transgression postulated in point #1 is not going to happen, or that the preponderance of subjects benefiting from EBIs outweighs the occasional transgression is irresponsible. Point #3 Following points 1 and 2, it then becomes our responsibility as people who care about the welfare of autistics to ensure that principles of ethics and morality are adhered to at every stage of attempting to establish EBIs. The possibility of moral transgressions should not prevent the effort from taking place \u2013 that would be ludicrous and counterproductive, and actually constitute a moral violation in and of itself. Here I have covered the three main objections to EBIs based on the concept of Consequentialism. It would be easy to assume, based on the fact that I am highlighting some weaknesses of the Evidence-Base approach, that I am opposed to it. This is not the case, and in actuality I am a strict adherent to the value of scientific contributions to the field of autism knowledge. One point I would like any reader to come away with from this post is that it is the people involved in the decision-making process and not the evidence itself that poses the most significant threat of misuse of this powerful economic/political tool. For those of you who have the ability to wield this power, I hope you carefully consider the extremely wide range of subjects that your decisions will influence.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/316/7138/1151", "http://www.blogger.com/profile/05619003228550909446"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/08/in-my-third-post-on-topic-of-evidence.html", "title": "\nPart 3:  Evidence-Based Interventions\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, August 12, 2007", "body": "\nIn my last  post,  I opened the topic of evidence-based approaches to treatment, and asked whether or not they are a good thing or not. I think the most obvious answer is that the efficacy and ethics of EBIs are entirely subject to the people who are establishing them and the processes they undergo prior to completion. Taken in their simplest form, it seems like a no-brainer that EBI\u2019s are the preferred method of treatments to offer for any number of conditions, including autism. But upon further consideration, the issue is far more complicated. What I\u2019d like to do here is to list some of the serious concerns I have about EBIs. (I would like to point out that there is probably not an original thought or concept on this list. While I am not plagiarizing \u2013 I am simply summarizing some of the problem areas that have occurred to me \u2013 I am aware that much thought has been given to this topic, many medical and ethics professionals have hashed out the nuances of this issue, and my \u201cglancing blow\u201d is not likely to generate any revolutionary concepts. At the same time, I don\u2019t believe enough debate has taken place within the autism community on this subject, and I would like to see more opinions \u2013 especially those who outstrip my own in terms of practical experience and academic fluency.) Who is Guiding the Process? The first thing I would be concerned about in relation to EBIs is; In any given effort at establishing EBIs, who are the primary players in starting the process and seeing the process through? Simple Conflict-of-Interest issues are one consideration here, self-fulfilling prophecy is another. I recall reading a  post  by one of my favorite bloggers \u2013 Prometheus \u2013 which stated that, in many research scenarios, one finds just exactly what one is looking for, regardless of whether it is true or not. It is very difficult to cull various forms of bias from research, and the design of the process that is expected to arrive at the correct EBI must be very carefully considered and reviewed for the correct conclusion to be reached. Let me throw out just one example to illustrate the point. I recently reviewed a document which outlined the process that has been established for determining the best EB approach for treating autism in the U.S. One part of the document specified that \u201cbiomedical\u201d approaches are being handled by another, similar group. As it turns out, by looking into the backgrounds of many of the individuals involved with this particular effort (the first group), this is largely a behaviorist-based movement. So we have a group of professionals with a heavy bias to one school of thought in autism treatment setting up a process to review scientific literature to determine the efficacy of various treatments. Let me ask you \u2013 do you think it likely that this particular group will agree upon a treatment, or group of treatments, that is not behaviorist in nature? And the \u201cother\u201d group that is being referred to \u2013 the one responsible for Biomedical EBIs \u2013 do you think it is even vaguely possible that they will end up recommending nothing? Is that even a possibility? I hope they come up with something that is appropriate, effective, and specific to autism, but I think it highly unlikely based on the current body of knowledge on the subject. Still, I fully expect they will come up with something to recommend \u2013 they have legions of healthcare providers (legitimate and otherwise) who have bills to pay, after all. Sorry if I sound a bit skeptical, but I really am concerned about this. \u201cI Don\u2019t Know\u201d Factor Though there probably exists an official academic term for this concern I have, I will just summarize it is the \u201cI Don\u2019t Know\u201d Factor. What I mean is that, in the absence of good evidence, isn\u2019t it best to not be making recommendations? That instead it should be clearly stated that not enough evidence exists to establish Evidence-Based Interventions? I understand that at no point do we know enough about anything to speak with absolute, unassailable authority about it. At the same time, a tangible lack of evidence (or an existing set of conflicting, inconclusive evidence) should seemingly prevent a definitive finding from being achieved. A great example here is ABA. There are, to the best of my knowledge, hundreds of studies about the efficacy of ABA. The result of these studies is a lack of agreement in the scientific community about whether or not ABA should be defined as an EBI for autism. Forget ethical considerations for a moment and consider this: After decades of research on how ABA (in varying forms and levels of intensity) affects autistic individuals, there is still no consensus on whether or not it is an effective intervention in cases of autistic individuals. Why, then, was it the only service (aside from respite care, which we have not yet ever done) offered by the state of California for my son? Is it perhaps because at some point in the past it was recommended as the state\u2019s official EBI? Interesting, since evidence clearly lacks. I am not sure it is appropriate for an EBI to be supported by such conflicting evidence. Some autism advocates will say, \u201cWe need to settle on something so that parents do not miss opportunities to provide early interventions to their children.\u201d What if \u2018something\u2019 really means \u2018the intervention that currently has the most evidence, even if that evidence suggests a very low efficacy rate\u2019? Is it still, then, appropriate to tout ABA as the single most beneficial autism intervention? Would it not be better to say that \u201cWe cannot, based on current scientific evidence, support any one intervention, but here is a list of reviewed approaches and the associated literature.\u201d If one does not know the answer to a question, \"I Don't Know\" may be the only honest response. Those two issues are enough for one post, but I do plan to continue my list. Here\u2019s a teaser for the next item on my list: The Implications of Consequentialism \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com/2007/02/what-you-want-is-what-you-get.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/08/part-2-evidence-based-interventions.html", "title": "\nPart 2:  Evidence Based Interventions\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2007", "body": "\nRecently, there have been  several  blogposts around the community on the topic of recovery. As I watch my own son develop over time, I think it would be prudent to make some comments on this issue. First, some background. My son Jason was diagnosed in January 2005 with \"Classic Autism\", or \"Kanner's Autism\". For those familiar with the DSM-IV's  diagnostic criteria , there are basically 12 points of diagnosis falling into 3 major categories. Jason was diagnosed as exhibiting 10 of the 12 categories of diagnosis, with 2 being untestable as he had shown at that point no verbal language abilities that could be tested. Upon follow-up testing around 14 months later, he was diagnosed as exhibiting all 12 points. It is important to understand that in most of these categories, his characteristics were not on the extreme end of the possible spectrum of behavior. For example, under (c)(3) \"stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements)\", he had several such movements but nothing that was easily observable. Most common for him was very regular hand-clenching, especially when focusing on something such as a book or video, that was very intense and sometimes caused his whole body to shudder with the effort. Another was repeatedly dropping small items from above his forehead to the floor, with the intent to make them fall through his field of peripheral vision. So, using this category of diagnosis as an example, he was displaying the full spectrum of diagnosable autistic behaviors but none of them in their most severe form (such as biting oneself or hitting one's own head repeatedly). Now he is just under three years beyond his time of diagnosis.  And, at this point, he is the type of kid that could be used as an example of a 'recovered' child.  Keep in mind that I am using 'recovered' the way someone selling an autism cure may use the term - most often I hear the definition \"indistinguishable from his/her peers\".   To someone unfamiliar with Autism Spectrum Disorder, or someone who only spends a limited amount of time with Jason in a fairly non-problematic setting, Jason has indeed become, in many observable ways, \"indistinguishable from his peers\"  My wife and I know this only means that, in the course of his natural development, some of his most outward behavioral tendencies that are 'autism indicators' have gone away.  The onset of verbal language also went a very long ways towards reducing the 'obviousness' of his autism.  Does this mean he is any less autistic than he was 2 years ago?  Not based on my understanding.  What it does mean is several things: -  He has learned effective ways to deal with his sensory integration issues in ways that are not as outwardly expressed as his previous methods were. -  His ability to communicate has increased our understanding of him and his of us, leading to improved ability on both sides to understand and accommodate otherwise difficult situations. -  His ongoing skill acquisition has made it easier for him to progress through his typical days without as much frustration or as many obstacles to success. -  We, as parents, have accepted and understood that expecting him to conform his behavior to situations that his typical peers may be able to is not a fair expectation in many circumstances. In case someone reading this is new to my blog, it is worth mentioning that we did not choose to treat Jason's autism with biomedical interventions - you know whose that are said to 'cure' autism.  As I have stated before, I do believe certain 'biomedical' treatments are appropriate for certain autistic children and adults, though it is certain that none of them will cure the individual of their autism (an example would be that we give Jason melatonin to help him fall asleep more easily.  Him getting more sleep may improve his attention and tolerability thresholds, which may give the appearance of 'lessening' his autistic behaviors, but it certainly does not cure him of autism.  And even still, we don't give it to him to lessen said behaviors, we just give it to him because falling asleep at a decent hour is healthy for a young child). I guess one takeaway point here is that, even though I am the parent of a child who could theoretically be paraded across a stage at an Autism One conference as Exhibit A of the latest cure, the claim would be patently false  even if we had provided that treatment .  We may believe that it was the BM intervention, and if so our belief would be  wrong .  So if any parents are reading this who have not yet decided which side of the fence they fall on as relates to  choices  in how to proceed with treating or educating their autistic child, please consider this point carefully.  I am certainly not the first to make this observation, but it bears repeating from time to time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=615", "http://ani.autistics.org/dsm4-autism.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/09/recovery.html", "title": "\nRecovery\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 6, 2007", "body": "\nNumerous readers will have reached this post by viewing the main page of the  Autism Hub , reading its Title, implying that the post holds some element of razor-edged controversy or perhaps some scintillating yet subtle commentary on life as an autistic person or as someone who loves an autistic person. I apologize, but you may have been misled. Instead, you will hear about a child's emergence (wait ...is emergence the right word?), a child's improvement (no, that doesn't really capture it), a child's advancement (woah, that implies the the prior state is subordinate to the current state of existence), a child's blossoming (nice flowery word, but encumbered by the same baggage as 'advancement'), a child's change (there we go) from a 'machine' to a 'little person'. I am talking about our baby, Colin. So if you visited here today looking for a commentary on autism, you might have clicked on the wrong blog. If, on the other hand, you want to learn something about Fathers (scientific evidence exists that  100%  of autistic people have fathers) then read on. And here is the groundbreaking news I have for you today: Fathers (and those who don't agree here will surely flock from all points to attack me based on this statement) do not truly connect with our babies until somewhere between 6 and 8 months of age. We just don't. Its not that we don't try - God knows we try our asses off. We rock and cluck and soothe and wipe and swaddle and hug and disinfect and bathe and bottle-feed and swab and tickle and smooch and show off and strap in and burp and worry and watch and carry and swing and we do it all while hoping to make that 'connection'.  This doesn't mean it works. I am the Father of three now, so I can speak with some authority when I say that personification is extremely difficult in the absence of understandable feedback. Read that carefully - the operative words are  understandable feedback . What I mean is that Moms, whose exposure to the baby and all of his or her little expressions of need from the cellular level to the diaper-processing level, seemingly have an innate ability to bond with and understand our babies, and we Men do not. Oh we try - how we try! But any Father I know will agree with me that only around the age when you receive that chin-thrusting smile do you realize that your baby has turned from a little machine into a little person.  And Wow! what a fun mutual experience that is for both parties. (That's the best part, you know.  When one of you realizes it, you both realize it.) Somewhere out there is a father, probably more than one, who is in the first 6-7 months of their first child's life and is thinking to himself, \"This smug blogger dude has it all wrong - I am  totally  in tune with my little guy/gal!\"  My only response can be:  wait a few months, wait until your baby stops smiling and starts  beaming  at you.  She doesn't look at you, she  grabs  you with her eyes and accompanying impish grin.  He is not laughing, he is belly-laughing - at something  you  did!  Then, and only then, will you realize that what you thought, a few months ago was a firm connection, was just practice for the real thing. And of course, in complete defiance of my first paragraph (yes, young readers, us thirty-somethings runs out of windmills to joust and eventually begin rebelling against our own selves, even within the limited context of a few paragraphs of writing) I am going to tie this into autism.  Its the whole machine thing.  I do realize that some fathers watch their 6+ month olds turn from babymachines into little guys and gals, and at some later point change again.  I realize this because I have experienced it.  \"Regressive Autism\" is not a defined thing, certainly not an official diagnosis, but many thousands of parents will define the point of development when they began to note divergent development patterns - even regression of acquired skills.  This period - usually accompanied by an autism diagnosis within a few weeks or months - is a critical zone of decision-making for parents who have not already been through it (and, I guess, maybe for those who have as well).  This is the point when us Fathers (and Mothers) must introspectively examine our attitudes towards our autistic kids.  Did they diverge from the expected path of development?  Did they acquire a disability?  Have they been poisoned by Big Pharma and Big Government?  Are they ...  machine-like?  Anyone who reads here with any regularity knows this Dad's answers to these questions.  Oh - did I mention that my baby boy Colin turned from babymachine into 'little guy' over the last few days?  That, my friends, is what prompted this little monologue on fatherhood.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/09/not-machine.html", "title": "\nNot a Machine\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 13, 2007", "body": "\nOn a daily basis, I sell flowers.  Upon my arrival at work, the first thing I do is the microeconomic equivalent of \"stop and smell the roses\" - in this particular case, I walk into our giant refrigerator to analyze our inventory position on any number of floral varieties that we are currently stocking, and based on the predicted market for each variety *that day*, I set prices.  I then email and fax the price list to our customer base, and the day's commerce immediately begins.  Over the course of a year, well over 1,000 varieties of flowers move through our warehouse and alternative distribution systems.  To fully digest and be comfortable with the diversity included in those 1,000 varieties takes some breadth of experience and learning. When considering diversity, one must have perspective.  My reference to 1,000 varieties of flowers seems to exist on the outward end of the spectrum of potential diversity. 1,000 varieties?  That seems to be so many.  Until one compares the number to groups or categories with virtually infinite variation.  Such as the group:  \"Parents\".  \"Parents\" is not just your typical noun.  It is tremendously loaded with all kind of culturally predetermined connotations.  It is loaded with personal experiential bias.  The human experience contains unfathomable variation in range of experience, but all of us are \"parented\" in our youths.  Regardless of whether one's personal translation of parenting refers to biological or institutional entities, parenting happens for all of us.  Even the lack of parenting equates to an experience of being parented  in absentia .  As a result, all of us who then choose to become parents ourselves enter this Faustian Bargain with some bias. It occurs to me that one of the most powerful determinants of a person's ability to experience life in a positive way is the blend of that person's characteristics with his/her parent(s) characteristics.  It does not require a world-class literary critic to notice that I am intentionally using value-neutral language in this discussion.  If I were to do so - to assign value to parenting 'types' - the point that I am meandering my way into making would become moot.  Or, to restate the issue, assigning value to parental technique would be counterproductive to this discussion by diminishing the fact that parenting is very difficult and very rarely performed perfectly.   To offer perfection, therefore, as an attainable ideal, puts this consideration out of the reach of all of us. I read today a most excellent  pos t by  Brett .  Brett is a guy who has been there, done that as realtes to parenting.  Brett has raised an autistic son who is now 15 years old.  I am stealing from his trove of earned wisdom on making some of the statements you are reading now. Here is one of Brett's statements.  \"Parenting is hard, mainly because it is a long-term investment of time and effort (and money, of course) with a high degree of uncertainty about the final outcome.\"  This hit home with me.  It says to me that parenting, as a long-term venture, does not finish out the way it starts.  It does not present opportunites for clear choices, but instead provides endless areas of gray from which to carve out a black and white scenario.  Is this different for the parent of a special needs child than it is for a typical child? As a man who fills both roles, I can confidently answer, \"NO!\". Parenting can be viewed in so many ways - joyful, impossible, taxing, rewarding, unpredictable, even unavoidable and mundane depending on cultural mores.  It can be happy and  sad at the same time, difficult and easy in the same day, structured and chaotic in the same hour.  Within a five minute time frame we can experience unquenchable enthusiasm for our childs' potential accompanied by paralyzing dread of that potential not being realized. I cannot thank my own parents enough for the efforts they put forth in raising me.  I have a great brother who also benefitted from their exhaustive efforts at providing us with opportunites.  Due to our personal shortcomings - none of which could or even should have been perceived through my parents' rose-colored glasses at the time - my brother and I failed to thrive in any number of settings we were placed in.   At the same time, we did succeed in other settings.  I only hope that I can provide my own children with the same opportunities that I had as a youth, knowing that each one of them will fail at some and succeed spectacularly at others. Good parenting can sometimes be viewed as less a case of \"right and wrong\" than it is of parents doing their damnedest to provide the maximum potential of best-case scenario for their kids given the prevailing circumstances.  Based on this philosophy, things such as autism, deafness, Down syndrome, ADHD, blindness, MR, MD, etc. should be viewed less as an 'impediment to' good parenting and more as an 'invitation to' good parenting.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php", "http://29marbles.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/09/on-parental-variety.html", "title": "\nOn Parental Variety\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 17, 2007", "body": "\nIt is one of the great ongoing debates within (and without) the autism community - the so-called 'epidemic' of autism over the last 10-15 years. Were I to point you to all of the excellent posts and articles on this topic, the list would be unbearably long. Suffice it to say that this topic has been rehashed over and over by lots of people with all kinds of agendas. In the final analysis, to me anyway, it appears that there may be a somewhat higher prevalence of ASD individuals than there were a couple of decades ago, but that the increase, assuming there actually is one, is nowhere near the what the commonly accepted prevalence figures from then and now would indicate. The reasons that there  seems  to be higher prevalence are well-documented. First, the diagnostic criteria used now are tremendously broader than what were used in the past. Autism Disorder itself has been redefined into a \"spectrum disorder\", indicating by definition that it now encompasses a large spectrum of individuals with varying presentations of diagnostic criteria. Beyond that, awareness has increased dramatically. In circumstances ranging from pediatrician visits to casual play-dates, autism is talked about openly and regularly. This most certainly has an effect on parents who may be concerned about their child's behavior and may seek additional information or a diagnosis, as well as on those who take part in the referral process (pediatrician to speech therapist to pediatric neurologist to developmental psychologist, or some variation). Add to that the increased level of acceptance of autism as a legitimate diagnosis and the result will be even higher prevalence numbers. 20 years ago, if a psychologist settled on autism as a diagnosis, it was an extremely rare evaluation with tremendous implications for the patient and his/her family. Nowadays, for the reasons listed above, it is a less mysterious and abstract diagnosis. Increased levels of understanding lead to a mutual and synchronous increase in acceptance between clinicians and patients' families that make it 'easier' to settle on ASD as a diagnosis. Another factor is the way services are doled out. Many families will push for the autism diagnosis over others for the simple reason that they are more likely to receive services either from the government or from their school systems. It may easier in California, for example, to receive behavioral therapies for a child Dx'd with Autism Disorder than it is for a child with a combination of Dyslexia and ADHD. Therefore, the parents of this theoretical child may push for an Autism diagnosis to receive what they consider to be the most appropriate services. Also included in this category are younger siblings of children who have been diagnosed with Autism, who may receive funding for early intervention because they fall into a higher risk category (not because they have been officially diagnosed). Once these kids are on the books, so to speak, if they develop typically are they ever removed? Considering that we have had changes in definition, changes in reporting, changes in diagnostic criteria, changes in the way society views and understands autism, is it even possible to have a discussion comparing prevalence levels now to then? It is all pure speculation at this point, though the arguments I have grouped together above certainly lead one to believe that any increase that may have occurred is less than what the 'numbers' would indicate. One interesting question on this topic is: If you think back throughout your life, can you think of one or more people who, in retrospect, knowing what you do now, may be someone who today could be diagnosed as being on the Autism spectrum? Personally, I can think of 1 who I think would almost certainly receive the diagnosis today, as well as a few other possibilities. Those who argue for the existence of an epidemic have a refrain, \"Where is the Hidden Horde of autistic adults?\" In my opinion, the (offensively monikered) Hidden Horde is all around us if we know what to look for. Last week I attended a several-day-long business conference in another part of the state. Over dinner, I was having a conversation about autism with a few business colleagues. All of them, of course, were of the belief that there is, indeed, an epidemic of autism and believed, of course, that vaccines or environmental toxins probably caused it. Of the 5 people, however, only one knew someone who was autistic or had an autistic family member. Interestingly, here are 5 adults who all believe in an autism epidemic but who do not know any autistic people. So anyway, I explained some of the reasoning against the belief in the epidemic. I then asked \"the question\" that I mention above, and explained some of the behaviors one might observe in an undiagnosed autistic adult, just giving a general idea to help them think it through. So one guy pipes up and says, \"Oh, you mean someone like my Uncle.\" After further questions and explanations, here is the description of his uncle: He works in the family business, at a supervisory level. He has had the same set of responsibilities for over 25 years - he performs them with absolute unflagging precision. At the same time, he has no interest in any goings-on outside his sphere of responsibility. He is friendly and outgoing, but has no long-term friendships outside his own family (where he is cherished for his loyalty and eccentricity). He tends to make acquaintances uncomfortable with his social behaviors. For example, he speaks in a tone just a little too loud for the atmosphere, regardless of whether the atmosphere is quiet or loud to begin with. He makes fleeting eye contact, and 'flicks' his eyes to and away from whomever he is speaking with. His first question for a new acquaintance is  always  \"So where are you from?\" When he receives his answer, he immediately responds with \"Buffaloes!\" or \"Gamecocks!\" or \"Huskies!\" The significance of this response is that this is the mascot for whatever NCAA football team is most closely located to where that person is from. He knows all of them. And then, for the duration of the acquaintanceship, he will repeat that mascot name each and every time he sees that person, no matter how frequently. It's like his way if saying \"Hi\". He \"lives independently\" (my colleague's choice of terms) in a family-owned rental property. His brothers help him manage his household finances (not by giving him money, as he earns a nice income, but just by helping get bills organized and paid and helping organize insurance and retirement plans and whatnot). He drives, but only a little because he does not like to. So, readers, what do you think? Is he autistic? Is he a member of the Hidden Horde? If he were born today, would he be diagnosed with Autism Disorder or maybe Asperger's? Or perhaps most interestingly, if he had been diagnosed as a child, would his life look different today?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/09/member-of-hidden-horde.html", "title": "\nA Member of the Hidden Horde?\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 17, 2007", "body": "\nI came across a blog entry today that kind of dampened my mood. I am not nearly as deeply involved in autism advocacy issues as some of you are - I tend to leave many of the most serious issues to those who I feel have more credibility than I do in various contexts. However, this particular thing really irritated me and left me with an uneasy feeling. The perspective I bring in this case is one of a father who wants to see all of his kids have great opportunities in life. Opportunities unspoiled by ignorant or selfish people. I realize that I cannot ultimately control my kids' exposure to things like this, but it still rankles me when I see the type of prejudice and lack of understanding that I just read. I am referring to the following blog post:  http://stanleybing.blogs.fortune.com/2007/09/14/the-guy-in-seat-12a/#comments First of all, notice that in this post the author does not actually mention Autism. He refers to a guy who occupied the seat next to him on a flight who was overly absorbed in his Blackberry Device. He uses language such as this: \"Here are several things he did NOT do during the time we were confined together: Talk; Smile; Respond to polite observations (\u201dI wonder how long we\u2019re going to be on the ground here\u201d)\u2019; Get up, even once, to stretch his legs or use the restroom; Watch a movie or use the personal in-flight entertainment system; Eat the in-flight meal, although he does have a few hot nuts; Drink anything except water with a bit of cranberry juice in it. \" In a follow-up post, he initiates the term  \"Blackberry Autism\" . Here is the link for that post: http://stanleybing.blogs.fortune.com/2007/09/17/blackberry-autism-a-worldwide-phenomenon/ I know nothing about this guy - he may be the nicest, most thoughtful and well-intentioned person in the blogosphere. Based on what I read, which compares \"The Guy in Seat 12A\" - a Blackberry addict -with an autistic person (not otherwise specified), I am thinking he could use some impetus to stop for a moment and consider the effect his words have on a population to which I suspect he means no direct harm. But it is very inappropriate for him to use his personal (mis)understanding of a real disorder to coin a new phrase. Let's draw some comparisons. In his list of the passenger's behaviors, he writes that the person did not \"Get up, even once, to stretch his legs or use the restroom\". But his ensuing post did not use the term \"Blackberry Paraplegism.\" He writes that this guy did not \"Watch a movie...\" but his ensuing post did not use the term \"Blackberry Blindman.\" If you read his tags, you will notice that he also refers to ADD, Alzheimer's, and Bipolar. It seems like a bit of a pattern is developing, though admittedly I have not taken the time to read those tagged posts. I have never been an overly Politically Correct kind of guy. I do respect people's desire to be referred to in a certain way, and will adhere to that to the best of my ability, but am most definitely not a \"PC\" purist by any stretch of the imagination. But I also have a protective streak as relates to my kids. And I think this kind of reference specifically casts autism in a negative light - no talking? no smiling? no response to polite observations? These are textbook prejudices - ones that I myself held just a few years ago. I encourage anyone reading my words - some of whom may be tempted to give him a piece of your mind, to sit tight for now and refrain from doing so. I have always found that the \"let's attack the opposition!\" approach creates more hard feelings than good ones. But it would be nice if this blogger noticed my comment (assuming it is passes moderation - still pending at the time of this post) and made some kind of response indicating that he has tried to understand the issue I raised. We'll see. ***Update:  The blogger - his name is Stanley Bing - has responded to my comments and clarified his reasons for choosing to coin the phrase \"Blackberry Autism\" (see the first of the two links). He is allowing a link to here after reading my recommendation that he considers the issue further, which seems like a stand-up thing to do. For anyone coming over from that site, I recommend that you visit the  Autism Hub . The Hub is a central point for bloggers on the topic of autism, many of whom are autistic themselves. You may learn, by reading the thoughts of those who are immersed in the Autism community that Autism is not necessarily what you thought it was.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 11, 2007", "body": "\nToday was Day Three of the Conference put on by the the USD Autism Institute:  \"People, Not Packages\".  I have already described why I feel this has been such a good conference, and there is no need to go into that again.  So I will just discuss two points. First - Stephen Hinkle, along with Jodi Robledo (Assistant Director of the AI at USD), did his first presentation.  Apparently, as Jodi explained, Stephen assisted her in a \"breakout\" session at last January's conference.  The attendees were so impressed with his perspective that they overwhelmingly requested that he become a featured presenter.  So here he was.  The title of the presentation was \"After the Final Bell:  The Importance of Extracurricular Inclusion.\"  As the title so adequately indicates, Stephen feels that extracurricular activities are what generate positive feelings about school and result in positive memories from school (what he refers to as the \"fun half\" of school).  He states that his epiphany came when a care-worker of his gave him an \"assignment\" his senior year of high school to attend the Homecoming Dance.  He did so, and that night changed his life.  It is his hope that, through his explanation of this issue, other kids will not have to wait quite so late in life to have their \"homecoming\" night.   Just a bit more detail on this guy - Dx'd at age 4, recommended institutionalization (in his words: \"A life sentence in prison without chance of parole, for no crime committed).  Moved from state to state, settled in California, reached full inclusion in fifth grade, graduated San Diego State University with a B.A. in Computer Science in May 2007, hired as Tech Manager for a new High School - good pay, full benefits, no more SSI, no more Medicaid.  He said that, had he kept the address through the years, he would have loved to have sent a copy of his college diploma to the diagnosing psychologist - you know, the one that recommended institutionalization.  Great line.  The only thing that bugged me about his presentation was the crowd reaction.  At times, everyone seemed to get a huge kick out of Stephen doing something such as asking the crowd to offer responses to his hypothetical questions.  It was almost as if, since he was pretty much skating through the presentation using very typical public-speaking strategies, this was cause for amusement.  I may be taking the whole thing wrong, but I found it to be rather patronizing.  Oh well, I guess if everyone shut up whenever I thought they should, not much conversation would take place in the world :) Second,  I just want to summarize what I think the Prime Movers of the conference are really trying to illustrate with their research, analysis, and discussion points.  Please understand that this is my take on their message, and that I do not want to put words in their mouths.  (They = Dr. Donnellan, Jodi Robledo, and Martha Leary). What I took from it is that we need to move away from the \"deficit model\" of autism.  The DSM-IV-r defines autism specifically by what autistic people cannot do compared to NT's (by the end of the conference, I must state here, EVERYONE was using the term NT - ever since Amanda's video was shown.  Amanda - it really does work - you know, Getting the Truth Out :) ).  This, in their view, improperly biases observers to look for \"voids\" of  good behavior or existence of \"bad\" behavior - without ever considering the root cause of any given behavior at all.  It leads to the (classic behaviorist) conclusion that \"If I can just isolate this one behavior and eliminate it, my subject will become less autistic.\"  An example (my own, made up right here on the spot):  In small children, a commonly observed autistic behavior is lack of response to the child's name being called.  The deficit model would indicate any of the following familiar reasons:  She is in her own world (isolation) and cannot hear you;  He is so focused on the spinning truck wheel (perseveration) that it trumps all other stimuli, She is overloaded with other stimuli and cannot sort your voice from other sounds (sensory integration), etc...   But perhaps it is that he/she does hear, does want to respond, and simply cannot organize his/her sensori-motor system quickly enough that the observer receives a response quickly enough that it is deemed (culturally determined, of course) to be appropriately delivered in an acceptable period of time.  Do you see the difference?  This really strikes at the heart of Neurodiversity, in my opinion (and the blog, after all, is One Dad's Opinion).  If the child were able to organize himself and respond in one second less time, would this, then, eliminate one aspect of his autism?  Would this be the determining factor in receiving a PDD-NOS Dx instead of an autism DX?  Very interesting stuff, and I like it because it presumes competence.  Presumption of competence is a prerequisite to assigning dignity to another person.  Words to live by.  Thanks, USD, for a great learning experience.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/07/last-day-of-great-conference.html", "title": "\nLast Day of a Great Conference\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, August 4, 2007", "body": "\n It is a term that causes all facets of the autism community to calm down and listen: Evidence-based Interventions. It implies a sense of hope and security. \u201cWhy, if its evidence-based\u201d, we say to ourselves as parents and professionals, \u201cit is bound to be effective. After all, it has been proven \u2026 verified \u2026 it is evidence-based.\u201d If I am a die-hard believer that if I \u201cget the mercury out\u201d then I will get my child back, then I want evidence to show me that my chosen path is the correct one. If I have a more skeptical nature and believe that science really hasn\u2019t given us any cause yet, I certainly feel better exercising my duties by supporting my child with an intervention that provides the highest likelihood of optimal outcome. If I am somewhere in between, or have some completely different theory about autism (such as: I parent a Crystal Child), I still want to do the right thing. I want someone to filter through all of the scientific data and provide me with a roadmap for positive results. Dammit, tell me what to do so I can get it right! Quite obviously the proper approach, the thing to do that will allow the greatest opportunity for your child\u2019s quality of life in the long-term, is to follow whatever the prevailing scientific evidence shows is the best thing to do. Right? Well \u2026.. maybe. Based on the most recent evidence released, considered alongside other evidentiary findings both collaborative and antithetical, we should no longer continue to provide ABA-type therapy to my son, Jason if we are stoic followers of the Evidence-Based approach. Oh, but we will, as we definitely feel that \u2013 despite evidence to the contrary \u2013 the behavioral intervention that Jason has undergone at varying levels of intensity since age 3 has been beneficial to him in any number of ways. But another study (more evidence!) states that ABA is not benefiting autistic children in any measurable way. The purpose of this entry is not to call into question whether or not Evidence-Based Interventions are the correct interventions to utilize to support one\u2019s autistic child. Instead, it is to promote a discussion on how we define Evidence-Based (hereafter referred to as EB), how we consider the effects of its application, how we ensure that it remains as undiluted a term as is possible, considering the number of scientific \u201ccamps\u201d that will exercise territorial rights over it. There are two things I would like to discuss up front: First: In introducing this topic \u2013 one I feel is very important \u2013 I was directing my statements towards parents and professionals. Unlike most of my writings, I excluded autistic individuals. The reason for this is that \u2013 up until now, anyway \u2013 the views of autistic adults have not been seriously considered in determining the best \u201cearly-intervention\u201d approaches to take. Like many others, I am interested in seeing this change, and believe that one legitimate way to start that change is to spark a change in the way autistic people are viewed within the context of this issue. Therefore, anyone who read the intro to this entry and did NOT think to themselves, \u201cWhere does the autistic viewpoint come into play here? What if the \u2018evidence\u2019 runs counter to what our adult autistic friends can tell us about a given approach?\u201d then please consider yourself called-out. It is essential that you and I and all the scientists engaged in this dialogue put those considerations at the forefront of any decision-making process, as virtually all ethics-based decision-making processes cannot proceed without it. Second: I have had several separate but significant events happen recently which have forced this issue to the forefront in my thinking about autism and what my son\u2019s future might look like. [1]Our funding for ABA stopped due to Jason\u2019s age. We have paid privately for most treatments for our son, and done so with the understanding that he is benefiting from them. Adding the expense of his ABA is not easy, but we of course will do so (actually, have done so for a while) without any hesitation since we believe he tangibly benefits from it. [2] I recently made an acquaintance who has been able to provide me with tremendous insight on many aspects of autism. To use the term acquaintance works only in the context of a semi-formal discussion such as this. In truth, I have made a friend. This friend has provided me with some incredibly profound and deep insights on the EB issue, among others, and I am extremely happy that I have found a like-minded person with whom I can discuss these topics. [3]I read a very good assessment of the most recent study on the efficacy of ABA on  Michelle Dawson\u2019s  blog. If one reads this analysis and also follows the trail Ms. Dawson leaves via links to other analyses, it is plain to see that a) EB is not as easy to define as one would think, and b) if I truly believe EB is the proper approach, perhaps it is time to drop ABA. As I stated above, we have no intention of ceasing Jason\u2019s behavioral therapies \u2013 but does this them mean that I oppose EB interventions? So, where to from here? I can think of at least 5 major topics of discussion on the issue of EB treatments/interventions. In my next few posts, I plan to review some of these issues \u2013 both positive and negative \u2013 that I see as being crucial to the welfare of autistic individuals. What I would like to do in the meantime is to invite all autism bloggers to discuss this issue - now. I have reason to believe that this discussion is urgent and timely, and that the more progress we can make on establishing a common position on this, the better off all autistic individuals will be in both the short and long term.  Please join me in discussing this important issue in any and all forums.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/08/autism-and-aba-in-uk-controlled-trial.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/08/part-1-evidence-based-interventions.html", "title": "\nPart 1:  Evidence-Based Interventions\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, September 27, 2007", "body": "\nI popped on over to the Rescue Post today to see if the rapturous self-actualizing had settled down for a bit after Jenny McCarthy's whirlwind book tour of the U.S. media.  I immediately noticed another Juxtaposition.  In case you missed my last post, it was a brief commentary on the interesting contrast between the way the autism research, political action, and parent communities have reacted to this past few weeks' news and media as relates to autism. The two major issues can be boiled down to:  (1)  a model/actress/mother of an autistic son has stated that she believes that her son's vaccinations caused him to become autistic and that the treatment she followed as a result of knowing the cause of his being autistic has caused him to no longer be autistic.  (2)  an expert panel assembled by the CDC, including one powerful anti-mercury member who was 'in step' with all other experts and contributed to the design and methodology of the study, published a study that concluded that mercury body burdens, as measured by Thimerosal uptake, has not resulted in significant neurological abnormalities in a specific age cohort. Gosh, what's an open-minded, clear-thinking person to do?  Believe Ms. McCarthy, or believe the CDC's panel of experts, experts who represent a range of backgrounds and areas of expertise? (To be fair, this argument is not all that simple.  After all, the MMR or - as Ms. McCarthy refers to it - \"The Autism Shot\" does not contain and has never contained Thimerosal.) So, now that you clear-headed and truth-oriented people out there are honed in on the issue, here's today's Juxtaposition, courtesy of the Rescue Post! {Click this link}   http://www.rescuepost.com/ Did you see it?  Right there on the front page.  A post by J.B. Handley, a truly lovely guy who considers autistic folks to be 'trailer-dwelling coo-coos' and once said to my friend  Kev Leitch , \"If we were on a rugby pitch, Kev, I'd put my boot in your eye and twist\u2026\"  about how wonderful a spokesmodel Ms. McCarthy is for their cause: Jenny McCarthy Missile Sinks USS Gerberding   by JB Handley \"I\u2019m not sure why CDC employees wear sailor suits, but after Jenny McCarthy\u2019s two week talk show romp, they\u2019ll be bailing water out of battleship CDC for months to come .....   Through Jenny\u2019s courage ... a national debate has emerged that is already forcing major change .....  It\u2019s hard to fathom how many children Jenny has already saved.\" Got the picture?  Okay.  Let's see how the same group reacts to the published, peer-reviewed study that included uber-mercury mom Sallie Bernard. AGAIN: A STUDY SHOWS NO LINK BETWEEN VACCINES AND AUTISM By Anne McElroy Dachel \"The fact the CDC has an obvious bias in showing that vaccines haven't damaged hundreds of thousands of children because they also run the vaccine program, isn't noted.  ..... We are to believe the endless pharmaceutical advertising dollars that ABC, NBC, and CBS News get along with the New England Journal of Medicine and WebMD hasn't possibly influenced their reporting ..... Maybe someone at ABC, NBC, or CBS NEWS should tell us why we should be so confident that it's safe to inject mercury into children when the CDC can never show us the one test that matters. ..... What the news networks don't tell us is that maybe all these endless population studies are damage control--a desperate attempt, after the fact, to disprove a scientific truth .....\" Ahhh, now one sees it.  The only rebuttal to be made by the mercury crusaders is based on conspiracy theory innuendeo.  And thus we have a second Juxtaposition.  Summary:  When we place the two messages originating directly from base camp of the vaccines-cause-autism contingent side-by-side, it is plainly obvious that we are being told to ignore experienced, serious researchers and instead to follow the advice of a Hollywood actress/model-turned-Mom.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rescuepost.com/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/09/juxtanother-juxtaposition.html", "title": "\nJuxtanother Juxtaposition\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 20, 2007", "body": "\nWe received an interesting email from my son's school today: ***** Regulations Proposed to Eliminate Federal Medicaid Reimbursement to Schools After years of fighting back the federal government\u2019s threat to eliminate schools\u2019 reimbursements for certain services provided to Medicaid-eligible students, school districts throughout the nation were dealt a severe blow that could have a significant impact on their budgets. On August 31, 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) formally released proposed regulations to eliminate reimbursement for Medicaid expenditures for school-based administrative activities and special education transportation services, thus marking the first step in the federal rulemaking process. The September 7, 2007, Federal Register posting of the proposed regulations (CMS-2287-P ) indicates the proposed rule is estimated to reduce federal Medicaid outlays by $635 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 and by $3.6 billion over the first five years (FY 2009\u201313). If adopted, California stands to lose more than $130 million annually in federal reimbursements for administrative responsibilities and certain home-to-school transportation services to students with disabilities (See August 18, 2007 Fiscal Report Article entitled, \u201cFight Continues on Proposed Federal Medicaid Regulations). The proposed rule would become effective October 1, 2008. The CMS, under the umbrella of the federal Office of Health and Human Services, has consistently argued that the program is fraught with fraud and abuse, citing examples in New York and Michigan . Those claims have been strongly disputed by school agencies in those states. In response, President Bush eliminated the funding in his 2008 Federal Budget, and CMS started developing the regulations. However, the President\u2019s proposed cuts have been rejected by the Democratic Congress, which has supported legislation to tighten up program requirements instead. The battle now moves to Congress; it will need to get language into a \u201cveto-proof\u201d bill to prevent the regulations from being implemented. The comment period has begun and will end on November 6, 2007. CMS is charged with reviewing the comments and preparing a final rule. California and national education groups are preparing comments for submission and school agencies are also being encouraged to submit comments. Comments can be submitted in one of three ways: 1. Electronically. Submit electronic comments on specific issues in this regulation to  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/eRulemaking .

A copy of the proposed regulations can be found at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/Downloads/CMS2287P.pdf http://www.gregontheweb.com/New_Folder/07-4356.pdf ***** While doing so in a typically obfuscating way, what this document is saying is simply this: The Federal Government will no longer continue to subsidize school districts' expense of transporting students to and from school. The original justification for covering the cost of medicaid-eligible (this definition covers many special needs kids) students' school transportation was that, since IDEA dictates that Medicaid must reimburse schools for costs incurred by meeting the requirements of that student's IEP, then transportation costs to and from the location of the school (in this translation, School = Medicaid Provider) are implied to be included in that reimbursement. The result of this is that most special needs students automatically are offered transportation to and from not just their own local school, but also (speaking from personal experience) to any other specialized schools or educational programs that are specified in the IEP.  Different people will draw different conclusions on this whole thing. Here are some of my thoughts: -Students with special needs already have a number of cards stacked against them. Their families do too, in many cases, including financial and time constraints. It seems wrong to me to cut back services for this particualr population. -Is it ultimately the school district's responsiblity to provide transportation for special education students, and they have pawned off that responsibility to the federal government through a Medicaid-based loophole? If so, any anger directed toward CMS for this would be better oriented toward the school districts to begin with. -Notice the wording of the document we received. In quintessential, uber-liberal, teachers-union-backed form, the author implicates the Republican administration as the culprit, and the Democratic congress as the potential savior. Puh-lease - this is not a partisan issue, and if the power roles were reversed then precisely the opposite scenario would prevail. I grow incredibly weary of the insertion of partisan political gamesmanship into issues such as this, when basically the  entire government  is at fault. It is astounding to me that, considering the taxes collected by the government for just the activities of my one family - including sales tax, vehicle tax, property tax, income tax, captial gains tax, etc, etc, etc - the school district cannot afford to transport one of my three kids back and forth to school. It boggles the mind and offends the intellect. And it transcends political party. And the political discussion would be incomplete if it did not also include the educators' various unions. -If you take the time to read the linked document, you may come away with the feeling, as I did, that the CMS may have a legitimate beef with the way schools are billing Medicaid. It says:  \"CMS has long-standing concerns about improper billing by school districts for administrative costs and transportation services. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office have identified these categories of expenses as susceptible to widespread fraud and abuse ... In fact, examining State-reported expenditure related to schools reveals that, in certain years, a number of States' reported school-based administrative expenditures approached or even exceeded their reported school-based direct medical service expenditures, which is clearly evidence of improper claiming in this area.\" So let me get this straight. Because the school districts improperly (fraudulently) claimed excessive administrative costs (does anyone doubt the truth of this?), we are now facing a situation where transportation could be cut off for special needs kids? My family will work around it if indeed it happens this way - other families may not be as blessed as mine. Other kids have disabilities requiring much more complex and expensive transportation considerations than mine. Other kids may be being raised by a single parent who has work schedule conflicts. Some families may not have the financial means to own a vehicle to get their kid to school (in which case they probably should have waited until better financial times to have a child, but that is a rant for another day). I hope the administrators who robbed the system lose at least one night of sleep over the results of their actions. But its not likely they will. -Is there not a better way to distribute these funds? In other words, any given dollar that is collected from a taxpayer that eventually ends up being spent on Special Ed transportation is passing more desks, obviously, than is necessary. The money, apparently, is going from the Federal general fund to the State general fund, from there to the Medicaid general fund, then to the school district general fund, where it is appropriated to transportation costs. How many pennies are sucked out of each dollar at each step of the way? Is the tax-collected dollar worth, in your estimation, 90 cents of transportation? 43 cents? 7.5 cents? I have no idea, but I'm guessing 7.5 is closest to accurate. If I ran my business like this system is being run, I'd have to close up shop tomorrow. If there is one thing I love about blogging, it is finding out via comments how many people agree or disagree with me.  Also, please note that the proper means to submit comments are included at the end of the school's email. If you would like to have input on this, this is your chance. The comment period lasts until November 6. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cms.hhs.gov/eRulemaking", "http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/Downloads/CMS2287P.pdf", "http://www.gregontheweb.com/New_Folder/07-4356.pdf"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/09/go-to-back-of-bus.html", "title": "\nGo to the Back of the Bus!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2007", "body": "\nI have been following the vaccine/autism debate since around January 2004. This was the month that my oldest son was diagnosed with Autism Disorder. Upon initial exposure to the concept, I had no significant reaction. I was too wrapped up in trying to figure out an effective course of action - a feeling I have in common with virtually every parent of an autistic child. A few months later, after the initial phases of adjustment to our family's new circumstance, I began to hear more about the ongoing debate. The debate began to matter to me when I mentally framed it in terms of how it may affect treatment decisions we would make for our son. As a result, I went off in search of knowledge. To make a long story short, a story that includes stops at  EOHarm Yahoo! group , at  PubMed , at  LeftBrain/RightBrain , and at many points in between, I eventually arrived at my conclusion. And this was a conclusion that was not to be taken lightly, as I had another baby on the way and decisions about vaccination were imminent. As a result of my evaluation of the available evidence, I unwittingly became a member of one of the autism community's 'camps'. This camp, this school of thought, believes that autism is not resultant from vaccinations, that an autism 'epidemic' has not been convincingly shown to have occurred, that an autistic family member is not a blight upon a family, that many autistic people show significant improvement over the course of their life in the absence of 'miracle cures', that those individuals who are most profoundly affected by autism are to be valued, supported, and are no less able to understand if we are treating them with dignity and respect than their \"higher on the spectrum\" brethren, and much more. Much can be said, in fact has already been said, about the (mis)behavior of many people who populate the camp on the other side of the vaccine/mercury debate. Their behaviors have been reprehensible in many cases - read just this one  letter  for some good examples of what I am referring to in terms of attitude towards autism and autistic people. Anyone has looked in on the EOHarm group in the recent past can vouch for the ongoing spite and malice that pervades their routine communications. And so we come to the Juxtaposition. Juxtaposition is defined as ... \"an act or instance of placing close together or side by side, esp. for comparison or contrast. \" And this happened over the last week or so in the autism community. Both camps feel vindicated in their views as a result of this juxtaposition.  The \"Autism is mercury poisoning\" camp (oh, wait, did they already  change that message  in response to a lack of data to support their position? Or did they commission their own phone survey in an attempt to  support their position ?) found validation last week and this week in the ongoing book tour of Jenny McCarthy. Jenny, as anyone who is reading this has got to know by now, is promoting a book in which she describes how: she believes that the MMR shot (yes, I know MMR does not contain Thimerosal) caused her son's autism and that various biomedical treatments, including the non-dangerous GFCF diet, have \"rescued\" her son from autism. 'Nuff said on  Jenny , as plenty has been  discussed  elsewhere on the internet. The other camp, my camp, the one who feels that the weight of scientific evidence exonerates mercury in childhood vaccines as a factor in Autism Disorder, also received some validation this week. Today, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that \"...Our study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immune globulins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years. \" Don't take my word for it, read the  abstract  yourself. The most obvious issue that the Mercury Militia will latch onto with this study is that it \"...did not assess autism-spectrum disorders.\" And this criticism, as relates to the debate, is valid to a degree. However, the neuropsychological metrics that they assessed clearly fall within the scope of what are recognized to be traits involved in the  Autism Disorder diagnosis . \"The outcome measures included speech and language indexes, verbal memory, achievement, fine motor coordination, visuospatial ability, attention and executive-functioning tasks, behavior regulation, tics, and general intellectual functioning (Table C of the  Supplementary Appendix ). Measures of attention, hyperactivity, and executive functioning were based on reports from parents and teachers.\" I'd like to direct you to this article by one  Dr. Gilbert Ross . In the  article , titled  Vaccine Litigation over Mercury and Autism Puts Kids in Jeopardy , Dr. Ross promotes the view that not only have vaccines been exonerated - again! - as a cause of autism and other neurological disorders, but also that the continuing legal debate potentiates the risk of a stoppage in production of vaccines altogether due to legal liability. I think even some fringe anti-vaxxers might agree that this would not be a positive outcome in terms of public health. The juxtaposition lies in the fact that one side of the debate has been in  rapture  over the occurrence that a B-list celebrity has taken to the airwaves to promote a book that discusses the author's belief that the MMR vaccine caused her son to become autistic, whilst the other side of the debate has been supported by a well-designed, large scale study that concludes that Thimerosal in childhood vaccines does not correlate with neurological dysfunction by the age range of 7-10. If the Scales of Justice were to weigh both current developments, here's one dad's opinion that the science outweighs the Indigo Mom's specious conclusions. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EOHarm/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/index.php", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/evidence_of_venom.html", "http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com/2007/06/survey-says-nothing.html", "http://www.childrenofthenewearth.com/free.php?page=articles_free/mccarthy_jenny/article1", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=650", "http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/357/13/1281", "http://ani.autistics.org/dsm4-autism.html", "http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1281/DC1", "http://www.acsh.org/about/staffID.11/staff_detail.asp", "http://www.acsh.org/factsfears/newsID.1070/news_detail.asp", "http://www.rescuepost.com/rescue_post/2007/09/jordache-jeans-.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/09/juxtaposition.html", "title": "\nJuxtaposition\n"},

He has a full-time shadow to help him through the more difficult moments, and everyone seems to agree that Jason is doing very well with this placement.  Especially Jason... *** During the parent-teacher meeting, when we asked how, in a general sense, Jason is doing, Jason's teacher burst into a big smile and told us the following story: The class was gathered around Ms. D'Nealian, who was holding their attention with some sort of information sharing game.  She was engaging the students to say something about themselves, or about her, or about whatever they chose.  She elected to start at the beginning of the semi-circle - her left - and work her way around giving each student an opportunity to talk.  As the students took their turns to talk, and the speaking job moved closer and closer to Jason, he began to get very fidgety. {Aside:  Jason is almost always fidgety.  He shows an extremely inquisitive nature, and asks a LOT of questions during the school day.  So many, in fact, that he constantly walks around all day  with his right arm upright at the shoulder, bent 90 degrees at the elbow, forearm resting on the top of his head.  This way, when he has a question, he can efficiently raise his hand in .0000057 seconds and ideally receive his answer much more quickly.} As each student in the arc ahead of Jason did their speaking bit, his movements became more pronounced.  First his hand would shudder in an effort to hold it back from shooting upwards to question-mode... Student A would stand up, say \"Ummmmmm, Ms. D'Nealian, I have socks that look like your socks\" and sit back down.  Jason would begin to \"jog in place\" with anticipation... Student B would stand up, say \"Ms. D'Nealian, my daddy has lots of tools and, and a truck that's fast and stuff\" and sit back down.  Jason was hopping by this time. Student C would stand up and say, \"Ms. D'Nealian, I saw a frog this weekend.  He was green.\" and sit back down.  Jason, whose turn was next, by this time was hopping and jogging in place, both hands straight up in a 'touchdown' signal... \"Jason, what would you like to say?\" asked Ms. D.Nealian.... Out from my little boy bursts - the kind of BURST that can only take place after holding back for a while -  \"I LOVE YOU!!!   I LOVE THIS CLASS!!!!\"  He is now jumping up and down wildly, his enthusiasm infectious!  All the little kids leap up from the floor - \"I love you too!\"  \"I love this class too!\"  It was a storm - a perfect storm of unleashed goodwill!  It was as if the proverbial crowd stormed the playing field.  Love was in the air!   And - amidst the chaos of 5 year-olds and 35-year olds celebrating their very existence in the wonderful classroom known as K5 - Ms. D'Nealian stopped a moment to observe my son.  My son Jason - who has his whole life ahead of him and will carry the things he learns in Kindergarten with him every moment of that journey - was standing there amidst leaping kids and grinning teachers/aides/volunteer moms with his hands on his hips, beaming from ear to ear, looking from side to side, being as smug as can be as if to say \"I DID IT, damn it!  I caused this glee!  I am Jason!  Join me in celebrating!!!!!  I LOVE this class!!!!\" *** If you've ever seen the end of the movie Rudy, you'll know how I felt when she told us that story.  Its a moment that will never leave me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/Rya0_uR9XtI/AAAAAAAAADU/BxLfewHrtuo/s1600-h/DSCN1144.JPG"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/best-story-ever.html", "title": "\nThe Best Story Ever!\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, November 7, 2007", "body": "\nI'm not sure what the topic of this post is.  I guess it is an admission that I am passing through a (hopefully brief) period of flagging enthusiasm for keeping my blog as current as possible.  It has been a week since I posted anything at all, and a few weeks since I have posted anything resembling valuable contributions to discussion relating to autism (That post, by the way, titled  \"The Autism ... Continuum?\"  netted some of the best and most varied comments I have ever received, comments that originated from a very diverse range of people covering various age groups, NT and ASD, several countries - all in all, good stuff). Don't get me wrong - I don't plan on stopping.  Its just that there are so many things going on in my life and in the autism blogosphere that the net effect seems to temporarily be that I haven' got enough creative juice to post as regularly as before. So what exactly is going on?  Let's see... 1)  We had tremendous wildfires here in Southern California, which caused a huge week-long distraction. (I actually  wrote  about that experience). Also recently occurring are such things as a trip to Disneyland for Jason's birthday, surgery for one of our dogs, school meetings and whatnot, lots and lots of work due to seasonal shifts and covering for out-of-the-office co-workers.   Lots to do leaves little time and energy for writing. 2) A favorite  blogger  (and friend) of mine was threatened and harrassed straight off the internet by \"the bad guys\".  His site always provided a good petri dish for autism-related discussion, as it was frequented by such a diverse group of people.  Other people whom I respect and like very much have also stopped or all but stopped blogging.  Though, as always, there will be new people entering the community who have great things to offer, that doesn't mean I can't miss the other ones. 3)  The more I read about and learn about autism, the more I realize that a non-academic like myself will have a hard time contributing new thoughts to the area I feel most strongly about:  improving understanding of the condition of autism and using that understanding to provide better supports for ASD individuals.  I am going to keep trying, but I am not one to spend too much time rehashing other people's thoughts or findings.  Therefore it is difficult sometimes for me to generate \"new material\".  But I don't want my blog to degenerate into a site like Harold Doherty's where I just grab autism news off the newswire and spin it to launch attacks against those who are ideologically different from me.  If I can't take a stab at a careful, reasoned discussion (when that is my intent, not including posts where I am simply  celebrating my family  or  having some fun , then I'd rather not say anything at all. 4)  We have three kids now, and they take a tremendous amount of time to care for, attend to, and nurture.  And that is priority #1.  So devoting the time to keeping up the blog is difficult.  I also have a very challenging and demanding career.  Again, a good thing, but it does make it hard to keep up the blog. So anyway, I am going to get my mojo back soon, I expect.  There still is much to talk about, much to learn, much to do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/index.php"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/11/excuses-excuses.html", "title": "\nExcuses, Excuses\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 14, 2007", "body": "\nThough it has been more than a few years now, I still recall elements of my undergraduate degree. Though I did not pursue it as a career, I majored in Psychology with an emphasis on Neurophysiology. In the lower level Psych classes, it seems that just about everything they taught us was based on the concept of \"stages\". Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development. Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development. Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development. In keeping with the basic idea I was left with - that the majority of these developmental diagrams were just flawed attempts by smart people at making sense of an incredibly random and unpredictable series of potential developmental trajectories - I will now introduce to you  Steve D's Stages of Autism Acceptance Development (for NT's) . Let me begin by saying that my stages will be tremendously flawed, unable to be generalized to anyone but my own self, and might even piss a few people off. Stage 1:  You don't know, and you don't know that you don't know. Stage 2:  You don't know, and you begin to know that you don't know. Stage 3:  You know, but you don't know that you know. Stage 4:  You know, and you know you know. Any parent of a child diagnosed with autism is intimately familiar with Stage 1. This is the time when we know nothing. We are pretty much going off the limited and largely fallacious information provided to us by the person giving the diagnosis. This information usually contains the line, \"A person diagnosed with autism may even someday have the ability to live independently in a group setting.\" While true for many autistic people, this flawed statement does not even begin to describe the real set of possibilities that exist for many others who receive this diagnosis in their first few years. But when someone is new to their child's diagnosis, you just don't know these things. One also, if they share a similar background to me, has limited if any experience in knowing autistic people. One has virtually no working knowledge of what \"autistic\" really means. One has no conception of the range of difficulties the disorder can cause people to experience, no conception of the huge variance in personal experience autistic people can live with. It also has an overriding negative connotation - another thing which proves that at that stage we \"don't know\". At some point later, we enter Stage 2. Everyone does. This is sometime after we have spent X amount of hours researching treatment options, funding options, outcome studies, reviewing discussion boards, attending local meetings, joining Autism Societies, meeting parents of other special needs kids via the school district. This is the point where we say to ourselves, \"Crikey! (if we are Australian, anyway, which I am decidedly not) There is so much to learn!\" And so we go about it. This is a crucial stage, and is the one that usually devolves the autism community into sects. Based on choices made at this point, one tends to set down a particular path. There are a million choices, but most are settled on while we are still in the \"Knowing we Don't Know Stage\". I cannot comment on the last 2 stages, other than saying this: -I am still in Stage 2 -I know a few NT folks who I think are in Stage 3. -A non-autistic person cannot get to Stage 4. Someday I will learn all about Stage 4 from my son. He is a bright, verbal, autistic boy who is not facing some of the challenges that other autistic people are facing. He is going to have his own set of challenges, especially I think those related to navigating social situations. I hope to raise him in such a way that he can, if he so chooses, be the ultimate advocate. An autistic person with Steve D's Stage 4 Awareness.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/11/not-knowing.html", "title": "\nNot Knowing\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 18, 2007", "body": "\nIf you were to perform a PubMed search for studies that include \"visuo-spatial\" and \"autism\", you might come up with 15 studies that indicate differences between the way autistic people process visuo-spatial stimuli versus control groups of neurotypicals.  Perhaps this goes a long way towards explaining why many autistic folks - and many of their allies in academia and parenting communities - object to the use of the term \"Autism Spectrum\".  Let me explain. \"What?\" the casual observer may ask, \"I didn't even realize that the use of the 'spectrum' was controversial\".  Well, its not really elevated to the level of controversy yet.  But as the realization of the need for protection of the rights of autistic people grows, so too does the need to consider the language of the topic.  And 'spectrum' is one word that deserves consideration. Consider, for example, my first exposure to the word.  This is a brief outtake of the story of the day we received our son's autism diagnosis: After standing by while my son completed a battery of behavioral and performance-based tests, I was asked by the psychologist to take Jason downstairs for a while so whe could complete her analysis of results.  After about 45 minutes, I brought him back up to the Pediatric Neurology offices for the diagnosis.  She worked with me through the initial process of diagnosis, describing each diagnostic criterion and asking if I agreed.  After 11 affirmative responses, she knew she had brought me to the point where I understood where she was going with this.  And so she continued with a description of the Autism Spectrum - the first I had ever heard of it: \"On this third, you have Asperger's Disorder. In the middle, you have PDD-nos, and the most severely affected are in the Top Third, called Autism Disorder or Classic Autism. Your son is in the top third, probably somewhere in the middle of that segment. This means that he has less of a chance of living independently and functioning normally in society than if he were in the other two sections.\" It was as if she had a special \"Autism Sextant\" that pinpointed precisely where he fell, at the ripe old age of 39 months, on the linear spectrum. And, being totally new to the diagnosis and having a complete void of any competing knowledge, I bought the whole line.  So this was my working knowledge of the autism spectrum - as a linear spectrum going from 'mild' to 'severe' - for maybe a year or so after my son's diagnosis.  How simplistic this view now seems to me. You see, the Autism Spectrum is  not  just a linear representation of behavior, with one end being the \"best\" and one end being the \"worst\".  Instead, it describes a continuum of subjective experience and behavior, resulting from neurological atypicalities, which can vary significantly over the lifespan of any individual who is labelled autistic. Notice that I have selected the word Continuuum here. Description:  Continuum theories or models explain variation as involving a gradual quantitative transition without abrupt changes or discontinuities. It can be contrasted with 'categorical' models which propose qualitatively different states. So by viewing autism as a continuum, we can incorporate the concept of fluidity of behaviors or experiential factors, thereby creating an increased ability to understand and discuss autism issues in a more realistic fashion.  At the same time, we avoid the Spectrum's push towards 'grading' behavioral presentation to the detriment of potentially diminishing the value of the individual. Too often, productive discussion on the topic of autism is limited by term usage such as \"high-functioning\" or \"low-functioning.\"  You will occasionally see comments such as \"Person A is just Asperger's or HFA, and therefore can't be considered alongside Person B, who is non-verbal with SIB's.\"  And there is something to this, as everyone I think agrees that some autistic individuals' symptoms or characteristics are much more debilitating than others.  But to simply compare HFA to LFA is far too simplistic.  Such a view ignores tremendous variation in \"clusters\" of abilities and disabilities related to autism.  I have read or spoken with several autistic adults, and a common theme is that \"some days are better than others\".  Or, to put it another way, a person can appear to function at different levels at different times.  I think the continuum concept captures this fluidity. Another criticism I would offer of the linear spectrum concept is adopted from a researcher-friend of mine.  She has stated (paraphrasing here) \"Spectrum?  Bahh.  That's just something the Behaviorists cooked up to separate those they could help from those they couldn't figure out.\" I think what she means by this is that allowing ourselves to label an individual as being in the lowest functioning category provides a wealth of excuses for ourselves to consider them outside the realm of \"help-able\".   Here's another angle, albeit somewhat Sophist by nature.  Taking this idea of a Spectrum to its extreme, then at any given moment ONE PERSON is the most autistic in the world.  One person is also the least autistic, and is just one person away from no longer being considered autistic.  This is purely conceptual and has no pratical application other than to highlight how the Spectrum can result in a \"ranking\" of behavioral presentation.     I have also been part of numerous discussions on the topic of a cure where this linear spectrum concept is inadvertently interjected into the conversation.  Usually the commenter will say, in reference to their efforts to provide a cure for their child's autism, \"All I want to do (with treatment X or intervention Y) is to move him/her up the spectrum.  Is that so wrong?\"  What the parent is insinuating, though probably unintentionally, is that their child's current 'level' of autistic functioning can be incrementally, quantitatively improved by degree and the progress can be tracked.  This is almost never the case.  Typically, when parents talk about their children's progress, it goes something like this,  Parent A:  \"Well, she has started talking now in single words, still isn't forming sentences.  But her use of sign language is improving all the time.  Unfortunately,  it seems that she has a lot of anxiety since school started, and her sleep patterns are very erratic and unpredictable.\" Parent B:  \"My son is not talking at all, and has never really had significant anxiety problems.  He's always very calm, like an old soul.  His fascination with airplanes is really taking over his other hobbies right now - he won't read anything but that topic.  And ever since we moved out of the city, he doesn't scratch or bite his arms anymore like he used to.\" In both of these examples, there is no clear delineation of improvement or regression.  The changes in the kids are Fluid.  They are on a Continuum.   This discussion, as do so many others, boils down in large part to the fact that we don't have a very good working definition of autism.  Autism Disorder is still, from an academic standpoint, a term used to describe a set of observable symptoms.  I hope the academics consider the importance of defining and endorsing a better way of describing the tremendous range of individuals that carry the label of Autism than placing them all on a linear Spectrum.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/autism-continuum.html", "title": "\nThe Autism ...

{"date": "Sunday, November 18, 2007", "body": "\nAt the end of my most recent post,  Breaking Bread , I talked about how we were having some friends visit this weekend, I would be attempting a fairly difficult recipe - authentic Spanish Paella ( sans  rabbit, of course) - and that we would be heading off to \"A Day Out With Thomas\". So its only fair that I report the results of the weekend .... which was a rousing success on all levels! First up, the Paella. You must realize that I am a foodie with little opportunity for outlet of my foodie-ism. I am not a big eater, but I like what I like and often crave well-prepared fresh foods . Suffice it to say that flavor trumps dietary value in my book. So when I set out to decide what to make for our guests this weekend, I hearkened back to a recipe I last made, with the help of my visiting-from-Chicago  gourmand  best friend about 7 years ago ( pre -kids). Actually, this is the same recipe we used then. Essential is the Paella pan. This is a 13-inch skillet with low, flared sides and dual handles. It is the utensil that gives the dish its name. Paella is Spanish fare, and therefore it is prepared in numerous forms dependent upon the region the cook hails from. In coastal regions, for example, clams and oysters are  de   rigeur . In regions with hard winters, such as the mountainous areas, cured meats are common ingredients. Since I am not a seafood guy, I lean more towards the \"turf\" than the \"surf\" version. I chose to use bone-in chicken breasts (chopped into thirds) and Portuguese  Linguica  sausage for the meats, and green beans, artichoke hearts, and red peppers for the veggies. The true heart and soul of Paella, however, is the rice and the saffron. Saffron - that rarest and most expensive of all spices, gives Paella its characteristic yellow color and  unmistakeable  aroma. The rice I used is  Arborio  - a medium grain that tends to end up  al   dente   as opposed to mushy or chewy. The recipe took me three hours to complete - non-stop cooking. I probably could reduce the over-the-stove time with experience, but since I am a Paella novice I really had to sweat every step this time. Here I am slowly  sauteeing  the red peppers.  In the pan you will notice a whole head of garlic with the top trimmed off. This stays in the pan the whole time - through all steps - and imparts a wonderful, deep, rich garlicky flavor that deepens as the process unfolds. The sauce pan holds the saffron-infused chicken stock that provides the unique flavor of the dish. The broth won't be added for another hour or so from this point. The red peppers are sauteed after the chicken and sausage has been done. After they have softened considerably, I will remove them to a plate and tent them with foil. This way, the steam their heat builds under the foil will help loosen the skin so I can easily remove it before adding the peppers back in for the final step. Details, details! While all that  sauteeing  is going on, I have to keep chopping,mincing, and grating.  Yes, grating. Part of the key to a good Paella is the  Sofrito .  The  Sofrito  provides the flavor base. It is the equivalent of a  Mirepoix , or the Holy Trinity of celery, onions, and bell pepper in Cajun cooking. But since Paella does not stew or roast for long periods, the flavor base has to be  pre -deconstructed, so to speak. So what I did is grate a whole tomato and grate a whole onion to make a big tomato/onion mush. To this, I added thin slivers of garlic (yes, more garlic). Also in this picture you will see a bottle of Spanish  Rioja   - a sturdy red wine made from  Tempranillo  grapes. When in Rome, and all that, right? The lemon  wedges  are to serve with the finished product for those who prefer to add a squeeze of tartness. The  Bosc  pears are for the salad. And now, the finished product! At this point I have boiled down over 5 cups of saffron-infused chicken stock. By rotating the Paella pan over two burners, as well as covering it with foil and placing it in a 425-degree oven, I have caused the rice to absorb all this liquid. Also, I have been passably proficient in producing the pinnacle of Paella perfection (awesome alliteration, eh?) - the  Soccarat . This is the term that describes the light brown crusting that develops on the bottom layer of rice in the pan. It is just shy of burnt, and is the final piece of the multi-layered puzzle of flavor in this dish. Note in the middle of the pan that whole head of garlic still tagging along.   Okay, no more food talk. I am sated for a while, and now return to my regular diet. This morning we went to 'A Day Out With Thomas'. This was out third year going, as Jason is perhaps the biggest Thomas fan the world has ever known.  {Aside - One of the best moments I have ever had with Jason was a time when he had found the Thomas website (by himself, of course). He was in his fourth year, and was gaining some verbal skills at the time. He still had lots of issues - and still does - with voice volume modulation, so I was trying to teach him to whisper. To do so, we got on the  webpage  that has all the  Sodor  characters listed vertically, with a brief synopsis (a CV, if you will) of each one. Well, little did I know he was going to go through every single one, whispering their name and 'story'. I was simply overwhelmed with the volume of information he threw at me that night (it was  late  at night as I remember, before we discovered melatonin), and amazed at his ability to keep reverting to a whisper as I reminded him. It was one of those moments where we just ... connected. Those moments were rare back then, and I'll always appreciate his love for Thomas as being one of the things that gave us some ' conversation  material'. } What would make this year's visit interesting would be our friends' little boy - all of almost-three years old - and his undying enthusiasm for all things Thomas. And the day certainly lived up to its billing.  We rode the train pulled by the life-sized  Thomas engine - that was fun as always.This is Colin on the train, straining to be turned loose on the unsuspecting passengers.  We also got some pictures with Sir  Topham   Hatt . Trying to get three young boys to look at a cameraman is difficult in any case  - when you add the Amphetamine Personified that is Sir TH, it becomes nigh on impossible. Making the day even more .. interesting .. is that it was close to 90 degrees  fahrenheit . It was just downright HOT and it was hard to escape the heat and sunlight. If you combine the effects of the heat, the crowds, the excitement, having guests spend the night before at our house, all the Thomas paraphernalia, and some ice cream you begin to see the recipe for what parents of  ASD  kids know to be somewhat of a problem -  sensory overload .  Today, though, Jason surprised us all. He actually agreed to let a clown paint his face! This is a huge step for him, and one that caught us completely off guard. His sensory integration issues would have prevented this from even having been a consideration in the past. This is a huge difference from last year, and we are just so proud of him for doing this today. He has always had a lot of sensory issues, and that makes this a really big deal! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R0ER7waxaLI/AAAAAAAAAD0/dDMHVbc6RvI/s1600-h/DSCN1678.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R0Eh0AaxaSI/AAAAAAAAAEs/8jJUznk0rig/s1600-h/DSCN1678.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R0ETmQaxaMI/AAAAAAAAAD8/8AuaMqaF_fk/s1600-h/DSCN1679.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R0EizQaxaTI/AAAAAAAAAE0/3DxU2cUG2uc/s1600-h/DSCN1679.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R0EbwQaxaPI/AAAAAAAAAEU/Qu5JHuNXOKY/s1600-h/DSCN1694.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R0EaewaxaOI/AAAAAAAAAEM/mWZWQ39flF8/s1600-h/DSCN1688.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R0EdsgaxaQI/AAAAAAAAAEc/gxQl83U1NwE/s1600-h/DSCN1708.JPG"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/11/more-food-and-friends.html", "title": "\nMore Food and Friends\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 17, 2007", "body": "\nRecently, we had a very nice visit from some friends. Their family is kind of a mirror image of ours - 3 kids, each set within a few months of age, oldest child autistic, semi-rural lifestyle. Its always a pleasure to spend time with them, and since it was at our house, I made lunch. Prior to having kids I was a pretty avid home cook. As with so many things, this changed a bit when the responsibilities of parenting took hold. I'd gladly make that exchange again 100 times, but that doesn't mean I can't long for the 'easier' times (funny how they only seem easy in retrospect. Aaaah, such is life.) So I made the usual; sandwiches, salad, side dish. The sandwiches featured smoky, thin-sliced Black Forest Ham piled on slices of crusty french bread. I added freshly grated Gruyere cheese with some freshly chopped tarragon for some flavor complexity and then spread on some Dijon mustard. I then coated the bread slices with butter - on the outside, of course - and toasted the sandwiches in a grill-pan till the cheese was all melty and the tarragon flavor had been released. In the meantime, I sauteed a skilletful of cauliflower florets in olive oil until they took on a golden color and nutty aroma (I love cauliflower). I removed the cauliflower from the pan and added a whole chopped onion and more oil (I've never been noted for low-fat cooking). Once the onion was sweating, a BIG pinch of Spanish saffron went in, followed by some chicken stock. At this point I added a can of stewed Roma tomatoes, some toasted pine nuts, and a heap of chopped Italian parsley. And, of course, the sauteed florets. After simmering for a bit to reduce the liquid, I coated the whole thing with some homemade fresh garlic breadcrumbs (made earlier in the day by toasting some of the crusty french bread I used for the sandwiches, along with oil, parsley and minced garlic in the food processor) and put the whole pan right in the oven at about 400 degrees. The result of all this is a rich, deep bronze panful of spiced, roasted cauliflower with a coating of crusty garlic breadcrumbs. Heaven. Moving on to the salad. A bed of field greens such as baby spinach and frisee. One peeled and chopped Bosc pear (I like Bosc pears because they are dry and crispy like apples - perfect for salad). A big handful of toasted walnuts (toasted side-by-side with the pine nuts earlier in the day). And some crumbled, rich, strong blue cheese. I'd have used Stilton, but the market didn't have any. Finish it with a Balsamic Vinaigrette - a really light, bright one - and that makes one heck of a lunch. But wait! A really good meal always requires a wild card. Sometimes it is a special announcement someone makes while eating. Sometimes it is a big storm during the meal, or a hallmark being celebrated. An old friend makes any meal special. Even the perfect song (like, for example, anything off 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' album). In this case, our guests had brought a bottle of wine. This was a Zinfandel that comes from the vineyard they had been married on. Awesome sentimental value, superb wine, the wild card was complete, and the meal was a success. Gotta love that. Tomorrow we have some other friends coming over. This time, they are spending the night so we can all get up and go to 'A Day Out With Thomas' in the morning. Their little boy likes Thomas the Tank Engine as much as ours does, and we will get to see the 'real' Thomas engine and ride in the train. I'll make an authentic Spanish Paella (yes, saffron seems to be the spice of choice for me these days) with chicken and sausage, artichokes, sweet peppers, green beans, arborio rice, and a  sofrito  of grated onion, garlic, and tomato. And perhaps a Spanish  Rioja  to add some depth to the meal. I just love food and friends.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/11/recently-we-had-very-nice-visit-from.html", "title": "\nBreaking Bread\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 1, 2007", "body": "\nWhen I started this blog in April of this year, I had already spent significant amounts of time familiarizing myself with much of the autism \"buzz\" on the internet.  There is lots out there, from message boards to propietary websites, from PubMed to weblogs, members-only groups to daily newsfeeds.  As with anyone who wants to become involved in the online community, I had to decide what was important to me.  What did I feel was an area that would stand to make me a better father for my autistic son?  Did I have anything to offer to the online discussions, considering that so much had been so adequately covered already.  I'm not particularly confrontational, I don't have advanced science degrees, I dont have enough internet savvy to run a \"newsfeed\"-type site.  One area that I felt affected me most strongly is the interaction and relationships I was able to develop with autistic adults who communicate via the internet.  I've got to say this was a surpsrise to me - a pleasant one at that - because when I first encountered these online self-advocates I was still early enough in the parenting process that I did not realize the extent of positive outcomes for autistic individuals.  I took it upon myself to read a lot about what they had to say, how their lives looked right now, what affected them positively and negatively, what similarities and differences they shared.  And slowly but surely I began to shift my view of autistic people from being a homogenous group from the pages of a textbook to being a group of people as varied and diverse in their abilities, pursuits, limitations, interests, and relationships as will be found in any group anywhere.  All this took place before we had any indication of what skills my son would someday develop.  In those early months and throughout the first year+ after diagnosis, Jason was nonverbal.  He had frequent and powerful stims.  He seemed very detached from us, and he had extreme sensory problems.  He still faces many of those challenges, but as he grows we are able to say with certainty that he is not one of the most negatively affected by autism.  Jason has no SIBs, is developing strong communication skills, and does not seem to deal with the anxiety issues I hear so commonly about from autistic folks. So I have spent much time on this blog discussing autistic people - not just my son - in the context of cultural issues, being accepted in our society, government funding, transportation issues, affect on parenting styles, evidence based interventions, cause and cure issues, self-advocacy, and many other topics that I feel are important. Having said all that, I recently received an email from a reader.  I want to share excerpts of this email with you and to express that it is messages like this that make all the work that goes into this blog worthwhile.  This was in response to a post I did last month when I indicated my focus on the blog will diminish due to other familial and professional responsibilities and changes in the online autism community: Hi Steve, I wanted to thank you again for all the support and encouragement you've given me. It really means alot to me. I like reading your blog very much. The way that you care about you kids shows in your writing. You have a background in studies that adds alot to what you have to offer. You have shown an interest in autistic adults on your blog that is unmatched by anyone I've seen ... We need people like you. I have fewer responsibilities than you and will look things up for you as just a friend and supporter if it will help give you more time and more to write about. There are actually several subjects that you have posted about that are a lot of interest to me and I would like to learn more about them. It would help me learn and help me express myself better as well. Please continue to blog when ever you can and let me know of any way I can be supportive. I hope you and your family are doing well. Thanks   If I have made even a moderately positive impact on even one person, then it makes this whole undertaking much more gratifying.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/12/making-it-worthwhile.html", "title": "\nMaking it Worthwhile\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 6, 2007", "body": "\nI am pleased to announce that I and a few other Autism Hub bloggers will be presenting at the University of San Diego Autism Institute Conference in January! Several bloggers will be presenting in person - including one of my personal favorites,  Bev  from Asperger Square 8.  The title of our presentation is \"Enhancing Communication:  Blogging and Autism\".  We plan to discuss a number of issues related to blogging and the Autism Hub, with each presenter speaking of their personal experience and area of focus.  Our presentation will also feature two video presentations which will help the attendees gain a greater understanding of how the Hub came to be what it is today and how its contributors and readers feel about it. If you have been reading this blog for a while, you may recall a series of posts ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 )I did in July about the Summer Conference I attended at USD.  I was very impressed with the topics covered, the expertise of the presenters, and the emphasis on providing viable supports for autistic people that emphasized the person over the disorder. The conference will take place from January 7-9 in San Diego. The USD campus is among the most beautiful in the U.S., and the conference itself will take place - appropriately - in the beautiful Joan B. Kroc  Institute for Peace and Justice .  Aside from our presentation, topics will include: -Understanding Sensory and Movement Differences (by Martha Leary, read  here ) -The role of development of learning and other support accomodations -Applying Dynamic Systems Theory -Humanizing and personalizing positive Applied Behavioral Analysis approaches -Understanding the lived experience of persons with the autism label I look forward to seeing those of you who are able to attend!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/", "http://peace.sandiego.edu/about/council.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/12/usd-january-conference.html", "title": "\nUSD January Conference\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 11, 2007", "body": "\n Edit as of 12-12-07 *** Individuals can now endorse the disability community's joint statement by going to  http://www.petitiononline.com/ransom/petition.html *** Solidarity. The autism community has gained solidarity - among many of its own organizations and those that involve other disabilities - in response to New York University's \"Ransom Notes\" campaign. For those of you who have not yet seen the ads being featured as part of this campaign, please take a moment to view them  here... Read the notes -  no really, go read them  - allow your natural emotional response to surface. If I set all personal experience with autism aside for a moment and take a fresh look - seeing these \"notes\", I feel a sense of panic, of a wrong having been committed. That I need to rush to the defense of someone, perhaps come up with some cash to solve the problem. There is an implication of crime, of guilt. A need for swift justice. I can only speak for my own son when I say ...  he doesn't need this kind of publicity. In an astonishingly misguided effort to raise awareness on Autism, Asperger's, Bulimia, ADHD, Depression, and OCD, the NYU Child Study Center has unwittingly produced precisely the result their campaign was 'designed' to combat. The response to these notes, as desired by the ad agency who developed the theme, is powerful and visceral. But it produces the wrong response. Instead of reducing stigma associated with these dosorders, it reinforces the stigma. In a remarkable display of unity, the blogging community has stepped forward in an attempt to help provide a unified response to this egregious affront to people affected by the aforementioned group of disorders. Much of the work in doing so has been borne by one Ari Ne'eman, president of the  Autism Self Advocacy Network . Ari prepared and delivered what I consider to be an excellent response to the leaders at NYU. His response acknowledges their good intentions, but clearly and appropriately spells out just exactly why the 'Ransom Notes' campaign has been met with such resistance within the autism community. Since Ari has done such a great job of reflecting my own thoughts on the subject, I need only to shut up at this point and post his letter here. ********** Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, M.D. The NYU Child Study Center 577 First Avenue New York, NY 10016 Dr. Robert Grossman, M.D. NYU School of Medicine IRM 229 560 First Avenue New York NY 10016 John Osborn President and CEO of BBDO New York BBDO New York 1285 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10019 Richard Schaps, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Van Wagner Communications, LLC. 800 Third Ave 28th Floor New York, NY 10022 To the NYU Child Study Center and the supporters of the \u201cRansom Notes\u201d advertising campaign: We, the undersigned organizations, are writing to you regarding your new ad campaign for the NYU Child Study Center: \u201cRansom Notes\u201d. Our organizations represent people with a wide range of disabilities, including those portrayed in your campaign, as well as family members, professionals and others whose lives are affected by disabilities. As people who live and work with disability, we cannot help but be concerned by the way your campaign depicts individuals with disabilities. By choosing to portray people on the autism spectrum as well as those living with OCD, ADHD and other disabilities as kidnapped or possessed children, you have inadvertently reinforced many of the worst stereotypes that have prevented children and adults with disabilities from gaining inclusion, equality and full access to the services and supports they require. While the \u201cRansom Notes\u201d campaign was no doubt a well-intentioned effort to increase awareness and thus support for the disabilities it describes, the means through which it attempts this have the opposite effect. When a child with ADHD is described as \u201ca detriment to himself and those around him,\u201d it hurts the efforts of individuals, parents and families to ensure inclusion and equal access throughout society for people with disabilities. When individuals with diagnoses of autism and Asperger\u2019s Syndrome are told that their capacities for social interaction and independent living are completely destroyed, it hurts their efforts for respect, inclusion, and necessary supports by spreading misleading and inaccurate information about these neurologies. While it is true that there are many difficulties associated with the disabilities you describe, individuals with those diagnostic categories do succeed \u2013 not necessarily by becoming indistinguishable from their non-disabled peers \u2013 but by finding ways to maximize their unique abilities and potential on their own terms. The \u201cRansom Notes\u201d campaign places a stigma on both parents and children, thus discouraging them from pursuing a diagnosis that might be helpful in gaining access to the appropriate services, supports, and educational tools. The autism spectrum should be recognized for what it is: a lifelong neurological condition \u2013 not a kidnapper that steals children in the dead of the night. The devaluation of the lives of people with disabilities has led to public policies and funding decisions that have forced thousands of people with disabilities into nursing homes and other institutions. The unintended consequences of ad campaigns like yours give legitimacy to the taking away of the civil and human rights of people with disabilities. It is true that diagnoses of ADHD, autism, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, and OCD often accompany great hardships for families. It is true that depression and bulimia are terrible disorders that require treatment. Yet, the way you choose to convey those messages is inappropriate and counterproductive. Individuals with disabilities are not replacements for normal children that are stolen away by the disability in question. They are whole people, deserving of the same rights, respect, and dignity afforded their peers. Too often, the idea that children with disabilities are less than human lies at the heart of horrific crimes committed against them. The recent tragic instances of violence against children and adults on the autism spectrum and with other developmental disabilities are linked to the perception that these people are less than human. We \u2013 the adults, families, professionals and others affected by these conditions - assert that nothing could be further from the truth. We are also concerned that the negative stereotypes the \u201cRansom Notes\u201d campaign depicts could make it harder for the many people with disabilities and their family members who are working to ensure that students with disabilities have the right to be included in their home schools while still receiving all necessary services. Federal law mandates that students with disabilities have the right to a \u201cfree and appropriate public education\u201d in the \u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d. Your advertising campaign claims that children with disabilities could be a detriment to those around them and as a result hurts the efforts of parents working to secure the opportunity for their children to be included with their peers. While we recognize and applaud the good intentions intended by this effort, we must urge you to withdraw this campaign immediately, as it threatens to harm the very people whom it seeks to benefit: people with disabilities, their families, and their supporters. In the press release announcing this campaign, the Center gave as one of its goals \u201celiminating the stigma of being or having a child with a psychiatric disorder\u201d. We are in full agreement with the goal of eliminating stigma against people with disabilities and their families. Yet, this campaign serves to increase that stigma rather than lessen it. We hope that you will heed our concerns and those of many other people with disabilities, family members, professionals, and countless others and end the \u201cRansom Notes\u201d advertising campaign. Please do not to hesitate to contact any of the organizations listed as signatories to this letter in order to better solicit the opinions of the disability community prior to your next advertising campaign. We would be more than glad to help the Center to develop better strategies to achieve its excellent goals. The NYU Child Study Center has the potential to do enormous good for children and families affected by disability. By showing that the Center respects the views of people with disabilities, families, and professionals, you can make that aspiration a reality.

{"date": "Thursday, December 20, 2007", "body": "\nIn  case you haven't had enough calls to action recently, what with the  Ransom Notes  campaign and all, I've got another one for you. Yesterday I received an email notification from the NIH (National Institute of Mental Health) Autism Listserv.  This email was an RFI (Request for Information) for the  autism community to make recommendations for future autism research directions.  Here's the email: \"The National Institute of Mental Health has issued a \u201cRequest for Information (RFI): Research Priorities for the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Strategic Plan for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).\u201d  Please see the official notice for more information and instructions for responding by the deadline of January 4, 2008:   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-08-003.html    The purpose of this time-sensitive RFI is to seek input from ASD stakeholders such as individuals with ASD and their families, autism advocates, scientists, health professionals, therapists, educators, state and local programs for ASD, and the public at large about what they consider to be high-priority research questions.  Please forward this email or share this request with any individuals or groups who may be interested.\"    Please note the deadline - January 4.  This is a mere 15 days from now, so a sense of urgency seems appropriate at this time. If you follow the link provided in the email, you will see a bit more information about the RFI.  Some key phrases stand out: \" The Combating Autism Act of 2006 ( Public Law 109-416 ) re-established the  Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)  and requires that the IACC develop a strategic plan for ASD research. \"  Yes, that actually stated that there is a legal mandate driving this process.  Though this circumstance is accompanied by its own set of problems, I think it is clear that some conclusions will be reached and a plan will be laid out.  If you, like me, have any concerns that the plan may not end up to be what you envision as being supportive of or appropriate to autistic people, now is the time to voice that opinion. \"In its inaugural meeting on November 30, 2007, the IACC approved a process for developing the strategic plan that includes multiple opportunities for stakeholder input.\" Huh?  They had a meeting already?  Well don't worry, a very strong and appropriate  statement  was delivered by Kristina Chew that hopefully helped to frame some of the decisions that will be taking place.  Thank you for your timely and well-chosen words, Kristina. \" To identify research priorities for possible inclusion in the strategic plan for ASD research, the IACC will convene several scientific workshops in January 2008. The responses received through this RFI will be collated, summarized, and provided to workshop participants. The scientific workshops will be organized around four broad areas of ASD research:\" The 4 areas are  Treatment, Diagnosis, Risk Factors, and Biology .  While it is in all likelihood too late to have input on what the 4 areas are, it is certainly the right moment to influence what direction these 4 areas will go in.  If you believe that vaccine studies are not a fruitful way to spend autism research dollars, say so now or risk Risk Factors being all about that.  If you are an autistic person who has benefitted from the GFCF diet and believe that research will result in the same benefit being granted to some other autistic people, please let the IACC know that now.  If you feel that Asperger's Syndrome and Autism Disorder belong in different diagnostic categories, argue why you feel that way.  If you think the JRC is an abomination, perhaps a recommendation to the IACC about researching electroshock therapy is in order. Notice that the RFI also allows for the category \"Other areas of research\".  Perhaps this is where you want to step in and try to make a difference in how future research directions will be established. Conveniently, contact info for Diane Buckley, Office of the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, is also listed for the purpose of supporting inquiries. I have followed any number of autism debates over the past couple of years, and am acutely aware that virtually all elements of the autism community feel under-represented.  Virtually all feel strongly that research should be oriented a certain way.  Well, guess what folks?  Now - NOW! - is the time to exert your individual and collective influence on the process.  I exhort each person, each 'stakeholder' in the autism community, to take some time in the next two weeks to organize your thoughts and present them to the NIH.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-08-003.html", "http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ416.109.pdf", "http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-funding/scientific-meetings/recurring-meetings/iacc/index.shtml", "http://www.autismvox.com/statement-to-the-interagency-autism-coordinating-committee/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/12/exhortation.html", "title": "\nAn Exhortation\n"},

After attending day one of the Winter Conference, the answer is a resounding NO! I am, as I was during the July conference, simply amazed at the ability of this group of presenters to make us think about our understanding of autism. I would love to break down today's sessions with a scintillating discussion of Presumption of Competence, the \"I Don't Know\" tenet, and an expansion of the discussion of  Movement Differences , but I can't. I also would love to go on about how much I enjoyed the company of Bev from  Asperger Square 8  during today's sessions. But I'm going to settle for this little blurb: In one exercise, Martha Leary had us attempting some speech while limiting our use of certain common language conventions. This exercise was designed to help us realize how it might feel to have speech limitations. Bev explained to me afterwards how this exercise felt in relation to her typical efforts involved in conversation and speech. Contrasted with the way the exercise impacted my abilities, I picked up some new insight as to how it may feel to spend the day as an autistic person. Thanks, Bev, and I hope you enjoy San Diego as much as we enjoy having you here! The reason I am limiting this post is: I need to be ready to do the Autism Hub presentation tomorrow! I still have some touch-up work to do, and I need to make sure the videos will play properly and my talking points are in order. So goodnight for now, and wish us luck tomorrow.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 19, 2007", "body": "\nI just received an email notification from Ari Ne'eman, President of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and current spokesperson for the wider disability community, that NYU has announced the end of the 'Ransom Notes' campaign. Here is a  link  to Dr. Koplewicz's official statement. A few brief words about all this: First, I can't overstate how impressed I have been by Ari Ne'eman's leadership during this process.  Though I am not sure at what point Ari assumed his unofficial leadership role, or how he individually ended up in that position, he acquitted himself admirably by all measures.  Ari, in his writings encouraging a response from the broader disability community, facilitated a tone of honest and open communication by using such a tone himself.  Noticeably absent from his statements was the contentious nature of so many debates and discussions, at least those in the autism community.  Ari was consistent in his position as a coalition-builder, was appropriate in his chosen use of diplomacy to achieve the goal of ending the ad campaign, was clear in his explanations of why the campaign was harmful and offensive to those who live with the labels/disabilities it centered on, and has fostered an environment in which Dr. Koplewicz is now willing to sit at the table with the disability community and craft a campaign that can bring about the ends that NYU initially was striving for. As I said in my earlier post on this topic, I don't think Dr. Koplewicz ever intended to cause harm to anyone.  Quite the contrary, I am thankful that there are professionals who dedicate their lives to careers that serve to benefit people with disabilities of all kinds, and he is certainly to be included in that group.  I think this is clearly evidenced in his closing statement about the 'Ransom Notes' campaign:  \"We hope you will partner with us to bring the issues surrounding child and adolescent mental health to the top of America's agenda. Work with us as we fight to give children and their families equal access to health insurance, remove the stigma that the term \"psychiatric disorder\" so clearly still elicits, and, most importantly, support the drive to make research and science-based treatment a national priority.\"  While there are still some things in his statement that I disagree with or are couched in such a way as to indicate that his hand had been forced, I am appreciative of the steps he has taken today. Here are some closing words from Ari Ne'eman which I think encapsulate the issue well: \"This is a victory for inclusion, for respect and for the strength and unity of people with disabilities across the world. It is that message that has carried the day in our successful response to this campaign. Furthermore, we intend to build on this progress, not only by continuing a dialogue with the NYU Child Study Center and using this momentum to ensure self-advocate representation at other institutions as well, but also by building on the broad and powerful alliance that secured the withdrawal of these ads in the first place. We are strongest when we stand together, as a community, as a culture and as a people. Thank you to all of you who have made this victory possible.

Thank you for attending, and for showing an interest in the goings-on of the Autism Hub. I sincerely hope you apreciated our presentation and that you have a good feel for who we are, what we do, and why we do it. I encourage you to take look around the Hub and spend some time reading each blog. There is much to be learned by doing so. If you see things you like, have a question for one of the writers, or would like clarification on something, leave a comment for the author. Many of us are quite responsive, and would love to learn from your experiences as we share ours. And to the Autism Hub bloggers - I, for one, was proud to represent you today. We showed some great videos prepared by some Hub veterans, including Estee, Kev, Autism Diva, and Do'C. Lisa/Jedi, Kassiane, ABFH, Jeanette, Casdok, Sharon, and Ken from Autism News Beat were featured in Autism Diva's video. Bev from Asperger Square 8 and Dad of Cameron both shared in the presentation and acquitted themselves marvellously. Bev talked about autism self-advocacy on the internet as well as discussing many Hub particulars and her own brand of blogging, and James added his capable voice to the discussion of autism science on the Hub. Bev and HollywoodJaded created wonderful flyers for distribution (I'll try to post the PDF at some point so you can see it). I am proud to have stood next to my two co-presenters, and proud to have represented all of the Hub bloggers' efforts over the years. Over 2,000 posts. Over 60,000 comments. Attitudes changed. Policy affected. Lives improved. Science advanced. I am humbled to be a part of this.

You see, the three of us who participated are not exactly seasoned veterans of the speaking circuit. We are people with a message who were provided a wonderful and unusual opportunity to offer that message in an unfamiliar medium. We coordinated our presentation amidst the separation of 2 continents, 3 countries, 4 states, about 9 or 10 people, 2 powerpoints, 4 videos (2 specially made for this purpose) - all via email and some brief conversations. One error we made in our approach was the time needed to present. I know I had the feeling, and I think Bev and Do'C did also, that we each personally were going to struggle to fill the time allotted to us and thankgoodnesstheothertwoweretheresotheycouldpickuptheslack! But it turned out that we all had plenty to say, that the attendees had lots of questions for us, and that after about 115 minutes of what was supposed to me a 90 minute presentation, we had to stop. I had not yet done my part, the topic of which was to be how the Autism Hub can help to develop a positive parenting approach. So, in keeping with the spirit of the presentation, I explained that I would post my portion of the presentation to my blog so that interested attendees could visit the Autism Hub with the intention of reading it there.  So ... here is my part of the presentation, condensed down from speaking version to written version.

Some of you don\u2019t have to imagine it \u2013 you know exactly how it feels. And I could describe to you how it felt for my wife and I when our son was diagnosed back in January of 2004. I think one of the most significant memories I had of that time was a feeling of not knowing where to turn. Immediately following the grave pronouncement of our son\u2019s diagnosis, they sent us home with a pamphlet of general autism information and a thin packet listing local service providers. That\u2019s it. \u201cUmmm \u2026 he\u2019s autistic, now have a nice day!\u201d And it seems to me in talking to other parents that many of us have this same feeling. Here we are, in the initial stage of our entry into the world of special needs, and not really having any good idea where to turn for guidance and support. Now imagine that you jumped on the computer during those early days post-diagnosis and came across the Autism Hub. You clicked on the video I just played. Yes, this video was just posted for the first time last week. Unlike some of the other videos, it was not specially created for today\u2019s presentation. This is just exactly the type of thing you find on the Hub. The creator of the video, by the way, is right here \u2013 he is Dad of Cameron from Autism Street. How would you feel as you saw this? (To self: Really ask the audience here- How would you feel?) I know how I felt upon my early exposure \u2013 I felt like I had found the right place for me. Here were thoughtful discussions about how to ensure a good world for our kids. Here were powerful scientific minds who had already spent thousands of hours sifting through available research and were eager to discuss their findings. And best of all, here were autistic adults and those who care about them \u2013 adults with highly variable presentation of autistic characteristics\u2013 discussing all kinds of things ranging from advocacy to services to bullying. Important things that are relevant to every autistic person\u2019s life. What\u2019s more, by reading these blogs and interacting with the authors of them, I came to realize that autism was not just the quiet little boy in my own home. The autism community is big!!! and many adults had been much like my boy during their youth and were now engaging me in intelligent, lucid debates about a huge range of topics. Your flyer contains a quote from Autism Diva\u2019s site \u2013 \u201cAutism, Its Not What You Think\u201d. There is an important message included in that simple statement. Consider for a moment the impact of this revelation. This was prior to my son developing speech, he had been diagnosed with classic autism, he was our first child, and we had no tools to even begin to anticipate what he might present like in 5 years, 15 years, 30 years. And here were these people, some of whom were just like my own son, taking their time to educate me on autism. The brochure I was given was wrong, Autism was not what I thought. So I\u2019d like to share with you, briefly, some of the ways in which my exposure to, and participation with, the Autism Hub helped shape our approach to raising our son, who is now 6.  The first thing I think that hit home by reading the Hub has to do with how we chose to support Jason. I choose that word carefully \u2013 support. You see, the very first stage some parents enter after the autism diagnosis for their kid is what I call the \u201cparent-as-superhero\u201d stage. This is the point where you say to yourself \u201cI\u2019ll do anything \u2026 anything! Move anywhere! See the best experts! Spend ourselves into bankruptcy! Anything to save my son!\u201d We certainly reacted this way. But what I realize now is that the goal all along should not have been to \u201cFix\u201d my son. He is wonderful and perfect under any circumstance. The idea was to learn about and then to provide the proper supports for him just like Martha and Gary have talked about in prior sessions. The realization that a cure-oriented approach was not going to be the one for our family did not in any way result in a lack of effort or attention to providing proper supports. What it did do was to focus our efforts on enjoying his process of development instead of always wishing for something different and looking for gradients of behavior, it allowed our family to spend its time learning together instead of staving off unwanted behaviors, and it caused us to put our son\u2019s self-esteem at the forefront of the goal structure. In our case, the support strategies we settled on included various speech and behavioral therapies, educational supports, a special weekly peer group meeting, and an adaptive horseback riding program. I realize that this sounds like a neatly packaged approach in retrospect. In reality, we bumbled through the implementation like everyone does. I have learned that raising an autistic child is not a race whose outcome is determined in the first few laps. Kids become teens. Teens become young adults. They become adults. Since my oldest son is only 6, the only way I have come to realize this is by communicating regularly with autistic adults and parents of kids who are much older than my own. One great example is a very wise woman who herself has been diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome. She has raised a wonderful son who has a lot of struggles with autism. He also is a regular competitor in marathons, and his mom posts wonderful photos and his race times to his blog on the Autism Hub. The young man only recently has begun writing the posts himself, which is great to see. You can get on there and comment to him. Tell him he\u2019s a hero, that he\u2019s doing a great job! His mom might answer, saying he is not yet responding ... but he is listening. Its very inspirational, and no matter how difficult some days seem with my son\u2019s struggles, there are always role models like this to look up to and rely on for a positive outlook. Another important thing I\u2019ve learned is \u2026 Words Matter. There are plenty of highly charged words in the autism community. Only by spending hours in discussion with both autistic and neurotypical people \u2013 all with different views on the subject \u2013 can one begin to appreciate the power of words such as disabled, cure, nonverbal, spectrum, low vs. high functioning. There is, for example, the whole debate between use of \u201cautistic person\u201d vs. \u201cperson with autism\u201d. I respect both views, and since I have learned the impact of these words I am careful in my use of them. Words shape our view of the world, and as a parent taking the time to understand the meaning of what we say can have a big impact on how we think of and view our family and its goals. Words Matter in other ways, too. It is easy to think that when your 4 year old is not speaking at all, and is not responding to you even when you raise your voice, that he is not hearing you. Big mistake, that one. I have also learned that this problem becomes more pronounced as children turn into teens, then adults. Especially for those adults who do not speak! Not being able to speak is not the same as not having anything to say. Not being able to respond is not the same as not being able to hear what\u2019s being said.  Which brings me to my last and probably most important point \u2013 positive outlooks and positive outcomes. I was advised by numerous folks when I first began to interact with the Hub bloggers \u2013 this is long before I started One Dad\u2019s Opinion \u2013 to get over the \u201cWoe-is-me\u201d stage as fast as possible. There\u2019s a whole world out there, a whole life to get to!  Having a Positive Outlook means\u2026 -Focusing on strengths over weaknesses. -It means zeroing in on opportunities for fun, for learning, and for interaction that will be meaningful to your child instead of lamenting that you may not be able to easily do things other families are doing. -It means adjusting your parental view to accommodate your child\u2019s unique set of circumstances -The positive outlook that the parent holds will affect the behaviors of all the professionals and educators who work with the child. Creating a Positive Outcome means\u2026 -Taking steps to educate yourself and understand about what challenges society will put up in front of your child, then working to address those challenges now and into the future. Have the courage to speak out in defense of your child. -Until some sort of medical breakthrough in understand and treating autism occurs, creating a positive outcome DOES NOT mean spending all of your family\u2019s resources, especially time, on experimenting with the latest speculative interventions. It DOES mean providing any and all medical support necessary to ensure your child\u2019s health. -Defining the term \u201cPositive Outcome\u201d can perhaps be the strongest influence on your parenting approach. If you strive to have a child that is \u201cfully recovered\u201d from autism, who becomes \u201cindistinguishable from his peers\u201d, then your approach is bound to be entirely different than if you want to teach him or her to be comfortable in their own skin, to be proud of who they are and the differences they bring. To me, a Positive Outcome is one where a child grows up to be secure in their own identity, and where their disability does not stand in the way of their happiness. This is what I wish for my oldest son. I am not going to stand here and say I\u2019ve got all this figured out. Parenting any child is a challenge. Many styles and approaches will be successful. There\u2019s lots of ways to Land that Plane! (Reference Do\u2019C\u2019s video) But I feel like the opportunity to learn from and in turn give back to the wonderful people who are involved with the Autism Hub gave me an edge in settling on a parenting style that will work to Jason\u2019s benefit. Anyway, that\u2019s \u201cOne Dad\u2019s Opinion\u201d on how the Autism Hub can help develop a positive approach to parenting an autistic child. (Show Autism Diva\u2019s Video here) I\u2019d like to thank all of you for taking time out of your busy lives to learn a bit about the Autism Hub. I hope you all find the time to visit regularly and comment and interact as you see fit. Thank you. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=161"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/01/one-dads-opinion.html", "title": "\nOne Dad's Opinion...\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 27, 2008", "body": "\nTo use a corporate term, I've recently been \"re-engineering\" my blog.  Little did I realize back in April 2007 when I began blogging that it would develop into what it has.  This is my 74th blog entry.  I have had over 750 comments to my posts, most of which have been thought-provoking and appropriate.  I have had over 12,000 visits to my little corner of the internet.  My visitors have come from no less than 20 countries around the world, perhaps more that I haven't noticed.  Blogging has helped me to develop a clearer understanding of the science of autism and the people involved in the autism community.  I can now count among my personal friends other parents of autistic kids as well as autistic adults - I began these friendships online but have been fortunate enough to extend several to the offline world as well.  I have developed relationships with professional authors, I have received positive feedback from professionals who provide service for autistic people.  I have gotten comments from autistic people who have endorsed my efforts at being an ally to autistic people.  I have received a \"Roar for Powerful Words\"  award  from an autistic self-advocate.  I have had 4-hour long cups of coffee with world-renowned autism researchers.  I have signed online petitions and written letters to the NIH and the CMS. My involvement culminated in a  presentation  at the University of San Diego Autism Institute's Winter Conference, at which myself,  Bev Harp , and  Dad of Cameron  spoke to a group of  parents  and professionals about the Autism Hub and how blogging has created a new environment for autistic self-advocates.  In all, my experience with blogging, with the Autism Hub, has been a very positive one.  It has been said that you can only get out of something equal to what you put in - I think blogging fits that paradigm quite well.  The act of writing this blog has made me a better person, a better father to my autistic son. Back to the reorganization.  First, I found a really neat widget that creates a Tag Cloud.  This is the image you see just below 'Recent Comments' on my sidebar.  The Tag Cloud shows all of the tags I have assigned to my posts, and the size of the text is proportional to how many times that tag has been used.  For example, some of my largest tags in the cloud are Autism (what a shocker!), Advocacy, Education, Ethics, Fatherhood, and Parenting.  This I think is a fair representation of the form this blog has taken over time, these are the things I mainly talk about.  Way back in my  second post , I mentioned how I anticipated it would be difficult to find my niche on the Autism Hub in light of how many great writers were here and how effectively they covered the various topics.  9 months later, one can look at the Tag Cloud and see how that question has been answered. Next, I added a section to my sidebar at the recommendation of two people - a \"Best Of...\"  I was hesitant to add this, as I don't consider anything I write to be all that worthy of Best Of status.  But I did it, and it was admittedly fun to take some time to review some past posts.  The last change I made is an idea I swiped from Kev Leitch's  Left Brain/Right Brain  - an RSS Feed to the Aut.Sagepub.com website.  This is an online medical journal that is sponsored by the National Autistic Society of England and features research about Autism.  If you read the Editorial by Lonnie Zwaigenbaum of the University of Alberta, you will see a good synopsis of this issue's studies.  If you happen to be someone like  Harold Doherty , you may be distressed to learn from a couple of these studies that people diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and those who are less severely affected by Autism Disorder also experience difficulties in life. You may even come to agree that it is a valid avenue of research to look at some of these diffculties.  Regardless, I would encourage other Autism Hub bloggers to add this and any other available research-related RSS feeds to your blogs as well.  It is just one small way to increase access to published research for those who may be interested. So that's it for my reorganization.  I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to visit, to read my opinions and offer their own.  I certainly look forward to more such opportunities as we move forward.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/01/moving-toward-respect-for-all.html", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=161", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/01/few-changes.html", "title": "\nA Few Changes\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 20, 2008", "body": "\nI've been wanting for a while to offer some thoughts about Applied Behavioral Analysis.  Before I do, a few disclaimers: I am not an expert, I do not profess to be one.  This is true from both a functional and academic standpoint.  This is, I would remind any reader, One Dad's  Opinion. There is a lot to write about as concerns ABA, and I will definitely not be hitting all issues in one blog post. Comments, as always, are welcome and invited.  If you disagree with any of my premises or opinions, or if you think I am marvellously well-grounded in my ruminations :), let me know. Okay, ABA.  I'm torn on this topic.  I think that, first of all, the methodology and probably the very concept is highly misunderstood by parents of young autistic children.  I think my first concept of ABA was something like, \"They observe and record current behaviors on an ongoing basis, in an established format of record-keeping, and they use progress or lack thereof in specifically defined areas of performance to determine how best to continue to modify the behaviors.\"  My definition has changed a bit over time, but not by much.  When we first settled on this as a good idea for our son, it sounded like a marvelous approach.  Not only that, but it apparently was the only treatment for autism that was backed by some science. I have learned much over the last couple of years.  Many things I've learned have caused me to not only doubt ABA's efficacy, but also to question its approaches from an ethical/humanistic standpoint.  Other things that I have observed and studied have led me to believe that my son has benefited tremendously from our choice to provide him with this 'treatment'. First of all, let me make it clear that our ABA program, administered by a really nice group of professionals, is not traditional ABA.  There was record keeping, but not during interaction between Jason and the therapist (only after).  We reached around 20-something hours per week and sustained that for maybe 18-20 months, but never even came close to the recommended 40-hour regimen.  By virtue of these differences, it would be impossible to say that Jason received ABA in the true clinical sense. Some people I know are critical of the process of this type of B-mod approach.  These concerns are valid, but never seemed to be relevant to the situation our son was in.  There was tons of positive reinforcement, there was a lot of \"parent-training\", and there were lots of breaks, play, and sensory-diet-type interval-based body regulation.  Jason developed real relationships with his therapists, relationships that have lasted to this day.  A great example:  last week was our son Colin's 1st birthday.  2 of Jason's former therapists attended, and neither one of them has 'worked with' Jason for quite a long time.  Jason was very happy to see both of them.  One of them had Jason in her wedding - he walked down the aisle! (with my help) So I suppose the question, at least in our son's case, becomes:  Did the ABA part benefit him, or was it the relationship-based learning?  I don't know the answer to that question - no one does.  But I have done a lot of thinking about it, and have arrived at this thought: Kids learn from their community, the people who surround them.  Many autistic kids, regardless of their specific experience with autism, do not have the community around them that most typical kids have.  This is true for numerous reasons, but I do think that in many cases it is true.  Well, in Jason's case, I think these wonderful, caring people that Jason saw several times per week, people who laughed with him and did his sensory stuff and shared chocolate chip cookies with him (not as part of therapy- just because my wife makes really good cookies), people who were so excited when he passed milestones or said simple words, people who were firm but gentle when they saw a teachable moment and capitalized on it, these people became Jason's community.  And he learned from them - not just skills, but how to be a friend and a kid and a student.  Things all kids should learn.  Maybe, because he is autistic and they were here doing the 'therapy' thing, Jason's community looks a little different than it would for typical kids.  This doesn't invalidate any benefits Jason received, by my estimation, though it also doesn't lend itself to supporting ABA as an approach to improving the lives of autistic people in general.  Okay, I now realize that I have settled on a direction for the first post I am doing on ABA.  I'm going to have to get into some of the other things - the things I originally sat down to discuss - at a later time.  This is one thing I like about blogging:  instead of going back and re-writing this post to smoothly incorporate my topical change of direction, I can simply state my human-ness and move on.  How nice. So, to summarize briefly and create a break off point for this portion of the ABA discussion:  My son has, like many kids, undergone many positive changes during the time he has been exposed to behavioral therapy.  There is no way to know exactly why this change has occurred, but I think it is likely that the people (not the methodology) have been the primary source of benefit to him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/01/thoughts-on-aba.html", "title": "\nThoughts on ABA\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 5, 2008", "body": "\nIt is typically my approach to stay out of some of the 'fights' in the autism community. Every now and then I come across something that really irks me. Sometimes, as in today's case, I can't specifically identify what it is about what I've read or heard that is so irritating. Allow me to refer you to the most recent  post  by J.B. Handley over at Age of Autism. In it, J.B. compares his own sanity (figuratively) to Nancy Minshew, Ph.D., while also comparing their scientific acumen. J.B. begins by offering up the fact that he has read an entire presentation by Dr. Minshew - over 100 pages! Of course, if one were to look at the document he is referring to, one would notice that the first 68 pages are Powerpoint slides. Way to go, J.B.! That's some serious reading! J.B. goes on to say, \"You see, after reading many of the things you have written and said, I find myself in a real funk, a state of angst and confusion.\" Well, that should be a familiar feeling for Mr. Handley in light of the colossal error he made in telling every news and print media outlet a few years ago that \"There is no such thing as Autism. Autism is a misidagnosis for Mercury poisoning!\" He even took out a full-page newspaper ad to tout this position. So how did he resolve that last bout of \"angst and confusion\" when it became painfully obvious to him that he was wrong and that he had made an utter jackass out of himself? When he reached a point where not even his own  cognitive dissonance  could prevent him from seeing the errors in his beliefs? Easy, he  changed his story  and never looked back. J.B. goes on to say, \"I  had never heard of you  until last week when, for reasons I can\u2019t pretend to understand, your name appeared in a number of articles discussing Eli Stone and the relationship between vaccines and autism.\" And this is most interesting since just a few sentences prior to this line, he said, \"My son was diagnosed with autism about 3 years ago. Since that time,  I have devoted myself to reading every printed page of science I have been able to find on autism.  I\u2019ve interviewed or seen dozens of different \u201cexperts\u201d (as you are often referred to in the press), and my wife and I have worked diligently to do everything we can to help our son.\" Here, I think I can be of some help to J.B. You see, anyone can quickly hop on over to PubMed and punch in a quick search that includes \"Minshew\" and \"Autism\". Voila! 83 entries appear. That's a lot of entries! Looks like they range from topics such as sensorimotor control to adaptive behavior. Now, for the purpose of contrast, let's type in \"Handley\" and \"Autism\". One result! Oh, wait. That's a  different  Handley. Oh, well. So, let me get this straight - J.B. Handley has read every printed page of science he has been able to find on autism, but has never used PubMed at all (much less had anything published there)? I'm stunned! So, if that's the case, then he has completely missed (let's see, I'm just typing in \"autism\" now)  11,734 entries  into the scientific record! I think we've estabished that J.B. Handley has a few gaps in his knowledge on the subject of autism! This leads an inquiring mind to ask, why would an illustrious Autism Expert such as J.B. Handley simply 'overlook' so much scientific information on such an important topic? Well, later in his post he conveniently answers that question for us: \"I really didn\u2019t pay much attention to these press mentions of you last week because I\u2019ve grown pretty insensitive to the propaganda effort (as I perceive it) continually underway to defend the national immunization program. \" Ah, there we have it. Anything that does not jibe with his worldview that the vaccination program is actually a grand conspiracy is to be ignored. Boy, that certainly limits your options when it comes to information sources. No wonder he is not using PubMed - it is a government-run database. Forget also the CDC, the FDA, anything related to the government or any pharmaceutical company. None of it is to be trusted. Because J.B. knows the truth, and is just waiting for the rest of us to catch up. Next, of course, J.B. goes through some of the typical talking points one might expect to hear from the autism-is-mercury-poisoining-camp (Can we still call it that? Or should we call it \"some-undetermined-toxic-load-is-autism-but-don't-be-offended-that-I-am-calling-you-or-your-kid-toxic-camp\".) They go something like \"experts'\" ... \"vaccines\" ... \"Thimerosal\" ... \"banned\" ... \"flu shot\" ... \"crazy\" ... you get the picture. J.B., though, always the gentleman, took the time to inform Dr. Minshew that he will be using her email - an email exchanged with a parent who had requested help of Dr. Minshew and was subsequently turned over to J.B. for the purpose of using it to attack her - the day prior to posting this fine article. When she responded explaining that her email was for private use, his gentlemanly response was, and I quote: From: J.B. Handley Sent: Monday, February 04, 2008 11:54 AMTo: Nancy MinshewSubject: Re: Nancy & Me: Who's crazy Says who? And, tough shit. J.B. Handley Just in case you were wondering why I am taking the time to criticize J.B. Handley's post, that last line might convince you. Unless, of course you are one of J.B.'s adulating fan, who left comments to the post that say things like: -\"OK, I just have to say that I almost shot some of the water I was drinking out of my nose laughing when I read JB's final email...\" -\"You Go, JB....I have a visual of a very angry Dr. Minshew with smoke coming out of her nose and ears after reading your email. \" -\"I'm in awe of your ability to combine common sense with science.\" That's right - AWE! -\"JB, WAY TO GO!!! Great letter! One of my favorite parts was in the newspaper article where it was stated that Dr. Minshew was taking off her gloves. HA! She doesn't realize who she just climbed into the ring with, now does she?\" What a lovely group of people, those AOA'ers! So, to answer J.B.'s question -indeed the tongue-in-cheek (which comes across as sneering wise-ass) topic of the post, \"This is my world, Dr. Minshew, it seems clear as day. It\u2019s so different from yours, I really, really need to know: which one of us is crazy?\" It's you, J.B. It's you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/02/dr-nancy-minshe.html#comment-100117330", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/02/jb-its-you.html", "title": "\nJB:  It's you\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2008", "body": "\nValentine's Day is upon us and, for that reason, I'd like to talk about a relevant issue that has nothing to do with autism.  I'd like to enlighten you about Valentine's Day and flowers. You see, I'm a flower guy.  I grew up in a flower business family.  I have spent the last 14 years dealing with commercial cut-flower sales and distribution.  I am not a retail florist - I have no floral design skills or talent - but I do have a strong working knowledge of the worldwide floral industry.  Needless to say, Valentine's Day is a BIG DAY for our industry.  It is also the day when one of the most negative consumer images of the floral industry is reinforced - that retail florists \"price-gouge\" their customers at Valentine's Day.  I am here to tell you that they do not, and that any price increase for Valentine's Day is justified in numerous ways. If I haven't lost you yet, let me explain.  From the beginning. Roses are the flower of Valentine's Day.  This is not news to anyone. For those readers in North America, over 85% of our total consumption of cut flowers is produced in Colombia and Ecuador (with Colombia holding the lion's share).  With roses, that percentage is even higher.  If you are fortunate enough to receive roses for this Valentine's Day, you are most likely receiving Colombian-grown roses.  For those readers who are located in Europe, your market is largely supplied by Kenya and Zimbabwe (even the current violence and political upheaval in Kenya, tragic as it may be, has not slowed down floral exports).  For floral consumers in England, particularly customers of Tesco, you can even check your flowers for \"Food miles\" (a marketing campaign that seems to have run its course) to see that many of your flowers have travelled a very, very long way before arriving on your kitchen table. Now, it is easy to understand that roses, since they are a plant that is put in the ground (or hydroponic growing medium, as it were) to stay for several years, are not intentionally over-produced on a 12-month basis simply so that there are sufficient blooms available for Valentine's Day.  In other words, you don't plant for the holiday, harvest the crop, the plant something else in the same soil.  Roses plants are a multi-year investment that require 24/7/365 care to result in a livable profit.  This means that rose growers must employ special techniques for 'force' a crop for the holiday harvest.  The main method to achieve this is known as 'pinching'.  When a grower pinches his/her crop, he removes a very young flower bud that would otherwise be ready for harvest in the next couple of weeks.  The remaining stem then 'breaks', meaning it splits into 2 stems.  About 6-8 weeks later, each stem 'break' will produce a saleable bud, or flower.  The economic impact of this pinch is tremendous to the grower.  They essentially sacrifice an entire harvest is an effort to double a future harvest.  This is the first mechanism that results in a higher price at the retail florist in Des Moines or Seattle or Bath or Zurich. The next issue that arises is transportation.  Imagine that you own a commercial cargo airline that flies throughout the Americas.  One of your main 'lanes' is the one that runs fresh flowers (and produce) from Bogota, Colombia to Miami, Florida, USA.  (Miami is the port of entry for the vast majority of flowers coming from South America).  You typically fly in one planeload per day, and your sales team has developed contracts to return items to Colombia such as clothing, or paper products, or computer monitors, or other items.  Your established rates are reflective of your ability to generate revenue  both ways , right?  Now, it is the lead-in to Valentine's Day.  Your regular, daily clients - the flower growers in Colombia and the wholesalers/distributors in Miami and throughout the U.S., are relying on you to push through over 10 times your typical volume.  You find a way to add more lift to your flight lane into Miami, but the planes must fly back empty.  Therefore, you must capture the cost of a round trip in just one direction.  This is the second mechanism that causes higher prices for the holiday. Now, picture the need for flowers to be distributed from Miami to all points in the U.S. so they can reach their retail endpoints.  There are a variety of methods available to accomplish this, with the Big 3 being:  Refrigerated trucks, commercial passenger airlines, and express delivery services such as FedEx.  In each case, these transporters face the same problems that the airline from Colombia to Miami faced.  All in light of fuel costs which are dramatically higher than they were just a few short years ago. All of these factors impact the per-stem costs of flowers - most particularly roses - by the time the retail florist gets their hands on them.  Now that they do have their roses, they have their own hurdles to jump.  If a retail florist typically has, let's say, 5 full-time employees on staff, then that is the number they have to work with (plus temps) to accomplish 5-10 times the normal workload.  They need to receive the product, process the flowers (cut stems, place in clean water with floral preservative, clean the stems and strip the guard petals, de-thorn some varieties, and store in refrigeration), arrange the flowers (to custom specifications in many cases), and deliver the product on many orders.  All of this is done with most employees on overtime or, sometimes, even double-time wages, with rented delivery vehicles, with rented refrigerated trailers for additional storage space, and with any number of other issues forcing costs up and up and up. These are some of the reasons why roses cost more at Valentine's Day. And, if you are like me, it doesn't matter at all.  If you are like me, the special person in your life is well worth the money spent. Happy Valentine's Day to my lovely wife!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/02/rose-is-rose.html", "title": "\nA rose is a rose...\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 7, 2008", "body": "\n I sat down to write a post a little while ago and ended up going in a different  direction  than originally intended.   Now I'm going to try to get back on track. ABA is among the least 'contested' treatments for autism.  I think this is because it is viewed as being largely benign by most people.  This has been my view as well, though there are certainly some compelling criticisms of ABA. And I guess that's where I am going with this discussion.  I want to show you in this post some of the 'good' and then briefly introduce some of the 'bad' of ABA (to be continued at another time) and invite you to comment/decide/consider for yourself where you stand on this issue.  If you are the parent of a recently diagnosed autistic child, I'm guessing you may feel differently about ABA than an autistic adult.  If you adhere to the idea that environmental toxins played a major role in your or your loved one's autism (I don't), you are less likely to lend credence to this approach as it does not involve detoxification.  If you are someone who focuses on scientific method and ethical criticisms (I am, though I'm a layperson in both cases), I suspect you may have a different view than someone who feels the 'early intervention' window will slam shut in a matter of months.  You catch my drift, I assume, that ABA undergoes a lot of scrutiny and has lots of adherents and detractors.   I recently had the pleasure of attending a presentation by Dr. Gary LaVigna of  IABA  on the topic of ABA.  Let me continue the philospohical dichotomy I have settled on in this post by saying that Dr. LaVigna said many things that I felt strongly positive about, but the overall thrust of his presentation left me with an uneasy feeling that was not easy to quantify.  First I'll relate the good stuff: Let me begin by saying that  Dr. LaVigna  is not primarily focused on 'early intervention' ABA.  His agency, IABA, according to the content of his presentations, has a focus on autistic young adults and adults who are experiencing very serious problems in any number of areas.  These include long-term aggressive/violent behaviors and very challenging self-injurious behaviors.  Some of Dr. LaVigna's clients are the types that some people, such as Harold Doherty, would claim have no future outside of an institution.  An excerpt from their website says : \"It is the philosophy of [IABA] that a person with a   developmental disability is entitled to live his or her life with the   full dignity of a developing human being, as a self-reliant and   productive member of society.\" This leads me to the \"good\" side of ABA.  I am familiar with many of the ethical and academic critiques of the ABA method, and I agree at least in part with many, if not all, of them. But there is an aspect of ABA which, in my view, is not directly in the line of fire of that criticism.  I am referring to the following (loosely paraphrased) 5 goals of Dr. LaVigna's approach to behavioral supports for autistic individuals: Community presence and participation that are appropriate and valued by society. Autonomy and self-determination through the exercise of increasingly informed choice. Continuous involvement in the ongoing process of becoming independent. Increasing independence and productivity, to the point of economic self-sufficiency. The opportunity to develop a full range of social relationships and friendships. (Note:  These 5 items are excerpted from an otherwise-established set of ABA goals/principles which Dr. LaVigna mentioned, but I failed to write down.  I am hoping someone with a more encyclopedic knowledge {Alyric?  Michelle?  Jypsy? Amanda?} of the concept may comment and advise me of a more direct source of this information.) Now, it is important to grasp that this goal set is certainly not exclusive to ABA as an approach.  This set of 5 goals, however, could be applied to virtually any technique and would remain admirable regardless, in my opinion. This set of goals seems to me to be a good beacon of orientation for working towards the happiness and well-being of autistic adults.  Notice the lack of emphasis on \"reducing/eliminating autistic behaviors\" or causing the client to strive to \"become indistinguishable from his/her peers\" and using that as a measure of success.  None of those concepts are discussed or referred to .  Instead, a sense of community, a sense of responsibility, the building of meaningful relationships, and true self-determination are discussed.  I think that is highly appropriate.  And, again, if you refer to my last  post  on ABA, I believe that a well-intentioned person or group of people who have appropriate goals in mind and value the autistic person they spend time with can have a positive impact in numerous ways that may not be measurable in terms that translate well to research studies (the reverse, unfortunately, is sadly also true). Here is the other thing about Dr. LaVigna's approach that I found to be good.  And you'll have to forgive me for giving the Cliff Notes version, as I spent more time listening than taking notes and therefore can't easily reconstruct precisely what he was saying.  But this has to do with, again, self-determination.  I think self-determination is a big issue in ABA.  My son is only 6 years old, and therefore of course will not be granted nearly as much freedom of choice as one would grant an adult.  This is true for virtually any teaching approach for any population.  But I do recognize that as a person grows and develops, more opportunities must be afforded that person to self-determine.  The squelching of this basic human right is a travesty and occurs far too frequently amongst autistic people (particularly in institutional settings).  There are those (again, like Harold Doherty) who believe that institutions are very appropriate for many people, for those who are simply 'beyond help'.  I disagree, and therefore applaud Dr. LaVigna's focus on this issue.  Briefly, Dr. LaVigna 'indexes' his clients' activities on a matrix.  The matrix is categorized into at-home and community settings, with further divisions to specify functional (such as errands) vs. social situations.  As a measurement of success (in other words, 'success' cannot be achieved without...), the client must gradually increase his/her involvement in choosing/avoiding/specifying activities (I don't like that word, but have no other to use in its place) to the point where they are at 100% self-determination. And, really, this approach is one embodiment of ABA.  Dr. LaVigna tries to understand what the individual's obstacles to success are (functional behavioral analysis) and then tries to implement (Apply) a plan to achieve the goal of helping the person overcome those obstacles. I may seem to someone reading this post to be a huge fan of Dr. LaVigna.  That's not necessarily the case at all.  I am extracting some of the things he talked about and using them as a theoretical model for how, in my opinion, ABA can be used as a method to positively impact the lives of autistic people.  Some things he described really resonated with me as being appropriate and logical and of great potential benefit. But my comfort level with anyone's application of ABA techniques or principles will always be tempered by some of the serious, valid problems with the approach.  Problems such as; Are the goals always met and, if not, what then?  Is the functional behavioral analysis likely to be correct?  Is 'non-aversive' really not?  Will Discrete Trial Teaching create robotic little autistic people?  Is the whole thing a colossal waste of time?  What do research results tell us?  These are some of the potential negatives, and deserve as much attention as the aspects that I perceive as being good. In my next post on ABA, I will get into some of those issues. I'd also like to recommend some further reading for those who are interested. First, a recent ( as in yesterday) and excellent  commentary  from Sharon on ABA in Ireland. For an in-depth look at ethics and ABA, please read Michelle Dawson's  The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists.

{"date": "Saturday, February 23, 2008", "body": "\nLittle League started today. This simple statement could be taken as a token description of this morning's activities.  Or, alternatively, it could be viewed in the much broader sense of marking a milestone in my sons' development. That's right, Little League started today  ....  for both of my older sons. You see, a few years ago the thought that my son could participate in an activity like this seemed pretty far-fetched.  Jason had been diagnosed with \"classic autism\", and I quickly divested myself of the idea that his childhood development was going to follow predictable, typical paths.  Well, to make a long story short, Jason has exceeded many of the expectations that were placed on him in the short years immediately following his diagnosis, and at age 6 is now playing tee ball. So here's how it all came about. First, my Dad (my parents live very near to us for most of the year and are very good at keeping a finger on the pulse of the community and letting us know what opportunities are out there for the kids) caught wind that Little League sign-ups were coming soon and passed the info on to me. I was hopeful but realistic about Jason's chances to play out the season on a team of his peers, but was heartened by the idea that Tyler (14 months younger) could be on the same team.  Jason and Tyler resonate well together, despite their differences.  My folks refer to their constant bickering as resembling two little old men who love each other dearly but get underneath each other's skin, which is a pretty good analogy.  Think Odd Couple.  Or Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. So when I went to sign up last month, I just decided to talk honestly with the head organizer about Jason and his opportunity to participate.  He initially recommended the Challenger League, which is specifically for players with disabilities, but I was enthusiastic that, especially with his brother on the same team, Jason would be up to the task.  We reached an agreement to at least give it a try, and signed up.  Now, Jason is a member of the Rattlers.  Though the Teal and White uniforms may not strike fear into the hearts of opponents, the kids sure are proud to wear them.  The coach is a friend of ours who has known Jason for a few years and really understands and relates well to him.  The coach's son is a friend of Jason's.  My father, a former Little League coach himself, is an assistant coach, as am I.  My wife is sharing duties as \"Team Mom\".  My Mom will be official cheerleader and photographer.  Tyler will be Jason's on-field supporter and taskmaster (until he gets distracted by a passing bumblebee).  In all, I think we have a network of support that ensures the highest likelihood of success. And, you know what?  If it doesn't work out, that's OK.  Furthermore, if Jason decides after some time of playing that baseball is not for him, that's OK, too.  I'm certainly not one of those rabid sports parents who lives vicariously through my kids' athletic (or other categories of) prowess.  Dammit, I just want Jason to get a crack at this, at having the opportunity to bond with his teammates and experience the feeling of winning or losing a game in which he gave it his all.  The Rattlers! We may swing the bat at the wrong object from time to time. We may be more likely to catch a cold than the ball. We may not throw very straight.  Or far. Or in the right direction. But we've got heart! And we're here to play ball! Go Rattlers!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/02/beware-rattlers.html", "title": "\nBeware the Rattlers...\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 18, 2008", "body": "\nThis blog is titled \"One Dad's Opinion\", and my posts are full of all kinds of opinions on any number of topics. It is nice to live in a society where I am free to offer my opinions and to discuss them openly with those who agree and disagree with me. Sometimes, though, opinions can easily be confused with facts. This is an area of potential problems for almost any topic, but can become particularly dangerous when discussing public health issues. Take the autism/vaccine connection. This is an area where there are numerous known facts along with lots and lots of opinion. Regrettably, this is also an area where, in some areas of the popular media as well as the internet, opinions have come to be viewed by some as facts. This is a trend that is potentially dangerous to the public health and, as such, the Autism Hub members have joined together today to help counteract that trend. Here are some facts: There exists no scientific evidence showing that the administration of childhood vaccines cause autism. There exist in excess of 20 studies that show there is no link between childhood vaccines and autism. Today, there is an outbreak of measles - a highly communicable, vaccine-preventable disease that kills up to 3 of every 1,000 children who contract it in developed countries - in my area of the country. So far, 11 children have been diagnosed. All 11 children have NOT received the measles vaccination. For some, it is becuase they have not yet reached one year of age. For the rest, it is because their parents chose not to have their children vaccinated, possibly due to their fears about the vaccine/autism connection.  Source. Regardless of your view on the vaccine/autism connection constantly discussed in the media, please carefully consider these three facts as you read the following letter from Susan Stevens Martin of the American Academy of  Ped  Pediatrics. If, after reading the letter, you feel that you are a candidate to be a media contact on this issue, please leave your contact info in my comments section for this post or email me directly. Thank you for taking the time to consider helping with this very important public health issue. The AAP letter follows: Hello, As part of our ongoing response to media stories regarding autism and vaccines, the AAP communications department is compiling a list of parents who support the AAP and are available for interviews. We are looking for two types of parents who could serve as spokespersons: Parents of children with autism spectrum disorders who support immunization and who do not believe there is any link between their child's vaccines and his or her autism. Parents of children who suffered a vaccine-preventable illness. This could be a parent who declined immunization, whose child became ill before a vaccine was available, or whose child was ineligible for immunization. We are asking for your help identifying parents who would be good spokespersons. They do not need to be expert public speakers. They just need to be open with their story and interested in speaking out on the issue. We will contact candidates in advance to conduct pre-interviews, to offer guidance on talking to reporters and to obtain a signed waiver giving us permission to release their name. If a parent were placed on our list, we would offer their name and contact information to select media. We hope to build a list of parents from a wide range of geographical areas. As the Jenny McCarthy and \"Eli Stone\" stories illustrate, this issue is likely to recur in the national and local media. The AAP is committed to doing all we can to counter such erroneous reports with factual information supported by scientific evidence and AAP recommendations. The anti-vaccine groups often have emotional family stories on their side. The ability to offer a reporter an interview with a similarly compelling parent who is sympathetic to the AAP's goals is a powerful tool for our media relations program. Please contact me if you have any questions or to suggest a parent to interview.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 4, 2008", "body": "\nHave you ever heard of  Wikio ? I received an email from a very friendly person named Sarah at Wikio today.   In part, it read: \"Wikio, an aggregator of online news and blogs, has recently kicked off our own blog ranking. Mashable has already positively acclaimed our new service ( http://mashable.com/2007/12/11/wikio/ ) and blogs like The New York Times\u2019 Freakonomics are rapidly adding badges featuring their Wikio ranking ( http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/ ).        Our Top Blogs ranking features a bunch of different categories; for instance, the \"Health\" category where your blog \"One Dad's Opinion\" stands at number 77.\" Taken in and of itself, that's pretty cool.  My little corner of the internet ranks somewhere, on something!  Who'da thunk it?  12 months ago, I thought \"HTML\" was German for \"internet\", and here I am now showing up in someone's rankings! But that's not the half of it.  You see, I have many reasons for writing this blog.  Among them are the sense of community and 'connectedness', the (predominantly) positive interaction I have with members of the autism community, the daily feedback on important issues affecting autistic people and those who care for and about them, the outlet for emotional and intellectual energy, and the ongoing effort to create a \"Captain's Log\" that my family can look back on in the future and remember what a challenging, yet rewarding, time it was when my sons were 'wee beasties'. But also among my reasons, perhaps foremost of all, is that I am confident that through the combined efforts of the amazing people who have voluntarily agreed to contribute to the Autism Hub, and who have sunk their heart and soul into those efforts (it is an effort!) over the past several months to years, that we communally have made and will continue to make a positive difference in the lives of autistic people (it goes without saying to anyone familiar with the Hub that a solid majority of our contributing members are autistic adults).

I recently was joined by  Bev  and Dad of Cameron for a multimedia  presentation  on the Autism Hub at the University of San Diego Autism Institute's Winter Conference.  The gist of our presentation was threefold:  That the Hub provides an entirely new context/medium for autistic self-advocacy (Bev), that the Hub provides a comprehensive and ongoing review of the current scientific issues relating to autism (Dad of Cameron), and that the Hub provides a powerful resource and point of reference for  parents  who are interested in focusing on their children's autistic strengths as well as learning to help them with their challenges (me).

{"date": "Saturday, March 8, 2008", "body": "\nOverall, it was a good day.  I got up early and went to work for a few hours.  Got a lot done since it was relatively quiet on the distribution end of things.  I was home by noon, just in time to see Grandma and Poppa whisk J and T off to have an \"adventure day\" (adventure day occurs most weekends when G&P are in town - about half the year.  It consists of, well, surprise adventures.)  Today's adventure, as it turns out, was a puppet show down in Balboa Park, followed by some playground time, followed by Church.  Then off to get some Mexican Food. In the meantime, my wife took baby C to run some errands and left me to attack the garage.  After 5 and a half hours of rearranging shelving and hanging pegboard, thinning out the garage-related inventory, narrowly escaping a Black Widow spider (thanks to my cat-like reflexes I am alive to write this blog post), and marvelling at how much Diazanon (sorry,  Andrea ) we have accumulated over 8 years of marriage, I was famished. So I headed up to meet G&P and the Boys (that sounds eerily like a bluegrass band name) and get some food.  After a nice dinner in which J and T both spilled their pink lemonade, it was time to drive home.  This is where things became interesting. As I pulled on the freeway, I heard sniffling coming from behind me.  Now, J is typically very emotionally stoic on the surface.  As can be the case with many people with autism, he doesn't wear his emotions right there on his shirt sleeve all the time like some other people.  But when he decides he is sad about something then, well, he gets  really  sad.  I look in the rear view mirror and see the first crocodile tear flow down his cherubic cheek.  I ask why he's crying. \"I'm sad.\" \"But why are you sad, Jason?\" \"I'll miss you when you're dead.\" (A brief pause by me as I apply One Dad's Opinion to the situation.  I quickly determine that this is a teachable moment, a rare and elusive burst of existential lucidity coming from a 6 year old whose sponge-like mind will absorb my wise words and reference this moment for many years to come.  So, I reply with...) \"But I'm not dead yet.  I'm right here, driving the car.\" As I have my Homer Simpson d'Oh! moment wherein I realize my mouth is substantially more active than my brain at this moment, I hear sniffles and a clipped cry coming from the other back seat.  Now T is in on it!  \"Daaaaady.  I'll m-m-miiisss you when you're...hnf ...hnf ...hnf .... dead!\" (\"Hnf\" is that sound little kids make when they cry and they have those involuntary hiccup-like breaths between sobs).  Clearly this situation is needing some better action than my first response.  So, I say \"Look, there's no need to cry or be sad.  How old am I right now?\" T:  \"36\" (this kid is unbelievably detail-oriented) \"Right, and I don't plan on dying until I'm at least 76, or maybe 80, or maybe even older!\" This seemed to cause a brief cessation of sobbing in the backseat.  I saw my opening, and I went for it. \"Who wants to listen to pirate music!?!?\" (together):\"ME!!!\" \"Then say, 'Arrr, Matey, I want some pirate music!'\" (together):\"Arrr, Matey, I want some pirate music!\" I cued up Flogging Molly and turned it up a bit.  Now, I love Irish music.  One would think I am genetically inclined I take to it so much, even though I am 0% Irish (though I do proudly associate with the  winner  of the Irish Blog Awards last week!).  For anyone who has not heard of or listened to Flogging Molly, please disregard the horrid name and give it a listen.  I could best describe it as an eclectic blend of classic Irish music mixed with  punk rock, and a little dash of other genres mixed in for good measure.  Each band member plays numerous instruments, and the overall effect is just awesome.  Oh, and some songs sound like pirate music. Tomorrow or the next day I'll sit down individually with J and T and talk over how they were feeling and why they thought I might die.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 11, 2008", "body": "\nIt is with great interest that I have been following the events relating to HHS conceding the claim brought before the VICP by the parents of 9-year-old Hannah Poling. I am a strong proponent of adhering to truth and utilizing appropriate lines of logic and reasoning to arrive at my understanding of the truth.  I have stated publicly and openly for quite some time that scientific data do not support the theory that vaccines nor the vaccine preservative Thimerosal cause autism.  I still adhere to that statement.  I also have supported the position that one must change one's position as new evidence comes to light.  What has occurred with the Poling case (I hate to refer to it as a \"case\".  Hannah Poling is a 9-year old girl who is a loved, valued person and deserves individual respect as a whole person without regard to what caused her condition, how that condition has manifested itself,  or how that cause has been contested in any venue.  But her suit against HHS does, in fact, constitute a \"case\") is that a legal hurdle has been presented and overcome.  The VICP did, in fact, deem that the Polings had enough evidence to warrant their claim that Hannah suffered physical harm from her vaccinations at around 18 months. I do not think that Hannah Poling flips a true/false switch on the statement that \"vaccines cause autism\", but I am now more likely to consider the merits of data that is presented that includes the role of mitochondrial dysfunction as an explanatory factor in the onset of autism, and furthermore that mitochondrial dysfunction could correlate to vaccinations.  In other words, I am willing and able to consider new information and adapt my understanding of the scientific body of evidence as a result.   This is not a direct result of the concession, but instead is a result of the focus that the concession has brought on this emerging area of research and my initial reaction to the quality of the data. Having said all that, and with apologies since my time to complete this post is short, I have some interesting questions/issues with regard to this issue in general and with regard to Dr. Poling's  post to AoA  today specifically: -  I find it fascinating that a  paper  that was co-authored by Dr. Poling was actually used as a supporting document in the case.  Is this not a conflict of interest?  Is it possible to factor in the existence of a potential large settlement/award from VICP as a COI for Dr. Poling while at the same time not including the other authors in any implication of bias? -  If you read the post by Dr. Poling on AoA, you will see that he clearly avoids making a statement regarding thimerosal/autism causation that he could be questioned on.  In other words, he offered an implication while avoiding a \"mine-able\" quote.  Observe: 5.  Thimerosal\u2014On or Off the Table?I don\u2019t want to dwell on mercury, as this theory is not why HHS conceded Hannah\u2019s case (imo).... My opinion is that mercury is a potent neurotoxin. Therefore, don\u2019t inject it into kids!  Interestingly, basic research studies have shown that Thimerosal toxicity occurs through mitochondrial pathways.  Is this statement a way to avoid making his stance debatable while at the same time influencing the reader to deduce that he does consider thimerosal a causative agent?  Or is he simply adhering to the language of science which precludes him from making an overly strong statement in the absence of compelling evidence?  - Dr. Poling, at the end of the post, discloses numerous COI's.  None of these concern me or have any effect on my opinion of his acumen as a neurologist or researcher.  Can people like JB Handley say the same thing?  Can all the members of EOHarm list and organizations like TACA, parents such as Jenny McCarthy and Lenny Schafer, author/journalists such as David Kirby, in general people who have backed their claims of government conspiracy over and over and over for years simply wave their hand and ignore the declared COI's simply because Dr. Poling's VICP-related efforts support their position instead of contesting it?  Anyone who has observed the debate over the years will acknowledge that a primary Talking Point of the supporters of the mercury/autism theory is that a government coverup is involved.  Just two or three days ago Jenny McCarthy put out a call to parents to blitz the White House with calls for Julie Gerberding's (of the CDC) resignation.  But what, then does that same group make of these statements from Dr. Poling and the editor of AoA?: -\"He also would like to declare his conflicts of interest.  First of all, he is the father of Hannah Poling.  Dr. Poling has also accepted consultancy or speakers honoraria from Pfizer, Eisai, Ortho-McNeil, Biogen, Teva, Immunex (now Amgen), and Allergan.)\" -\"Dr. Shoffner furthermore advocates, along with us, that vaccination is important even for kids with mitochondrial dysfunction. \"  -  I thought for a while that I was the only parent following this discussion who was thinking to myself, \"This is all very valuable in terms of adding to the scientific body of knowledge, but is anybody thinking about/talking about autism in the blogosphere aside from this topic?\"  Until I saw my thoughts echoed by  Kristina .  And then I looked at the  Autism Hub  in general.  What I saw was a huge range of people and opinions covering all kinds of topics including, but not limited to, discussion of the Poling case.  Let it be known that I sincerely hope Hannah Poling is an Autism Hub contributor someday.  She would fit right in over here.  Not so much at AoA, where autistic people dare not tread.  I wish Dr. Poling would have considered that issue when deciding where to post his response to Dr. Novella today.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/03/dr-jon-poling-o.html#more", "http://jcn.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/2/170", "http://www.autismvox.com/vaccine-fixation-but-wheres-the-education/", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/03/processing-new-information.html", "title": "\nProcessing New Information\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 7, 2008", "body": "\nThe purpose of this post is to lay out as clearly as I can my understanding of the  Vaccine Injury  case that was announced today in the  national media . I, like many of you, run the risk of misunderstanding the significance of this event due to my lack of knowledge about several of its key components. So I am going to try to summarize, with every effort to avoid bias or opinion, my understanding of the case of this 9-year old girl and what the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (Vaccine Court) has found. If you would like to gain a much better understanding of how the Vaccine Court works, take the time to read this  excellent summary . The Background The case is about 9-year old Hannah Poling who, according to her parents and their attorneys, developed autism at around 18 months of age (in July 2000) after she received routine childhood vaccinations. At the time she was vaccinated, she was experiencing a high fever. Additionally, she had been ill (with ear infections and fever) on and off for almost a full year leading into that doctor's visit, and several times vaccinations had been delayed as a result. Soon after (within 48-96 hours) receiving her vaccinations, her health began to deterioriate. Not only was she ailing physically, but she also began to present \"features of autism\". It was later determined that she suffers from mitochondrial dysfunction. The Concession The government, or more specifically HHS (Department of Health and human Services) has agreed to compensate Hannah Poling for injuries she received from vaccines. They are stating that the vaccines she received significantly aggravated a rare, underlying mitochondrial disorder and that this resulted in regressive  encephalopathy  including \"features of autism\"  (FYI - I keep putting quotes around that phrase since most reports are also doing so. Apparently Hannah was not presented in court as being autistic, but instead was presented as exhibiting features of autism. More on that later...) Here is a  link  to the Huffington Post page on which the Concession Document has been posted, in case you would like to read it for yourself. Mitochondrial Dysfunction Mitochondria  are organelles that exist in most of the cells in our bodies. They serve several functions, the most important being the creation of  ATP  - a chemical source of cell energy. Oxidative stress can interfere with the proper functioning of mitochondria's role in this process, and also explains in part why mitochondrial functioning diminishes with age. Mitochondrial Dysfunction can result from Mitochondrial Disease (which is genetic, passed almost exclusively through the maternal DNA, and is associated with Parkinson's disease and ataxia, among other diseases) or other mitochondrial dysfunction (which can have variable causes including genetic and environmental and has been associated with numerous neurological disorders such as Bipolar disorder, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease, among others). Hannah Poling apparently has a mitochondrial disease that her mother also has. This disease was unknown at the time of her vaccinations. Currently, vaccinations are recommended for most sufferers of Mito. If you would like to read a very interesting take on autism and mito from someone who is intimately familiar with both, please read this  blog entry by SL . The Autism Link Hannah was presented to the court as exhibiting \"features of autism\". At least 10 specific features were mentioned in the case documentation, only 3 of which relate directly to  DSM-IV diagnostic criteria . More on that (subjective analysis)  here . Hannah was originally included in the Autism Omnibus case, but was subsequently removed from that group of litigants. I am unsure as to why this is, but have read in several spots that her underlying Mito would prevent her from being classified alongside the 4800+ cases that make up the Omnibus proceedings. EDIT 3/7:  Please read the comments section, where Dad of Cameron has provided a good overview, with links, of some of the possible factors relating to the decision to exclude Hannah Poling from the Autism Omnibus proceedings.  Of particular interest to me was an excerpt from the  Journal of Child Neurology / Volume 21, Number 2 , in which Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, who performed a case study on Hannah Poling, said: It is unclear whether mitochondrial dysfunction results from a primary genetic abnormality, atypical development of essential metabolic pathways, or secondary inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by other factors. If such dysfunction is present at the time of infections and immunizations in young children, the added oxidative stresses from immune activation on cellular energy metabolism are likely to be especially critical for the central nervous system, which is highly dependent on mitochondrial function. Young children who have dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism therefore might be more prone to undergo autistic regression between 18 and 30 months of age if they also have infections or immunizations at the same time. Summary Clearly there are issues here that deserve and will certainly garner additional discussion and, yes, research. I have many questions stemming from this information as well as several early thoughts/opinions, but I will save those for another post. For now, I simply wanted to provide a summary of events so that interested people can have a well-rounded understanding of the case of this little girl from Georgia. I am not a scientist and have no special knowledge in any of these areas. Many of my readers, however, are.

{"date": "Sunday, April 6, 2008", "body": "\nSometimes we need a break.   But there is simply too much to write about, think about, and act on these days in the autism community.  But first, I need a one-night break. This post will, therefore, be a break from  suspicious subpeonas , from  mercury moms , from  jabbering Jennies , from suspect science, from  suggested segregation .  It will not discuss important autistic issues such as residency options, community acceptance, communication assistance, or health insurance coverage.  It will avoid causation controversies, blathering bloggers, and annoying antagonists.  You will notice the almost complete absence of parental perception, friendly factoids, and buddy bias.  In fact, you will be acutely aware of the almost all-inclusive absence of any and all autism assignations, both abstract and actual. All these things will be put on hold. And instead, I'll just tell you about a birthday party. No, seriously.  I took J and T to the most interesting birthday party today.  I carefully chose the word interesting, largely because many other adjectives simply do not apply in this case. A few weeks ago, the invitation came in the mail.  Pretty standard stuff for a 4-year old boy's birthday - an imposing Transformer commanding you to attend a party.  We RSVP'd, and the family lottery determined that I go to this party with J and T, while my wife spent quality 1 on 1 time with baby C.  (Family lotteries are great in that, hey, nobody can lose!  Either spend a lively day with 'the boys' or a quiet day with 'the baby'.  Automatic win-win.) Noon rolled around today and we left for the party.  As we approached the area, I realized that we were entering interesting territory.  Very expensive homes set on several acres each make up this neighborhood, which is absolutely beautiful.  We found the house we were looking for and went in. It was a lovely home.  Furniture was oversized, almost Baroque but lacking its ornate pretense, with big cushions and large pedestal-like footings.  The flooring was dark hardwood, the interior rooms were separated by brick walls.  The peaked ceilings featured dark wood beams and casing.  It was austere and yet inviting, very nicely done.  How very old-world, I thought to myself.  And then I met the parents of the birthday boy who were Italian.  Not Italian-American,  but Italian born and raised.  It turns out they are restaurateurs and own a couple of really good eateries in our area.   Which leads me to the most interesting part of the party - the food. Now keep in mind, as I list the 'finger food' portion of the offerings, that this is a birthday party for a young boy turning four.   Also note that I will create contrast by listing the Common birthday party fare alongside the Actual party fare offered today. Common                                                         / Actual Tortilla Chips and Salsa                         / Pita Toasts and Ceviche Cheese and Crackers                                / A full wheel   of Parmagianno-Reggiano with cracked pepper                                                                     wafers Potato Chips                                         / Deep-fried potato puffs with chorizo and chile stuffing Ice Water                                             / Vitamin Water, chilled, over ice Pigs in a Blanket                                 / Tart Cherry and Ground beef in Phyllo pastries M&M's /                                                  Cinnamon and Stewed Apple Empanadas Hot Dogs /                                                Hot Dogs Get the picture?  Or, keeping in the vernacular,  capeesh ? While not uncommon for an adult beverage such as a can of light beer to be offered to the parents who stay through these kids' parties, it is decidedly uncommon to  be able to choose between a very nice Malbec from Argentina or an ice cold Stella Artois on tap. (Note to self:  Next year, at this kid's party, bring wife to be designated driver). So they had an inflatable bounce-house and a swingset which kept the kids entertained.  Then there was a fabulous puppet show - superbly done and replete with original music, konfetti cannons, smoke effects, and great kid humor.  Very impressive stuff. The cake.  This was a marvel, something one might see on  Ace of Cakes .  This particular opus was an eclectic mix of Spiderman, Transformers, and Cars (the Movie).  It was done in two layers.  The top layer was chocolate with strawberry striations.  The way they served it was to pool some creamy strawberry sauce on a plate, lay the cake slice on it, then smother it with more strawberry cream.  While the kids were enjoying that, they served the adults the bottom layer.  This was vanilla with vanilla cream striations, covered in stewed strawberry halves.  This would have been great, except I really had my heart set on a particular Spiderman decoration that ended up going to the lady served right before me.  I had to settle for sucking the frosting off a Lightning McQueen figurine.  Damn! All in all, a good time was had by all.  I am  really  looking forward to next year! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/150/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/18/", "http://gmwm.autistics.org/?p=191", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/community/forums/showthread.php?t=5961", "http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_db"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/04/brief-break-and-birthday-party.html", "title": "\nA Brief Break, and a Birthday Party\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 17, 2008", "body": "\nI'd like to make you aware of a situation with a boy named Nate Tseglin.  Nate is a 17-year-old boy who lives not far from me.  I do not know Nate or his family, but have been made aware of his story by other, mutual friends. In a nutshell, Nate was forced into residential treatment by San Diego Child Protective Services against both his will and the will of his parents.  Please take a moment to read this  post by Kristina  and some very interesting comments.  Included in the comments are this link to  GetNateHome.com , which gives a detailed description of events leading up to Nate's removal and what has occurred since.  Please do read the timeline, which will give you a feel for the level of tragedy that Nate and his family are dealing with.   Here, also, is a brief post from last week by Ginger, and excellent blogger who I disagree with on so many  issues  - but not this one. So my point in bringing up Nate's plight is not to ask for pity for him (though I do, like Ginger and Nate's parents ask for prayers for him), but instead to ask for help.  Is there anyone reading this blog who has any help or service that can be offered to assist the family?  Several things come to mind: Does anyone have the capacity to provide expert testimony on the adverse effects of psychotropic medications, that could be provided  gratis ? Can anyone testify as to the nature and scope of self-injurious behavior, and accepted means of managing that behavior without medication? Is there a lawyer who has expertise in any of these areas relating to this circumstance with Nate? Are there any folks with media contacts who could help to increase public exposure - particularly in the coastal Southern California region?  Added media exposure could potentially identify others who can help as well as increasing public pressure on CPS to resolve this situation in Nate's favor. I am pulling for Nate to have a positive outcome, and I hope that someone out there feels the same way and is equipped to help to a greater degree than I.  If so, please email me directly and I will connect you with the family, or direct you to someone else who can. Now, on to another boy.  My son, J.  On the off chance that any of the State's agents in this situation happen upon this blog, I'd like to illustrate what can happen when a boy who is on the autism spectrum is provided the opportunity to live and learn and experience in a positive, family-based environment. As for a brief lead-in...  A few days ago, we received an email at home that our sons' Little League website was up and running, and we went to take a look at the schedules and whatnot.  We noticed a tab on the screen for 'Albums', which led us to a series of pictures from Week 1.  We looked over the pictures, most of which were of older kids playing hardball, pitching, sliding, making reaching catches and bullet throws.  But there were a few of the T-ballers including, lo and behold, one of our own boys! (They both are on the same team as discussed  here ).  Never mind that J is clearly running way past Home Plate to the side, and never mind that he is not exactly tearing up the turf like a racehorse - the point is that he is participating in a positive way and having a great time doing it! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/nate-tseglin-removed-from-his-home-and-institutionalized-why/", "http://www.getnatehome.com/", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2008/03/pray-for-nate-tseglin-today.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/R989tbaxEKI/AAAAAAAAAG8/tI-3mGELg7o/s1600-h/47b8dd29b3127cce98548bc78d7d00000027102AcsnDZs4aMn.jpg"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/03/one-runs-home.html", "title": "\nOne Runs Home...\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 4, 2008", "body": "\nAs the father of an autistic child, I often worry about my son becoming the victim of a bully.   Today, I became aware of a situation that reminded me that bullying is not exclusive to the halls of your local elementary school or the public park. A  Bully  can be defined as \"a blustering, quarrelsome, overbearing person who habitually  badgers and intimidates  smaller or weaker people . \" Apparently, Clifford Shoemaker and his clients, Reverend and Mr. Sykes, failed to consider the last portion of this definition prior to issuing their  subpeona  to  Kathleen Seidel . You see, Kathleen does not strike me as being someone who is weaker than anyone else, or as being someone who is likely to take bullying and intimidation lying down. Please review, therefore, her  post at Neurodiversity.com  in which she describes the circumstances of the issuance of the subpeona and follows that with a 17-point Motion to Quash Subpeona that has now been filed.  I have no legal background, but it certainly appears to me that Kathleen has offered a vigorous and compelling set of arguments for the consideration of the  United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire . The patently obvious effort at intimidating a private citizen who has no bearing on the outcome of the  Sykes vs. Bayer  case provides a crystal clear example of the lengths to which anti-vaccine activists and the ruthless trial lawyers who steer them will go.  Considering the fact that my blog among many others was named specifically in  section 5 of the subpeona , I am proud to stand with my fellows in the online community against this baseless harassment and infringement on Kathleen Seidel's personal right to research, analyze, and publish information about ... well ... any damn thing she wants to. Here's to hoping that Mr. Shoemaker and his gold-digging clients get a lot more than they bargained for when they settled on bullying as their stratagem of choice.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 2, 2008", "body": "\nI'd like to post Ari Ne'eman's statement, made today to the Florida Autism Task Force, here on my blog as I consider to be a well conceived and thorough dissertation on many significant points related to autism advocacy today. These comments were delivered today to the Florida Autism Task Force's inaugural meeting by ASAN President Ari Ne'eman. \"Thank you for this opportunity to address the first meeting of the Florida Autism Task Force on today, the first World Autism Day. My name is Ari Ne'eman and I am here today in my capacity as the President of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), a volunteer non-profit organization run by and for adults and youth on the autism spectrum. ASAN works to promote the autistic culture movement and other opportunities for individuals on the autism spectrum to interact with each other as well as work to improve the representation of the autistic community in public policy deliberations about autism and disability affairs. The autism spectrum is broad, diverse and subject to many stereotypes. Just as we work to combat generalizations about racial, religious, national or other minorities, it is only right to avoid a stereotyped view of autism. There are speaking and nonspeaking people on the autism spectrum; people currently capable of living independently and holding competitive employment and those with more significant support needs before those goals are conceivable to them. There are those of us who have held diagnoses since childhood and those of us who were identified later in life, serving to correct an inaccurate previous diagnosis that had placed us in the wrong educational or service-delivery infrastructure. To claim, as some continue to do, that we on the autism spectrum are all incapable of speaking for ourselves is an ignorant and damaging falsehood. Equally harmful is the idea that autistic people are all geniuses or savants, with Rain Man-esque abilities. As someone with an autism spectrum diagnosis myself, I hope to address some of these misconceptions, explain a bit more about our community and inform those assembled here today about the public policy priorities \u2013 and concerns \u2013 of the autistic self-advocacy movement. In doing so, I hope to communicate to you that, contrary to the unfortunate paradigm that has pervaded the media discourse about us, autism is not a tragedy. We are, as with any other minority, a community with unique needs, strengths, challenges and aspirations that are often distinct from the parent or professional voices that speak about us, without us. The true tragedy is the persistent discrimination, abuse and lack of access that continues to govern society's approach to us. On this, the first ever World Autism Day, we assert that it is this prejudice \u2013 not autism itself \u2013 that we have a true interest in combating, in the interest of ensuring for every person the rights of communication, inclusion, self-determination and respect. I was diagnosed on the autism spectrum, specifically Asperger's Syndrome, at age 12. Growing up, I spent time in both inclusive and segregated educational placements. My own negative experiences with segregated educational environments led me to become an advocate for my own educational inclusion and later for the inclusion of other students with disabilities. These experiences motivated me to found the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, an international grassroots advocacy organization of adults and youth on the autism spectrum. ASAN's work has involved me in a number of areas of public policymaking that are important to people on the autism spectrum, some of which I will outline here. In determining how best to develop a system that provides for the educational, service-delivery and other needs for individuals on the autism spectrum, it is imperative that self-advocates be recognized as the central stakeholder in this discussion. I'm happy to see Florida creating an Autism Task Force to identify what needs to be done in the areas of education, services, supports and research, however I am saddened that the task force did not provide for representation from people on the autism spectrum ourselves. During my time in Florida, I will be working to create a chapter of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. I encourage the members of the Task Force to communicate with us in their deliberations. Future policymaking bodies relating to the autism spectrum and disability issues more generally must include self-advocates. We know our own needs best and no policymaking process can be legitimate without including those who it purports to serve. Nothing About Us, Without Us! One of the key areas of unmet need for the autistic community \u2013 the community of those of us actually on the autism spectrum, as opposed to the parents and professionals who make up the frequently discussed autism community \u2013 is in the area of diagnosis. As many of you familiar with the autism field are aware, we have been seeing a steady increase in the reported incidence of the autism spectrum, with the most recent update pointing to an incidence of 1 in 150 from a previous 1 in 166. The reason for this increase in reported incidence is not an \"autism epidemic\" or any other causation theory that seeks to promote the false idea of autism as a contagion or a force that \"steals\" an otherwise normal child. This disease-oriented model is not supported by either science or our own experiences. What we are seeing is an increase in awareness of the autism spectrum, resulting in more accurate diagnosis identifying individuals who previously were placed within the mental retardation, mental illness, learning disability or other educational and service-delivery infrastructure. This is a situation that I myself experienced, having been diagnosed on the autism spectrum after having an inaccurate ADD diagnosis for years prior. It is also something that is experienced by many other adults and youth on the autism spectrum in a far more damaging fashion, as a result of the frequent institutionalization and presumption of cognitive inability that far too many autistics continue to suffer from today. The rapid increase in autism spectrum diagnoses has accompanied repeated broadening of the diagnostic criteria for the autism spectrum, incorporating more information about the diverse manifestations of our neurological type. In addition, the past few decades have resulted in a decrease in the stigmatization of parents of autistic children, as a result of the medical community moving away from the odious and damaging inaccuracy that autism is the result of \"refrigerator mothers\". This, combined with increased services and supports available for the autism spectrum, has resulted in more autism spectrum diagnoses. These increasing numbers, however, fail to take into account the substantial number of individuals on the autism spectrum who, as a result of a lack of health care access and/or professionals trained in the diagnosis of adults as well as problems with inaccurate diagnostic criteria, are unable to find the resources to acquire the diagnosis that would accurately describe their characteristics and enable them to qualify for services. It is necessary that we increase the availability of accurate information relating to the autism spectrum in reference to adults and youth. There remains a shocking lack of awareness for the needs \u2013 and even the very existence \u2013 of autistic adults. In many circles, it is assumed that autism is something relevant only to children and as a result legislation and policymaking has been focused mostly on early childhood. However, there is a large population of adults and adolescents on the spectrum with needs that are not being met. In areas like employment accommodations and other aspects of disability service-delivery, adults on the spectrum are frequently unable to access the supports that are currently available, due to a lack of knowledge of our particular needs. Many of us, as is the case for others with less obvious, \"invisible\" disabilities, face pervasive employment discrimination as a result of communication difficulties. Vocational Rehabilitation agencies in many states are unaware of how to address these issues, due to the fact that while many of us have the skills for competitive employment, difficulties with transportation, the interview process and the social aspects of the workplace can often interfere with holding a job. It is important not only to educate the general public about autism, but also disability service-delivery professionals who are too often unfamiliar with our population. Many adults on the autism spectrum continue to suffer in institutions, despite the Supreme Court decision of Olmstead v. L.C., promising community living options for adults with disabilities. In my work on New Jersey's Olmstead Implementation and Planning Advisory Council and with ASAN chapters across the country, I have seen a consistent lack of knowledge of the unique needs of adults on the spectrum when planning community living options. Many of us have difficulties with certain kinds of sensory environments \u2013 a lack of awareness of these issues on the part of those planning and implementing the transition into the community can result in problems with the de-institutionalization process. These and other aspects of community living show the need for significant representation of self-advocates in the policymaking process, to ensure both the legitimacy of the process and the creation of the most effective possible public policy strategies. Autism training for law enforcement (as well as other emergency personnel) remains a key issue. Many of us possess significant difficulties with communication, particularly in high-stress and anxiety-provoking situations. What happens when a person who cannot speak out loud when under stress is approached by a police officer and asked for personal information? What about when a person fails to understand instructions given to stop or engages in an activity that is interpreted as aggressive? There have been numerous incidents of serious injury and even death as a result of a lack of knowledge on the part of law enforcement personnel about autism and other disabilities. This must be rectified and has been the source of legislation in a variety of states across the country. High-quality training for law enforcement and other emergency personnel does exist and it should be utilized in every locale. For many adolescents on the spectrum and our families preparing to transition out of the school is a process with little guidance or support. When I was preparing to leave high school, my school did not provide sufficient information on the college applications process because it was assumed that as a special education student, my options were limited. While it is certainly the case that not every student on the spectrum \u2013 or every student generally \u2013 will be able to attend university, more of us are having that opportunity. It is necessary to see more of a focus on college transition for students on the autism spectrum in both high schools and universities. One of the areas that is frequently ignored in this process is that of \"soft skills\" related to day to day living. Many of ASAN's parent members frequently are told that issues relating to life skills are not the obligation of school districts, despite the fact that this type of education is just as necessary for students to succeed as the more traditional forms of academics. The communication and executive functioning difficulties that those of us on the spectrum face compound the traditional difficulties that new college students face. In fact, these issues \u2013 as well as the matter of transition more generally \u2013 are relevant for all students on the spectrum, whether or not college is a possibility. For a successful transition to a post-secondary environment of any kind, basic life skills need to be understood. It is essential that steps be taken to incorporate these elements into the school curriculum in an inclusive fashion. In a broader sense, educational needs for students on the spectrum must be given additional focus. There has already been a productive discussion on the issue of early childhood educational methodologies. It is important to keep in mind that any educational intervention should be aimed at the acquisition of skills, not trying to enforce an arbitrary standard of normalcy. Efforts should not be aimed at the undesirable and impossible goal of trying to make autistic individuals non-autistic. Instead, education should be aimed at addressing the significant disabilities many of us face with the goal of improving quality of life. We also have to ensure that are educational methods avoid utilizing abusive and dangerous techniques in the name of treatment. The use of aversive interventions, the application of pain as a means of behavior modification, should be considered unacceptable in any society that aspires to be termed civilized. As a result of aversives and abusive restraint practices, many students and adults in institutions are injured or even killed each year. This must stop. We need a full ban on the use of aversives and non-emergency restraint as well as an end to out-of-state placements that put students in facilities that utilize these barbaric methods. We also have to face up to the persistent problem of bullying and its negative effect on the mental health of all students. Students on the autism spectrum are particularly vulnerable to bullies due to the social literacy issues we tend to have. When I was in school, bullying was one of the reasons I spent a period of time away from my home school. This is a common situation for students on the spectrum and represents a grave obstacle to our legal right of a \"free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment\". I know that the success that I have achieved today would not have been possible had I not returned to an inclusive school setting where I learnt more about how to successfully adapt to the world around me. Yet, as a result of bullying, many students face serious emotional or physical injury if they remain in their home schools. This also must be stopped. Florida remains one of a handful of states without true anti-bullying legislation. I urge the legislators and activists here today to address this problem. Finally, I turn to the more controversial area of research. Here, the autistic self-advocate community holds strong views that may clash with those of some of the interest groups assembled today. The persistent focus on both causation and cure in the autism research agenda has left promising areas of research ignored would could positively impact the quality of life for those of us on the spectrum. Despite extremely encouraging possibilities in the realm of Assistive and Augmentative Communication (AAC) technology for many individuals on the autism spectrum, research in this area is given little to no funding. The development of best practices in service-delivery and education is too often ignored. Mental health needs, restraint reduction, health care access, transition, adult supports and a variety of other educational and service/support needs could all benefit from more research into best practices and effective methodologies. Yet quality of life-oriented research in general is underfunded. If we spent one-tenth of the money and attention we currently lavish on the idea of an autism cure on communication technologies, countless nonspeaking autistic people would be able to communicate today. The fact that we have not pursued promising avenues of research into communication possibilities should be a source of great concern to us as a society. There are also concerns that we have about the type of research that is being funded. The autism spectrum represents a natural and legitimate part of human genetic diversity. As a result, efforts to identify genes associated with autism with the goal of developing a prenatal test, enabling the possibility of selective abortion, should be met with opposition from all those concerned about the issue of disability rights. Given the fact that 90% of fetuses that test positive for Down Syndrome are aborted and there exists a similar social stigma against the autism spectrum, I urge both private foundations and government research institutions to re-orient their funding away from research with eugenic applications. While we have no position about the broad issue of abortion, the issue of eugenics is of great concern to us. Thank you for your time. If we as a society seek to fulfill the values we espouse, we must take practical steps to establish ourselves as a culture that respects neurological diversity in the same way that history has shown us to respect racial, religious, national and other forms of diversity. We on the autism spectrum can make significant contributions to the world around us and, with the right supports, services and education, we can and should be active and participating members of society. By pursuing the goals of inclusion, respect and access, we can make that a reality. I'd like to end with a quote from Jim Sinclair, the founder of Autism Network International (ANI), the first autistic self-advocate organization and a group from which much of the growing autistic culture developed from. \"\"The tragedy is not that we're here, but that your world has no place for us to be.\" Today, on the first World Autism Day, I encourage all of us to think about what we can do to change that unfortunate reality and pursue a policy of autism acceptance, now and into the future.\" While I agree strongly with the majority of Mr. Ne'eman's and ASAN's positions, there are a few elements of this statement that leave me wanting to discuss the positions in more detail.  Specifically, though I share his concerns about genetic research and its implications for eugenics, I also see the potential for genetic research to result in significant quality of life improvements for autistic people.  I am not knowledgeable enough about this topic to postulate how best to reconcile these issues.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/04/world-autism-day-statement-by-ari.html", "title": "\nWorld Autism Day Statement by Ari Ne'eman\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 8, 2008", "body": "\nI am of the opinion that an ongoing increase in the real prevalence of autism is not a foregone conclusion.  I sometimes chafe at watching the general mass media, which seems to operate with the baseline assumption that the easily-demonstrated and indisputable increase in the administrative prevalence (i.e. reported numbers) of autism automatically signifies that more autistic people exist now than existed previously.  I feel that the jury is still out on whether a real increase has occurred. Anyone who has spent any time looking at this issue will have a pretty good idea of some of the reasons to believe that the current upward trend in administrative prevalence does not actually mean that more autistics are being born (or \"damaged\" into autism) nowadays.  Among them are several changes in the diagnostic criteria, the adoption of the Spectrum Disorder assignation which includes PDD and Asperger's Syndrome, changes in reporting requirements at various service providers, an increased awareness among diagnosticians and a possible improvement in diagnostic tools, and a reduction in the social and educational stigma associated with Autism.  Another chief reason is diagnostic substitution. Diagnostic substitution describes an occurence in which a person either receives a change in diagnosis or is diagnosed with, in this case, autism instead of a different diagnosis that may have been appropriate under previous diagnostic criteria.  It has been demonstrated numerous times that in CDDS data, the increase in administrative prevalence for autism very closely mirrors the simultaneous decrease in administrative prevalence for Mental Retardation.  It has also been closely examined that  Childhood Schizophrenia is a diagnosis that has, for many children, been replaced by an autism diagnosis as the diagnostic criteria for autism changed and developed over the years. Setting aside speculation, it is nice to see some science being done on this question.  Establishing accurate and consistent real prevalence figures and trends would be tremendously beneficial in understanding many aspects of autism, including clues to causation as well as planning for the future needs of autistic people in a whole-society sense. Today I saw the abstract for  this study  that has been published in  Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology .   An excerpt form the abstract states: \"Rates of diagnosis of autism have risen since 1980, raising the question of whether some children who previously had other diagnoses are now being diagnosed with autism. We applied contemporary diagnostic criteria for autism to adults with a history of developmental language disorder, to discover whether diagnostic substitution has taken place.  ... Some children who would nowadays be diagnosed unambiguously with autistic disorder had been diagnosed with developmental language disorder in the past. This finding has implications for our understanding of the epidemiology of autism.\" That's pretty straightforward.  This study follows another published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2007 Nov).  From the abstract: \"We examined trends in assignment of special education codes to British Columbia (BC) school children who had an autism code in at least 1 year between 1996 and 2004, inclusive. The proportion of children with an autism code increased from 12.3/10,000 in 1996 to 43.1/10,000 in 2004; 51.9% of this increase was attributable to children switching from another special education classification to autism (16.0/10,000). Taking into account the reverse situation (children with an autism code switching to another special education category (5.9/10.000)),  diagnostic substitution accounted for at least one-third of the increase in autism prevalence over the study period. \" So here we have two differently structured studies that both indicate that diagnostic substitution plays a role in the increase in autism administrative caseload prevalence.  These two follow another, perhaps more widely known study by Shattuck, published in Pediatrics (Apr 2006).  This is the study that resulted in  harrassment  and character assassination of Paul Shattuck by the folks over at NAA, a major \"mercury causes autism\" advocacy group.  From this study's abstract: \"RESULTS: The average administrative prevalence of autism among children increased from 0.6 to 3.1 per 1000 from 1994 to 2003 ... During the same period, the prevalence of mental retardation and learning disabilities declined by 2.8 and 8.3 per 1000, respectively.  Higher autism prevalence was significantly associated with corresponding declines in the prevalence of mental retardation and learning disabilities.  The declining prevalence of mental retardation and learning disabilities from 1994 to 2003 represented a significant downward deflection in their preexisting trajectories of prevalence from 1984 to 1993. California was one of a handful of states that did not clearly follow this pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence findings from special education data do not support the claim of an autism epidemic because the administrative prevalence figures for most states are well below epidemiological estimates.  The growing administrative prevalence of autism from 1994 to 2003 was associated with corresponding declines in the usage of other diagnostic categories. \" I think that in today's media climate, where fund raising  a la  Autism Speaks, spotlight seeking  a la  Jenny McCarthy and David Kirby, and controversy seeking  a la  every major news outlet are combining to paint a picture of a devastating autism epidemic, it is important to keep in mind that the path to real answer lies in the careful application of science.  And it is even more important to understand and recognize the impact of our focus on various issues on those who sometimes seem to have the quietest voice in a community full of big voices  - autistics.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18384386?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=385"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/04/diagnostic-substitution.html", "title": "\nDiagnostic Substitution\n"},

This month, the cover story is \"Microenterprises:  A New Way for Consumers to do Business\".  This brief article discusses the microenterprise - defined as a business with five or fewer employees that can utilize initial capital of $35,000 or less.  Think of things like minor repair operations, cleaning services, pet sitting or training, gift basket creation, local tech support, etc.   The point of the article is that this type of business venture creates an exciting opportunity for individuals with developmental disabilities to strike out \"on their own\".  Of course, on one's own can be defined in many different ways, as different people have highly variable needs for support. The article goes on to detail some of the necessary areas of skill acquisition and interest determination that would allow for a successful outcome in a microenterprise. I think the thing that struck me most about this article was the closing paragraph, as it seamlessly integrates my acquired views of both personal fulfillment/responsibility and the need to provide ample opportunities for all people to realize their potential: \"People have a universal desire to experience and express their dignity, meaning, and self-worth through creatively harnessing their skills and talents in volunteer or compensated work activities.

Today's homework entailed the directive to look around, say what you see, and then draw a picture of that in the box.  L was helping J with his homework and I was sitting next to J eating my dinner. J looked around and settled his searching gaze on ...  me. And this was the result: Allow me to walk you through the creation of this piece of art. The first thing J did was to ask for his colored pencils.  He was not at all happy that we didn't have 'grey'.  'Why do you need grey', L asked.  'For hair' was J's reply.  Ouch!  He decided to do the hair \"spikey\". The black circles that you are currently convinced are eyeballs?  They are nostrils.  The yellow circle around them is my nose. The red edges to the ears do not indicate that I am a warrior of the Sioux nation, but that my ear rims were redder than the rest of my ears. The black dots are a very fine 5 o'clock shadow.  I did shave this morning.  J's attention to detail is astounding. The large brown patch and the green smudge in the eye area of the drawing are my eyes.  He asked me to look at him and stared deeply into my eyes, after which he pronounced, \"Light brown for the outside, light green for the inside, and dark brown for the spots.\"  The yellow column upon which is resting my head is my neck (in retrospect, that is the strangest sentence I have ever written.) The black oval, black stripes, and red circle below the neck represents the Adidas logo on my t-shirt.

On so many levels, this is my favorite part of the \"portrait\". One last thing to end this post... This morning J was up early.  He was perched in front of the computer when I came downstairs to leave for work at 5:20 a.m.  I walked over, rubbed his head, kissed him, and said \"Bye, J!  I'm going to work now.  You have a wonderful day, I love you, and  you're a great kid !\"  (this is something I tell all three boys every chance I get) Without peeling his eyes away from the computer, he responded in a low, yet falsetto, voice, \"You're a great dad.\" I walked away, knowing that even though he didn't address me directly or in a normal-volume voice he meant it.

{"date": "Sunday, May 18, 2008", "body": "\nI encountered a study a few days ago that you may have not noticed.  Here is an excerpt from the introduction: This remarkable growth has been accompanied                                    by continued and escalating calls to reform [...] policy not only at the national                                    level but within large and small communities                                    across the country. [...] policy debates                                    touch on a wide array of arguments:  economic,                                    political, ethical, legal, and emotional . In                                    many cases, these debates are also influenced                                    by incomplete or misleading information. All                                    sides in the debate face a trade-off between                                    conveying a concise message and oversimplifying                                    an inherently complex issue. These are many of the issues I find myself thinking through in relation to my own son's future, as well as for autistics as a whole subset of the population.  And the granular nature of the Autism Spectrum - the vast complexity of how autism can manifest and then play out over an individual's lifespan - plays into the extreme complexity referenced in this quote from the study. The study goes on to say: The purpose of this report is to present information                                    relevant to these ongoing debates by measuring                                    the degree of distinction between the [...] populations of the United States,                                    or alternatively, their degree of assimilation... The analysis introduces a numeric index of assimilation,                                    which measures the extent to which the [...] can be distinguished from each                                    other on the basis of commonly observed social                                    and economic data. Interesting angle.  This study is bringing to bear some statistical algorithms to determine the degree of assimilation into U.S. general society by a highly heterogenous group that is categorically similar only in respect to the fact that they begin as societal \"outsiders\". You may have gathered by now that  this study  is not about autism or any other disability.  Instead, it is about immigration.   What fascinated me when I came across the abstract is how much I yearned to see similar data gathered and presented about autism. A few disclaimers:  I am not minimizing or overdramatizing the circumstances surrounding any individual or any group labelled or categorized as autistic or immigrant by making this comparison.  This discussion is strictly about the data gathering and ensuing statistical analysis used in the Manhattan Institute study and how the autism research community might be able to take a few lessons. Look back at this sentence from the study intro for the sentence that tightened this analogy for me: All                                    sides in the debate face a trade-off between                                    conveying a concise message and oversimplifying                                    an inherently complex issue. This seems to me to be such a common area of misunderstanding and misdirection in all areas of autism research, autistic rights, autism treatments, autism diagnosis. One way in which this immigration study tries to channel the discussion is to create categories of analysis within which the data can be more accurately compared and analyzed.  These categories are Economic, Cultural, and Civic.  I think in a similar discussion of autistic assimilation the categories might look different.  If 100 people were asked to name the 3 categories, you might receive 100 different answers.  My answers would be, trying to keep in mind the vast array of people who are autistic:  Activity/productivity self-determination, community and family involvement, and personal/spiritual/emotional expression.  I'd be very interested in your comments with what three (or more, or less) you would identify. I guess where I am going with all of this is that I, like virtually everybody involved in the autism community, would like to clearly and easily understand how best to approach solving the legion of challenges that face autistics over their lifespan.  From toilet training to schoolyard bullying to friendship seeking to sexuality to job/career building to self-sufficiency at whatever degree makes sense for a given individual, I would love to see a clearer roadmap to success.  I feel much the same way about the immigration debate, much of which seems to hinge on as many irreconcilable realities and viewpoints and human rights issues as the autism discussion does. It is my belief that the autism community could draw some ideas from the Manhattan Institute's approach to gaining a deeper understanding of the immigration issue.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_53.htm"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/05/assimilation.html", "title": "\nAssimilation\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 27, 2008", "body": "\nOn March 17, I wrote a post titled  One Runs Home  about the plight of Nate Tseglin.  Nate is a young man who was forcibly removed from his home and consigned to Fairview Community Center in Orange County, CA by San Diego Child Protective Services. I recommend that you read the family's website,  GetNateHome , for a complete description and timeline of the events leading to Nate's current circumstance. Today I was informed by my friend Ari Ne'eman, President of ASAN, that he and V.P. of ASAN Scott Michael Robertson had submitted an Amicus Curiae brief on behalf of Nate Tseglin.  The purpose of this document is to establish, via published scientific findings, that his current placement and course of psychotropic medications is highly inappropriate. I'd like to publish that letter here on my blog, and express my hope that this piece of advocacy by ASAN provides significant assistance in estabishing the need for Nate to return home to his family. To Whom It May Concern:   The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) is an international organization of adults and youth on the autism spectrum, including Asperger's Syndrome, working to promote the interests of the autistic self-advocate community through public policy and social change advocacy. We are writing as friends of the court to express our concern about the treatment of Nate Tseglin, a young adult with a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome who has been taken away from his family and placed in an institution under heavy psychotropic medication. The right of individuals with disabilities to live in the community has been well established by the United States Supreme Court under the landmark Olmstead v. L.C. decision. The ruling requires states to shift funding from institutional placements to community living supports. Given the clear evidence that institutional settings and the indiscriminate use of psychotropic medication negatively impact the quality of life of autistic adults and youth, we are concerned by Nate's continued placement under restraint in a residential facility where he is isolated from his family, his community, and any meaningful educational or social opportunities. The overwhelming consensus of the scientific community indicates that such a placement is inappropriate, unnecessary, and counterproductive. Scientific studies have not found that autistic persons are more likely to commit violent acts or violent crimes than non-autistic persons despite some media sensationalism of isolated cases of violence (Murrie, Warren, Kristiannsson, & Dietz, 2002; Barry-Walsh & Mullen, 2004). Autistic persons are, however, more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, for which cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and one-on-one talk counseling are the recommended interventions (Stewart, Barnard, Pearson, Hasan, & O'Brien, 2006; Sofronoff, Attwood, & Hinton, 2005). Autistic persons also require positive support systems, frequent encouragement and praise, and living and learning environments that are compatible with their cognitive strengths, challenges, and preferences in order to achieve success in their life pursuits and gain a high quality of life (Renty & Roeyers, 2006; Plimley, 2007). Psychotropic medications should always be used with extreme caution with autistic persons as typically these medications are not specifically tested on this population in clinical studies, and psychotropic medications may cause substantial harm if used in an indiscriminate fashion. Nate's current placement does not meet his needs and is likely to result in long-term physical and emotional damage. We urge the Court to recommend that Nate be removed from the Fairview Developmental Center and returned to the community.

Three weeks that have seen opportunity after opportunity to write and discuss go whizzing by, victims of the fevered pitch which life takes on during the spring for me and my family.  Jeez, I'm starting to feel less prolific than  Not Mercury  here! As many of you know, I run a company that distributes  fresh cut flowers  to the North American markets.  Here in Southern California, floral production is peaking as Mother's Day draws near.  This is a potent brew in our business, and I spend far more time at the office at this time of year than I would choose to in a perfect world.  In the flower biz, however, one must make hay while the sun shines, so to speak.  At the same time, J is in Kindergarten, T is in preschool, both of them are in  T-ball , Colin is walking (which dramatically increases his destructive range - now knee-high) and babbling a lot, Grandma and Poppa take them on regular weekend adventures, we had Arts in the Park to attend, it has been warm enough to swim, we are trying to train our puppy  Marley  (who is rapidly approaching 100 pounds of hyperactive dogginess), the yard and house need lots of attention, L and I are trying to exercise a bit more, etc, etc.  I also have been following the  autism/mito story  as it develops in fits and starts.   While fascinating from a purely academic standpoint, the real-world implications are far-reaching.  At this point, I am of the strong opinion that any possible mito/autism connection (with the implication that vaccines are the link) has turned into a  feeding frenzy  for the  anti-vax crowd , that they are being irresponsibly (and erroneously) offered  chum  by sensationalist David Kirby, that real  mitochondrial experts  are carefully weighing in with cautionary notes that are being largely ignored, and that  some bloggers are doing a superior job  of weaving personal experience with scientific understanding in an attempt to bring some well-needed grounding to the situation.  Another fascinating situation involving  Neurodiversity.com  author Kathleen Seidel has been unfolding rapidly and with great affect.  Let me be the 1000th to say Kudos! to Kathleen for her oh-so-American, self-made Motion to  Quash  that may have propelled Clifford Shoemaker (a key player in the autism/mito scenario, to boot) to the brink of jurisprudential retribution.  For shame, Mr. Shoemaker.  At the same time, thanks for indirectly generating so much traffic for the  Autism Hub . I have also had my nose in a few different books/publications.  One has been  Elijah's Cup , a heartfelt opus written by  Valerie Paradiz .  Though I am only about 1/3 of the way through this book, I am completely drawn in by the story of Valerie and her son's early days entering the arena that so many of us inhabit comfortably now.  I am eager to continue on with the lovely style of Valerie's writing and its powerful, positive message. Another thing I had wanted to write at some length about is Autism:  The Musical.  Here's the short version of my reaction to this documentary:  I LOVED IT.  Not all of it, but who cares?  I loved it.  Please watch it. I have also noticed that we have a couple more new bloggers here at the Autism Hub - the more the merrier!.  Welcome,  Bill !  Your well-grounded opinions and wonderful sense of humor are very welcome around here.  Welcome, Jeff Gitchel!  I've been reading your blog a bit and I really like it.  Your  real-world guides  are great! I also have been actively at work behind the scenes, along with several other Autism Hub bloggers, on a project.  Taking a page out of David Kirby's book, I'm not going to tell you what it is right now.  Instead, I am going to leave you with this teaser:   Leave your calenders open the week of June 25.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://notmercury.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismvox.com/in-search-of-another-hidden-hoard-autistic-children-with-mito/", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/the-next-vaccine-autism-n_b_98807.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=781", "http://stopthinkautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/too-many-masters-of-illusions.html", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/152/", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://www.amazon.com/Elijahs-Cup-Community-High-Functioning-Aspergers/dp/074320445X", "http://www.valerieparadiz.com/", "http://livsjourney.blogspot.com/", "http://perseveration.org/?p=59"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/04/mish-mash.html", "title": "\nA mish-mash\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 14, 2008", "body": "\nI'd like for you to meet George Saidah, Captain of  Heart of Sailing . A few weeks ago, we had the opportunity to join George and his crew for a daysail around San Diego Harbor.  As all four of us sailors (baby C stayed with Grandma and Poppa) are nautical neophytes, we weren't quite sure what to expect.  It was just ... perfect. George is a retired guy who now runs an organization called Heart of Sailing.  I'm not sure all of the details, but his story goes something like this: After retirement, George was trying to think of a way to combine his ample free time, his love of sailing, and his urge to provide a valuable service to the community.  In the middle of the night he shot awake in bed with this idea - which eventually became Heart of Sailing. Here is an excerpt from the mission statement: Although alternative forms of therapy such as art and music therapy, as well as horseback riding, have become widely accepted in the last few years, sailing is a unique environment for participants. Sailing encourages abstract thought and teamwork, develops problem-solving skills and ultimately helps one learn patience and self-respect. The experience of sailing is not limited to the physical, although for many participants, it is their first opportunity to enjoy the unique sensations associated with sailing: the feel of the wind, the movement of the waves, the sounds as the boat moves through the water, all of which are stimulating and exhilarating. Some of this may be true, but we didn't do this for J as a \"therapy\".  We did it for fun!  And fun it was. We were accompanied by another local family who have become dear friends over the last couple of years as our kids grow up together.  Good company always makes a day more fun, less challenging, and more special. With George and his crew, we four D's, and the 5 members of our friend's family, we had a pretty full little boat.  Which was all the more reason for the kids to climb out on to the prow, which is a far different experience than riding on the seats in the stern.  (That's pirate-talk for \"front\" and \"back\", for you land-lubbers). We got to see some interesting traffic in the Harbor - including one freighter laden with brand new yachts - big, expensive yachts.  I couldn't help but wonder of that was the only cargo currently traversing the 7 seas that, if the vessel sunk none of the cargo would be lost! We also had the pleasure of meeting some Sea Lions.  They were just basking in the rays of a beautiful San Diego day, choosing a buoy as their place of R&R. And, just as George promised, as we rounded the tip of Point Loma, we caught a great view of the Point Loma Lighthouse.  This lighthouse canot be seen from anywhere on land, as it is at the base of a high cliff at the tip of a peninsula.  If you can see the lighthouse, you are officially in the Pacific Ocean! In all, we have George's skills and generosity to thank for a fun and exciting day.  Aye aye, Captain J! Heart of sailing?  Heart of gold!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.heartofsailing.org/mission.asp", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SCucqgwzANI/AAAAAAAAAHM/FyyEzFRT2bo/s1600-h/DSCN2031.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SCudlgwzAOI/AAAAAAAAAHU/JOcnYu6femI/s1600-h/DSCN2033.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SCueNAwzAPI/AAAAAAAAAHc/myfTCfWuIqk/s1600-h/DSCN2029.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SCue_gwzAQI/AAAAAAAAAHk/W_ULaPRZnC0/s1600-h/DSCN2037.JPG"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/05/meet-george.html", "title": "\nMeet George\n"},

By all accounts, it was a successful venture and the attendees hopefully left with a broader view of autism than when they started.  And now its time to do it again - but this time we'll take it up a notch and actually do  two  presentations! This time (the conference is June 23-25 and titled \" Autism:  Work With Me, Not On Me \"), we will be joined by two more Hub members -  Estee  Klar-Wolfond will be coming in from Toronto, and  Autism Diva  will be heading south to bolster our ranks!  We are excited to welcome these two Hub bloggers to the presenting group, which now numbers 5.  Estee will also be delivering a keynote address, which I very much look forward to.  Especially in light of her recent health problems, I couldn't be more pleased to have Estee join us.  And Autism Diva?  What a pleasure it will be to have her depth of knowledge and experience as part of our team. On the  USD website , you can see the  speaker bios  and  presentation descriptions .  The conference will be held in in the Rotunda/Theatre at the Joan B. Kroc  Institute for Peace and Justice  - a fitting location for the content we will deliver.

{"date": "Saturday, May 17, 2008", "body": "\nBack in March I received an email from a medical student in Canada.  In it, she described herself as an \"Aspie\" - a person diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome - and she was asking for participation on an ethics project she was working on as part of her medical school curriculum.  She had contacted several bloggers who are either on the autism spectrum themselves or have an interest/association with the autism spectrum. Her project was to collect and analyze congruency among definitions of three terms:  Human, Fully Functional, and Normal.  Once collected, could the definitions be used to understand differences in perception of autistics from within and without the autism community?  I have written about  the importance of words  before, so this was a concept I could relate to. I though this was a fair and decent request, so I decided to participate.  I have not yet seen any results from her research project, but I hope to soon.  Apparently she had asked 20 or more bloggers to participate - did anyone else reading this contribute as well?  I would be interested in the definitions you used. I can be a bit, ahem, long winded at times.  Keeping that in mind I did ask the researcher whether there was a framework to stay within in terms of length or type of definition.  Their project was designed to take into account any type of response.  So here is what I gave as my definitions: Human A Human is quite simply each and every member of our species.  Incredibly diverse in appearance and behavior, humans are nonetheless of one \"family\".  'Human' is a word that ought to be devoid of subjectivity, though it most definitely is not so.  To be considered \"less than human\" is typically a label reserved for people who are viewed as being either unconscionably cruel and evil  or  not able to function in such a way as to be easily viewed as part of the broader 'family'.  Either assignation creates contemptibility by its very implication, which is incredibly unfortunate for those who are not evil, yet still considered \"less than human\". When considering this definition, I can't help but consider my use of the term 'whole person' in reference to how I feel ASD folks should always be viewed.  I realize now that I intend this term to act as a counterpoint to the view that a non-typical human is 'less than human'. Fully Functional Whether or not a person is fully functional is far more dependent on the external circumstances, supports, and expectations of successful adaptation than it is within any one individual.  Functionality, in other words, is situationally dependent.  A star athlete may excel on the playing field but utterly fail dealing with the pressures of parenthood.  Is this person, then, fully functional?  A person who is profoundly affected by autism may have difficulty or total inability to wash his/her own hair in the shower, but the same person may be a superior pet owner, whose dog or cat is a paragon of health and happiness.  Is this person fully functional? It is my opinion that none of us, therefore, are fully functional, and that the term itself is the result of a biased position.  A more accurate statement that would expose the bias would be 'fully functional as compared to the average performance in any given activity and circumstance'.  An appreciation of what many ASD people need to exert in terms of effort to fit within this preconceived range of \"fuunctionality\" is merited.  The fact that so many are so successful at it does not mean that the definition of 'fully functional' should not be expanded so that more ASD folks can be considered to be 'whole persons' (see definition of Human, above). Normal The definition of normal is perhaps the most fluid of the three definitons discussed here, and is entirely dependent on the position of the observer.  What is considered to be 'normal' in Zambia is not necessarily so in Chile.  What is 'normal' at afternoon tea would not be considered so during a cattle drive in the American West.  Age, sex, status, culture, environment, and thousands of other factors all contribute to the subjective view of 'normal'. However, it is not 'Normal' that makes parents cringe the day of their child's diagnosis of autism.  It is, instead, its antonym, 'Abnormal'.  Abnormality evokes a far greater response, and it is this automatic response the allows one to understand when something is, indeed, abnormal. I think that where great strides are being made in promoting understanding and acceptance in mainstream society of autistic people is in reassigning the value system that freights with 'abnormality'.  For example, when my son, as he did last week, scores in the 99.7% in reading skills, that is definitely 'abnormal'.  But not in a bad way. Interesting to note is that had he been tested strictly versus a hyperlexic population, he probably would have tested - you guessed it - 'Normal'.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/05/definitions.html", "title": "\nDefinitions\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 6, 2008", "body": "\nThis topic is being more than adequately covered elsewhere, so I fortunately need not go into excessive detail about the Green Our Vaccines rally staged in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. I do, however, need to express one level of serious dismay with some of the posters being shown there.  Some of the posters were fairly mild-mannered.  Some ramped up the rhetoric, using Devil imagery to mock our government health agencies and employing the skull-and-crossbones to imply poison (although vaccines are not in any way poisonous).  But the ones the evoked the most visceral response in me were the ones that exploited autistic children.  Let me give you an example: This post has been edited to remove two photos taken at the rally.  For a discussion of why the photos were removed, please see the comments section.  The first photo depicted a mother holding a picture of her beautiful son, surrounded by a Skull and Crossbones and the words, \"Stop Poisoning our future\" In this poster,  Mommy's message to her son is quite clear - your future has been poisoned, you are a casualty.  Where else but this rally can you find parents carrying photos of their *live* children accompanied by POISON and TOXIC WASTE symbolism and terminology?  I have to wonder if the parents have stopped for a moment to consider the impact of this imagery on their child. Now take a look at this one: The second photo had two side-by-side frames.  In the first was a smiling little boy with the heading \"What God Made\".  In the second was the same boy in an awkward pose saying \"What Man Made\". This is the one that elicited the most powerful response from me, but very likely not for the reason this Dad intended.  First off, do you think Dad picked the best 'after' photo to prove his point, or the 'worst'?  Am I the only one who gathers the intended message that if he were autistic in the 'before' picture, he couldn't possibly be smiling? I am deeply bothered by the callous, insensitive nature of this poster.  How is a child supposed to feel valued when their own father is going out of his way to cast his appearance/behavior in the worst possible light?  This is really foul, really disturbing, and I think provides a chilling example of what happens when anti-vaccination zeal is a more powerful force in someone's life than simple respect for a person, a child. I recently received a request from a friend to help them with some written assets for a project about how people view \"behaviors\".  The simple request was to review some of my writing about my son and to pick out some examples where I had addressed problem behaviors.  The goal of the project is to discuss various ways people refer to autistic behaviors in an effort to highlight some positive, respectful methods of doing so.  So I went to work reviewing archived blogposts to find some.  I knew I would have to do some digging, since I didn't specifically recall writing directly on this issue.  The end result is that I found virtually nothing of benefit except some comments to my posts (not by me).  The reason for this, as I discussed with my friend, is that I do not write negative things about my son.  I can be frank and sometimes allude to difficult moments or times, but I feel a powerful parental duty to  not   cast aspersion on my son, the fact that he is autistic, the fact that raising him includes challenges that are directly related to his autism.  My duty as a Dad to a 6-year old boy is to keep the world at bay, not to invite it in and hold him forth as a political tool or pawn in an anger and blame game.  Many contributors to the Autism Hub are accused of glossing over autism, of making light, of minimizing autism's disabling aspects, even of ignoring the existence of those who are most severely affected by autism.  Perhaps the examples above can provide a good example of why I choose not to dwell on my son's most challenging issues for all the world to read and discuss.  Perhaps I have too much respect for him as a person - a person who will someday read this blog and hopefully be proud of his Mom and his Dad and his brothers and who can feel really safe and secure knowing that he is valued as a person - not relegated to the scrapheap of collateral damage. This philosophy is not new, not something I conveniently stumbled upon as a way to criticize the Green Our Vaccines attendees.  My  very first post to this blog ,  Taking Up The Pen ,  contains this line: \"It occurs to me that, years from now, these words will be accessible to all three of my sons.\" But that's just One Dad's Opinion.  What's yours? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/06/on-green-our-vaccines-rally.html", "title": "\nOn the Green Our Vaccines Rally\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, June 26, 2008", "body": "\nWhat follows is a completely inadequate summary of the occasion of  The Autism Hub  presentation at  University of San Diego's Autism Institute  on June 25, 2008.  The reason it will be inadequate, the reason that I know this even before committing it to paper, is that it would be impossible to capture the  spirit  and energy of that day in a simple blog entry. It began with a toast. Bev ,  Camille ,  Dad of Cameron ,  Estee , and I all met in Old Town San Diego at a landmark San Diego restaurant - the  Old Town Mexican Cafe .   Its the kind of place with wire-back chairs in a stuffy room and slow service, but that still has a 45-minute wait on a Tuesday evening.  And has for decades. When we sat down for a joy-filled dinner, it was the first time several of us had met in person, despite e-knowing each other for a couple of years or more.  Though the next morning we were to present to a crowd of 200 and we were just getting a feel for each other, we just flat-out had a great time.  If you think you might have come up during our dinner conversation, you probably did.  When Do'C asked the Mariachis to play Jalisco, we knew it was time to call it a night.  But not before we toasted the fact that we had all come together, spanning three states and two countries, to talk about what we do. Next thing we all knew - the next morning -  we were hustling around in a media room in the  Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace and Justice  (certainly an apropos location for the subject matter), transferring files from laptop to laptop, testing software versions and compatibility, running through various ways to reshuffle and reorder the presentation due to aesthetical, timeframe, and technological issues.  If one was not careful, one might by impaled by a flying  memory stick  in that busy room.  After a very quick 90 minutes, Dr. Jodi Robledo came in and said we had access to the auditorium in 5 minutes.  But we were only 20 minutes into our first run-through! As we set up on stage in the main auditorium ( a  beautiful room in a world-class facility ), I noticed that  Peyton Goddard  came in the room with her parents.  Peyton's friend, Lisha, had already been there filming, and I was hoping this meant Peyton would be attending.  She came over to the relatively empty side of the auditorium where my Mom (who came to see our presentation) was sitting and joined her for a while.  In the meantime, the couple of hundred guests filed in and took their seats.  The audience was predominantly educators and service providers, there were a number of parents, there were three self-advocates who had come down from Orange County,  Stephen Hinkle  also joined us later, and I believe two other autistics were in attendance. The presentation, as we were told later, came together perfectly.  Though we each individually had chosen our won subject matter, what resulted was a symphony of perspectives, assertions, and concepts that hit on seemingly every cylinder.  From Estee's video, \" Adam Speaks \" to Bev's talk and video on the importance of respectful language, from Do'C's cheerleading (literally) and logical presentation about the \" epidemic \" to Camille's deeply insightful discussion of bias and stereotyping (bias:  don't think you have it?  Guess again...), from lots of laughs to some very touching moments (a moment of silence for  Katie McCarron ), we hopefully brought the attendees through as many aspects of the Autism Hub as can be accomplished in 2 hours. In one of the more touching moments I experienced (there were many more that I am not fitting into this post),  Peyton sat with her parents in the front row of the otherwise-empty auditorium near the end of the lunch break.  Her Mother told us that she was typing something for us that she wanted us to have.  After quite a few minutes, her mother had transcribed the brief note Peyton had worked so hard to write.  The words were  powerful ,  poignant .  I will share them if I receive permission from Peyton to do so, as I forgot to ask her that day.  They left the indelible impression that at least one person had heard our message loud and clear.  Strange how this same person is one who I,  in my own ignorance , may have \"written off\" just a few short years ago. Perhaps in another post, I'd like to describe that afternoon's breakout session, as well as the fascinating panel discussion at the end of the day (please let me know if you are interested in hearing about it). But in case it takes me some time to get that written, I want to make sure I express my gratitude to Dr. Anne Donnellan for making this whole thing possible.  I am probably the 17,000th person Anne has directly impacted in a positive way, and am happy to be in that group.  I want to thank Dr. Jodi Robledo for doing the heavy lifting of organizing the conference, despite her pregnancy (congratulations!) and for being the only person to subject herself to more interviews than I did.   I want to thank Martha and Kate and Nan for their unabashed support for us \"rookie\" participants, and I want to thank Stephen, Peyton, Steven, Sara, Lauren, Bev, Camille, and a young woman in the crowd whose name I don't know for adding the \"autism\" to the \"autism conference\".  I want to thank Diana Pastore Carson for the most heartfelt response to our presentation and for describing the very difficult conditions her brother has endured in the absence of true acceptance from the people who were assigned the professional responsibility to aid in caring for him.  And Darlene and J.D., whose breakout I unfortunately missed due to our own occurring simultaneously.  If I am forgetting anyone, please remind me and forgive me. And I want to thank my wife, who valiantly chased, fed, cleaned, cajoled, entertained, moderated between, picked up after, and kept on schedule 3 active boys while their Dad was off sitting on a stage somewhere.

{"date": "Friday, June 13, 2008", "body": "\nI don't spend too much time writing on this blog about vaccines.  The reason is not that I don't think it is important - I think this is a very important issue that spans health, politics, science, human and financial resources, and quality of life issues for autistics.  The main reason I don't spend too much time on it is that other bloggers such as  Kev et al .,  Prometheus ,  Kristina ,  Mike , and  Kathleen  among many others do such a thorough and marvelous job with current analysis.  I appreciate their efforts, and I hope they all know that. What prompted this post is an  interview  I read today on a website called Science Progress.  The interview was with Dr. Saad Omer, whose credentials you can find  here  on Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's faculty page.  It really caught my attention because I think Dr. Omer has a very clear, concise, well-organized approach to describing where current knowledge stands in relation to vaccine safety and autism causation issues.  Here is a set of assertions that is sensitive to all \"sides\" of the debate, that does not pussy-foot around adverse vaccine reactions, and yet falls back on the current science to draw current conclusions. As the parent of an autistic child, I am often asked my thoughts on vaccines.  There are so many talking points and subtleties that I often find it difficult to summarize why I have arrived at my position without losing them in the details and finer points.  So I am posting portions of the interview to my blog, linking to the rest of it, and can use this as a referral when asked this question in the future. Here are some excerpts: On the Hannah Poling case: So to put things in perspective for that case\u2014and in terms of people drawing conclusions from it\u2014I would caution that this is just  a  case and the question I often ask, even within the scientific community is \u201cwhere are the controls?\u201d Because when we assess scientific evidence, we need to keep in mind that we need to compare an association of an event with an outcome in both cases and controls, we haven\u2019t had that kind of evaluation yet. On the Hannah Poling case's significance to autism causation: And just to clarify why we are on this topic: even if this link is established, and what it says is that mitochondrial disorders, which are a kind of disorder in the cell\u2019s energy mechanism, is proven to be exacerbated by vaccines and result in autism spectrum disorders, metabolic disorders are very rare and it would explain a very small proportion of autism diseases\u2014just to put that in perspective. On Evidentiary Standards for the VICP: ... the Special Masters of the compensation program, not the HHS, interpreted as having said that the evidence should be evaluated on a standard of \u201cbiologically plausible.\u201d I think that\u2019s dangerous, because I can sit here and come up with twenty or thirty different hypotheses which would be biologically plausible on several biological models. We are not talking about  probable ; we are talking about  plausible  ...   So I think it\u2019s not a very robust standard to go by because what we are saying is that we would have judgments on these cases based on something that  could  happen, not something that  does  happen. On methods to maximize Vaccine safety: One major program is the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting system, which is jointly managed by the CDC and the FDA, and events that seem to be associated with vaccines are reported into that system. It\u2019s a good system for generating signals but it has its limitations ... There was a recent analysis published in  Pediatrics  that showed that most of the rise in reports of autism-related symptoms associated with vaccines has been due to increased reporting of litigation-associated cases. So we have that kind of a problem with VAERS but it still has a lot of utility in terms of generating signals. For example, it generated a signal for the old rotavirus vaccine. ... Then the CDC has the Vaccine Safety Datalink. They have put together a system by linking databases from several large HMOs, and it covers approximately two percent of the U.S. population of zero to six years. ... Then there is the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network, which is a network of a few centers of excellence, mostly academic centers, coordinated by the CDC, to assess vaccine safety in a clinical setting. ... I must say, I think vaccine safety needs a lot more resources than it is provided. Because as I said, vaccine events are rare so you need large numbers to study these phenomena and the resources that are available are very low. On the risks of not vaccinating: On the other hand, we know that there is risk of\u2014even an individual level risk\u2014of acquiring vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States if your child is not vaccinated.  For example, in a national-level study it was found that kids who are exempt from vaccination requirements had thirty-three times\u2014not percent, it\u2019s times\u2014higher risk of acquiring measles with those who are vaccinated, who do not seek exemptions,  and [in a Colorado study] six times higher risk of acquiring pertussis than those who are vaccinated. So there are real risks involved in terms of acquiring vaccine-preventable diseases On Rubella - very interesting point: One last point in this regard: we do know that congenital rubella syndrome is associated\u2014and there are some studies showing an association\u2014with autism-like symptoms. So we know that part of that syndrome is explained by a congenital rubella syndrome which used to occur when the population-level immunity in the U.S was relatively low. So actually, MMR vaccine prevents against something that is associated with autism.  So if you are thinking specifically in terms of autism, one should consider that we are talking about something that prevents autism. On sources of information: It\u2019s several sources. We found in our studies\u2014looking at parents of children exempted from vaccination requirements, compared to those vaccinated\u2014there was an association with types of provider, trust in government, the sources of information people tended to get, information from some of the advocacy sites tended to seek exemptions at a higher rate, etc. So yes. There are several sources of that, and there are passionate people who feel there is an association with vaccines and autism, and that includes some celebrities as well. So that gets people\u2019s attention. On concerned parents: On the other hand I must say that most parents, even those that are concerned about vaccine safety, are coming from the right place. All of us want our children to be safe from any harm, including harm from any pharmaceutical interventions. On adverse reactions and risk/benefit: One thing that people should realize is that we know that vaccines have some side effects. And we should acknowledge that, everyone who is involved. However, the risk and benefit calculus for all vaccines that are out there, based on our current knowledge, heavily favors not only getting your child vaccinated, but also getting them vaccinated according to the specified schedule. On spreading out the schedule: I have seen a new trend where people are splitting the difference and saying, \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to get my kid vaccinated, but I\u2019m going to get them vaccinated late.\u201d Well the risk of illness is not constant across childhood and so that\u2019s why the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics come up with these recommendations to look at several factors, including the burden of disease.  So it\u2019s important to not only get your child vaccinated, but also to get them vaccinated per specified schedule. All bold emphasis is mine. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/", "http://www.autismvox.com/", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/", "http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/05/safe-vaccines-and-healthy-children/", "http://faculty.jhsph.edu/?F=Saad&L=Omer"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/06/dr-omer-on-vaccines.html", "title": "\nDr. Omer on Vaccines\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 27, 2008", "body": "\nIn my  first conference summary , I wrote about the morning before the presentation and the presentation itself.  I left out at least 100 anecdotes, but the gist is there. Later that day, we were scheduled to do a breakout session for 90 minutes.  And to close the conference, all speakers were invited to be part of a panel discussion. First, let me finish relating a bit about  Peyton Goddard . During the presentation, we were each to choose subject matter that was important to us and relevant to our understanding of the value of the  Autism Hub  community.  One thing that was quite profound to me was the compelling difference of views of autism that are embodied by the Hub's overarching philosophy versus someone who could actually take the life of a child, as happened to Katie McCarron.  I am deeply respectful of Katie's family, especially having gotten to know her grandfather a bit, and I wrote to ask him permission to talk about this during the conference.  Mike McCarron gave me his blessing. On that topic, I chose to read Mike's  Open Letter to the Autism Hub , followed by a moment of silence to honor Katie.  What I didn't realize, mainly because I never looked up from Mike's letter as I read it for fear of being a bit overwhelmed by 200 stunned, silent pairs of eyes on me and the emotion of trying to grapple with the loss of a precious little girl, is that Peyton had been unable or unwilling to remain in her seat while I was reading.  She had moved to the edge of the theater, perhaps even left for a bit. (I said in my last post that I would talk about what Peyton wrote if she granted permission to do so.  Today, she gave me permission via her father, Patrick). Fast forward to the moments before we were to begin our \"breakout\" session.  Peyton was in the auditorium again, in the front row typing a message.  She finished typing and then immediately left.  Her mother had transferred her words to a slip of paper, which she gave to Estee.  She told us that Peyton had written the message for Estee and Bev.   Consider the subject matter I just related to you when reading Peyton's words: \"Queer is equated to fear and pity.  It should = Love.\" Seriously. Peyton also wanted us to know something she has said at an earlier time, but is also relevant to the content of the conference. \"We need to stand on each other's shoulders in order to reach our common goal.\" I hope you are now getting a better feel for why I am referring to these posts as 'inadequate summaries'.  How am I supposed to impart to you how all of this felt as it occurred, moment after moment, all day long?  I can't do it.  I don't have the words. Okay, so back to the breakout.  Our morning presentation ended at 12:30 (...sorry, Jodi, I know we were supposed to be done at 12:00.  But we were kind of on a roll at that point).   Lunch was one hour long.  At 1:15 the five of us convened on stage to admit to each other that we had nothing for the breakout.  We were done, we had exhausted our repertoire of videos and slides and anecdotes.  But wait!  James had a great video we hadn't shown -  Belong .  We would play that to get things going.  And Bev had a slide show we did on Tuesday's breakout - Myths about Neurodiversity and the Autism Hub (good stuff).  Estee has a chapter in a new book, and she would do a reading.  Camille and I would, well, um, we would lend support. We made it through James' video and as Bev's slideshow went on, the audience and us Hubbers began a dialogue.  Long story short, Bev never got the chance to finish her Powerpoint.  What happened, instead, was a fantastic discussion covering all kinds of topics.  I want to point out in particular that this breakout group had just sat through a long, 2-hour session with us and opted to come back to interact with us some more.  I wish I had taken notes during all of this, as the discussion was deep and important.  A round of lattes and slices of lemon loaf would have made this feel like a fireside chat.  It was really refreshing, thought-provoking, and productive.  Thanks to that small group of people for selecting our breakout. I need to take a moment here to also acknowledge and thank HollywoodJaded for her attending the conference and for her overall support of all our efforts.  HJ is one of our Hub webmasters, and none of this would be possible without hers and Dave's efforts to keep a good thing going. HJ also took some pics, and I'd like to use one to segue to the next session - the panel discussion... A bit of lead-in.  I worked in the weeks before the conference to increase the attendance of autistics.  Dr. Anne Donnellan and Dr. Jodi Robledo worked with me to ensure that a minimum of obstacles existed for autistics to attend.  I then asked Ari Ne'eman to help me spread the word that at least one \"Autism\" conference had every intention to include \"Autism\".  Though I hope we do better next time, several autistic folks did attend.  I'll keep to a first name basis for now and say that Steven, Lauren, and Sara were the attendees.  They had attended the entire conference, but only in the last moments before the last session - the panel discussion - we asked them to join us on stage.  It was time to provide a voice to the self-advocates that were not presenters.  Lauren opted to stay in the audience.  In the following picture, you will see some of the panel members, L-R: Stephen Hinkle, Darlene Hanson, Steven K, Sara L, Me, and Kate McGinnity: What I really enjoyed during this segment was the interchange between various people on the autism spectrum.   In one memorable moment, a young woman in attendance with her mother stood up and declared her preference that she be considered to be a \"person with autism\" as opposed to an \"autistic person\".  She cited several reasons for feeling this way.  I utterly respect her assertion of this viewpoint, and the way in which she clearly and diligently stated her case.  We  often throw the word \"self-advocate\" around, but here is a case where actions speak louder than words.  I would be remiss if I didn't also mention Steven K, Bev, and Camille's responses on the same topic.  Though they all disagreed with the original speaker's viewpoint, it was eminently clear the respect that existed between all individuals with divergent points of view.  Moreover, the point was not lost on me that here were 4 autistic people, engaged in a really good discussion that is highly relevant to self-esteem and identity, while close to 150 NT's observed, and learned, and for the most part stayed out of it.  Is this not what it is all about?  From Peyton's note to this exchange of ideas, I hope you can grasp the importance of all that transpired. Thursday morning, I woke up at 4:45 to go to work.  The conference was over.  I was exhausted, but felt really good about what had happened.  I was still processing the many levels of information I had immersed myself into, I was still in a mildly unsettled state I often feel after putting myself \"out there\" like that (I am not a highly social creature), I was physically tired and even more so intellectually, and I was acclimating to the fact that - several years now after becoming an active participant in the Autism community as I know it - many people have forgotten more than I have yet learned. And before I drove off to get back into the workaday routine, I did a quick email check. I had received an email from Autreat.  Several people had listened to the MP3 of the  interview Bev and I had done on NPR  and were writing to express their enthusiasm for the message we sent that day.  One person was listening with xyr child, a young adult, who was \"squealing and cheering\" during the playback. For a community which is  supposedly  impaired in the area of relationships and communication, the \"experts\" may be surprised at the prevailing level of interconnectedness.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://peytongoddard.com/album.htm", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=698", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/index.php?s=belong", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SGW-dhtCiXI/AAAAAAAAAJU/r6Y72iUBr8M/s1600-h/photo%282%29.jpg", "http://www.kpbs.org/radio/these_days;id=12059"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/06/inadequate-summary-part-2.html", "title": "\nInadequate Summary, Part 2\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 8, 2008", "body": "\n I have written from time to time on the importance of \"community\".   Community takes many forms, and in the autism vernacular is used in many ways, some as cold and unfeeling as a word included in a clinical calibration of goal establishment, such as \"subject will spend 45 minutes per day, 5 times per week, in a  community -based setting\". Sometimes, when I am applying \"real\" autism stuff to our little corner of the autism world, I need to get my arms around how terms or circumstances apply in our life - how does something like \"community involvement\" or any of its variations play out in our family dynamic? To answer this question, I will use a minor occurrence from last Tuesday.  You see, last Tuesday J received two postcards in the mail.  Ask yourself the last time you received two postcards the same day!  Heck, when is the last time you received one postcard? The first postcard is from J's kindergarten teacher.  Now, please be aware that Jason is done with Kindergarten.  He graduated.  Just ask anyone who lives around here, and they know, since J told everyone he saw - very loudly and at the expense of any other greeting, \"I graduated Kindergarten!\" - for the last 3 weeks. The teacher, Mrs. D'Nealian, was simply one of the most perfect people that could have come into J's life at the time she did.  Mrs. D'Nealian runs a tight classroom, with lots of rules.  Mrs. D'Nealian has all of her rules in writing, at eye level, all over the classroom.  Mrs. D'Nealian uses very concrete ways to help young learners identify good and bad behaviors (such as the \"VIP\" chair), Mrs. D.Nealian welcomes parents to be involved in the classroom, and also welcomed a full-time aide for one of her students (that would be J).  For perhaps the greatest example of the type of things that occur in Mrs. D'Nealian's classroom, read  The Best Story Ever! .  Here is the back of Mrs. D'Nealian's postcard to J, probably written on a plane somewhere between here and Chicago: (Postcard has been cropped to protect personal information.  It is signed, \"Love, Mrs. D'Nealian\") Is it just me who is struck by the importance of this type of small, simple action on the part of this teacher?  Please keep in mind that Mrs. D'Nealian has never had an autistic student before. She is a general ed. teacher, and J had a mainstream placement for Kindergarten. And, truth be told, Mrs. D'Nealian is one of a long line of perfect people who have entered our lives as a result of being part of J's \"community\".  Some examples: J's first therapist just sent us pictures of her new baby, still in touch after moving away two years ago. J's second therapist had both of my sons walk down the aisle in her wedding.  That was the day that J took a bite out of the wedding cake.  The bride's response?  She laughed the loudest of anyone. J's third therapist is a lasting friend, and even gave our other son, T, his first fish (named Tony). J's fourth therapist is also a lasting friend, and is the source of one of our great dogs,  Marley  (hey, there seems to be a pattern developing here.) J's fifth (and last) therapist weathered some storms of defiance from a newly assertive J with a stiff upper lip, and still took the time to come see the Autism Hub  presentation  in January. J still gets mopey from time to time and mentions that he misses N, his former SLT. J's Special Ed Coordinator at school has proven to have his best interests in mind, and even took it upon herself to start a district-based Autism Parents group for the purpose of sharing information and putting together some simple social activities for our kids (such as an Easter Egg hunt). J has had some wonderful aides at school, who have been by his side through much of his period of positive development over the last two years of his full inclusion at school. J's therapeutic horsemanship teacher has also become his swim instructor, and she and her sister are also housesitters for us now.    She also is working in the same capacity with Baby C now (Yikes!  Don't ask about that yet). I know I am forgetting some people here, there have been so many that have been a positive force in our family's life. They don't tell you this stuff at the time of diagnosis, do they?  They don't tell you all of the good things that come along with the challenges and difficulties.  Maybe they should.  It is my understanding that some parents of children born with Down Syndrome are given a \"Congratulations\" gift bag on the birth of their child.  How would autistic children benefit if the same were to happen with our kids? Of course, I mentioned at the beginning of this post that J received two postcards that day, and leaving out mention of the second would be a travesty.  You see, J's Grandma and Poppa have been the most impactful on J's life of anyone.  From simply accepting him for who he is and all the foibles that come along with him, to dedicating themselves to taking both older boys on a surprise \"adventure\" every Saturday that they are in town (they are part-time residents of our area), to the big trip coming up in a couple of weeks.  Grandma and Poppa are taking our two older boys to Colorado, without Mom and Dad!  Its a big adventure! Grandma and Poppa know J and T are nervous about their biggest adventure of all.  Grandma and Poppa know that J loves trains, and that he will be excited to see one in Breckenridge.  Grandma and Poppa know J responds well to things that are written down and is able to reference images easily. Grandma and Poppa are perfect grandparents for J and T. Perfect. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SHGURC1190I/AAAAAAAAAJc/OjT1cEcccnE/s1600-h/ScannedImage-3.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SHGWf_L1e0I/AAAAAAAAAJs/oKTjLz0IfgU/s1600-h/ScannedImage-4.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SHQycRIdBiI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/u7R4G2aqvXM/s1600-h/ScannedImage.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SHQy8bepo8I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/ViLUFJbWH5Y/s1600-h/ScannedImage-2.jpg"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/07/importance-of-postcards.html", "title": "\nThe Importance Of ...

{"date": "Monday, July 21, 2008", "body": "\n I just read a great column in the Washington Post by Ann Bauer, and I wanted to share it with you. Please read the article in its entirety  here .  You will need to register (free) in order to access the page. One of my main goals in keeping this blog and participating in online and real-life advocacy efforts is to try to promote the concept of supporting autistic people.  I remain immensely dismayed by the overwhelming occupancy of cause and cure issues in the national rhetoric on the topic of autism.  It is far too often that autistic adults and those who are transitioning into adulthood are ignored - they are victims of the autism community's unnerving inability to move beyond the vaccine and mercury causation belief systems.  These belief systems pigeonhole the range of discussion and seemingly override most other concerns within the community.  These belief systems result in a worldview that narrows the definition of \"support\" to a set of medical interventions sold to parents with still-young children.  To put it in a different way, one a friend recently mentioned, the broader autism discussion has been \"framed\" - the narrative has been set in the public's mind -  to imply that all autistics are young children who are the victims of their toxic environment.   One unintended result of this misappropriation of ongoing focus and energy on the vaccine issue is that it inevitable draws resources from known areas of shortfalls.  One such area is aiding young adults with their transition into adulthood. Let me give you a quote from Ms. Bauer's piece: \"My grown son has autism. And while I wouldn't trade him -- the person to whom I gave birth -- for any other, I wish that his disability were as recognizable as Down syndrome and that we, his parents, were more effective at helping him achieve a satisfying life. Right now, we're flummoxed by the issues that arise as a child with autism veers into adulthood: higher education, employment, independent living, romance. In all these areas, family members of those with Down syndrome have figured out a cohesive, workable system of support.\" I think Ms. Bauer hit the proverbial nail on the head.  I think she has voiced the concerns that parents of adult autistics have been asserting for a long time now.  Is this situation improving?  I certainly hope so, but obviously not at a pace that has helped Ms. Bauer's son. Another quote: \"Third -- and most important -- they have carved out a place in society for their children. It's a hackneyed myth that people with Down syndrome are uniformly happy, but it is true that they have the capacity for joy and that their community has ensured they have a breadth of options -- career, marriage, dignity. This is what we who love people with autism must do\" Thank you for that, Ms. Bauer. You see, I have long wondered what happens when the last biomedical treatment has been tried, and the resignation sets in that autism truly is a lifelong disability. Or when a child who has been held out in public as being an example of a \"cured\", or \"recovered\", by his or her parents has problems as life's stages unfold.  Problems that he or she is not \"supposed\" to be having. Well, hopefully those of us who have been working towards societal acceptance, who have been shooting holes in the \"autism is worse than cancer\" mindset, who have decided that respect and dignity freight more effectively in autistics' lives than panic and pity, hopefully we will have made enough of a difference in society that those kids, too, can pursue their individuality in a way that preserves their happiness and sense of fulfillment.  So how do we go about that?  How do we improve services and life transitions for autistic people?  In an interesting parallel, a really good post hit the Autism Hub today by  Joel Smith  on that very subject.  In it, Joel - an autistic adult himself who has the strength of experience behind his words - spells out specific areas on which supporters and educators of autistics can focus for the most positive impact.  Please give it a read.  Ann Bauer and her son.  Joel Smith and the Autism Hub.  My son J.  Let's keep writing our own narrative. Note:  Apologies for the formatting problems with this, and other, posts.

{"date": "Sunday, June 29, 2008", "body": "\nIt is Sunday evening, and the clock is ticking on what turned out to be a very heady week.  Between one  radio interview , one television interview, one interview for a documentary in progress,  three presentations , and a  panel discussion , this week turned out to be steeped in engaged and fascinating discussion and action.  And now, after a weekend of hanging out with my boys, picking fresh fruit from the orchard, swimming, taking the dogs for long walks, blogging as a means of processing all that happened this week, I feel refreshed and  rejuvenated.  I also feel encouraged by the response our actions garnered this week in the worldwide autism community - both online and in the live local community.  I am encouraged by the communication I am having with other Hub bloggers who would like to see similar events take place in their locales. But, as so often happens in life, I soon  came across something  that reminded me that there is a lot of work left to be done. Harold Doherty is the father of an autistic boy named Connor.  Anyone who has read Mr. Doherty's blog will recognize Connor as the vibrant, tall, active young guy in many photos  and videos.  Mr. Doherty is an involved, doting, loving father as is plain for anyone to see.  He also is a hard-working advocate for autism services - in particular, Applied Behavioral Analysis - in Eastern Canada. So what, then, would motivate  Mr. Doherty  to write the kind of offensive, utterly pointless blog post that appeared on Facing Autism In New Brunswick today? In the post, he first takes some potshots at  Dr. Roy Richard Grinker  and  Dr. Kristina Chew  (\"some professors of cultural anthropology and classical literature\") by virtue of assigning to them a position that neither has taken.  Mr. Doherty claims that they \"...believe ...[that]... there are no environmental causes of autism and there is no autism epidemic.  ALL  of the dramatic increases in the numbers of autistic children and adults are  due  ENTIRELY  to the definition changes in the DSM and to diagnostic substitution.\" This statement is patently and verifiably false.  But not only does Mr. Doherty create a false position for Dr. Grinker and Dr. Chew, he also fails to even provide a decent summary of the evidence-based reasoning that they and so many others have used to determine that any comparison of today's autism prevalence figures to those in the not-too-distant past would be flawed and mostly useless.  Even more egregious is Mr. Doherty's failure to point out why people such as Dr. Chew and Dr. Grinker - themselves parents of autistic children - choose to eschew terminology such as \"epidemic\".  I can't speak for them, but I suspect it may be that they understand this type of rhetoric to be harmful to autistic people. Having established in the first paragraph that this particular blog post will be yet another \"hit piece\" against 'neurodiversity' and anyone associated with it, Mr. Doherty goes on to underwhelm us with yet more evidence of his slippery slope into autism quackery.  Let's select a few words he uses in his effort to convince the reader that epidemic-panic is justifiable: \"mercury\", \"lead\", \"pesticides\", \"exposed\", \"increasingly toxic bath\", \"triggers\". To state this another way, Mr. Doherty must convince you that there is an autism epidemic in order for you to buy his premise that an elusive \"trigger\" is causing all of this destruction.  And, to establish this premise, he uses an ad hominem attack against people who disagree with him. Dr. Grinker has applied his accumulated knowledge of autism study in numerous cultures and within a historical context as a means to help us understand some of the more vague and subtle factors that may be influencing prevalence figures.  Mr. Doherty dismisses this body of evidence with the angry stroke of a key. Dr. Chew performs perhaps the most complete and thorough review to be found in the world today of day-to-day developments in autism media, research, and real life communities.  Mr. Doherty huffs and puffs as a means of discrediting her careful, thoughtful commentary.  Both Dr. Grinker and Dr. Chew are parents of autistic children, and have been so for longer than Mr. Doherty.  Both have chosen to emphasize their child's strengths over deficits, and this is where they and Mr. Doherty diverge.  That is where  many  of us and Mr. Doherty diverge. Mr. Doherty goes on to summarize his rant by citing his pet term, the \"Autism Knowledge Revolution\".  And yet he offers us no new knowledge, not even any original thought on the \"epidemic\".  Perhaps he really means the \"Autism  Bluster  Revolution\", a battle front which he has engaged for quite some time now. What amazes me sometimes, and was one reason for writing this post, is the ongoing spite in the autism community online.  I was first \" singled out \" by Mr. Doherty one year ago, after I attended and blogged about my first University of San Diego conference.  At that time, I was attacked for discussing the difference between \"deficit model\" and \"dynamic systems model\".  I still recall being stunned by someone taking a negative view of what I considered to be a very appropriate and complex approach to understanding and supporting autistic people - especially those who have serious communication impairments.  ( Link   -read the comments) Now it is a year later, and nothing has changed. I also realize that I, and the Autism Hub in general, probably gained more than a few readers due to the exposure that was generated last week.  It is important that people understand the range of mentalities that exist in relation to understanding autism, and people such as Mr. Doherty clearly approach the whole thing from an entirely different angle than I do. So I will make the same offer again that I have numerous times in the past - to have Mr. Doherty engage in a calm, respectful discussion on any of the various points of disagreement.  I'm not expecting a different result, but the offer is there for the taking, as always. Aside from that, my return to \"Reality\" has been as discomforting as it has been ... expected.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kpbs.org/radio/these_days;id=12059", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/", "http://www.blogger.com/unstrange.com", "http://www.autismvox.com/", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bluster", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2007/07/autism-newsflash-neurodiversity-and.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/06/back-to-reality.html", "title": "\nBack to 'Reality'\n"},

All kinds of things have been happening this summer in the autism communities.  Some I have silently cheered, others have left me cringing and wondering when the madness would end.  I do rest assured that the efforts I see on an ongoing basis in the more stable, sane corners of the world of autism are working to the benefit of my son and many others like - and not so much like - him. Taking a step back for a while has also helped me to realize the importance of the message we try to get out here on the Autism Hub.  People need to hear us - autistics, parents, professionals, researchers.  When I see the sheer volume of oppressive or misguided messages that exist out there, I am resolved to continue to speak to the issues. Now for a mini- Snippet  (this becomes Snippets 3.0): About an hour ago, J was rooting through the cupboard looking for something to eat.   I peeked in there and noticed a bag of sunflower seeds - one of my favorite snacks.  I buy the shelled type, as I hate shelling them myself.  I grabbed about 4 or 5 seeds out of the bag and encouraged J to try some.  Anyone who knows J also knows that he is extremely limited in his diet, and has very powerful sensory reactions (gag and vomit) to a huge range of textures.  This is something we have only last week received funding approval to address via OT.  But as he matures he has at least shown a willingness to try new things.  So I asked him to try the sunflower seeds, and promptly put these 4 or 5 on his tongue before he could object.  I saw the familiar facial expression change, and he began to retch.  He spit out the seeds and backed away.  Knowing how these things go, and constantly feeling guilty for having to push and push for him to expand his diet in the face of real challenges, I told him I was sorry. His response? \"I ...  I just ....    don't want them to grow in my belly!\" Riiiiight.  Sunflower  seeds . Just when I think I know why he's doing what he's doing, I am proven wrong again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/08/what-i-did-on-my-summer-vacation.html", "title": "\nWhat I Did On My Summer Vacation\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 15, 2008", "body": "\nThis post is one of the most challenging for me to write.  It is very difficult to put my arms around how I feel right now and even more so to find the right words to express it. Today, my youngest son was diagnosed with Autism Disorder. C is 19 months old, so the diagnosis is \"provisional\".  This means that his \" label \" may change (within the ASD umbrella) as he develops over the next year or so.  But the diagnosing clinician, who has assessed around 1,000 kids during her career, left no room for doubt as to whether or not he is on the spectrum.  Both the results of the ADOS and her clinical experience paint a very clear picture.  What is not so clear, and what is so difficult as a parent of a child with autism or any number of other developmental challenges is what C's prognosis looks like.  I have spent a lot of time on this blog writing about Positive Outcomes, and I can't help but dwell on the mercurial nature of that subject on the day my son was diagnosed. Of course, we knew this about C before he went to Children's Hospital today.  We knew, but we didn't know, if you know what I mean.  We have seen all kinds of indicators over the past 6-8 months.  At the same time, we also saw things that would indicate he is not autistic.  What we, as parents, lacked is the clinical experience and the lack of bias that a professional can provide.  For this reason, we have been counting the days to August 15 so we could receive a confirmation or denial of what we had been observing. I've got some more thinking to do before I write much more on this.  Feel free to comment any way you'd like on this - I welcome your thoughts and insights at this time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/03/i-am-joes-functioning-label.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-challenge.html", "title": "\nA New Challenge\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 26, 2008", "body": "\nIt is a  situation  that I honestly did not anticipate occurring in our lives again.  That feeling - soon after a child is diagnosed with autism - of \"Now what do we do!?\" Let me begin by saying that the operational aspect of this is soooo much easier than last time.  When J was diagnosed in 2004, it took several months for us to get our bearings.  I'll never forget leaving the hospital that day.  Being told that J is autistic, then being handed a packet of information/local contacts/agencies, and being shown the door.  At that time, I knew  nothing  about autism.  I wrote about the drive home  here . This time, the feeling of disorientation is there again.  But it is rooted in different lines of thought.  Now we are very familiar with what to do, and what  not  to do.  We're not hitting the panic button as before, nor are we organizing our family and friends into a quasi-military command structure in order to \"combat\" autism or \"defeat\" our family's new circumstance.  No, we are much more accepting of the inherent good and not-so-good that accompanies the effort to raise an autistic child.  More importantly, we are acutely aware of the challenges - moment by moment, day by day - that are facing our little guy.  I think we can do a better job this time of balancing his needs with trying to promote the most positive outcome in overcoming some of the disabling aspects of autism.  And, unlike before, he and we have a role model for success in the first few years (his older brother).  And we already have a great support-framework in place (a very supportive family, real-life friends on and off the spectrum, numerous professional contacts, and an immensely supportive online community who have already provided staunch emotional support accompanied by personal anecdotes and great advice).  Let me take this opportunity to thank each of you who commented on my last post announcing baby C's diagnosis, those who felt supportive but did not or could not put their thoughts into words, and those whp sent personal emails.  All messages were read, digested, and appreciated. So that leads me back to, What's Next? In a great coincidence, the answer to that question came in a peer-reviewed, published paper approximately 10 days prior to C's diagnosis at Children's Hospital. I cannot link you to the full paper, but  here is the abstract  as listed on PubMed. The study is titled \"Properties of supportive relationships form the perspective of academically successful individuals with autism\", and it was authored by Dr. Jodi Robledo and Dr. Anne Donnellan, both of the University of San Diego Autism Institute.  If you need more info on the USD Autism Institute, simply look at the Home Page of the  Autism Hub,  and you will find them listed under \"Autism Hub Friends\".  Or, here is a  direct link . The really important aspect of this paper is that, by interviewing autistic adults, the authors established 6 factors that were  deemed as being essential to their success in building relationships.  It is extremely gratifying to me to see researchers intentionally positioning autistics as a primary source of experiential information, and basing their findings on these experiential factors.  This is an unfortunately rare circumstance in autism research today, and the results are - to my way of thinking - all the more valuable as a result. Before I discuss the findings and their relevancy in my family's life, a quick note about the participants.  All 5 participants are young adults who have been academically successful.  3 of the 5 are non-speaking and communicate through typing.  I have personally met three of the five participants, and will attest that their autism-related challenges are as significant as a researcher is likely to find.  The results of the study essentially consist of  the responses of these 5 participants, and the translation of these responses into 6 categories.  The participants were asked to identify 2 to 4 individuals with whom they had a  supportive  relationship, the definition of supportive being left up to the participant.  When the data - collected via face-to-face interviews, email correspondence, published documents, public broadcasts, and phone interviews - were analyzed, 6 major properties emerged as being essential components of a supportive relationship: TRUST INTIMATE CONNECTION SHARED VISION OF INDEPENDENCE THE PRESUMPTION OF COMPETENCE UNDERSTANDING COMMUNICATION Perhaps this list struck you as you read it for the first time in the same way that it struck me. And what struck me is that it is nice to see some research-based verification of that philosophy that I have already adopted.  Anyone who has spent any time browsing the Autism Hub will agree that these properties are discussed regularly, in detail, with enthusiasm, and are universally embraced as being essential components of autism \"acceptance\" (for lack of a more efficacious word).  So as we move forward into building a relationship with our second autistic son, we will be keeping these things at the forefront of our minds.  There is no need to reinvent the wheel, here.  What is called for is to listen to those who have come before (in this case, autistic adults) and emulate that which has been shown to be effective. THAT'S what's next. Thanks to Drs. Robledo and Donnellan for their work on this study.

{"date": "Friday, August 29, 2008", "body": "\nOne of the great pleasures of being a Dad to small children is being able to hug them.  Both of my older boys are highly accustomed to Dad's Hug Economy around the house.  There is the Stealth Hug, the Bear Hug, the Feel Better Hug, and numerous other variations. Baby C, on the other hand, has never hugged me.  He is dealing with some developmental anomalies that are probably causing some sensory integration issues that make my kind of hugging not so pleasant for him.  It is also possible that my hugs are too unpredictable in their occurrence or intensity.  Perhaps my voice or posture is not copacetic to his way of thinking.  Whatever it is, its not working for him.  That's not to say he doesn't hug in his own way, though.  He does. When I want to have some time with C, or just let him know I'm interested in getting down to his physical level, I kneel and spread my arms out wide.  This is a fairly universal gesture, I think.  He will notice me, and cruise over to me.  However, once he is approximately arm's length he will stop, rotate in place until his back is to me, and take tiny backwards steps until he backs into me.  I, in keeping with the routine we have developed, will squeeze him by pressing his shoulders towards each other, will apply pressure to his crown, temples, and forehead, and will do some other deep pressure stuff and joint compressions as long as he will let me.  Its not a typical hug, but C is not a typical kid. Tonight, though, for the first time, I received a Full Frontal Hug!  And once he decided it was okay, he grabbed on tight and we were able to hug for a good 12 or 15 seconds.  Once I put him down, he motored right past me as if nothing had happened.  But he and I both know that a small barrier has been broken.  Next time I kneel down, he will have options.  If he wants to back into me, then fine.  But I'm ready for another Full Frontal Hug whenever he is.  And again I am reminded of one of the wonderful aspects of parenting.  Its the little things - the things that no person outside the immediate dyad could ever know - that makes the parent/child relationship so special.  Things like the Full Frontal Hug.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/08/full-frontal-hug.html", "title": "\nFull Frontal Hug\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 4, 2008", "body": "\nOne way or another, barriers will be broken this year when the results of our presidential election are known in November.  I cannot recall a more important time for a country to take stock of itself, determine where to go from here, and to act on that determination.  This blog has never been intended to be a platform for discussion of \"party\" politics.  This post, though it may smack of such politics, is not intended as such.  I have stated before and I will reiterate now that I am socially and fiscally of a Conservative mindset.  I realize that many of my real life and online friends do not share my beliefs and determinations on such matters, and I have been fortunate enough to have encountered some good souls who can provoke serious thought and deliberation on various topics in this arena without rancor and strife.  I do, however, draw a few hard lines.  One of them has to do with abortion.  This is the first reason that I am feeling pretty darn positive about Governor Sarah Palin's nomination as Vice-Presidential candidate on the McCain ticket.  In case you haven't already heard, Governor Palin is the proud mother of a 4-month old boy who has Down Syndrome. Are you aware that, according to at least  one review of the available scientific literature , up to 92% of children who are prenatally determined - typically via amniocentesis - to have Down Syndrome are terminated prenatally?   Do you ever wonder how close we are to having a prenatal test for autism, at least one that could determine statistical likelihood?  What concerns does the possibility of such a test cause you to consider? Perhaps Sarah Palin had an \"amnio\", perhaps she didn't.  If she felt, as my wife and I did during all three pregnancies, that the results of an amniocentesis would not result in our deciding to terminate our unborn child, then I'm guessing she declined for health reasons.   As we declined.   Regardless, we now have a vice-presidential candidate whose gender - she would, of course, become the first female VP in American history - is being, if not overshadowed,  complemented  by her role as the very-new parent of a child with special needs.  And this role is what caused her to assert the following statement during last night's candidacy acceptance speech: \"And in April, my husband, Todd, and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical. That's how it is with us.  Our family has the same ups and downs as any other \u2014 the same challenges and the same joys.  Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge. And children with special needs inspire a special love.  To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters. I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House. \" This is music to my ears, and provides an incandescent spark of hope that perhaps, if Governor Palin does indeed become the Vice President of the United States of America, the disability community will have an important ally in Washington. Here is One Dad's best wishes that, whatever the outcome of this political contest, Trig Palin will thrive at all stages of his precious life, and that he will touch us all and in turn be touched by us in ways that promote our ...  well ...  our  humanity .  Go Trig!  Go Sarah!

{"date": "Wednesday, September 3, 2008", "body": "\nSince not all of my readers are often aware of all the scientific goings-on in the world of autism study and research, I would be doing a disservice by failing to mention the most recent important study that looked at the hypothesized link between vaccines (in this case the MMR, not to be confused with the now-defunct mercury causation concept) and autism. More specifically,  this study looked at  the long-held position that (follow me here) Measles/Mumps/Rubella vaccine causes autism by creating a persistent measles-virus infection in the gut of the affected individual - termed \" autistic enterocolitis \" - which, in turn, causes the individual to manifest autistic behaviors, perhaps due to the opioid excess theory.  This is the entirety, and half of another, of the three causation concepts being advanced in the  Autism Omnibus Proceeding  currently (and for the past 2 years) underway in the  VICP  in our nation's capitol. To offer a brief summary, the study adds to the body of knowledge that the MMR vaccine has no relation to autism. A couple of things make this study somewhat more palatable to the broader autism community than the numerous others that have arrived at the same conclusion.  One is that a major contributor to this study -  indeed half of the presenting research team - is one Dr. Mady Hornig.  Dr. Hornig is (in)famous for her studies on \" SJL Thim \" mice in which she supposedly  induced autism  via thimerosal exposure.  The mice literally chewed through each other's skulls, which was construed as being an \"animal model\" for autism.  Go figure.  ( Author's note:  Neither of my two autistic children have attempted to chew on anyone else's skulls, including each others'.  Knock on wood. ) So Mady Hornig - a veritable \"celebrity\" of the vaccine/autism research pantheon - is now stating with certainty that the MMR is  not  to be considered a culprit in autism causation.  Of course, one hero of the autism/vaccine movement turning to the \"dark side\" as a result of this study is easy to explain away if the resulting  cognitive dissonance  is too great to bear.  But two? Yes,  two .   Rick Rollens  was present at the press conference.  Although his comments (which I can only reference in a limited context, as I did not have access to the presser itself) do not directly address what the study authors have found to be the most significant findings, they instead are intended to perpetuate the controversial causation hypotheses. The following quote, a  real  \"study finding\", is by study co-author Ian Lipkin of Columbia University:  \"We found no difference in children who had GI complaints and no autism and children who had autism but no GI complaints,...\" Rick Rollens' presence - especially considering his personal, political, and financial largesse in directing funding away from needed services and toward the vaccine causation hypotheses  - at the press conference certainly implies a tacit approval of the findings.  Few people have more personal or emotional investment in the erroneous, yet dominant,  theory.  As opposed to arguing against the study results, Rick redirects the topic away from vaccines which, frankly, may be the appropriate thing to do - even if it is a dodge. Let's please remember that this is not \"new\" information, per se, but instead is a further confirmation of what has already been accepted by the broader scientific community after numerous studies achieving the same (via different methods)  result.  Here is, in contrast to the above quoted statement by Ian Lipkin,  one of Mr. Rollens' statements from the teleconference:  \"No longer can mainstream medicine ignore parents' claims of clinically significant GI distress,\" said Rick Rollens, a parent and autism research advocate.    He commended the researchers for their work but said, \"This study by itself does not exonerate the role of all vaccines.\" Well, no, this study doesn't exonerate all vaccines - it was not designed to do so.  But seeing as the theories espoused by the vaccine/autism crowd have been centered on two theories (MMR or TCV's/Mercury), that not one shred of good science has supported these theories, that little tangible benefit to a single individual with autism has resulted from these theories, and that the whole topic doesn't amount to a hill of beans in the quality of life for my two autistic sons, I am of a mind to continue to focus on whatever will create the best likelihood of positive outcome for all autistics and not let the festering vaccine causation theories prevail. Lets all understand that this ongoing and falsely contrived crusade against public health, regardless of what is motivating it and who is perpetuating it, is drawing crucial resources and attention away from the truly pressing issues that the autism community should be addressing.  Issues such as housing for adults, societal inclusion, promoting ways and means that autistics can be impactful in a positive way in their communities and microeconomies, identifying and implementing appropriate means to ensure physical and mental health at all stages of life for autistic people.  So I ask about the autism/vaccine connection - NOW is it over?  Please read  here ,  here , and  here  for much more through reviews of this important research result.

In the hit-piece, he attempts to draw imaginary lines between Kathleen's career path and resulting ethyl mercury exposure, with the fact that she is the parent of an autistic person. It is  de rigeur  to find this type of (poorly done and factually erroneous) attempted character assassination on AoA, as past \"victims\" have included anyone from respected researcher  Nancy Minshew , to vaccine expert Paul Offit, to Drs. (and parents) Joyce Chung and Roy Richard Grinker, among many others. Kev has already explained  the foundational level of ineptness displayed by Dan Olmstead in writing this most recent diatribe, by explaining that the supposed ethyl mercury exposure that Mr. Olmstead has 'accused' Kathleen of never actually happened. No need to rehash that point again, as I'm sure Mr. Olmstead is appropriately ashamed of his blind leap to conclusions by now. Or perhaps not, since Mr. Olmstead seems to have made a career of this type of  dot-connecting without fact-checking . What I want to address is the common content of the comments on that post. Aside from the expected \"GO DAN!\" style of comments, there is a recurring theme there of agreement on something that Mr. Olmstead brought up in his attempt to discredit Kathleen. Mr. Olmstead's piece uses the following quote from Kathleen Seidel:    \"Excuse me. Did it ever occur to [vaccine mercury critics] that someone might object to having their family members labeled as inherently toxic?\"    as a springboard for his counter-argument:    \"Well, they might object, but that doesn't have any bearing on the truth.\"    And the commenters to the piece really dig in to this concept, with comments like:    \"There is absolutely no logic in saying that it is offensive to imply that a child is poisoned. Poising is something that happens to someone.Poisoning is not a trait one is born with. How can you \"offend\" someone by stating or hypothesizing that an event happened to someone? Ridiculous!\" ***** \"And \"toxic\" is not an insult -- it is a possible explanation which, when treated, can sometimes result in substantial improvement in quality of life -- health, social skills, cognition...\" ***** \"What an ostrich attitude, construing concern over treatment of a medical malady instead as a social gaffe. I know toxic people, myself among them, and have no problem applying or wearing that label.\" ***** \"Is Kathleen Seidel Toxic? Unequivocally \"yes\". What else could explain her aggressive, obsessive, hateful demeanor. Somebody toss this woman a DMSA, please!\"    I had to throw that last quote in as a perfect example of what connotations the word \"toxic\" carries in today's vernacular.    Having read these comments, I think perhaps I can offer One Dad's Opinion - not to be confused with \"the Neurodiversity movement\" (if anyone has a membership list for the ND's, I'd love to see one) - on why it is so important to not refer to our children as toxic when they are not. Toxic  is defined as:    tox\u00b7ic    play_w2(\"T0295700\")                                                                                (t   k   s   k)        adj.       1.  Of, relating to, or caused by a toxin or other poison: a toxic condition; toxic hepatitis.       2.  Capable of causing injury or death, especially by chemical means; poisonous: food preservatives that are toxic in concentrated amounts; a dump for toxic industrial wastes. See Synonyms at  poisonous .    This, then, is the set of parameters folks at Age of Autism are setting for our children. They would have you believe that, in the immortal words of JB Handley, \"There is no such thing as autism. Autism is just a mis-diagnosis for mercury poisoning.\" Words that JB - founder of Generation Rescue and Age of Autism - has never retracted.     The logical extension of this statement is quite simple: Toxic is  bad Non-toxic (\"cured\" or \"recovered\") is  good Since they also take the position that autism is condition resulting from toxicity, then of course: Autistic is  bad Non-autistic is  good Now I'm not going to sit here and say there is nothing  bad  about the condition of being autistic, as different individuals experience the challenges and disabling aspects of autism in different ways and it would be foolish to sugarcoat those aspects. And it is certainly not my place to speak for anyone else on this topic. But I have a serious problem with autism being approached from a  de facto  position that it is a lesser circumstance.       This position requires the view that autism is inherently negative, and that elimination of the condition of autism (i.e. toxicity) is the only worthy goal.  Recall that autism is defined as a life-long disorder.  There is documented improvement in some young children - some even \"moving off\" the spectrum altogether - but no \"treatment\" oriented toward resolving the hypothesized toxicity component has been shown to have been more effective than placebo.   So often it has amazed me that, among the parents who go down the road of hard-core buying into the \"toxic child\" mythology, so little thought is given to the life-long impact of their particular brand of PR on those people who will remain autistic and require community supports throughout their lifespan. The mantra seems to be, \"I recovered  my  kid, aren't you ashamed that you haven't even tried?\" Which equates in my mind to, \"My kid is better off than yours because he/she is less autistic than yours\". Are these people unable to conceptualize how the \"toxicity\" view of autism would dictate how educator and service providers may view the individual? Imagine an IEP meeting - \"How is Kim this year? Still poisoned? Oh, that sucks ... I guess we'll have to support her again. When do you think she might be detoxed?\" And let's just say that the PR machine (all style, no substance) that is GR and AoA succeeds in their very expensive and cult-like \"selling\" of the toxic child paradigm to the general public. What, then, of the autistic teens, young adults, and adults that are out in the community - participating as is their God-given right? Will they be met with sad looks, hushed conversations just out of earshot about the poor \"toxic cesspool\" that is the autistic person? How, exactly, does this world-view engender dignity for the autistic person? You know what? It doesn't. It just doesn't. And it saddens me that people like Mr. Olmstead - himself a person who is NOT a stakeholder in the autism community - devote their efforts to entrenching the public in this erroneous and harmful paradigm.

Shame, Mr. Olmstead. Shame.    For those who may want to get a more accurate view of Kathleen Seidel's thoughts on autism, you may want to consider reading  this excellent essay .

{"date": "Saturday, September 20, 2008", "body": "\nI read an interesting piece in the UK's  Telegraph  today on the topic of autistic women titled \"Autistic Women: A Life More Ordinary\".  The author of the article, Charlotte Moore, is mother to two autistic sons and, as such, brings some autism-related life experience to bear in her brief synopsis of autistic females. I can state with certainty that my understanding of autism - formed from the perspective of a non-autistic parent - has been enriched greatly by having met and gotten to know  Bev Harp , an autistic woman and all-around great person.  Likewise, I have seldom been more moved to consider my own shortfalls of understanding than I am when I spend time with  Peyton Goddard .  I have also had the great pleasure of getting to know  Camille Clark  in person. Online, I have also benefitted from exchanging ideas with  Michelle Dawson  and  Amanda Baggs.   I have not spent much time considering the skewed male:female ratio in terms of autism.  In light of that, I found the following paragraph from the article very interesting, especially in the context of our understanding of prevalence of autism today (and the supposed 'epidemic'): \"When the first of my two autistic sons was diagnosed in 1994,     someone told me that autism was more prevalent among Jews (my     sons' father is partly Jewish). This notion probably arose     because many mid-century psychiatrists and psychoanalysts were     Jewish, so interest in and awareness of unusual mental states was     higher among Jewish families, who were therefore more likely to seek     consultations for their children. Similarly, Asperger believed     autism to be more prevalent amongst the professional classes,     failing to see that it was simply more likely that such a parent     would seek his advice. We now know that autism is not related to     ethnicity, income or social class. Are we about to find that it is     not as strongly linked to gender as has been supposed, that there     are more autistic women out there than we imagine?\" Anyway, its a well-written but brief article that I would recommend.

Having stayed at  The Breakers  for the duration, one would think I would be well rested and rejuvenated.  Not so.  I suffered family pangs while I was gone, and was generally unable to relax knowing that my wife was at home trying to manage the lives of three little handfuls (two of them not so little anymore) single-handed. As Dads have done for untold generations, I took great pleasure in trying to find a few trinkets to bring home for everyone in the family.  For Baby C, I found a pop-up hand puppet of a raccoon in a lidded trash can.  Great fun for the little guy.  T got a little treasure chest with three Pirate puzzle games.  Arrrr.   J - our little bibliophile - got a book.  Keeping in mind that October is just around the corner, I got him \"13 Monsters Who Should Be Avoided\" by  Kevin Shortsleeve .  J was enthralled as I read him the book this morning.  He had laughed his way through the rhyme about the Three Toed Albanian Snoring Sock Bats, who nest in our sock drawers and are generally responsible for all the missing socks of the world.  He gasped as I read to him about the stinky Sissyfoos that dines on wet sneakers and unlucky toads.

Unfortunately, they can't read, so \"They mix up their parts till the mess is so muddled, they end up cross-eyed, confused and befuddled.\" But the best moment came when I read to him about the Mess Monsters: Mess Monsters, in general, should not be let in, Because once inside, Mess Monsters begin To tip every lamp and spill every mug, Tilt all the paintings and rumple each rug, Topple the trash can down the front stairs, Replace every light bulb with sticky peeled pears, Load the dishwasher with sport-fishing gear, Drape soggy spaghetti from the brass chandelier, Paint pudding-pie murals depicting a pig, Stick bubble-gum wads in your aunt's silver wig, Cut paper dolls out of your dinosaur poster, And pour maple syrup right in the toaster. Then the Mess Monster will suddenly shrug, Say, \"Sorry 'bout that,\" and give you a hug. But before the Mess Monster can help you to clean, He leaps on his scooter and flees from the scene! After reading this, I turned the page (to the one about Snurps that eat parked cars), but J stopped me and turned the page back.  He looked from the words to me.  Back to the picture, then back to me.  \"Daddy,\" he said, \"is  Baby C  a Mess Monster too?\" (Anyone who has seen C in the last 4-6 months would answer a resounding \"YES!\") And to think I left my wife alone with a Mess Monster for 6 days!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thebreakers.com/about_the_breakers/", "http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1998/monsters-1021.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SNcVF9-2qJI/AAAAAAAAAKY/SOS9PIlbxYE/s1600-h/51FWK58TQVL._SL500_AA240_.jpg"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/09/mess-monster.html", "title": "\nThe Mess Monster\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 25, 2008", "body": "\nA couple of days ago, Orac enticed us with an offer: Ask Jenny McCarthy a Question! (Steve Raises Hand, a la  Horshack  of \" Welcome Back Cotter \" fame) \"Ooh!, Ooh!, Ooh!\" I have a question for Jenny McCarthy!  I guess this one applies to Jim Carrey as well, as he has assumed the fatherhood role for young Evan McCarthy.  (Jenny and Jim are Mom and Dad.  Good for them, and I wish all three the very best in all things. But I certainly wish Jenny and Jim would stop promoting the ideal that  Toxic Autism is Bad .) My question is this: \"Jenny, have you considered the impact of your publicity-driven actions on the future self-image of Evan?\" (Consider:  Green our Vaccines rally, Oprah Winfrey appearances, Generation Rescue Board of Directors, etc) Let me explain why this is of concern.  Evan is a growing boy.  If we take you at your word, Evan is a recovered autistic.  He was autistic and now he is not autistic - he is typical.  Through your actions as a Mother Warrior, you have pulled your son from the brink of the abyss, and he is now free to pursue his life's dreams as a non-toxic, normal person.  Okay. So what happens - now that you have staked your professional reputation on his being absolutely \"typical\" - when he has some struggles at school?  If you take him to a birthday party with other kids his age and he is sitting off to the side, not really interested in their collective social excitement?  Or maybe a kid approaches him and asks what class he is in, only to be met with a very animated stream-of-consciousness about his preferred topic of conversation.  In that same setting, maybe the noise and excitement are a touch disconcerting and he begins to jump-spin (a combination of jumping and spinning that is somewhat \"dangerous to self\" and nearby \"others\"). You see, Jenny, most of us parents of kids who are on the autism spectrum have little ways of dealing with situations like this that fully allow for our kid's neurological/perceptual uniqueness while capitalizing on \"teachable moments\".  Jenny, we can do this because we have not staked our personal dignity or professional reputation on the expectation that our child  will not  exhibit autistic behaviors.  As an example, just today - after work -  I myself took J to a local pizza place for a classmate's birthday party and managed the  jump-spin  and  sitting-alone  scenarios.  I then took him to soccer practice where the  sensory/lying down  drive was dominant and lack of desire to  play with the team  was blatantly obvious.  All this with a boy who most casual observers would consider to appear as \"recovered\" as Evan may be. Fast forward a few years.  Evan is really growing up now.  He's hitting puberty, and is contending with all of the challenges that come with it.  Now he is really expected to fall in line with his peers.  Pack mentality rules.  Awkward or non-conformist behavior is met with derision.  Especially for a kid with such high-caliber social parents.  Especially for a kid whose Mom has been a professional \"Babe\".  How is Evan going to be dealing with the wrinkles of his (formerly) autistic neurology then?   Will his very publicly announced transition from the world of \" autism \" to the world of \" typicality \" (as documented by his \"warrior mom\" in books, magazines, and TV shows) cause any consternation at that point in his development?  I don't know the answer to any of these questions.  I'm not really expecting to get the answer here.  I do ask the reader of this blog to consider the term \"autism acceptance \" in the light of this post.  This term can be reduced down to admitting that a diagnosis is correct, but can also be utile in considering the overall set of factors that influence quality of life at various points in a person's development.   I wish Jenny McCarthy had factored in this second definition before deciding to exploit her beautiful son, Evan, as the First Child of autism recovery, and thereby set the stage for intense internal conflict in him for years to come.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/ask_jenny_mccarthy_a_question.php#more", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_Back_Kotter"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/09/jenny-mccarthy-and-autism-acceptance.html", "title": "\nJenny MCCarthy and Autism Acceptance\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 12, 2008", "body": "\n Saturday night marked the annual \"Hoedown\" at REINS, also known as \"The Happiest Place in the World\".  I have written about REINS previously, as it is the place we take both J and Baby C for horseback riding. REINS has one simple requirement for its riders - that they experience a disability.  For this reason, our middle son T has not been able to participate.  No matter, as he is well known around there for his wit and shiny attitude, and loves to go as much as his older brother.  His younger brother is not yet quite sure what to make of the place, but his most recent session went just a bit more smoothly that the prior ones. It was our great pleasure this year (my company, my family) to donate the fresh flower arrangements for all of the guest tables at the Hoedown.  I am fortunate enough to be in a leadership role in a company that is in the business of wholesale fresh flower distribution, and it occurred to me that providing bright, cheery flowers  for the all-important, annual fund-raising event is one way that we can give back after all the wonderful experiences we have had there over the years.  So for a few days leading into the event, several of my employees who have arrangement-design experience, led by their wonderful manager Leticia, prepared two different designs - one for the expensive \"Sponsorship\" tables, and another, smaller design for the other tables.  Keep in mind that this is an all-outdoor event, western-themed, with an Autumn twist due to its occurring on October, complete with a riding demonstration by some of the students/participants. After having spent that Saturday morning working, I hopped in the big ol' work truck - loaded with fresh flower arrangements - and drove it over to the site of the event, which is right on the grounds of REINS. With the help of Kaitlyn and Jessica - two lovely ladies who have not only taught J to ride horses but also have helped J and T with swimming lessons over two summers, and have generally become dear friends to our family - we placed all of the floral arrangements on the tables. I must admit, they did add a certain amount of charm to the whole event. Flowers aside, the main event of the Hoedown is the riding demonstration.  I'll tell you, once the demonstration is underway, there is rarely a dry eye in the place.  The lengths that some of these riders go to in order to participate here(not just for the Hoedown, but every week, all year long) is just ... inspirational. The first rider provided a fascinating counterpoint for our family, in particular.  You see, during this rider's introduction, it was mentioned that the  youngest rider is under two  and the  oldest rider is 93 years old !   Of course, the \"under two\" rider is our own son, Baby C.  The oldest is Millie, who also has the challenge of Scoliosis.  At 93, Millie is the epitome of inspiration for all us young whippersnappers who feel a little bit beat up after a long day of raising kids or conducting business. The next rider prompted Debbie, the emcee of the riding demonstration and owner/operator of REINS, to bring us all the way back from age 93 to age 5.  In spirit, anyway.   This rider suffers from Progeria, and her body is already experiencing many of the physically degenerative characteristics that typical people might undergo in their 50's.  And there she was, with she and her supporters encouraging her horse to a lengthy trot to finish her part of the demo.  And what a great moment to experience the synergy created by an engaged audience and a rider who is so genuinely and rightfully proud of her achievement. I realize that Hippotherapy (the benefits of riding horseback) lacks any data to support its use as a \"remedy\" for what ails people.  We can talk about core strength and balance, we can observe the bond that develops between some horses and riders.  We can call the riding routines \"life skills\" or \"positive reinforcement\".  All that is predictably clinical, despite the decidedly non-clinical setting, and utterly belies our lack of imagination in understanding what really happens at REINS. This is a community.  No one gives a darn about disabilities here.  Nobody is trying to cure anyone of anything.  I don't think \"warrior mothers\" like Jenny McCarthy would find very fertile ground here for convincing people that autism is some sort of tragic circumstance.   Everyone loves horses here,  as well as  people who may not be just like themselves.  Work gets done.  Funds are raised, without a lot of pomp and circumstance but with the help of the local community.   Young, angst-ridden adolescent volunteers who harbor the thought of complaining about the heat and the dust are silenced by self-comparisons to people who have much more than today's climatic conditions to worry about.  Adults and children alike find a deep-seated thrill in their mundane  tete-a-tete s with their equine compatriots. Even Dads who are feeling pinched by the responsibilities of raising three sons and trying to navigate a business through a difficult economic climate find reasons here to spread some Sunshine! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SPQXmvJLOiI/AAAAAAAAAKo/9xGMTbDFsnM/s1600-h/REINS+Hoedown+2008+088.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SPQZmN-sUWI/AAAAAAAAALA/otO7iv-vNEk/s1600-h/REINS+Hoedown+2008+073.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SPQYC-WxNWI/AAAAAAAAAKw/Qw7ETZuI2r0/s1600-h/REINS+Hoedown+2008+075.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SPQY5VyxXuI/AAAAAAAAAK4/5PBmOyecnVA/s1600-h/REINS+Hoedown+2008+081.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SPQlAVNryCI/AAAAAAAAALo/3sgQgQJgMsk/s1600-h/REINS+Hoedown+2008+072.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SPQaVj2HPDI/AAAAAAAAALI/w0P_FpJRsRE/s1600-h/REINS+Hoedown+2008+101.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SPQdr6MzABI/AAAAAAAAALY/GBXx17_PMQ4/s1600-h/REINS+Hoedown+2008+103.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SPQi55zZSqI/AAAAAAAAALg/Oek6mkauLfA/s1600-h/REINS+Hoedown+2008+076.jpg"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/10/spreading-some-sunshine.html", "title": "\nSpreading Some Sunshine\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 21, 2008", "body": "\nI have spent a great deal of time, at great benefit to myself, engaging autistic adults since my oldest son was diagnosed with autism in 2004. Aside from simply enjoying the exchanges, and from learning copious amounts about what living with autism may be like from an experiential standpoint, I have perpetually searched for meaningful things that could, hopefully, cause me to become a better parent to my son by their knowing. Firm conclusions that are somehow specific to autism have been elusive.  In fact, and as a polar opposite to the Jenny McCarthys of the world, I have found that parental approaches effective for autistic children are remarkably similar to parental approaches for neurotypical children.  Be patient.  Be kind.  Teach in a way that is effective.  Sublimate your own needs for the needs of your child.  Form a supportive community.  Roll with the proverbial punches.  Be prepared to lose a little sleep.  Maximize the fun moments, but know when to calm things down.  Expect yourself and your child to be disappointed and frustrated sometimes.  The list goes on, and is certainly familiar to anyone who has done their best to raise a child. But ... there is one thing that seems to be incredibly impactful in improving the quality of life for the autistic child/person.  This thing is debated from a tremendous number of angles, but in the endgame most folks agree upon its importance.  This thing is communication.  If I could wish one thing for all autistic people, including my own two sons who are on the spectrum, it is that they find satisfying ways to communicate that expand the boundaries of their interpersonal environments. My oldest son is an atypical communicator.  He is a boy who, upon casual observation, does not move or behave in such a way as to lead someone to believe he may not be neurotypical.  But, all it takes is a brief conversation with him to know you are dealing with someone special.  Community members who are strangers (ie. cashiers, librarians, friends' parents) are often \"thrown off\" by J's interactions - they simply don't know how to take him.  Still, he communicates effectively if not typically. My youngest son, however, is not communicating verbally.  Developmentally, this is not shocking as he is only 21 months old.  Lots of 21-month olds don't speak.  At the same time, he is not even showing the vaguest signs of verbal communication yet.   Knowing what we know about the importance of communication, we started C on a sign language program a full month before he was even diagnosed with autism.  That was in July.  It is now October and, guess what?  Baby C is signing reliably!  Only two words, but they are really important words for a 21-month old to know.  The first one is \"eat\". There could be no more fitting end to this post that taking Baby C's second sign and directing it right back at him: \"More, please!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SP6oWg3B0WI/AAAAAAAAAPs/HzwS5P3F5JA/s1600-h/more.jpg"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/10/more-please.html", "title": "\nMore, please!\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 6, 2009", "body": "\nWell ... hello again everyone.  Long time, no blog.   On with it, then. In the hubbub of daily life in the D household (and believe me when I tell you that a term that adequately describes our level of chaos has not yet been coined), it is exceedingly and unfortunately rare that focused, direct, one-on-one communication is able to take place.  It is very fortunate, therefore, that my 7-year-old, highly verbal, autism-spectrum son and I have established a new bedtime routine that provides that well-needed time.  T, my middle son, is also welcome to join in, but this is a routine that J thinks about now all day long, and simply will not do without.  This routine is well known in many households around the world, and is certainly not unique to us.  It is ...   Bedtime Stories . To understand why this simple topic  justifies a blog entry of its own, one must understand the stage of interest/learning/discovery/passion/focus that J is at right now.  I think of him as an intellectual  tuning fork  in a lot of ways; interacting with him is rewarding (and enjoyable and fun) on so many levels (especially - as many \"autism\" parents can relate to - being previously told that his likelihood of developing valid communication aptitude is very low) and yet also rigorous by virtue of needing to  resonate  with his particular and fairly demanding communication style. Anyway, a few weeks ago I settled into a certain genre of storytelling that is based on modifying fables (\"the moral of  this  story is...\") to fit the theme of a young Indian Brave named Redwing.  Actually, it began as Redwing - largely due to my ignorance of Native American nomenclature and resulting cliched approach to inventing a name (let alone the Detroit NHL franchise of the same name) - but very quickly changed to a new name.  Me:  \"This is a story about a little Indian Brave named Redwing.  One day Redwing...\" J (interrupting):  \"But my favorite color is Blue\" Me:  \"Okay, blue is a great color.  I like orange, myself.  But this is a story about Redwing and the big archery contest...\" J:  \"Awww.  But my favorite color is blue.  Why is Redwing Red?\" Me:  \"Redwing is his name, but the important thing is that he needs to get ready for the big archery contest!  So Red wing decided one day...\" J (interrupting):  \"If he was blue, then he would be my favorite color, you know.\" *pause, as I consider...* Me:  \"Once, there was a little Indian Brave named Bluewing...\"  and off we went - a tradition was born.  Now we have run into another unexpected issue.  J now recognizes when I am using an analogy to his own life to try to create a teachable moment.   Example:  We recently took a trip to Hawaii.  My wife and Baby C were unable to go, depsite the existing travel plans, due to Baby C's own issues (he was  diagnosed with autism in August ).  J had very significant homesickness issues due to, in his own words, Mommy and Baby C not being with us.  After we returned, I adapted a Bluewing story to mimic this set of circumstances.  I very cleverly wove a tale about how Bluewing was going \"whale-watching\" on an island, and how he would be honored to travel with his father and all the fun adventures they would have, etc, etc.  At the end of the story, to which he listened with his characterstic stoic intensity, he immediately asked, \"Why did you tell a story about me being homesick in Hawaii?\"   Hmph. I explained the value of analogy and how it helps us to understand difficult situations in our own lives, and I think that resonated with him.  Because, ever since, he will certainly point out when I am inferring an analogy but he has no real objection to it.  In fact, he may have warmed to the idea that maybe the Ol' Man has something relevant to offer his little 7-year old body of wisdom.   And I can't help but think of this bedtime story routine as a reasonable extension of Social Stories, which seemed to help J so much from ages 3-5.   Social stories presented J with digestible information in the form of a simple storyline accompanied by little pictures (i.e. \"going to school\" or \"visiting Grandma and Poppa\"), whereas Bedtime Stories seem to be fulfilling a more advanced set of needs in terms of a budding sense of ethics and morals (Bluewing is a pretty upstanding little Indian Brave) in a format that is easily digestible due to the routine and mutually-agreed-upon format.  All of which serves as yet another reminder that, in many ways, raising a child (or two) on the autism spectrum is not wholly different from raising a typically developing child.  A little understanding and acomodation does go a long way... Tonight, I told J that he needs to tell me a Bedtime Story. That from now on, Tuesday night is the night that he has to 'reciprocate'.  Do you doubt his grasp of the nature of the analogy? J:  \"There once was an Indian Brave named Orangewing.  (big smile;  \"because that's your favorite color, Dad\").   He knew he had to go to work.  But he was sick.  So he went to work sick, because he always goes to work. \"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuning_fork"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/01/analogy-works-both-ways.html", "title": "\nAnalogy Works Both Ways\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, January 10, 2009", "body": "\nOver the past year, in particular, we have been trying to help J - now 7 years old - to find some physical activities he enjoys.  J, like many autistic people, has a limited range of foods that he eats.  Though we do what we can to enhance the nutritional value of his diet, and we have employed numerous strategies to reduce the gag-reflex that accompanies so many different kinds of food, J simply does not, at this age, have an ideal diet.  J's limited diet issues are exacerbated by another tendency, or characteristic, that it seems to me is also quite common amongst autistics, and that is that he prefers cerebral pursuits to physical activities.  We recognize the importance of leading a healthful life in terms of impact on physical as well as emotional well-being, and have therefore been \"signing up\" J for a range of activities. Over the past year, these activities have included  Tee-ball .  This was not a big hit (please ignore the obnoxious pun), though it is difficult to determine exactly why J never seemed to get into it.  I can say that his younger brother, T, on the same team, also did not derive a lot of pleasure or interest from it.  It may be an age thing.  In the summer, we enrolled J in Tae Kwan Do.  There, we definitely found something to his liking.  The more individual nature of it, as well as the rigidity of the routines and the \"demanding\" nature of the instruction seems to really jibe with J's mentality.  In the Fall, J joined a soccer team.  This had mixed results - he enjoyed the practices due to some of the practice games we would play (i.e. Sharks and Minnows), but during games it was not uncommon for him to simply lie down in the middle of the action.  The ultra-bright mornings were not ideal for him in terms of light sensitivity, and he could often be found during his \"breaks\" from action reading thick books in the foldup chair on the sideline instead of cheering his teammates on.  Aside from these structured activities, J fully enjoys games like \"Monster Tag\" and wrestling with Daddy.  And he loves a day at the beach, something we can do with regularity during the summer now that he is over his aversion to the movement of the waves.  Surfing is definitely on the slate for the little grommet this summer (maybe Dad can learn a little too!).  He also loves to swim in our pool, and has been involved in a  therapeutic horsemanship program  for over three years. So at this point - at age 7 - J's physical activity and nutritional intake is a mixed-bag at best, and certainly could use some \"catching up\" to his pretty remarkable academic achievements.  Enter Wii Fit. When I first read about the Wii Fit and its remarkable balance board, I knew it would be a perfect match for J and the way he derives enjoyment from his activities.  As I write this blog, J and his two brothers are around the corner engaging with the Wii system and working up a good sweat doing it! You see, the Wii Fit allows J - and everyone in the family - to create a Mii, which is a little on-screen mini-me of each of us.  Once created, you step on the board and the system takes your height and weight and establishes a baseline BMI (body mass index).  It also measures your overall balance and body posture.  It then allows you to set short or long term fitness goals, specifically addressing the areas you would like.  Once you have completed the setup, it records your time spent in the \"time bank\", and also regularly re-weighs and tests balance, updating your progress vs. goals.  The player then picks aerobic (running, hula hoops), strength training, balance activities (ski slalom, ski long jump), and yoga for posture.  The more you play, the more different games you unlock.  All of these features are precisely conducive to J's unique way of learning.  First of all, it is engaging without being overly demanding from a social standpoint (unlike team sports).  It is unforgivingly rigid in its repetitive nature - it behaves the same way each time.  This avoids J's sometime-anxiety about variable things.  It has clear, easy-to-understand goals, which play to J's learning style.  It disguises physical activity in what seems more of a cerebral pursuit with the use of points, stars, levels of achievement, and gradual unlocking of new activities.  Frankly, it is an ideal method for J to improve his physical fitness.  Interestingly, since beginning this (at Christmas), J has expressed a higher level of interest in eating more healthfully (even though this does not overcome his extreme sensitivity to certain foods and the way they elicit his gag reflex). I realize that not all autistic children or adults have would be able to play Wii Fit.  I also realize that not all families or individuals can own or access one.  But the bottom line is this:  I can't recommend the Wii Fit highly enough for any individual who would like to help them self or a loved one to improve their physical well-being in a fun and positive way!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/01/wii-would-like-to-play.html", "title": "\nWii Would Like To Play...\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 12, 2009", "body": "\nWhen I became aware that the Vaccine Court (VICP) was to soon announce their decisions on the three test-cases for the Autism Omnibus Proceedings, I thought about what I might write - indeed if I might write - about the outcome.  Having closely followed and carefully tried to understand the various expert positions and arguments, I felt quite certain that the petitioners had very little chance of establishing causation.  At the same time, I anticipated a profound sense of sorrow for the thousands of families involved, families whom I feel have been preyed upon by a group of unethical, malfeasant physicians and alt-med practitioners.  How could I express this feeling in a way that is respectful to the families involved without coming across with an \"I told you so\" posture? Fortunately, I don't have to come up with anything, for Special Master Hastings wrote a poignant and powerful conclusion to his decision on the Cedillo portion of the AOP.  The conclusion sums up perfectly how I feel about this dark chapter in autism's timeline. CONCLUSION The record of this case demonstrates plainly that Michelle Cedillo and her family have been though a tragic and painful ordeal. I had the opportunity, in the courtroom during the evidentiary hearing, to meet and to observe both of Michelle\u2019s parents, and a number of other family members as well. I have also studied the records describing Michelle\u2019s medical history, and the efforts of her family in caring for her. Based upon those experiences, I am deeply impressed by the very loving, caring, and courageous nature of the Cedillo family. Those family members clearly have done a wonderful job of coping with Michelle\u2019s conditions, and in caring for her with great love. I admire them greatly for their dedication to Michelle\u2019s welfare. Nor do I doubt that Michelle\u2019s parents and relatives are sincere in their belief that the MMR vaccine played a role in causing Michelle\u2019s devastating disorders. Certainly, the mere fact that Michelle\u2019s autistic symptoms first became evident to her family during the months after her MMR vaccination might make them wonder about a possible causal connection. Further, the Cedillos have read about physicians who profess to believe in a causal connection between the MMR vaccine and both autism and chronic gastrointestinal problems. They have visited at least one physician, Dr. Krigsman, who has explicitly opined that Michelle\u2019s own chronic gastrointestinal symptoms are MMR-caused. And they have even been told that a medical laboratory has positively identified the presence of the persisting vaccine-strain measles virus in Michelle\u2019s body, years after her vaccination. After studying the extensive evidence in this case for many months, I am convinced that the reports and advice given to the Cedillos by Dr. Krigsman and some other physicians, advising the Cedillos that there is a causal connection between Michelle\u2019s MMR vaccination and her chronic conditions, have been very wrong. Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment. Nevertheless, I can understand why the Cedillos found such reports and advice to be believable under the circumstances. I conclude that the Cedillos filed this Program claim in good faith. Thus, I feel deep sympathy and admiration for the Cedillo family. And I have no doubt that the families of countless other autistic children, families that cope every day with the tremendous challenges of caring for autistic children, are similarly deserving of sympathy and admiration. However, I must decide this case not on sentiment, but by analyzing the evidence. Congress designed the Program to compensate only the families of those individuals whose injuries or deaths can be linked causally, either by a Table Injury presumption or by a preponderance of causation-infact evidence, to a listed vaccination. In this case the evidence advanced by the petitioners has fallen 173 far short of demonstrating such a link. Accordingly, I conclude that the petitioners in this case are not entitled to a Program award on Michelle\u2019s behalf. /s/ George L.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "body": "\nHere's a \" press release \", issued on that highly respected stalwart of news wire services, \"ChiroEco.com\", that trumpets: \"...a world-class board of advisors that bring extraordinary expertise concerning autism spectrum disorder care and represent the many different facets of recovery. This board oversees \u201cHope for Autism\u201d the first BioNutritional Care certification program ever designed specifically for chiropractors.\" This \"board of advisers\" is the board of one American Chiropractic Autism Board.  Sounds very official!  How encouraging! Or maybe not ... As a friend recently put it, \"Health Care Fraud is a booming business, and the bad guys know all about autism.\" Let's begin with a quick trip over to the  American Board of Medical Specialties  website, which is the \"gold standard\" for physician certification.  If a \"board\" is not listed there, its not legit.  A quick search for 'American Chiropractic Autism Board' and 'ACAB' turns up ...... nothing!  So let's understand at the outset that we are dealing with a \"...world-class board of advisors...\" that has no regard or respect for established accreditation/certification with mainstream medical standards of practice.  But that's nothing new for the cottage autism \"cure\" industry,  is it ? So the ABMS search came up empty.  How else can we validate the credibility of this seemingly remarkable group that is in a position to \" [meet] ... the demand of parents who are desperately searching for a physician to help their child recover;...\" Conveniently, the press release has listed on the bottom a link to their  very own website !  A quick perusal unveils their \"board members\", which turns out to be a veritable pantheon of purveyors of quackery.  To wit: Andrew Moulden, M.D., Ph.D. (watch about 2 minutes of  this video  - recorded at a 9/11 conspiracy theorist march, no less - for all you need to know about this guy). Boyd Haley, Ph.D., the man who has concocted and patented a  home-tested chelator  to market to parents of autistic children. William Shaw, Ph.D, who is director of the  Great Plains Laboratory .  This is the primary \"mail-order\" lab that generates deeply misleading and flawed reports on heavy metals contamination among autistic children, primarily by comparing \"provoked\" urine samples to \"standardized\" measurements. And the \"Sisters Tocco\" - Mary and Renee. Read on... Renee is a (surprise!) DAN! doc.  Hey, don't they require a medical degree for that?  Uh, no.  Mary is an \"independent vaccine researcher\".  She sells a DVD on her website -  childhoodshots.com  - titled \"Are Vaccines Safe?\"    Let's review for a minute.  What we have here is the ACAB, made up of known hucksters, 9/11 conspiracists, anti-vaccine zealots, DAN! docs and other alt-med-gurus, backed by those who operate the bogus testing labs as well as someone who sells a home-brewed chelating agent masquerading as an FDA-approved \"nutritional supplement\" (OSR by Boyd Haley).  Can the rabbit hole of quackery get any deeper than this?  Every single one of these players has something to sell you.  Speaking engagements, lab tests, DVD's, online consultations, BioNutritional \"Hope for Autism\" programs, supplements, chelators, certifications.  And, notably,  not one single peer-reviewed, documented case of even one single autistic child benefitting in even one single way from anything they sell !  Its a grand scheme, and who is falling for it?  Look no further than the original press release itself, as it so callously labels its target market: \"The benefits of being a certified \u201cHope for Autism\u201d doctor include:     \u2022 Having the solution to the number 1 healthcare crisis affecting children; \u2022 Meeting the  demand of parents who are desperately searching for a physician to help their child recover ;    \u2022 Being a part of the movement of chiropractors who are dedicated to healing our nation; and    \u2022 Increasing patient base complimenting autism care and chiropractic, allowing for the best opportunity of recovery.\" Unbelieveable, isn't it?  Un-freakin'-believable.  Picking up the pieces here, let's just take a quick look back at the purpose of the press release to begin with (believe it or not, we haven't even discussed that yet). The purpose is to advertise a 3-day seminar.  This seminar does NOT  include the words 'autism', 'chiropractic', 'nutritional', or even 'health' in its title.  It is actually called \"The 2009 International Vaccine Risk Symposium\".  I'm not making this up - its right there on the press release.  The final two days of the 'symposium' will be spent training chiropractors on the newly minted \"Hope for Autism\" (HFA - nice pun, eh?) certification that promises to: \"... equip chiropractors to responsibly address autism, ADD, learning disabilities, and other neurological developmental problems using BioNutritional Care.\" Just two days, and they are miraculously suited to cure children of autism and other neurological problems! So the next time you see media reports offering a 'balanced' view of the vaccine controversy, please consider that these are the type of people that populate the anti-vaccine side.  This is the sales machine that so actively pursues, to use their own words, parents who are \"desperately\" searching for solutions.  And these are the tactics they use.  It is One Dad's Opinion that this is shameful exploitation and needs to be exposed for what it is.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chiroeco.com/chiropractic/news/7212/52/Chiropractor-forms-American-Chiropractic-Autism-Board/", "http://www.abms.org/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=783", "http://www.americanchiropracticautismboard.com/", "http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=MPOPRnYjF0s", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/170/", "http://www.greatplainslaboratory.com/home/eng/home.asp", "http://childhoodshots.com/Preview_DVD_.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/01/buyer-beware-acab.html", "title": "\nBuyer Beware - ACAB\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 29, 2008", "body": "\nIn today's news, one could not help but notice the appalling new publicity campaign initiated by the radical group,  PETA . In this campaign, currently propagated via billboards in Newark, NJ, the following message is delivered: Yes, that's right, this ad campaign chooses to associate autism with a frowning face in a cereal bowl.  The entire ill-conceived concept is based on the ridiculous concept that drinking cow's milk causes autism. *sigh* Okay, lets begin with the \"science\".  The brilliant minds at PETA have apparently been hearing as much as the rest of us recently in the major media about how the GFCF elimination diet can initiate a recovery from autism (hey, thanks Jenny McCarthy!).  While I am not going to cast aspersion on or otherwise debate what parents will attest to as they put their kids on this elimination diet, I will take my usual position and refer you to the science.  Yes, this theory has been put to the test.  Here are some direct results, as well as results of some academic reviews: J Autism Dev Disord.  2006 Apr;36(3):413-20. Excerpt from abstract:  \"Group data indicated no statistically significant findings even though several parents reported improvement in their children. \" Cochrane Database Syst Rev.  2008 Apr 16;(2):CD003498. Excerpt from abstract:  \" Research has shown of high rates of use of complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) for children with autism including gluten and/or casein exclusion diets. Current evidence for efficacy of these diets is poor.\" Pediatr Nurs.  2007 Mar-Apr;33(2):138-43. Excerpt from abstract:   \"Dietary treatment of children with behavioral disorders has had wide public appeal and been a source of controversy since the 1920's. Yet, to date, there is little empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of dietary restrictions in treating child psychiatric disorders, in particular, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\" And of course the most recent study, which accentuates the risk of the assumed-to-be-harmless GFCF diet: J Autism Dev Disord.  2008 May;38(5):848-56. Excerpt from abstract:  \" Bone development, casein-free diet use, supplements, and medications were assessed for 75 boys with autism or autism spectrum disorder, ages 4-8 years ... The 12% of the boys on casein-free diets had an overall % deviation of -18.9 +/- 3.7%, nearly twice that of boys on minimally restricted or unrestricted diets (-10.5 +/- 1.3%, p especially if they are on casein-free diets. So what the he**, you may ask, is PETA doing?  Have they gone mad?  Well, we all know they were never sane to begin with and are basically just a charicature of an important socially-conscious movement.  But they lead off their  press release  about the campaign with the following statement: \"In light of two scientific studies that link milk consumption to autism in children and a third that establishes that the Newark metropolitan area has the highest rate of autism among 14 regions studied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, PETA has just unveiled in the city a brand-new billboard parodying a ubiquitous milk ad.\" Whoa!  They sure have done their homework!  Or ... have they? It took a bit of digging to come up with the two studies they are referring to.  Here is the first, conveniently linked to from the PETA blog: Panminerva Med.  1995 Sep;37(3):137-41. Excerpt from the abstract:  \" Our results lead us to hypothesise a relationship between food allergy and infantile autism as has already been suggested for other disturbances of the central nervous system.\" Lets discuss that for a moment.  Oftentimes, we hear people in the autism community with the rallying cry \"Science has ignored us!\"  or \"Let us see the science!\"  I hold the opinion that the scientific method is alive and well - and generously funded - in autism etiological research.  It simply has not delivered clear-cut, easily digestible results to date.  This study may be a good case of that.  As the authors at the University of Rome state, the results are good for the formulation of a hypothesis.  They  are not , and the authors never claimed them to be,  conclusive . Since the study was completed -  13 years ago  - the hypothesis has been put to the test.  To date, we can only say that the data do not support the hypothesis that dietary intake of casein is a causative factor in the development of autism. Here is the second study they rely on: Nutr Neurosci.  2002 Sep;5(4):251-61. Excerpt from abstract:  \" A randomly selected diet and control group with 10 children in each group participated. Observations and tests were done before and after a period of 1 year. The development for the group of children on diet was significantly better than for the controls.\" First off, this was a single-blind study.  Secondly, the control group and subject group had all of 10 kids each.  The general research/treatment community was willing to set this one aside 6 years ago when it was released, so its hard to figure why PETA wants to dredge it up now. Or is it? You see, it is really quite clear what PETA is doing, and there is a word for it - EXPLOIT: ex\u00b7ploit           var interfaceflash = new LEXICOFlashObject ( \"http://cache.lexico.com/d/g/speaker.swf\", \"speaker\", \"17\", \"18\", \"<a href=\"\\\" target=\"\\\"><img src=\"\\\" border=\"\\\" /></a>\", \"6\");   interfaceflash.addParam(\"loop\", \"false\");   interfaceflash.addParam(\"quality\", \"high\");   interfaceflash.addParam(\"menu\", \"false\");   interfaceflash.addParam(\"salign\", \"t\");   interfaceflash.addParam(\"FlashVars\", \"soundUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fcache.lexico.com%2Fdictionary%2Faudio%2Fluna%2FE04%2FE0416200.mp3\");   interfaceflash.write();      / \u026ak\u02c8spl\u0254\u026at /   Pronunciation Key  -  Show Spelled Pronunciation [ ik- sploit ]   1. to utilize, esp. for profit; turn to practical account:  to exploit a business opportunity.        2. to use selfishly for one's own ends:  employers who exploit their workers.        3. to advance or further through exploitation; promote Yes, PETA is engaging in  exploitation  of the autistic community to serve their needs, to further their agenda, to \" use selfishly for one's own ends \". As the father of two boys on the autism spectrum, I am deeply bothered by the callous exploitation exhibited by these self-righteous people. How, as an autistic adult, would you feel as you saw this ad for the first time?  Would you feel marginalized?  Degraded?  Would the \"sad face\" build your self-image, or chip away at it?   Would you feel like a valued contributor to society, or a \"burden\" who need not exist were it not for kids drinking milk? Perhaps in a future post I will get into the issue of how bogus the New Jersey prevalence figures are in relation to other states (an important aspect of their ridiculous campaign).  Or maybe I'll jump into the dubious - no, discredited - nature of the opioid excess theory of autism that the entire casein house of cards is built upon.  Or maybe I'll just discuss the basic concepts of causation v. correlation.  In any case, I cannot reach nearly as many people as the fools at PETA will this week in Newark.  Shame, PETA, shame. I dunno, folks.  At times it seems that the idiocy gets ahead of us and I feel like not much we can do will really create a better world for autistic people.  I hope the Autism Hub, ASAN, and like-minded folks will remain aware of travesties such as this PETA embarrassment and provide a united front to counter open bigotry of this nature.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 22, 2008", "body": "\nOkay, I am finally peeved enough about Michael Savage's inane rants about autism over the past few days to invest a few moments' time in writing about it.  The fact that this has been discussed exhaustively elsewhere bears no inhibiting influence on my need to write about it - I need to get this off my chest and move on. Perhaps I have been slower to react to this due to the fact that I have listened to Michael Savage's talk show over the years.  I have a lengthy drive home, and for the sake of diversity I often change up the listening material I garner from the radio.  Someday I hope to be able to afford  these products  and therefore to while away the car time in a state of continuing-education bliss.    In the meantime, I have spent too many hours listening to the likes of this blowhard. So when I initially heard about the controversial statements he had made, I said to myself, \"Self, this is no big deal.  Savage insults somebody at this level of magnitude virtually every day.  Its his  shtick , nobody will pay attention to this garbage.  Plus, if you put virtually anyone in front of a microphone for three hours a day, every day, foot will insert into mouth at some point.\" Self was wrong.  When Savage went on his little diatribe about autism diagnoses being a fraud, a play for the welfare of the state, the autism community and the greater disability community came unglued.  Deservedly so. So, Michael Savage went into damage control mode.  Or at least his deranged little version of damage control, which reeks of conspiracy theory, paranoia, and a complete lack of respect or understanding of autistic people and those who love them.  I maintain that Ben Stiller is a modern-day comic icon due to his ability to play roles that just make us cringe to watch.  Witnessing Savage's self-inflicted, ego-driven tailspin was every bit as cringe-producing as anything Stiller has acted out on camera.  Though I missed the Talk Show Tour de Farce that occurred last night as a means to defuse the situation, I did tune in to The Savage Nation  for the last time today  to hear this guy sputter his way through what is hopefully his Swan Song as a radio personality.  I was utterly fascinated to hear him spin his web of obfuscation and red herrings as a means of deflecting attention from the ugly truth of his bigotry on this topic.  Here is how the reasoning goes: Michael Savage believes that the APA, the AAP, and Big Pharma all conspired to have the diagnostic criteria broadened in the 90's.  This was done in an effort to promote the sale of more SSRI's (anti-depressants, anti-anxiety). Pediatricians are envious of other doctors, such as plastic surgeons, due to the disparity in income (does anyone see echoes of anti-vax sentiment in these statements, hmmm?).  \"They\", meaning the AAP, therefore conspired with drug makers to invent this new Dx so that both groups could increase their revenue and profit margins.  ( Apparently Savage is not aware that pediatricians are not involved directly in the diagnosis of, or treatment of, autism ). Parents are vacuous, drooling, knuckle-dragging, self-centered morons who buy this line from the aforementioned triumvirate and submit their kids to a parade of narcotics in the name of controlling their behavior.  These same parents take no responsibility for the behaviors of the kids they brought into the world, allowing them to scream and carry on.  Nothing a good beatin' wouldn't solve, right Dr. Savage? Do you get the picture he is painting?  As I listened today, he had the gall to say (and I am paraphrasing - this is not a direct quote): \"You should be lauding me as a hero, not reviling me - for bringing this subject to your attention.  I am the defender of the defenseless!\" Can you believe this guy?  He actually discounts an entire category of people, is excoriated for it in the national media, then tries to recast himself as some sort of martyr who only has the kids' best interests in mind! Most readers of this blog (all 17 of you) have the critical thinking skills to know a Purveyor of Woo when you see one, right?  Well, as further example of Michael Savage's debased version of critical thinking skills, let's just examine a few of the \"headlines\" from MichaelSavage.com, shall we? BREAKING HEALTH NEWS The Life-Saver Heart Surgeons Never Tell You About This 23-cent miracle could save your life! *** TURN A $200 INVESTMENT INTO $1 MILLION *** OUTRAGE!! Billion dollar drug company found a cure for cancer ... and TOLD NO ONE!!! They hid the cure to sell you more drugs! *** (or, perhaps most telling of all...) PROTECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH! Support the Michael Savage Legal Defense Fund (Donations are not tax deductible) Does this give you an idea of who we are dealing with, and why I assumed the whole thing would receive no airtime whatsoever?  Nobody really takes this guy seriously, or so I thought. I truly became outraged only today when listening to this bigot (as opposed to observing the commentary on the internet) made me realize that many of his listeners will actually buy into and support this line of crap.  Autism is known as \"the hidden disability\", and its subtle presentation in many people can cause extensive problems in day-to-day interactions.  My friend,  Bev , is the best I know at capturing this aspect of autism and presenting in a fashion that makes it easy for people like me to understand.  She exquisitely and poignantly describes some of the challenges and issues that my son will be facing as life progresses, and thousands of others like him.  Shame on Michael Savage for using his bully pulpit to try to make life more challenging for my son.  Shame on him for discounting the struggles of autistic people.  Shame on him for ignoring the existence of autistic adults (they're not all little kids, ya know?).  Shame on him for scoffing at the need to accommodate and support people with special needs.

{"date": "Sunday, June 22, 2008", "body": "\nYes, all is quiet today on the Western Front.  But not for long... You see, as I write this post there are Autism Hub bloggers on the way to San Diego.  From 2 countries, from 3 states we are converging at University of San Diego to participate in and present to the \"Work With Me, Not On Me\" conference. At this conference, there will be discussion of all kinds of aspects of Autism, with an emphasis on how we can provide appropriate and effective education and supports to autistics over their entire lifespan. Issues of movement, of language, of societal inclusion, of self-image and self-esteem, of fulfilling potential - all of these will be discussed, with respect for autistics as a guiding principle.  While I understand the need to look at many different facets of autism and ways to promote a positive outcome for autistic individuals, I am proud to be contributing to this school of thought as I feel it can directly benefit autistics in the long term.  There are those who disagree with the importance of toning down the rhetoric, of using positive terms, of emphasizing strengths, of dispelling myths about autism.  I submit that we can accomplish these goals without ignoring the challenges of autistics, and while fully respecting the efforts at overcoming the myriad disabling aspects of autism.  My good friend,  Bev , may have put it best when she wrote in an open letter to parents: \"But I am not your enemy. If you have a child on the spectrum and are hoping to cure him or her, hoping to get rid of the autism, I don\u2019t want to argue with you. Most likely, you and I don\u2019t even use the word \u201cautism\u201d to mean the same thing. If you are one of these parents working to change your child, know that I am working, too. If your quest to change the course of autism fails, perhaps the quest to change societal attitudes will fare better. In which case, your autistic child might have a less hostile world to live in. That is why I do this.\" Thanks for that, Bev. So today, then, is a quiet day (all quiet...) that precedes a whirlwind of activity.  I have always been a huge fan of quiet days around the house, and the proverbial apple seems to have not fallen far from the tree.  A little while ago, I walked by J's bedroom and saw the following scene: Apparently, he is going to read all of those books.   There are probably 30 books there.  Don't put it past him - he devours books at an amazing rate. Some other members of the family can't even muster the energy required to be read  to .  Evidence, Baby C: So I will continue to work on the various presentations and discussions we will be part of at USD over the course of the day, my fellow bloggers will complete their journeys, and tomorrow we will converge and hope to begin to help some parents, self-advocates, and professionals understand who we are, what we stand for, and why we do what we do.  Understanding, of course, that this group is anything but homogenous and represents a huge diversity of opinions and emphasis on different topics. We also may have a surprise in store.  More on that later. It occurs to me that over the next few days there may be many new visitors to the Autism Hub and to this blog.  For those newcomers, here is a brief tour of some good posts from this week that I consider \"recommended reading\": Joel Smith  writes about how certain autistic strengths may, or may not, translate into employable skills. Alex  blogs about his new personal best in 5K. Amanda Baggs  discusses some difficult communication issues. Kristina Chew  has numerous good posts this week - I would recommend this one about the importance of riding a bike. Kev  writes an Open Letter to those who aggressively promote the vaccine hypothesis. Club 166  gives a day in the life of the typical autism Dad.  Notice its a pretty good day. Bev  recommends some new PECS cards. Estee  celebrates her son moving to 1st grade.  This hits home, as J also finished K this year.  He tells everybody all about it - I mean everybody.   Not much fluff, just in a loud voice with a sidelong glance - \"I graduated Kindergarten!\".  This is currently his pat response to any question asked in public by a member of the community. Michelle Dawson  asks why Autism Speaks seems to have trouble with epidemiological figures. Ari  asks for input for the Autistic Adults Planning Committee. There is more, so much more for people to learn about from reading these pages. I'd like for any interested Hub Blogger to consider pulling your favorite post, on whatever topic you wish, and re-post it tomorrow.  I have reason to believe that we may have a good number of people wanting to take their first look at what we have to say, and it seems that this might be a good opportunity to put our proverbial best foot forward.  If you would like to do so, please re-post your favorite blog entry sometime tomorrow, the earlier the better.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SF6YooSK6WI/AAAAAAAAAJE/CnqsvgglDUU/s1600-h/a2j_DSCN2116.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SF6Z7i6FXrI/AAAAAAAAAJM/Sr8kCIsXMaU/s1600-h/a2j_DSCN2114.jpg", "http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/?p=325", "http://therunman.blogspot.com/2008/06/deltaware-5k-personal-best.html", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=544", "http://www.autismvox.com/freedom-of-movement-the-importance-of-riding-a-bike/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=890#comment-51197", "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/06/mud-therapy.html", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/06/pecs-they-overlooked.html", "http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/2008/06/he-did-it.html", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2008/06/epidemiology-of-autism-speaks.html", "http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2008/06/autistic-adults-planning-committee.html"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/06/all-quiet-on-western-front.html", "title": "\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 12, 2008", "body": "\nThere is power in the written and the spoken word. There is perhaps even more power to be found in the  introspective  use of language. This self-conversation, regardless of what form (words or pictures), language, or stage of development it occurs in, will have a significant impact on not only our choice of language when we do communicate, but also on our overall view of the world. As an aside to this, I believe that all of us carry on this internal self-communication, regardless of our ability to indicate this communication to others. This is an important concept for me to present to you, as it is a foundational belief that dictates a lot of my other views of those whose are autistic in such a way that they are unable to speak or, in some cases, communicate via virtually any means at all with others. In the world of functional behavioral analysis and resulting behavior modification techniques (which combine to form ABA), there are several commonly used terms which collectively can be referred to as the vernacular of the profession. Without discriminating against those who work in this profession, without assigning value-based judgments on those who have, or might, or will use these terms, and while considering the clinical and functional value of these terms (at least as intended) lets review some of the language and present some alternatives as to how we could think of/say the same thing: \"He has shown a 'splinter skill' in regards to his use of the computer mouse.\" He likes to spend time on the computer. \"She has a tendency to go 'off task' frequently.\" She's taking a break. \"He is 'perseverating' on certain toys at the expense of other 'imaginative play'.\" This kid is a world-class 'Cars' fan! \"Her episodes of 'non-compliance' are increasing during the lunch hour.\" She is taking a stand that she wants a salad with Italian dressing. Or that the afternoon sun is too bright on that side of the room that we always make her sit. \"His 'episodic severity' has increased significantly since we changed his room.\" His former roommate reminded him of home because he looked so much like his brother. And they hugged a lot - the new roommate doesn't do that. \"Ongoing 'food aversion' issues make mealtime such a challenge.\" She recognizes that a lot of dairy affects her digestive tract and results in discomfort, so she has decided to only eat dairy for breakfast. \"He has 'regressed'. He used to play chess every day and now just throws the pieces on the floor.\" Ever since his long-time chess-playing partner died, his loneliness is intensified each time he sits at the chess table. I could go on, but perhaps you see the point. Can we, as a community of autistic people and those who love them, presume competence at all times when considering/interacting with those who are unable to communicate in a way that we can easily understand? Yes, we can. And I think that carefully reviewing our language, our words, our internal dialogue and the external result of it, can provide a great place to start.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/01/words-matter.html", "title": "\nWords Matter\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 18, 2009", "body": "\nSome of you have been asking how Baby C is doing these days.  I appreciate your questions and concerns.  Many readers here know that Baby C was  determined to be autistic  back in August.   At the time, even though it was the second such diagnosis we had experienced as parents, and even though we are generally at peace with autism and all that goes along with it from a young family's perspective, and even though we were much more 'equipped' with information than the first time around, we still had great concerns about Baby C and his outcome. I, for one, fully realize that autism is a different experience for different people.  Some are more significantly affected by the disabling aspects of autism.  Some are in environments that, combined with their autistic characteristics make things difficult.  There are rough spots over the lifespan.  Some have challenges or discomforts that their communication differences make very difficult to convey and to request help for.   Some have co-occurring cognitive or physical disabilities.  Some just frankly want to be neurotypical.  The list goes on and on.   Autism is not \"all good\", and as parents my wife and I worry all the time about Baby C and what challenges lie ahead for him.  That goes for both of his brothers too, as with any parents and kids, but for Baby C and his older brother J, we have the added concerns of autism. As of now, Colin is just a happy, growing boy.  He has strong likes and dislikes, he is kind of obnoxious most of the time due to pretty constant 'loudness', and his happy moments shine brightly.  During his first 12-16 months of life, there were precious few happy moments.  He was, quite simply, the most challenging child I have ever met, seen, or even heard of.  He almost brought us to our knees with his perpetual, um, er, ....  discomfort with the world around him.  It is a tremendous relief to see the improvement in his demeanor and enjoyment of himself and our family. So here are a few pictorial updates of little Baby C (who is not really a baby anymore). Fall comes late in Southern California, and these leaves just fell from our Mulberry tree over the last three weeks.  Baby C loves when Mom rakes them into a leaf-pile! C just had his 2nd birthday this past week!  In our family, on the first birthday, the baby gets to \"dig in\" to their birthday cake with full gusto and no rules.  In the case of Baby C, he showed utterly no interest in his cake on that first birthday.  So we decided to let him have a chance at Round 2, and he certainly appreciated the offer.  Note how our resident canines uderstand the concept of 'positioning' as they hope for some scraps to hit floor.  Believe me when I tell you that their patience is rewarded more often than not. Speaking of the dogs, any mention of Baby C would be incomplete without also caling to attention his best buddy - Marley.  Marley is the Rottweiler/Lab mix on your right in this photo.  He is still very much a puppy, albeit a 100-lb+ puppy.  And he still tips the scales a few pounds lighter than old man  Chance , who is often seen lying down as in the photo above.  Marley and Baby C play together all day, and are best buddies.  For a picture of when they first met, look  here . This photo shows Baby C surrounded by some of the wonderful people at  REINS , where he is the youngest rider they have ever had.  After a period of adjustment, he seems to have reached a point (on most days) where he genuinely enjoys riding horses.  In case you are wondering ... that's a pretty small horse.  And this picture was taken while we were still fighting the 'helmet' battle with him. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SXPmbm4LWkI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/PMd8m0Frp2M/s1600-h/DSCN0251.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SXPmzxPQ_2I/AAAAAAAAAQY/jMaXnwlF6Ag/s1600-h/DSCN0284.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SXPqRizs4UI/AAAAAAAAAQg/6z3xzaYkwVY/s1600-h/DSCN0268.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XhlalxzLyfU/SXPuIkERZHI/AAAAAAAAAQo/j6ZDWv5VlmU/s1600-h/PICT5087.JPG"], "link": "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/01/blog-post.html", "title": "\nBaby C (and friends)\n"},

It is heart-wrenching to hear quotes from potential neighbors such as: \"We have no guarantee as to who is going to live there and with what degree of mental illness,\" said Diana Grogan, who lives a few doors down [from a proposed group home in a suburban neighborhood]. Perhaps Diana Grogan should examine precisely what type of guarantee she wants, and what misconceptions about \"mental illness\" she harbors that make her feel a guarantee is necessary.  Perhaps Diana Grogan should consider that her life, too, may be touched by \"mental illness\", and exercise the same degree of understanding and compassion that she would someday expect others to exercise in her or her loved ones' favor. There are some encouraging aspects to the article as well.  TERI, the organization cited in the article, has been around North County for a long time.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 12, 2008", "body": "\nThis post is not about Michael Savage or JB Handley. Though it could be, considering the title. Instead, I must warn you that this is an entirely non-autism-related post and holds absolutely no scientific value or journalistic integrity. When Animals Attack #1 My family is technologically challenged.   Though I have learned my way around blogger, I am pretty much a rube in regards to all other things electronic.  Oh, to be an electronic guru like my friends Glynn or Kev!  No such luck. So when I booked the install appointment for DSL (we currently run satellite internet due to our semi-rural location and resulting limited options), I just knew it would not go well.  In the week leading into the appointment, we had one TV go down, baby C dropped our digital camera in the pool and thereby destroyed that, I found that many of my most recently downloaded songs are MP4 format which will not play in our little \"gemstone\" pseudo-Ipod thing, my wife's cell phone shuts itself down when she tries to dial out, and my company's servers are full and requiring a PowerVault for expansion (very expensive).  DSL must run through phone lines, as does our satellite TV and our alarm system.  Though I was assured these would not conflict, it took 3 hours of a tech being in my home to verify what I knew already - that we are living in the technological equivalent of purgatory. During the Tech's visit, my wife noticed the dogs barking excessively on the back patio.  When she went to investigate, she noticed the sound of water running, or spraying.  Upon closer investigation, it was  not  water ... it was a  rattle  ... Or, to be more specific, Rattlesnake!  After she hollered for attention, I helped her drag the dogs in the house (we have really big dogs and they  really  wanted to play with the snake) and I prepared myself to do battle with the leviathan. Okay, as an aside, I really don't like to kill snakes. But Rattlers are territorial(they will return to the same spots repeatedly), and I happen to also be territorial (I return to my home each night).  It is my responsibility to; a)  protect my children from harm, and b) not kill myself in the process if it can be easily avoided.  This means my options - since I have no way of picking up and removing a rattlesnake - are limited.  I can't let it get out of my sight and wonder every moment if my kids or dogs will encounter it, so I have to kill it.  To spare you the details, I accomplished my task and am feeling not very good about it.  I am currently loking for a snake-catcher so that next time I can remove the snake instead of killing it.  Maybe I should have called this post, \"When Humans Attack\". The point here is that all of this happened while the DSL installer was here.  He kept peeking outside to check on my raging battle with the snake. When he left ... hours later ... defeated by the curse of the D family's electronics ... I told him, \"Hey, lighten up.  Its not your fault.  This install was doomed before I even ordered it!  You see, when we try to upgrade technologically around here  it not only doesn't work, but we also get attacked by wild animals!\" When Animals Attack #2 You'd like to think the story is over at his point, right?  Ummm, no. The snake thing happened last Wednesday.  Fast forward all of 2 days, and my wife has the boys down by the pool.  My wife is an animal husbandry aficionado, and has not yet learned (as we cynics have) that so-called \"lesser\" animals can be safely ignored.  As a result, she was rescuing a drowning bee from our pool.  Yes,  picture an exhausted, drenched bee being mercifully lifted from the cold, deathly, chlorinated clutch of the pool by L's graceful hands.  Then picture the little ungrateful bastard stinging her! (Sorry  Andrea  for flinging epithets at the bee, but read on prior to passing judgment please). To shorten a long story, by the next day (Saturday) her finger was turning black and her hand was swollen to a painful point.  I took watch over the boys while she went to Urgent Care.  She returned 5 hours later with a splint on her hand (extending up to her forearm), gauze on her opposing wrist to cover the IV tube they left in her arm.  You see, she had undergone a severe reaction to the bee sting and required IV antibiotics, and she had to return the next day for another round.  They had to cut off her ring due to swelling.  Now she appeared to be some android-mom.  So this was a big deal!  And it was not directly related to any technology installs or upgrades!  Unbelievable. She is ok now, but apparently this reaction will get worse with each ensuing bee sting.  And never mind that our middle son, T, also reacts strongly to bee stings, and that bees hate T.  They have some sort of bee-nation vendetta on the poor kid, and typically harass him at every turn.  He's had twice as many bee stings in 5 years as I've had in my life, poor kid.  So we are planning to move to Nome, Alaska where it is too freakin' cold for bees to live.
