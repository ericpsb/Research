I struggle with how to return a phone call, never sure how much access I'm going to have to speech. I start a project with enthusiasm and get derailed when the next big thing comes along, demanding 100% attention. Deadlines are my best friend and archenemy. I sometimes need help with staying on task and I resent that I need help and I resent the people who help me. It's all part of the package.\n\nChallenge 20 is for me. You can share it if you want to. It's not an easy one. I need to find better ways of balancing acceptance of my autistic style of tasking with actually delivering work while it is still useful. Taking on fewer tasks is not always an option. I'll be checking in here (eventually) to let you know what happens.\n\nI did pretty well with this, coming through with 90% of the promised challenges by the deadline. I'm counting this as a win.\n\nSpeaking of winning, the winner of the Squawkers McCaw Autism Acceptance Challenge is Jennifer Vail, who completed 15 of the 18 actual challenges (#19 was not a challenge, and #20 is a day late.) 30 people participated in the official challenge, and many others took part without ever posting a comment. I noticed those people who signed petitions and liked pages without entering the competition. I appreciated these responses every bit as much as those who made themselves known here.\n\nSquawk.\n\nJennifer Vail, please send me your mailing address.

I am beyond honored to be in such good company and to be chosen by someone I have looked up to since I started reading blogs regularly. These are the official rules of the Thinking Bloggermeme:1. If, and only if, you get tagged, write a post with links     to 5 blogs that make you think,2. Link to this post so that people can easily find the exact origin of the meme,3. Optional: Proudly display the Thinking Blogger Award with     a link to the post that you wrote.These are a few of my favorites. I've tried to stick with ones who haven't received this meme recently, but in a couple of cases I wasn't sure. Either way, these are some people and blogs I respect. Andrea's Buzzing About is on my must-read list. Andrea's insights into human behavior via the insect world are deep and intriguing. I have learned a lot from her about topics I would not have bothered to study without the autism connection. I identify deeply with much of what she writes, and she always says it better than I would have. The Gimp Parade is a blog I only discovered during May's Blogging Against Disablism event. I am still catching up on the earlier posts of Blue/Kay Olson there. In addition to her writings on disability from a feminist perspective, discrimination and bigotry of all kinds are identified and deftly analyzed at The Gimp Parade. Blue/Kay also has excellent taste in poetry. Check out her Poetry Monday feature while you're there. I very much enjoy the writing at Autism Street. Dad of Cameron, or Do'C, sometimes invites guest bloggers to post there. Mum to Laura's post on \"The Blindness Spectrum\" is especially memorable. Combined with his own writings, the various voices found on the blog create something reminiscent of a very good magazine or journal, with Do'C as Editor in Chief. Estee Klar-Wolfond, not only for the refreshingly named Joy of Autism blog, but also for The Autism Acceptance Project (TAAP) with its beautiful website and important mission of promoting autistic artists and writers. Joel Smith, NTs Are Weird. Joel seems not to accept these awards, I know at least a couple of bloggers have tagged him, but I've not seen a response. That's okay by me. I just want to express my appreciation, Joel, for your thoughtful posts on self advocacy and disclosure this past month and for your continued diligence in reporting abuse toward autistics. Thank you. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rl4x3F7AI3I/AAAAAAAAAgs/dpwvr-6ZhqA/s1600-h/thinkingblogger.jpg", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/", "http://www.thethinkingblog.com/2007/02/thinking-blogger-awards_11.html", "http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/", "http://thegimpparade.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/", "http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.taaproject.com/", "http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/think-think-think.html", "title": "\nThink, think, think...\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 28, 2007", "body": "\nIt happened every Saturday morning without fail, somewhere in between The Jetsons and Scooby Doo: my favorite, albeit brief program came on. It started with the Color Bars and ended with \"this has been a test of the emergency broadcast system\" and just before the slightly painful tone that let you know the test truly was being run, the famed announcement requesting all viewers to \"Please Stand By\".This was my cue to get up from the floor in front of the large console TV and rush to its side to stand at attention, allowing the test to be properly conducted. How many times did I do this in earnest before realizing the error of my ways? Memory does not serve in this capacity, alas; I remember best the giggling times (several years worth) after I'd realized the command was not intended literally, but before the repeated joke had finally stretched the patience of both my parents to the limit. I never grew tired of it myself, and would to this day enjoy the chance to \"stand by\", but they haven't made that announcement in years. It's a funny sort of nostalgia, I guess, this yearning for something most typical kids must have found an irritating waste of cartoon time. Thinking back to my childhood in the 1960's, I imagine living rooms across the U.S. inhabited by unidentified autistic children, lining up to follow the solemn announcer's instructions, learning the colors cyan and magenta, helping the TV get on with its job, taking part in the ritual, our own autistic version of the seventh inning stretch.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RqvhIGxmQII/AAAAAAAAAxM/d8Bz-3rLzGQ/s1600-h/tv+with+woman+standing+by.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/07/please-stand-by.html", "title": "\nPlease stand by...\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 31, 2007", "body": "\nA commenter to my recent post on depression asked, \"Is the diagnosis good for anything?\" Referring to Asperger syndrome as a \"crude label\", the writer states that it has \"zero explanatory value\" and describes a set of qualities that are really nothing new. No argument there, I suppose AS by any other name would smell as weird. Of course it's nothing new. People like us have always existed. What's new, relatively speaking, is the way these traits are construed as a disorder or quasi-medical condition. Sometimes when I discuss autism with people not familiar with the idea of disability as a cutural construction, someone will start talking about labels. \"Why do you feel a need to label yourself?\" is a question I've heard a few times. \"What's the point of diagnosis at your age?\" is another one. A satellite to the labelling conversation is the accusation that I have somehow \"given up\" since accepting the truth of my autism. I've written about labels before, and how having a name for the seemingly separate mysteries of my existence has allowed me to experience life more fully and view myself as unbroken. To be able, finally, to answer the many questions I've asked myself and those that others have asked of me has been the most meaningful gift I could have received. Why do I walk the way I walk, and why do I have such problems with talking? Why don't I understand small talk, why do I always seem to have some all encompassing obsession? Why do I get so irritable with noises other people don't notice? Why do I love repeating words and phrases? Why do I seem to misunderstand others so often? On and on and on. Having a name for this, seeing that it might all fit together, rather than being a large collection of independently weird traits, helped me make sense of my life and stop blaming myself and get on with the business of living. Stigma happens, yes. My experience is that is happens with or without a diagnostic label. The labels \"weird\", \"lazy\", \"crazy\", etc. seem to be sufficient excuses to ostracize others, if one is inclined to do that.Yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak to a group of about 50 special education teachers. I had been invited to share information on a social club I coordinate for Asperger teens. I included some general information about autism and Asperger syndrome, both from literature and personal observation. I was able to stand up in front of this group and tell them that we are not broken and do not need training to behave more \"normally\" so much as we need acceptance for our different ways of being. Several people approached me afterward, asking if I'd like to speak at their schools or other groups. I am happy to be able to make these small attempts at changing attitudes, little by little.This is something I would never have been able to do a few years ago. I could barely talk at all if more than one other person was in the room with me. As I told the group of teachers, I have always been that kid in the back row, trying very hard to become invisible. I've changed a lot.Part of the change has resulted from accepting a \"label\" that gave me a lens through which to view previously inexplicable behaviors, perceptions and preferences. The bigger part of it, I think is the result of what's been called \"giving up\". I stopped trying so hard to do things \"the right way\" and started accepting the ways that I could do things. Now when I speak, I don't worry that I'll forget something like the word for \"puppy\" or that I'll be rocking back and forth a bit or that I'll throw in too many \"umm\"s and \"ahh\"s.I don't worry anymore. I know I will do these things. They are a part of me, not affectations to be eliminated, but a part of the presentation, a part of the message. Form and function, acceptance in action.  Just one of the things I couldn't do before, but now I can, now that I've finally \"given up\".\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://mjane.zolaweb.com/label.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/08/giving-up.html", "title": "\nGiving up\n"},

I felt safely anonymous starting out with only my first name to identify me and a handful of incidental readers. I hadn't predicted the ways blogging might affect my relationships with present and future colleagues, friends and family.

One difference this writing has made is that the people around me now have a way of knowing what I think. I have a way of telling them, without writing individual letters or emails every time I've failed to get my point across. This is different from the way my life used to be, not in a bad way. It's almost as if I've become, for the first time, visible, authentic. But these people are not the ones who enter the discussions here.

In 1985, Vincent Milletich, an autistic 22-year-old, suffered a seizure and died after he was put in restraints and forced to wear a white-noise helmet. Five years later, 19-year-old Linda Cornelison, who had the mental capacity of a toddler, refused to eat. On the bus to school, she clutched her stomach; someone had to carry her inside, and she spent the day on a couch in a classroom. Linda could not speak, and the staff treated her actions as misbehaviors. Between 3:52 p.m. and 8 p.m., staffers punished her with 13 spatula spankings, 29 finger pinches, 14 muscle squeezes, and 5 forced inhalings of ammonia. It turned out that Linda had a perforated stomach. She died on the operating table at 1:45 a.m.The local district attorney's office examined the circumstances of Vincent's death but declined to file any charges. In Linda's case, the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation investigated and found that while Linda's treatment had \"violated the most basic codes and standards of decency and humane treatment,\" there was insufficient evidence to prove that the use of aversives had caused her death.\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghheuvDQD2Q&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Faspergersquare8%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2007%2F03%2Fjudge%2Drotenberg%2Dcenter%2Duses%2Delectric%2Ehtml", "http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock.html", "http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock.html", "http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/Mass_DMR_LC_investigation.pdf"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/10/not-news-but-anyway.html", "title": "\nNot news, but anyway...\n"},

The song listed a number of events which did not properly meet the definition of irony (rain at a wedding, a belated death row pardon), interspersed with the seemingly rhetorical question of the chorus. I thought all along that the critics missed the point in a big way. The song was not actually about irony, but about the rampant misuse of the word, and also the inclination of some people (and many would place me, not unfairly, in this category) to focus on a speaker\u2019s word misuse at the expense of the intended point. Rather than being a bit\u2026wrong\u2026the song was actually brilliant, at least in its power to sell itself as an inferior good. While everyone agreed that much about the song was wrong, they couldn\u2019t stop talking about it, helping to boost a fairly weak piece of music to popularity. That was ironic.Then there\u2019s Smitty\u2019s, a business which recently earned some negative attention for its insensitivity in ejecting an autistic child and from one of its restaurants. Smitty\u2019s has now joined forces with Autism Speaks to \"raise awareness.\" Oh my! The restaurant chain can now be viewed in some circles as making amends for bad behavior.

Some move invisibly through the world in order to avoid the hatred much of society expresses with impunity toward known members of their group.

The killers often draw lesser sentences for these murders than those who kill more \u201cnormal\u201d members of society. Such killings tend to be ignored or glossed over, even by those who would seem naturally positioned to be allies.The story is familiar, but it isn\u2019t about autism this time. Today, I am taking up a challenge offered by Queen Emily and Lisa Harney. The challenge was addressed to feminist bloggers who have remained silent on the topic of violence against trans women.I am heeding also the message from Shiva, recently presented at Autscape, a reminder that as advocates for autistic rights we are \u201cpart of a wider disability movement and an even wider pro-diversity/anti-discrimination movement.\u201d It\u2019s an important message.Andrade explained to police that he thought he \u201ckilled it,\u201d referring to Zapata but when she made gurgling noises and started to sit up, he hit her withthe extinguisher again.Killed \u201cit.\u201d It.If I would be outraged (and I would) if this referred to the killing of an autistic person, and if I would not be outraged at an identical hate crime toward another minority person, I would be a bigot.

I write about autism here because I see it as the center of my being and my story, not because I think that one kind of diversity is better or more important than another.

{"date": "Friday, January 2, 2009", "body": "\nCagesThis week, I visited two local pet shops. At the first one, I talked with two Blue and Gold Macaws. They were molting, and not in the best of moods. Their cages were marked: These birds will bite. The owner explained that they wouldn\u2019t have much to say. That\u2019s okay, I told her. They don\u2019t have to talk in order to be loved. These were rescue birds, taken in by the shop owner after being mistreated or rejected by previous people. Yes, she said. They know that now.At the second store, parrots were free to roam around large habitats, interacting with visitors. One tried to work the zipper on my jacket; another worked at removing an earring. There was a big Macaw in the back. He kept to himself for awhile, declining invitations to chat or play. He argued with a cockatoo about who would get to use the swing. After winning, he happily vocalized, Hello, Hello, Hi There, Hello. Swinging away. Enjoying the ride.JoyFrom The Joy of Autism blog: \u201cFinding joy doesn\u2019t come without struggle.\u201d Estee gets a lot of flak from \u201cautism advocates\u201d for the way she supports autistic people. Sometimes I wonder if the critics read much beyond the blog\u2019s title. In addition to joy, Estee writes about pain, challenges, anger, disappointment and hope, inspiration and grief. Her core message is one of respect for all people. But even if she did only write about things that made her happy, or if I only wrote about parrots and squares, so what? Celebrating life is not wrong. When situations are difficult, it becomes ever more necessary to find the parts worthy of celebration. It shouldn\u2019t need to be said that finding joy in autism doesn\u2019t mean that is all one finds. Besides, the internet could hold a few hundred blogs about joy and autism without making a dent in the negative things that get said.CagesMy father used to say that there are two kinds of animals: the ones in cages and the ones not in cages. He repeated this \u201cjoke\u201d a lot. I rolled my eyes every time. I thought he was being facile. I missed the point, maybe. He was teaching me about the concept of false dichotomy, and how just about anything can be set as the bar separating one \u201ctype\u201d from another. Today, I am able to see a deeper truth embedded within the silliness. In a way, Dad was right. The cage itself makes the animal less what it is, puts the individual on display to represent its entire species, keeps the people on the other side safe, looking in, imagining that what they see is the truth about that specimen, that species. Two realities: what is and what is seen from the outside.\u201cReality\u201dAccording to some \u201cautism advocates,\u201d there are two kinds of autistics. The distinction varies, sometimes stated as autism vs. Asperger syndrome, speaking vs. non-speaking, or even, incredibly, miserable vs. joyful. Not only are there two types of autistics, some of these advocates claim, the voices of one \u201ctype\u201d necessarily deny or trivialize the needs of the other. The idea that one \u201creality\u201d trumps another, the idea that \u201creality\u201d is static, the idea that one organization or entity owns the definition of \u201cautism,\u201d the idea that seeing, even at the surface, is believing, these form the bars to a cage that keeps those on the outside wondering. Which is the \u201creal\u201d autistic? Of course the question is silly, born of the false belief that the autistic person one sees in the nearest classroom or family (or mirror?) must be the archetypal Autistic from which others are once, twice or infinitely removed. The fact that my reality is different from someone else\u2019s doesn\u2019t make either of them less valid. There are as many autism realities as autistic people. This really shouldn\u2019t need to be said.CagesI do a lot of talking about autism. These presentations cover a variety of topics from communication strategies to employment to self-advocacy. Somehow, I always end up having to talk about murder. I don\u2019t like talking about murder. It isn\u2019t fun. It doesn\u2019t make people happy to hear about Katie McCarron, Jacob Grabe, and Tiffany Pinckney. It doesn\u2019t please people to hear about the shock interventions used routinely at the Judge Rotenburg Center. Students locked in isolation rooms. Caged. Children evicted from fast food restaurants and churches and kindergarten classrooms, none of this is enjoyable. I don\u2019t make a lot of friends doing this, but it has to be done. Whatever the topic, these things work their way to the surface, demanding attention, because they are what matter most.And then I come home and read once again that neurodiversity is some sort of \u201cfeel good ideology,\u201d denying the hardships faced by autistic people and their families. I read somewhere else, once again, that autistic adults do not exist, that we are a different animal entirely from the children who are \u201creally\u201d autistic. I want to just shake my head and go on, but I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t get over it. I tend to obsess about things, this is my nature. This is my cage, and also my swing. From the other side, Hello! Hello!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.esteeklar.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SV7NK2uelmI/AAAAAAAACME/V8PCUFlNoqo/s1600-h/caged.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SV7hSoyEX5I/AAAAAAAACMU/AQqLkQyI_KE/s1600-h/caged.jpg", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=380", "http://www.autismvox.com/remembering-jacob-grabe-and-too-many-others/", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2008/02/life-and-death-of-tiffany-pinckney.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/01/cages.html", "title": "\nCages\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, January 6, 2009", "body": "\nThis announcement is from Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network:Hello,This past Friday, we met with representatives from the Office of the President-Elect on Autism Policy. The meeting was attended by representatives from the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, Easter Seals, TASH, the Marino Foundation, Autism Speaks and the Autism Society of America. At the request of the Office of the President-elect, we presented to the new administration our top three policy priorities for the coming year: 1) Supporting and Empowering autistic adults, 2) Ending School Abuse and Ensuring a Free and Appropriate Public Education for Every Student, and 3) Balancing the Research Agenda in Support of Quality of Life. You can read our recommendations to the new Administration on our website and we encourage you to post them on your blogs, listservs and elsewhere.Although these are our top three priorities, they do not represent our only action items and we are pleased to report that the incoming administration expressed a strong interest in remaining in continuous contact on these and other issues. It is absolutely essential that we ensure that autistic self-advocates have a voice at the policy table and we will continue to keep you up to date as we advocate for the autistic community. Nothing About Us, Without Us!Regards, Ari Ne'emanPresidentThe Autistic Self Advocacy Network1660 L Street, NW, Suite 700Washington, DC 20036http://www.autisticadvocacy.org732.763.5530Details of ASAN's recommendations can be found here.Here is a brief excerpt:Research that focuses on discovering and eliminating autism both enters the dangerous and unethical realm of eugenics and avoids addressing the social barriers that autistic people face that prevent quality of life and full participation and inclusion in society at large. Balancing the autism research agenda to focus on quality of life will pay dividends by providing evidence on the most effective methods of delivering services and providing for an effective education across the lifespan.ASAN goes on to suggest that no less than a third of federal funding for autism research be allocated to services-based research. The inclusion of ASAN in this discussion represents a big step in the right direction. A common myth about neurodiversity is that autistic self-advocates who support ideas like acceptance would prefer to see an end to autism research. That isn't the case. It's about resources. While huge sums of money are poured into finding the cause of autism, there are many autistic people who might benefit from services that money could buy. There are autistic adults who need help with employment, education, transportation, activities of daily living. Autistic children need Free and Appropriate Public Education. Adults and children on the spectrum need access to Augmentative and Alternative Communication devices. All of us need the opportunity to be fully included in the communities we live in. All of us need doctors and police officers who are properly educated about autism.None of these needs are addressed by \"Walk for Autism\" events or public service announcements decrying the \"horrors\" of autism. But they are addressed realistically through the inclusion of autistic adults in formulating policy.This is truly a hopeful start to the New Year. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/documents/ASANTransitionRecommendations.pdf", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/documents/ASANTransitionRecommendations.pdf"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/01/asan-recommedations-to-obama-transition.html", "title": "\nASAN Recommedations to Obama Transition Team\n"},

That was how long I had to describe the life of a woman with Asperger syndrome, the details of how AS is diagnosed, how it is (or isn\u2019t) different from autism, why boys are diagnosed so much more often than girls. Twelve minutes for what might be the only chance some of these listeners, the nine other people in my class, ever have to hear a perspective like mine. I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be enough.As regular readers of this blog know, as anyone who\u2019s ever had a conversation with me knows, I am not a fast talker. Even with multiple rehearsals and a well written plan, the stalling of words is all but inevitable. That\u2019s why I tend to follow up class presentations and other important talks with the written words that flow more easily here. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this post now, instead of the many other pieces of writing that I have committed to doing. Because of the things I didn\u2019t get to say.To the nine other members of my class, this may hold little importance. I know that. But I will have failed in a fundamental way if I don\u2019t at least try to correct some possible misconceptions. I want you to know that an autism diagnosis isn\u2019t a disaster or a \u201cbomb.\u201d It isn\u2019t a tragedy to be autistic. I tried to make that clear through the \u201ccase\u201d I presented and the small piece of my own history tacked on at the end.There is no hard and fast line separating AS from autism. When I was young, I hardly talked at all. By young I mean\u2026until about 30. This was always seen as volitional, but it wasn\u2019t. Having the physical ability to produce speech is not the only prerequisite to using spoken language. When asked a question, I would often say nothing. This wasn\u2019t \u201cshyness.\u201d It was an absence of words to describe what I knew. The thoughts were not available in that format. Sometimes this is still true for me. It is less noticeable. The more years a person lives, the more strategies she finds. I\u2019ve heard that this is also true for non-autistic people.There is no hard and fast line separating AS from autism. Many people do not agree with this statement. Some of them have let me know this, and not always in the kindest of ways. \u201cPeople like you\u201d\u2026I\u2019ve been addressed that way more than once\u2026\u201dPeople like you have it easy and don\u2019t care about the lower functioning.\u201d The people saying this have never met me. There is the assumption on some parts that if you can write and drive and attend college, you should not call yourself \u201cautistic.\u201d That autistic is something else. A tragedy. Something that takes a terrible toll.IISomething that \u201ctakes a terrible toll.\u201d Please read this link. As much as it saddens and sickens me that this man took his son\u2019s life, this article, the way it is written, this infuriates me beyond belief. It\u2019s not an isolated incident, this killing. This sort of writing isn\u2019t either. Somehow, autism is made out to be the villain. No. A man killed his son. \u201cI had to,\u201d he said. What was so terrible? Look at the article\u2019s first two paragraphs:Jacob Grabe, 13, could sense a storm coming several days out. He would get agitated and make strange noises. Silverware bothered him. He could eat only from plastic forks and spoons. He breezed through complicated algebra but struggled with basic division. Nearly three months ago, when his father, Allen, allegedly shot and killed him while he was sleeping, Jacob had been exhibiting these and many other symptoms of the mysterious disorder autism for most of his short lifeLater we hear this: \"Autism is a maddening disorder of scrambled brain development that can lead some parents to snap, experts say.\u201d Who are these experts who use terms like \u201cscrambled\u201d to describe a differently developing human brain? Who sanctions this \"snapping?\" I want to know. I want this to stop, this unconscionable victim blaming. Throughout history, people have offered many poor reasons for killing. This is among the weakest arguments I\u2019ve heard for murdering a child. But for a so-called journalist to endorse such garbage by focusing on the cost and the stress associated with autism, this is beyond the pale.\u201cSo Jacob became another statistic in a sad, pressure-cooker reality for families with autistic children.\u201d No. He became a victim of murder. But because he was autistic, that\u2019s not how the story is told. He deserved better, and so does his memory.IIIHe could only eat with plastic forks and spoons. I can\u2019t wear silk or polyester or be in the same room with styrofoam. Earlier, a reader sent an email asking me to write about Jacob. I thought I couldn\u2019t do it. I was too angry, too sad, too ready to give up. Having the physical ability to write is not always the only prerequisite to using language. Sometimes I make strange noises, too.If I had twelve hours to explain, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. There is no hard and fast line. Jacob Grabe\u2019s diagnosis was Asperger syndrome. So many others have died for no reason. Autism isn\u2019t a tragedy, but catastrophic thinking can open the door to such unthinkable events. There is more, so much more to say but this...today, this was most important.Note: Minor stylistic edits have been made to this post.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_11116100?source=email"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/12/twelve-minutes.html", "title": "\nTwelve minutes\n"},
{"date": "Friday, January 16, 2009", "body": "\nWhy can't we face the truth? Having an autistic child wrecks your life. The title of Carol Sarler's article in today's Mail Online pretty much tells the story. It has all the drama you would expect from the title--a child who \"screams like a banshee,\" moments of \"everyday terror,\" parents who will never work full time again, an entire family ruined by the presence of an autistic child. Even the grandparents are starting to have disagreements over finances! Sarler concludes her sad tale with her unsolicited opinion (it would be \"impertinent,\" you see, to bring this up to the mother, yet not so much to broadcast it to all of cyberspace) that life would have been better for this family, for all concerned, had \"Tom\" never been born. Yes, seriously.I scrolled through the story as quickly as possible, reaching for the comments section where surely these hateful statements would be soundly refuted. There were some comments rejecting Sarler's conclusion, but quite a few agreed with her completely. I didn't get far before I found these:I have no doubt that Tom is, through no fault of this own, a tremendous burden. Oooh, you're going to have all the dogooders at your throat, but yes, his life should have been one unlived, sad but true.Amen, no one is brave enough to say it but we all think it. What misery for all involved.This is a very brave article. And very true. My twelve year old nephew is severely autistic. Needless to say, my sister and brother-in-law have a miserable marriage Finally, someone with the spine to state the obvious. Thank you Carol Sarler.Madam, you are very right. Something else, probably never thought of - the poor neighbours suffer as well.. their quality of life is also changed for the worse if they have the misfortune to live above, below or next to a family with such a child. A very moving and thought-provoking article. I think many more people than are willing to let on would abort an autistic child if they knew.Yes, there are more, feel free to look it up if you feel like taking a few punches to the gut. Yes, I know that the Daily Mail is not to be taken seriously as a newspaper. But the number of people writing in agreement with Sarler is hard to take. I have surrounded myself with people who agree that disability is not a tragedy, parents who treasure their autistic children. People who don't assign ultimate value based on what someone can or cannot do. Some call this \"burying one's head in the sand,\" I suppose. I see it as a necessity. The will to go on can be fragile. Do these commenters not even stop to think how this reporting of wrecked lives might affect their autistic family members? Or do they seriously believe that autistics are not aware of their openly expressed opinions? Yet of the three generations, it is Tom who suffers most. And he's getting worse. As Helen [Tom's grandmother] said, only last week: 'We used to have a little autistic boy who was often happy. Now we have one who never is.'Does anyone wonder?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/01/everyday-terror.html", "title": "\nEveryday Terror\n"},

He recognized that he was having a heart attack. He wanted to live. The dispatcher stayed on the line with him, waiting for help to arrive. Before it did, he collapsed, but the dispatcher kept the line open. When the ambulance arrived, the two EMT workers opened the door to Mr. Baker\u2019s house. They saw a messy house. A very messy house. They saw a very large man, a man with a disability, a very large man with a disability, collapsed on the floor of a very messy house. They talked about him. They talked about his house. Expressed disgust at the way he lived. They talked about whether or not he was worth saving, agreeing to report that he was dead when they got there. The dispatcher heard it all, and turned the tape over to authorities. The EMT workers were arrested, and are free on bail until late in February.It happened on November 29, it\u2019s an old story. It was quite a bit later when I heard it. Late in December, the company charged with cleaning the house chose to release photos of Baker\u2019s home, allowing all the world to see and comment upon and judge the state of Baker\u2019s living room. People like to see the evidence, decide for themselves. Worthy or unworthy? Barry Baker was left to die in this living room. It is too late for him.Just over a week ago, Dave Hingsburger posted a blog in memory of Baker at Chewing the Fat. He promised to tell people the story, to keep it alive. Now, I am telling it here. Baker\u2019s story, on its own, is important for many reasons. It demonstrates the occasional failure of agencies sworn to help, of people paid to help, to remember that they are not endowed with the authority to decide who lives and who dies. People who are disabled, people who are \u201cdifficult,\u201d are equally worthy of life and dignity.This is a truth that has once again been called into question.Minna Mettinen- Kekalainen, a 42 year old autistic woman with ALS has been denied services she needs to continue living. Apparently, the nursing agency that served her through the North East Community Care Access Centre in Sudbury, Ontario has reported harassment by Ms. Mettinen-Kekalainen since she threatened to report them for not following her doctor\u2019s orders. The agency has said that they would not deny services to anyone, as long as their workers were \u201csafe.\u201d Meanwhile, the many forms of assistance she needs, listed by her as \u201cbasic hygiene, communication, mobility, and administration of medications, food and water\u201d have been denied for forty days. It is hard to imagine that she could be much of a threat to anyone. No, she is being punished for speaking up for her rights. Judged as unworthy of care. Read more about her story here and here and here and here. In his post about Barry Baker, Hingsburger wrote:I hope you will join me and bring Barry's story to others, begin a conversation of the dangers of disphobia and the need for us to be alert to the fact thatthose who are supposed to save us, may indeed kill us, that those who are supposed to care for us, may indeed hate us, that those who we are supposed to trust - can't be.Here it is.

I have been wanting to write about the state of our former apartment, but this is one of those Top Secret Secrets that may take a little longer to talk about. And even under the best of conditions, having guests is uncomfortable for me. It\u2019s something I\u2019m working on, slowly.The sounds I make have not much to do with any of that. I have made bird and other animal sounds for as long as I can remember. They are a way of expressing things when words are less available. They are a way of participating. Many people, not just a few, have been annoyed by this way I have of expressing myself. There is a particular trill that comes up pretty frequently, specific to work. Wherever I have worked I have used it the way some people use chit chat and others whistling. Some people, even as they work, keep a window open to Facebook in case someone wants to message them. If I occasionally make a sound, this keeps me closer to the language others understand. When I am silent for a long time, my ability to process the spoken word slows down even more.Sometimes the chirping and trilling annoy people. So does the endless chatter they engage in distract me. Sometimes I get off track and can\u2019t find my way back to what I was doing. I try to compromise, to get along. No matter how many times I explain it, or what words or methods I use, most people are unable to see that this is not a matter of choice. Speaking and listening use an incredible amount of my energy. When I participate, it is often because I think enough of the person to not want to appear rude.So yes, I do care when someone thinks I am being unfriendly or dismissive with my sounds. The trill I use most often at work is a happy one, focused and productive. A squawk ususally means I\u2019m reasonably comfortable in your presence. A squawk isn\u2019t anything bad. Really. Had I been unhappy, I would have howled.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/11/squawking-incident.html", "title": "\nThe squawking incident\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 11, 2008", "body": "\nFour hours is a very long time to talk. For me, sometimes, four minutes is too long. It\u2019s worth the effort though, when minds are changed, and there are many strategies I use to keep things moving when words don\u2019t work. On Saturday, Squawkers and I presented a workshop at TASH 2008 on the topic of \u201cautism advocacy\u201d and autistic advocacy as it can be. I called this presentation, \u201cSpeaking of Autism: Who Speaks for Whom?\u201dThe first segment was a PowerPoint with narration by text-to-speech software, outlining some of the struggles I faced prior to diagnosis. These are not things I can say with my own voice, but I need to say them. This is the part that, when giving a talk in Alcoholics Anonymous, people sometimes call \u201cqualifying.\u201d I find that this works for me in allowing people to see past the Notlikemychild condition they may see before them.This was followed by introductions amongst the attendees, who were given Hello My Name Is tags with names like \u201cTrain Wreck\u201d and \u201cDestroyer of Families.\u201d They found they had a hard time making friends or being trusted with these labels on their backs. Who knew?To ease the burden of speaking, I also used a number of videos to illustrate points about good and bad advocacy, including work by Christschool, Amanda Baggs and others. I told the stories of Teddy Willis, Adam Race, Alex Barton, Katie McCarron, Jacob Grabe and many others through a combination of pictures, text, video and speech. I tried to do as much listening as talking, and this turned out, unsurprisingly, to be a very productive strategy.In the audience were two people on the spectrum, including a well known FC user and a woman who told me that she is a regular reader of this blog. Also present were a few family members of autistic adults, several educators, an employee of ARC of New Mexico, and a woman who said she had recently attended a DAN conference.It was an adventure. Someone (not me) used the word \u201ceugenics.\u201d Someone complained that she saw nothing wrong with Autism Every Day. It had helped her, she said. I tried not to argue; I had asked for, and promised, a suspension of judgment during the workshop. By chance or fate, my video of Autism Every Day would not play. I asked those who had seen it to help me describe it, just the first two minutes, before any mention of murder was made. I asked them, what did you see?Several people spoke. They had seen frustration and challenges, parents at the ends of their ropes. They saw worry for uncertain futures, hopelessness and desperation. This is where the whole topic of empathy gets very interesting for me. I heard people talking about the way they saw the parents feeling. This makes sense to me. The people talking were parents and they were not autistic.Do you know what I saw there in those first two minutes? Three children spoken about as if they were not there. \u201cShe is like a baby.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never said a single word.\u201d I empathized as much as anyone, I argued. I empathized with those children. I know that feeling, and it wasn\u2019t hard to see it in their eyes, in their gestures. There in that conference room, I saw subtle changes in some faces. Lights were coming on, not everywhere, but somewhere. By the end of it the woman who had liked Autism Every Day asked me for recommendations. She had some money saved, and she was no longer willing to give it to Autism Speaks. I was happy to point her in more positive directions. The woman who had been to DAN! had visibly relaxed. Now she spoke up, \u201cDefeat\u2026I never realized how bad that sounded.\u201d I was glad I hadn\u2019t said anything the first time she'd mentioned it. Sometimes, being at a loss for words can be a pretty good thing.Ari Ne'eman of ASAN was a keynote speaker at the TASH 2008 conference.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tash.org/2008tash/", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/04/its-teddys-turn-autistic-advocacy.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=380", "http://www.taaproject.com/", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SUG8urz61nI/AAAAAAAACL8/m4O7q0chEkk/s1600-h/ari.squawk2.jpg", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/12/four-hours.html", "title": "\nFour hours\n"},

She has asked me to help get this message out, and others are encouraged to post it as well.Change for People with Disabilities: Time to Email Obama!On November 4, 2008, millions of people with disabilities across the United States and around the world joined our non-disabled peers in watching the United States election results. Obama supporters cheered or wept to learn that the next US president would be Obama. Then we cheered or wept again when Obama mentioned people with disabilities in his acceptance speech. History was made\u2013not only for America, not only for Black people, not only for Kenya and all of Africa, not only for Indigenous peoples, but also for people with disabilities.But we cannot afford to allow the moment to end here. Whether we supported Obama, McCain, or another candidate, we all know there is far too much work ahead before we can say, \u201cYes, we have made real change for people with disabilities.\u201dIt is time for people with disabilities, our loved ones, our neighbors, and colleagues to join together, across ideological divides, to reach out to Obama. We should all send an email to Kareem Dale, Obama\u2019s National Disability Vote Director (at kdale@barackobama.com), WITH COPIES TO Anne Hayes, a volunteer on the Obama Disability Policy Committee (at ahayesku@hotmail.com).First, we should thank Obama \u2014 and also Kareem Dale \u2014 for mentioning people with disabilities in Obama\u2019s acceptance speech on November 4. Ensure that they understand how much it matters simply for us to be included. How did you feel when Obama mentioned us? Share your story.Second, we should tell Obama and Kareem Dale that we are aware of Obama\u2019s disability platform. He promised to increase educational opportunities; end discrimination; increase employment opportunities; and support independent, community-based living for Americans with disabilities. And he promised to sign the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the first international, legally-binding human rights treaty for people with disabilities. Tell Obama and Kareem Dale that we are ready to call Obama to account if he fails us. But more importantly, we are ready to work with him for change for people with disabilities.It is important to send your disability-related emails to BOTH Kareem Dale AND Anne Hayes (kdale@barackobama.com AND ahayesku@hotmail.com) between now and inauguration day. Kareem Dale\u2019s email address may change between now and January 20, 2009. Anne Hayes can help ensure that emails sent to Kareem Dale are not lost during this time of transition.Both Kareem Dale and others who have worked on disability issues within the Obama campaign are ready to receive YOUR emails on disability-related issues for US President-elect Obama. Emails are welcome from across the United States and around the world.

{"date": "Thursday, November 13, 2008", "body": "\n\u2026Fine\u2026It\u2019s a classic exchange between parent and teen, whether or not the teen (or the parent, for that matter) is on the autism spectrum. But for the autistic person, How was your day? can pose seemingly insurmountable difficulties. To this day, I would rather someone ask me to solve some equations or decline Latin nouns than take on that most difficult query. Any closed ended question, regardless of difficulty, is preferable to the impossibly vague and confusing tell me about\u2026format. When I hear, for example, How was your day? most often my mind goes blank, struggling to figure out what type of information is being requested. I say nothing, or I say fine. Sometimes I don\u2019t know or I\u2019m not sure yet, but these are usually taken to be poor attempts at humor or evasion.Conceivably, How was your day? could be an inquiry into factual events. I woke up, drank coffee, took a shower and got dressed, drove to work, (the traffic was not too bad), I arrived at work, the boss was not there yet, I went into my office and started to work on my latest assignment\u2026No, I realize that\u2019s not right. These are the wrong types of events. And it doesn\u2019t come close to getting at the \u201chow.\u201d One must reorganize the information, not recite it in the order in which it happened, but according to priority. And with somewhat meaningful commentary.There are a couple of problems with this. First, my memory just doesn\u2019t work that way. I am more of an associative thinker, a style which lends itself fairly well to chronological reporting. First this happened, and then, that happened, caused or not by the first thing, but most likely influenced by it or linked to it by some object or feeling or sensory experience. I woke up, and since I was awake and had someplace to go, I got out of bed, and since I wasn\u2019t awake enough, I drank some coffee. Using this style of unfolding memory that comes naturally to me, I will eventually arrive at the type of fact that someone might want to hear.By that time, though, the asker has either become annoyed at my \u201crefusal\u201d to answer, or moved on to telling me about his or her day. Relieved of the responsibility of speaking, I could try to use the other person\u2019s illustration as a template. It seems to go like this: Big Event 1, what they did, what the other parties did, how they felt about it, how they thought the other people saw it, resolution (or not), and on to Big Event 2.This brings me to the second problem. My priorities, my Big Events, are rarely those the listener would choose if given a video of my day. When asked How was your day? I am as likely to land, after several (and several more) seconds of thinking, on the interesting pattern of a stone wall I saw at lunchtime as on a heated argument between co-workers. What I have to say about the wall might shine an accurate light on the workings of my mind, but this is not what the conversational partner expects or wants. Any reporting of facts needs to be sprinkled with plenty of interactive human drama. There needs to be a plot.It is possible to prepare for the question, but time consuming. This requires first recognizing that the question is likely to be asked, and then compiling a list of possibly appropriate responses. This part isn\u2019t difficult on days I consider something to have happened. The day an armed robbery occurred at the business where I worked, I knew exactly what to talk about. Most days, it isn\u2019t clear at all. But consciously noting things that might be of interest to others, keeping these in a sort of file I can call up using some associative technique, that can work sometimes. Not always, though.It\u2019s a lot of work considering that I usually get the same blank stare or look of strained patience. Whether I\u2019ve taken too long, used the \u201cwrong\u201d facial expression or chosen the wrong sort of story again, my answer to How was your day? is never going to be \u201cright.\u201dAfter many years of this, I think I understand something about this:How was your day? is not about my day or anyone\u2019s day. It\u2019s one of those \u201cconnection\u201d questions or statements. It\u2019s one of those conversations made up mostly of subtext. So when you say:How was your day?and I say:Fine.You might think you have said:I recognize that you are a person with experiences of your own, and if you tell me some of them, I will tell you some similar ones, and we will then celebrate what it is we have in common.And that I have said:Who cares?I promise, that is not what I meant. I meant that my day was (well, more or less, as much as I know how to explain, and a number of frustrating conversations notwithstanding) fine.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/11/how-was-your-day.html", "title": "\nHow was your day?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 7, 2008", "body": "\nAs I have mentioned before, I am working on a project to support people with developmental disabilities at the postsecondary level. This is a small pilot project, and we are just getting started. As part of a discussion on choosing the students who will participate, the topic of online courses came up. If a student requested only classes available online, would this be in line with the intentions of our grant?Strong arguments were made against this suggestion. The intention of the project is not only to include the students in academic aspects of college and university work, but even more importantly to foster true inclusion in the community. How could this be accomplished while the students worked from their separate homes, never or rarely meeting one another face to face? How would such students be encouraged to join clubs and organization, attend sporting events, take part in campus politics, or just \u201chang out\u201d with friends? Most of the group agreed that these parts of the college experience are as important as the academic work.I was slow to speak. We had been discussing a potential student who is on the autism spectrum. I have met this person. I know him as someone who likes other people, though not everyone sees that about him. I also know that sitting quietly in one place for an extended period of time, in a group, is not something that is always possible for him. He might prefer to start with an online class, or a hybrid class that meets just a few times during the semester. I wanted to advocate for a broader view of \u201cinclusion\u201d and \u201ccommunity.\u201dMy understanding of community includes the people I talk with through this blog, discussion groups, email lists, individual emails, and yes, even discussion boards for online classes. Not long ago, a hybrid class in which I\u2019m currently enrolled discussed this very topic as part of our mid-term evaluation. This is part of what I posted:The quality of discussions has been very good, the online format seems to work well for this group. I process written statements better than spoken ones, so I feel that I have a much better understanding of other students' viewpoints than I would in a face to face class. I am getting a much deeper understanding of who people are and what they believe; this is something I'm really enjoying about the course.I have been in classes with some of these same students for several years. Until now, I have never known for sure (with one or two exceptions) what they thought of me or my ideas. Nor have I understood much about who they were or the reasons behind the things they said. When we met in person two weeks ago, I enjoyed their company. I felt more visible and real to them than ever before. That is one aspect of inclusion.I thought about this, and about the similar experiences I\u2019ve had meeting other bloggers and readers of Autism Hub blogs. It was like meeting people I already knew very well, better in some ways than I know the members of my family. Immediate and strong connections seemed to form, but no, not form, they were already there. The face to face time spent with these friends was meaningful because I already really knew them. It takes many years to develop as close a bond to people I haven\u2019t corresponded with in writing. My community is very large, and that is because I write. I won\u2019t accept that this community is less real than the experiences I have with people face to face. Those are a comedy of errors, or perhaps a melodrama of misunderstandings. The real \u201cme\u201d is on this page.On the way home from the meeting, I thought about the other side of the equation. How can non-autistic people learn to accept our differences and alternate ways of communication if we don\u2019t spend time with them? Doesn\u2019t that need to be at least half of our long term goal? The students in my online class do recognize me as a different kind of thinker, but they don\u2019t have to see me struggle to put a sentence together, or notice that I am wearing a black shirt yet again, or drawing squares constantly in my notebook. They never endure the occasional squawk or chirp or accidental interruption. If they take me more seriously when protected from those differences, does that add up to the sort of acceptance I want for autistic people? Not at all. And that is one reason I have no desire to withdraw all together from society. People need to see diversity up close, in their familiar and comfortable environments. This is how fears are extinguished.Yet I think that the best accommodation for any given person is likely to be the one he or she has actually requested. If I should say that I need an online class, I hope no one would try to offer me instead a communication device and a bus ticket. Because they\u2019d only be making their best guess as to why I needed to work from home. I would have tried to tell them of course, but people don\u2019t always understand.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/11/inclusion-means-what.html", "title": "\nInclusion means what?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 4, 2008", "body": "\nSeven years ago, in a moment of confusion, I decided to throw a Derby party. The food was elaborate and perfect, all prepared fresh just hours before the guests arrived. The people invited knew and liked one another. There was sunshine, music and of course the Kentucky Derby to discuss, place bets on, watch and then discuss some more. Among the guests were one of the best storytellers I have ever known, several people who had led interesting and adventurous lives, and one of those people sometimes described as \u201cnever [having] met a stranger.\u201d The party was a social disaster, including possibly the longest \u201cawkward silence\u201d ever to occur in a group of twelve people. Following that pause, each and every guest found that suddenly it was time to go; they exited en masse, leaving me puzzled at how such a grand effort at \u201cbeing social\u201d could have failed despite every precaution.At the time, I didn\u2019t have a name for what separated me from them. For the most part I didn\u2019t mind it\u2014the seat next to me, usually remaining empty wherever I went, provided a welcome visible marker for my personal space. In truth, I never wanted a large group of friends around me, just a couple of people (one at a time, please!) with whom to engage in philosophical discussions or compare observations of the many incomprehensible aspects of human behavior. Groups of people, even those made up of perfectly fine individuals, have never appealed to me. With groups come the dynamics of \u201cothering,\u201d and the insipid jockeying to be the first or the best, at least at one thing. And this is only a small piece of why parties are not \u201cmy thing.\u201dThe true purpose of that 2001 Derby party was to prove\u2026well, I\u2019m not sure what, but something\u2026 to certain people around me who were sure that I could overcome my brokenness (whether this was called being \u201cshy,\u201d \u201cdistant,\u201d \u201chostile,\u201d \u201csuperior,\" \"mentally ill\" or \u201cafraid of life\u201d varied by time and by critic and the mood of the speaker) if only I would make the effort. These were people who claimed to like me, while simultaneously asserting that my entire being was little more than a collection of attention-grabbing, fear-pandering character defects. They may have thought that they liked something they thought of as me, but this was a myth. That something, a me without substance or personality, didn\u2019t exist. And for my part, for buying into this, I ended up proving only that I was destined to fail at socializing no matter how hard I might try.The party was based on a lie\u2014that I wanted to be somehow different. What I really wanted, ever, was permission to be me. When I didn\u2019t get it, I rebelled. And people saw the anger, but few ever understood its cause or true nature. Some saw a person who was \u201ctrapped\u201d within herself, unable to reach out to others. Some saw a person who disliked or even hated people. Pretty much everyone agreed that I needed some sort of treatment\u2014therapy, medication, maybe religion\u2014to make me whole, to make me really human. The party was in part an experiment. It took a few more years for me to fully analyze the data.Yesterday, there was another party. There were some simple foods, a few I made, some others purchased from a deli. There were burnt hamburgers, problems with the sound system, rain clouds, and a robotic bird who squawked at several people. Many of the guests had not met one another before. All they had in common was that they are people who have shown acceptance for the person I really am. I had a great time. The guests seemed to enjoy themselves, too. I think this one was a success.These are some of the things that helped me, that made this one different. First, a couple of generous friends who allowed me to host the event at their home made this possible. Having people in my own living space has always been difficult to intolerable for me. I feel exposed, as if someone flipping through my CD collection or noticing the pattern in a dish towel might as well be rummaging through my underwear drawer. So having the party someplace else is a prerequisite for relaxing. Second, I made sure to include children under 10. These are the best guests you can have at an outdoor party; there is so much to be learned from them about how easy it is, really, to have fun. Content for hours with some sidewalk chalk, a ball and a small trampoline, they set the tone for the rest of us to relax and enjoy ourselves freely.Another thing that helped was allowing people to help me. My friend\u2019s daughter, a young adult I\u2019ve had the pleasure of knowing for most of her life, cut vegetables, arranged the table, greeted guests and took photographs. All without being asked. She\u2019s the kind of person who sees what needs to be done, and then does it. Things would not have gone as smoothly without her. Thank you, Dawn! Others pitched in too, bringing ice, cake, appetizers, a beautiful arrangement of fruit. Everyone assisted with the introductions, and a couple of folks volunteered to help out with the grill. Most important, though, was the guest list. When I thought about whom to invite, I realized just how much my life has changed over these last few years. I have people around me now who accept me as an autistic person, as myself, whether they use the word autistic to describe me or not. They know that I will sometimes make bird sounds or say things that don\u2019t make sense to them, or say nothing when something is clearly expected. Two people I had never met in person drove 400 miles to attend. As a result, a friendship already deeply important to me took on additional dimension and meaning. Another friend drove 70 miles, despite having other obligations for the day; he gave me a card with a parrot on it. Another friend brought a beautiful parrot pi\u00f1ata, knowing I would never allow it to be broken.Some of my friends are autistic, but most are not. Most of them are just people who don\u2019t mind discussing soda can collections, floor tile photography or the populations of major U.S. cities. People who speak to Squawkers McCaw, and look out for him when the wind kicks up and threatens to knock him from his perch. All of them strong enough to withstand some moments of silence, some expression of difference. People who were possibly surprised, yet not overly alarmed, that a few minutes after the ending time clearly stated on the party invitation, and without a word of warning to the few remaining, the host of the party had already left the building. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SB5WILshSGI/AAAAAAAABVE/RumxUkH7I04/s1600-h/party.2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SB5U_LshSDI/AAAAAAAABUs/RJqDZFVAdnU/s1600-h/party.1.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/major-stereotype-violation-party.html", "title": "\nMajor Stereotype Violation (Party Variety)\n"},

She wanted to let him know that the language on his website asking for help for people experiencing the \u201cburden of dealing with autism\u201d was offensive. Explaining that she and her sons are autistic, she asked, \u201cWhat, exactly, to you have against people like myself and my 2 sons that you want to prevent people like us from existing?\u201d She also inquired as to what plans Howard had for funds raised by his run across Canada. You can read more here.No response was made to that e-mail. Then on May 9, Jypsy and Alex were invited by Mike McCarther (Run the Dream\u2019s production manager) to meet Mr. Howard. She declined, referring him to the earlier e-mail. This is the reply she received:From: \"Mike McCarther\" Haha oh sh*t...That\u2019s all.Later she received an abrupt non-apology stating simply that the first message was in error and should be disregarded.It leaves me wondering, what were they thinking?How many times throughout the average person\u2019s life does she hear that autism is a tragedy, that autistic people are empty shells, kidnapped, soulless, missing, stolen, damaged, defective, poisoned, no longer there? Less than human? How many repetitions does it take before something is \u201clearned\u201d or taken as a fact? Why then, would it be necessary to treat such people with respect? They wouldn\u2019t notice would they? What better target then, to bombard with the anger and frustration we all have stored up? Need to blow off some steam? Here\u2019s someone who looks human, but is actually \u201cmissing.\u201d Have at it.If only it ended at rude language, well, that still wouldn\u2019t be acceptable, but we all know it doesn\u2019t end there. The consequences for people so thoroughly devalued by a society are grave and are well known. Still the major \u201ccharities\u201d persist in the rhetoric of devastation, believing that somehow the end they seek justifies any means.I belong to a group said to be lacking in social skills. Still, had I made such an \u201cerror\u201d (and I can\u2019t imagine who the intended recipient of that e-mail would have been), I would have known that an immediate, direct and personal apology was necessary. Though supposedly lacking a theory of mind, I\u2019d have realized that I\u2019d hurt someone.

During a single fall semester, Matthew was placed in a small time out room (or closet, depending on whom you ask) nearly eighty times. Sometimes he was locked in. Sometimes he came home from school with cuts and bruises. In one case he was taken to a hospital where doctors suspected abuse. This is called education.Mrs. Montgomery, quite understandably, decided to homeschool her son. The school has been clear: Matthew is to return to classes immediately. On May 8, Jeanie received a written warning, a final notice that she and her husband will face legal action unless they comply. Could the problem be that the Montgomerys have not followed the correct procedures? No, that's not it...From the Courier Journal: To receive home services, state law requires a signed physician's statement that the child's condition \"prevents or renders inadvisable attendance at school.\" Montgomery said she has provided two such letters from Matthew's pediatricians, the last one asking for more time for an independent psychological examination of the child. A March 28 letter from Dr. Jeff Wampler, with All Children Pediatrics, cited Matthew's autism and other health issues, including allergies and gastrointestinal problems, as a reason for requesting temporary homebound services. On an application the school requested, Wampler also cited investigation for abuse at school.\"In a follow-up letter to Oldham school officials on May 1, Dr. Jeffrey Burton said he believes Matthew may be suffering from fear and stress over his experiences at school and requested time for a psychologist's evaluation.\"I would encourage you to allow Matthew's parents more time and latitude before you start any type of legal proceeding,\" Burton wrote. But Coorssen said the school system does not believe the physicians' letters adequately detailed Matthew's medical problems.\"Those are just blanket statements you can get from anybody,\" she said.Now, I'm not an expert in this area, far from it. But it would seem logical that recurring bruises and abrasions, isolation for extended periods of time, these sorts of things in themselves are the \"conditions\" clearly making this young man's attendance at the school \"inadvisable.\" Logic, though, has no place in the paper factory. (Please read this post at Ed's Autism Page. It's important.) The lessons Matthew has learned from his school are not the kind that need more reinforcement. There will be plenty more chances for him to learn about cruelty, incompetence and intolerence.\"These are not easy cases, believe me,\" said Fendley (the county attorney in charge of truancy cases). \"This autism situation is going to be a difficult one.\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080519/ZONE09/805190421&referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL#pluckcomments", "http://eds-autism-blog.blogspot.com/2008/05/paper-factory.html", "http://eds-autism-blog.blogspot.com/2008/05/paper-factory.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/this-autism-situation.html", "title": "\nThis Autism Situation\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 21, 2008", "body": "\nSteve D., of One Dad's Opinion, recently posted about the definitions of normal, human, and fully functional. He and and some other bloggers had been asked by a researcher to define the terms independently and relative to one another. I also participated in the survey. Not surprisingly, my responses and Steve's share some common territory, diverging more stylistically than pragmatically. Of course, you have read his post right? Well, then go read it, okay? I'll wait.Did you read the comments? There were some good responses in the comments.Anyway, I figured my response is a bit too long to put in a comments section, so I told Steve I'd post it over here. As with everything, there's more than one way to answer a survey. Here's mine:Normal:Pertaining to norms, that which is average or close enough to it, usually not more than one standard deviation on a bell curve. Some people use the term normal to express value judgments, or in attempt to enforce conformity. People fear not being normal. It\u2019s primitive, I think, the fear of exclusion, because in difficult times exclusion can mean death.We live in difficult times.Fully-Functional:To be fully functional is to do whatever your society expects of you in the ways determined by those in power, who necessarily must be within the one standard deviation. To be a fully functional citizen, one must work at a job and pay her own way. If you don\u2019t have a job, it is your fault. The manager looked at you and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to work out.\u201d The manager is fully functional, in the Functionalist sense. He is keeping the riff-raff out.Human:Homo sapiens. A person. A man, woman or child. Except for Hitler. Oh, yeah, and Osama Bin Laden. And Charles Manson. Child abusers, sexual predators, sociopaths, murderers. These are a few of the labels people use alongside words like \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cmonster.\u201d The great Me / Not me dividing line. Which side am I on if I laugh when the others are crying?Normal, Human:I was a normal human, but broken. Couldn\u2019t get it together. Defective. You know you could do this, if only you tried. Yes, you are probably right. But I don\u2019t know how to \u201ctry.\u201dNormal, Fully Functional:I will work extra hard. Yes, I will arrive thirty minutes early. I will skip my break. I will volunteer for holidays. Then you will like me and keep me at this crappy job forever.Normal, Normal:You are perfect as you are. Take this pill. Now you are different. Now you are perfect as you are.Human, Human:Have you heard the story of the girl who cried all day, and I am not exaggerating, I mean all day, from 8AM until 6PM and maybe even longer, over a sad song on the radio? She was autistic, you know. Her parents did not know what to think. Especially later, when she didn\u2019t cry at funerals. They didn\u2019t know what to think. I will tell you a secret, though. The music at the funeral home was not very good. It wasn\u2019t functional.Fully Functional Normal Human:The pearl is in the river. There is a light that never goes out. Have you ever eaten a pine tree? Ticket! Ticket! These are a few of my scripts. Speech is sometimes required. This is how I can function.Human:Is not to have Super Powers. I have been invisible. At night, sometimes, too, I have flown.Human Normal Human:I tell you I have never wanted to be. Sometimes it would have been nice to be considered to be it but not to be it. No. I never wanted.Normal Human Functioning Fully:Eat. Work. Sleep. Play. Use the bathroom. Don\u2019t forget. Don\u2019t forget to flush.Normal:That which is broken.Normal:Losing its meaning.Normal:Laughing at videos of people slipping on ice.Human:Turning away.Normal:Turning away from human turning away from normal laughing at people slipping on ice.Fully functional:The leg will be fine in a few months.Normal:I am so happy it wasn\u2019t me.Human:Ouch for you, ouch for the other!Fully functional:\u201cThey, since they were not the one dead, turned to their\u2026\u201dNormal:Nonsense! You are hereby excluded.Human:Ouch.Normal:Boo hoo! Grow up, why don\u2019t you?Human:(Quiet, invisibly quiet, invisible)Fully functional:Choosing.Choosing to live anyway.In difficult times.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/05/definitions.html", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/05/definitions.html", "https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6202467949945153658&postID=5226713841249146503"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/normal.html", "title": "\nNormal\n"},

By a vote of 14 to 2, Barton was removed from the class. Since his \"eviction\" from the St. Lucie Co.

The reasons students gave for disliking Alex included that he is \"disgusting\" and \"annoying.\" Since February, the young man has been in the process of being evaluated for Asperger syndrome. Let me be clear: I don't care whether or not Alex is assigned a diagnostic label. I don't care what he did to be classified as \"disgusting.\" The behavior of this teacher is reprehensible. She has not disputed the allegation, but according to Port St. Lucie spokeswoman Michelle Steele, has confirmed that the incident did take place. Please help ensure that proper disciplinary action is taken. People with differences of all sorts deal with bullying from peers every day. It is no secret to many of us that teachers and others in authority can be bullies, too.

He had several friends with whom he corresponded by mail; he was well liked by his neighbors. When he was younger, he\u2019d worked at a racetrack. He lived an ordinary life.I worked in Roy\u2019s apartment building the last four years of his life. I noticed a few things about him, the way he stood, swaying, leaning so far back he seemed always on the verge of falling over, the way he walked, his head turned down and to one side. He had an intense stare, but this was not intimidating, as he tended to direct it near, but not at the eyes of the person he was speaking with. He wore the same style of shirt every day.Roy and I had some things in common, deeply entrenched patterns for navigating our days, and a love for drawing and coloring with crayons. Unlike most of his neighbors in the building, he took rules seriously, never leaving the community room without a lid covering his coffee, emptying his garbage daily, whether there was anything in it or not. Not once did anyone complain that his television was too loud.Roy was a great source of information, often arriving at my office or the community area to report the latest news of catastrophic weather around the globe or to inform me of the latest career move of one of his favorite news anchors. His talk was more a series of announcements than conversation. These visits were always the highlight of my work shift.Roy didn\u2019t cook. He was more than willing to try it, but his sisters felt sure he would be both safer and healthier if he got some help with that. They made arrangements with a local cafeteria owner to bring him hot meals each day. On the weekends, his sisters picked up his laundry, and took him shopping or to their house or a park or the farmer\u2019s market. Ordinary stuff.I never asked Roy or any of his family if he had an autism diagnosis. I suspect he didn\u2019t, and it really doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t think his neighbors thought of him as especially different. Someone would check up on him when his family was out of town, but the same is true for many of the building\u2019s other residents. He fit in there.Each Mother\u2019s Day, Roy explained to me, using the same words, that his mother had passed away. He carried her portrait with him to Mother\u2019s Day Mass at the church he attended weekly.Some time before he died, Roy\u2019s doctor informed him that he had a few months left to live. The doctor took his time explaining, making sure Roy understood. He asked if Roy had any questions. He thought for a minute. He did have one. \u201cWhat do you think about that new airplane?\u201d he asked. \u201cI heard it\u2019s as big as two football fields.\u201dRoy died Thursday morning, May 22, 2008. He was 79 years old. He was my friend, and I will miss him.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SDomJk2PN1I/AAAAAAAABWU/YnYPj-1LScU/s1600-h/KY.Roy.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/roy.html", "title": "\nRoy\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, May 27, 2008", "body": "\nSome of my posts are for informational purposes. Others are meant to entertain while providing insight into the life of one person on the autism spectrum. Still others are intended to incite action. In the case of the terrible treatment of Alex Barton, I hoped that those of us who blog on Autism Hub, along with other fair minded bloggers might succeed in directing some media attention to a situation that looked as if it could end up buried on page 8, never being seen by the general public, those who don't follow autism related news as closely as some of us do. I also hoped that this would offer solace and encouragement to the Barton family.When Autism Hub played a part, along with ASAN, in having the Ransom Notes Campaign pulled, I was proud to be involved in that. While I still believe that Wendy Portillo needs to be removed from the classroom, that a public apology needs to be made, I am not proud of what this campaign has become.I am not trying to take credit for the attention the case has gotten. I played a very small part in organizing this; others have done more to ensure that the injustice was brought to light. But for my part, I do feel a responsibility to say that from where I sit, it is time to wait. Wait and see what happens in Florida. If further action is needed, we will be here.I have begun to consider that Ms. Portillo is perhaps a person who found herself in a job she was not suited for, without the proper training, someone who never should have been in the teaching profession. The problems which led up to the events in Port St. Lucie are systemic, and will need to be addressed at that level. Around the web, you can find comments stating that she did the right thing, that children must be made to behave through any means available. You will also find people saying she should be harmed emotionally and/or physically for her crime. I've heard that she is undeserving of life. This is not acceptable to me. I have made terrible mistakes in my life. I have harmed people. I have done my best to make amends for those wrongs and not to repeat the hurtful actions. I know that if my worst moments were shown to the world, were discussed on numerous sites, some with nearly a thousand comments now, I would not want to continue living. Yet I believe in redemption (not in a passive sense, but through hard work toward change) and I hope that others, including Portillo, do too. When people start coming to my blog and talking about revenge and sending people to hell, it is time to take a break.Sometimes the lines between right and wrong can be fuzzy, and that is not the case here. What happened to Alex never should have happened, and should not be allowed to happen again. For the sake of the other Alexes, those whose names are not in the spotlight, it is time to turn our attention toward the larger societal problems, those which allow bullying to occur, not just in one school in Florida, but throughout this nation. This is just one autistic person's opinion. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/why-i-am-closing-comments-on-two-posts.html", "title": "\nWhy I am closing the comments on two posts\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 28, 2008", "body": "\nMark Mitchell (not his real name) was regarded as a trouble maker by his teachers, and a \u201cnerd\u201d by fellow students. He was the Alex Barton of my grade school class. He was considered \u201cannoying\u201d\u2014 he interrupted people, talked too loud, and snorted when he laughed. Some surely thought he was \u201cdisgusting\u201d or \u201cgross\u201d\u2014 his clothes were often dirty or stained by spilled food and drinks; his nose seemed always to be running, and he burped with alarming frequency. Something was always unzipped or haphazardly buttoned. Worst of all, he cried easily, something completely unacceptable for boys over five.Mark\u2019s name was next to my name in the roll book. He sat beside me or in front of me every year from first through sixth grade. He lived in my neighborhood, just a couple of blocks away.There were a lot of Marks in my class some years. The teachers referred to Mark Mitchell as \u201cthe bad Mark.\u201d His papers were always a mess, and sometimes his homework was incomplete. He was an enigma, a boy who talked about nothing but science, obviously bright, but barely maintaining a C-minus average.Mark moved awkwardly, his speech was halting and nasal; he wore outdated clothing styles, and never figured out how to join a group of kids who were playing. As the class scapegoat, he kept me safely invisible. Fewer people noticed my less pronounced awkwardness. Since I hardly ever spoke, interrupting was hardly a problem. Mark served a purpose in my life beyond even the purpose he served for the more typical students. They needed someone to serve as an example of what they were not, all that was uncool and thus contemptible. I needed Mark to be that person, so I didn\u2019t have to be.I didn\u2019t know any of this then. I knew that I was different, but when I say I was invisible, this is barely an exaggeration. My M.O. was staying off the radar. During recess, I played alone, making up stories in my head or examining the rocks at the edges of the property. I was good at not noticing certain things. Sometimes I think I chose isolation so I didn\u2019t have to notice it choosing me. It worked fairly well for me, as long as someone else was around to be the bad Mark.I was returning from vacation with my family, riding in the back seat of the car, when I heard Mark\u2019s name on the radio. The small plane his father had been piloting had crashed; Mark, his parents and his sister had all died. We had just started seventh grade, at a much larger school. He got out of it. That was what I thought.For the next few weeks, there was a lot of talk about Mark around school. No one had anything bad to say now. For most of us, this was the first time we had known someone our own age, one of us, so suddenly gone. I wondered if the other kids felt bad about the way they\u2019d treated him. They seemed to have forgotten all that. History was rewriting itself. For many, many reasons, probably none of them having a thing to do with Mark, my life was about to get a lot more difficult. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/bad-mark.html", "title": "\nThe Bad Mark\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 30, 2008", "body": "\nYesterday, I recieved an email from a father of a young man with Asperger syndrome. He included the text of this email, which he sent to his son's school, and which he thought might be useful to other parents struggling with feelings of rage and frustration, along with concerns for the safety of thier children. He has kindly agreed to have it posted here, in case others would be interested in taking similar action:Good Morning,As most of you are aware my son, his name, has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. He is now 16 years old and can still tell you word for word the cruel things that some of the kids in his kindergarten class and our neighborhood said to him. He is also now doing very well in school and is popular with both teachers and the few friends who spend any time getting to know him.This link will take you to the CBS newscast of the story that has broken my heart for 5 year old Alex Barton and his Mom, Melissa Barton, too: http://www.breitbart.tv/html/103693.htmlThis link will take you to an Asperger\u2019s Syndrome support site with some additional details about the story, as well as links regarding the card and letter writing campaign I am asking each of you to consider taking part in:http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/not-special-support-alex-barton.htmlAdditionally, I would like to ask you to forward this information to your own School system\u2019s School Board and ask that they initiate some kind of educational requirement or in service training for the teachers so that more situations like this can be avoided for these beautiful young people as they try to take their place in theworld.Thanks in advance for yoursupport,SignatureOf course this can be edited to suit individual needs; linking to this blog is certainly not a requirement for using it!I have been planning to update my sidebar for some time, and am in the process of doing so now. I have added a link list of anti-bullying resources. I also recommend visiting lastcrazyhorn's blog, Odd One Out. She has written some very insightful posts on bullying and its consequences, and also has a link list focusing on specific articles on bullying.The topic of teachers who bully their students has not been widely researched, but there are a couple of interesting papers available online. One is a very recently submitted master's thesis by Susan Marie Reschny of the University of Saskatchewan. Lengthy, but well worth the read, this is a qualitative study focusing on parents' perceptions and concluding with suggestions for administrators, school boards and other stakeholders to address the problem.Alan McEvoy's Teachers Who Bully Students: Patterns and Implications has a lot to say about the abuse of power and tactics used by these teachers, tactics that will come as no surprise to anyone who has experienced bullying of any variety (shifting attention to the victim's behavior, attempts to convince victims they are \"paranoid or crazy\"). This is a pilot study which used convenience sampling, but it surely supports the need for more extensive research in the area of teachers who bully.There are a few books which offer advice on bullying for students on the spectrum and their parents. Nick Dubin's Asperger Syndrome and Bullying: Strategies and Solutions discusses the topic from the viewpoint of a former victim. Discussing the importance of educating peers, addressing the issue of bystanders, and highlighting the importance of helping kids on the spectrum recognize bullying for what it is, this book covers a lot of ground.These are just a few resources; there are many more available which I will add when I have the time.

Connecting with an old friend, I swear to myself I won\u2019t do it this time, but chances are, I will. My social needs seem much less pronounced than those of most people I know. Other times I crave companionship, but find myself unable to move toward it, stuck. And the urge passes, I am happy again with solitude.At parties or gatherings, I am the one at the edge of the property, brushing the grass, arranging the stones. I am the one on the sidewalk, in the street, gone out for something someone might need. I once had a group of friends who tagged me \u201cthe stroller.\u201d She\u2019s gone on one of her strolls, they\u2019d say, knowing I\u2019d be back eventually for a few minutes at a time, as much as I could stand.When I wandered away from this blog, that was accidental. I hadn\u2019t realized how hard I would find the many transitions I had scheduled for September, starting graduate school, starting a new job, moving to a new place. I wandered away from myself this time, and I\u2019m not sure how to get back. Writing Asperger Square 8 is important to me, it\u2019s become a part of my identity and I don\u2019t feel exactly complete without it. Still I wonder how I\u2019ll find the time, and whether or not I have anything left to say. Afraid showing up here at all is akin to making a promise I might not be able to keep. So I\u2019ll approach it the way I go into a presentation. I never know if it will work or not, if words will be available to grab one by one and assemble into sentences, if those sentences will communicate what I mean. I do it anyway, sometimes telling the people who come to listen, things will go wrong and this is a part of the story. The true picture of what autism means in my life cannot leave out the fluctuations, the disappearing and reappearing of interests and abilities, the uncertainty of so many things. I am here today, and I have something I want to write about later this week. Whether I\u2019ll follow through with that or not or disappear again remains to be seen.I want to say thank you to everyone who commented here or emailed me to ask if I was okay.

{"date": "Monday, October 6, 2008", "body": "\nThis poster is in response to PETA's \"Got Autism\" campaign. For background, see the message below from Ari Ne'eman of ASAN.Hello all,Recently, the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) launched a new ad campaign entitled, \"Got Autism?\", misleadingly implying that the consumption of milk is associated with the cause of the autism spectrum. PETA is misinforming the public about autism and thus joining a long line of unscrupulous groups that have sought to try and spread fear about autism as a means of pushing their particular agendas.Attempts such as these treat individuals with disabilities as pawns in the efforts of other constituencies. By refusing to acknowledge the right of the autistic community to be referred to with respect instead of as the focus of public hysteria, PETA contributes to a state of affairs which marginalizes the disability community. People with disabilities, our families and our supporters deserve better than the exploitation and fear-mongering that comes about when disability is used as a means of scaring the general populace. For millions across the globe, the answer to PETA's \"Got Autism?\" question is an unequivocal yes. That should not spell the end of our lives or prevent us from being fully included throughout society. By exploiting us, PETA becomes a culprit in the social forces that marginalize people with disabilities and lead to the discrimination and prejudice that truly disable us.Let PETA know how you feel about its choice to exploit autistic people by writing to them at info@peta.org or call them at 757-622-7382 and dial 0.

We are doing the usual first day introduction thing, what is your name, where did you get your bachelor\u2019s degree\u2026what are your areas of interest. Mine haven\u2019t changed much since I started back to school a few years ago. Autism. Needs of adults on the spectrum, employment, higher education, services for general living type problems. Recognition of basic human rights. I talk for a minute or so, and everyone else does too, and then we are on to the lesson, three hours long.It\u2019s tiring to sit for that long, and when it\u2019s over I\u2019m out of my seat and out the door, moving fast, down the stairs, down the path to the parking lot. Someone is behind me, catching up as I finally make it to my van. \u201cAutism\u2026\u201d she wants to talk. I\u2019ve had enough of these conversations that I know not to expect any questions about the particular areas of interest I mentioned. The questions I get are nearly always about supporting children. I don\u2019t pretend to know a lot about raising children, I don\u2019t have any. I was a child once, though, one who had a lot to say, and not very much ability to say any of it. I know what that feels like and the damage that can be done with a roll of the eyes, an exasperated sigh.I get these thoughts lined up in my mind, like a row of similar objects, ready to pull the one I need, depending on the question. Usually, the question will be about a behavior issue or an educational concern. I know about some resources nearby; I know the names of some professionals who respect autistic ways of being. I hope I will be some help to this person. She has finished the question. She\u2019s waiting while my mind catches up. Inside my head the possible questions and answers fall like dominoes. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s the vaccines?\u201d Now I hear it. Look at the pavement. No. I say it slow, more slowly than I mean to, raise my head slowly to meet her eyes. A jumble of words greets me. It\u2019s hard to know\u2026so many children\u2026Jenny McCarthy\u2026I counter with a few of my own. Polio. Measles. Death. Preventable. Yes, this matters, it matters a lot. It\u2019s not my area of expertise, and I prefer to pass these questions along to people who explain these things far better than I do. But when the question keeps coming to me, what can I do? No mention is ever made of the reason for her interest. A person in her life? Autistic? I still don\u2019t know. Maybe I should stop saying I have an interest in autism. Somebody always seems to think it means causes, treatments, cures, or numbers. No, I wanted to tell her. That's not it. I meant autistic people. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-jenny-matters.html", "title": "\nWhy Jenny matters\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 3, 2008", "body": "\nI lost a friend this week. I had known her a little over a year; she was a private person, so I\u2019ll not be giving her name or identifying information. She died in an accident early this week.Some friends become important because of things we have in common. I met this woman because of something we had in common\u2014Asperger syndrome. She had contacted me at the suggestion of a mutual friend, hoping I could direct her to a group for adults. When I couldn\u2019t, we decided to form one. It took a long time to put the plan into action, but we did it. In the meantime, we met in coffee shops to discuss autism and our lives in general.Through these meetings, I became aware of how much she and I didn\u2019t have in common, the ways we differed. There were a lot. She had little interest in advocacy, at least the way I was used to using the term. She was not a reader of Autism Hub and had never heard of Neurodiversity. She was interested in biomedical interventions.My friend had been in a work-related accident a few years earlier. This was something which seriously affected her health for the rest of her life; she was sure that she would not have been involved if she had been more adept at interpreting the subtext of language and behaviors going on around her. Knowing the full story, I believe she is correct in this. She suffered the consequences of the unethical actions of others. She knew this, too, but I\u2019m not sure she ever got past blaming herself or her disability.I advocate for societal interventions for many reasons. One of them isn\u2019t that I think autistic people have no need of personal interventions. My friend worked hard to increase her social understanding and to be a productive citizen. She took self defense and learned to stand up to bullies. She shared information and resources freely with others who might benefit. She listened to people no one had ever listened to before. She listened with empathy.Quickly, she became the emotional center of our group, offering acceptance and the wealth of her experience. I was enriched by caring for someone whose views I found so often in opposition to mine. I never stopped arguing my own position that the changes that needed to occur were not in our neurology. She never stopped talking about vitamins and supplements. We managed to get along.In the days following her death, I obsessed, in unsurprising fashion, about the parrot she\u2019d left behind. She\u2019d had a beautiful African Grey, a bird she had tutored in two languages. Who would care for him, that was all I could think about for awhile. It was a way of grieving, different from some, but no worse. When I knew the parrot was okay, only then, I was able to turn my attention to the person I had known, to register that loss, to start the process of goodbye.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SG2Mry9S3vI/AAAAAAAABao/8Kx35H--yJQ/s1600-h/african.grey.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/07/some-kind-of-goodbye.html", "title": "\nSome kind of goodbye\n"},

Based on my own experience, this story explains how two simple and inexpensive accommodations could have prevented my leaving a job I had for seven years. It is a dramatic tale of deteriorating relationships with managers, as neither they nor I could understand why I was unable to adjust to the new requirements for making bread. After a series of these \"magazines\" about misunderstandings on the job and how some of these can be addressed, it's important to note that autistic workers do not always require accommodations, and can in fact be among the most valuable employees in a company.

{"date": "Thursday, July 10, 2008", "body": "\nThis was a pretty tough crowd. No one laughed at my introduction slide, which was marked clearly \u2014 Introduction: This is a social convention\u2014 or my earnest explanation of how and why one should say hello to a new acquaintance. Well, it was four in the afternoon, the last of a day full of sessions. The room was packed and it was hot in there. There had been a delay setting up the equipment, so everyone attending my session had to watch as the projector was set up, microphone adjusted, internet connection checked. So I didn\u2019t worry too much at first.When, by the third or fourth piece of silliness, hardly anyone had cracked a smile, I had an idea. Could it be happening\u2026again? I asked them. \u201cDid anyone think it was funny, when I talked about introductions\u2026or did you think I was serious?\u201dYep. That was it. They thought I\u2019d meant to explain to them the importance of saying hello. Now we could all relax a bit, and have a laugh at our misunderstandings, at this unintentional exercise in understanding the Theory of Mind concept. You see, I thought I\u2019d understood well enough. Here was a group of pretty sophisticated professionals, mostly OVR and Supported Employment specialists who were not going to be fooled into thinking that a diagnosis of AS would necessarily mean 1) no sense of humor and 2) poor understanding of basic social niceties. But they weren\u2019t sure. They were keeping quiet until they were better able to assess the situation. Laughing at someone\u2019s differences, at someone\u2019s expense, was not their intention.In short, I\u2019d assumed a shared point of reference, and it wasn\u2019t there. Probably, this is the thing most responsible for the question I hear more than any other in everyday conversations:  Are you serious?Yes, much of my humor depends on the viewer or listener having experienced the same input I have, and having interpreted it in a similar way. That shared history, whether through popular culture or classic literature, plays an important part in any humor. For the autistic person, one who tends to take a strong interest in a few topics rather than a general interest in many topics, the opportunities to share humor can be somewhat reduced. There is a fairly narrow audience for jokes about the Amish Anomaly or the Sally-Anne test.  (Brick walls don't get many laughs, either.)So that was problem one, the assumption that my audience would be familiar enough with autism stereotypes as stereotypes to know when they were being tweaked in a funny direction. Of course non-verbal communications (body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, etc.) can serve as cues that something is intended as a joke. I can use this to good effect sometimes. Think of the humor of Steven Wright, all the more funny because he appears not to know he is funny. But sometimes, a flat affect is just a flat affect. Sometimes it confuses people who are used to a little more inflection or finesse.Yesterday, I was not having a great speech day. I felt like I was trying to lasso words while riding a horse that kept rearing up or breaking into a gallop. I didn\u2019t have anything left in me for finesse. Better to stick to the script, hope for the best. I walked through the rest of the slides, alternating the absurd with the serious, often combining the two in semi-haphazard fashion, as I\u2019m inclined to. The Detective magazine stories worked well in encouraging group discussion. By the time I got to those, a number of myths had been questioned, and everyone seemed more relaxed and less afraid of saying the wrong thing or giggling at the wrong time.Afterward, I had one less standard question to answer. I got it last time, and the time before, but here, it had already been covered. I can usually tell when this one is coming. It\u2019s practically the opposite of the one that comes up in conversations. Someone steps forward nervously. I\u2019m not sure if I should\u2026or\u2026I mean how to say it\u2026but\u2026do you\u2026do you know? Do you know you are funny?Well, yeah, sometimes.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SHbDrMYsPgI/AAAAAAAABdU/n166Q8QHcss/s1600-h/introduction.png", "http://www.apse.org/", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=32", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/01/deconstructing-sally-anne.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/07/are-you-serious.html", "title": "\nAre You Serious?\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, July 17, 2008", "body": "\nII was on the phone. This was several years ago, before I had a name to describe what was going on with me. I was trying to figure out what had gone wrong that morning and what was continuing, throughout the afternoon, to go wrong.My friend had invited me over on a Saturday morning. There was a serious topic to be discussed, something personal, between the two of us. The invitation had been issued on Wednesday. On Friday, something had changed. A plan had been made with several other people to have breakfast at the first person\u2019s house. I was invited.Since there had not been a time set for the serious discussion, I asked at this time. Would the serious discussion still be occurring? Of course, I was told. After the breakfast, there would be plenty of time.Now, I knew that a chatty breakfast for five was not what I needed right before the serious discussion. I needed to get my thoughts together, I needed some quiet reflection time. If I chose to put a lot of energy into trying to be social, there was no way I was going to have sufficient language skills when it came time for the serious discussion. So I declined the invitation to breakfast, although I knew this would be seen as unfriendly and wrong. At the time, I wasn\u2019t able to explain about the energy drain that occurs with conversing. Not because I didn\u2019t know about it. I did. But because, since Everyone said I was being ridiculous or making excuses or \u201cgiving in\u201d to my anxiety disorder (diagnosed by Everyone), I figured they must be right somehow. I must be a hostile, or at least unfriendly, person.This was where I made the big mistake. I asked what time I should expect to come over. When the answer was vague, I asked my friend to call when the breakfast was over and the time for the serious discussion had arrived. At this point, the friend lost all patience with me. She let me know that I was manipulative and demanding and all kinds of difficult. Why couldn\u2019t I accept this slight change in plans, show up at her house without a specific time, without knowing for sure who would be there? How hard could it be?In my mind, I saw a large pitcher of liquid representing my communicative resources. Already, a quarter had been drained, in the effort to find a non-offensive way to get my question answered. I pictured the rest of it spilling out as I tried to balance it like some sort of circus animal performing tricks of conversation. Everything I knew about the topic of the serious discussion had reverted to a form that wasn\u2019t compatible with words. I couldn\u2019t get it back.I think we will have to do this another time. I said something like that. It was around 1:00 in the afternoon by now, and I was getting tired. Before she hung up the phone, my friend remarked that it certainly would be nice if, in the future, I\u2019d make just the slightest effort toward accommodating others.  IIToday, I was involved in a conversation about the classic \u201ctriad of impairment\u201d concept. (Personally, I prefer to call this a \"triad of differences.\") I thought about the story of the serious discussion that never was. Was this a communication problem or a social issue? What part did the infamous \u201cinsistence on sameness\u201d play in the way my friend and I had perceived the situation? Are these three facets of autism independent features, or do they interact to make something unique? Is this a useful or valid way of thinking about autism? Is all this stuff in the eye of the beholder anyway? I thought I would take another look at this story with those questions in mind.For my friend, the key issue was probably my need for things to be exactly as stated. She saw a very inflexible person, someone unable to tolerate a change in plans. Indeed, this has been a constant theme throughout my life. I wonder if non-autistic people think much about the reasons this is true for some of us on the spectrum. In my case, at least, there is an overwhelming sense of unpredictability that is a part of my very being. From one day to the next, from one hour to the next, I am never sure how well I will be able to speak. I still have days when, no matter how sincerely I have formed the intent to speak, no matter how clear the thought is in my mind, no words come out. At other times, words tumble out unpredictably, announcing irrelevant information or stating something tangential or even in opposition to what I am thinking.Speech isn\u2019t the only area where this happens, but it is the most frequent and obvious example. It is possible the issues I have with oral communication are at the root of a wide range of repetitive needs, from the physical stims that I use to keep myself moving to the so-called perseverative interests which hold my attention in part because of their reliability.While my insistence on sameness was, on the surface, the thing that annoyed my friend, deeper inspection would have revealed that she saw my primary problem as a social one. She had said to me on several occasions that I was afraid of people and just needed more practice socializing to become more comfortable.There is some truth in the idea that I was (sometimes am) afraid of people, especially in groups. It is clear to me how I learned this fear. I learned it through experience with many, many people who reacted to me as if I were somewhat less than competent. I learned that my ways of communicating were not acceptable and would not be tolerated by most. I came to believe that I would be either ignored or mocked or vilified or patronized if I dared to appear in a group of people. I believe these reactions resulted mostly from the way I talked or didn\u2019t talk, as well as my differences in understanding and transmitting non-verbal cues.I think now that the way I see the day of the serious discussion is not at all the way my friend would describe it. I always thought that if I could only explain to the people in my life what I was thinking, they\u2019d see I wasn\u2019t so different after all. The fact that I am so often unable to do this through speech, that is the central point for me, the key to understanding and describing my own autism. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/07/serious-discussion.html", "title": "\nA serious discussion\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, July 26, 2008", "body": "\nISomebody quacked. Somebody screeched. Then came a yelp in a lower register. Tourette\u2019s maybe? That was my first thought. It happened again. Quack, screech, YELP, the same exact cadence. I was enjoying it somewhat. Once in awhile I will chirp or trill, but I was quiet for this ride. Quack, screech, YELP. The man in front of me was getting angry. I could see his neck turning red and his eyes narrowing as he tried to concentrate on his book. On the next quack, he turned sharply to the young men behind me. Would you be quiet? Because that is very rude. Briefly, there was nervous laughter, as the offender(s) seemed to debate whether or not compliance was warranted. Not Tourettes? Was the quacking voluntary? How much did it matter?Squawkers McCaw was tucked in a messenger bag. We had had a good day, riding a trolley down to Chicago\u2019s Navy Pier, interacting with other tourists, coming back in a taxi. The cab driver had been fascinated by Squawkers, asking him questions, and even inviting him to sing. But first he\u2019d asked the same question so many others do upon seeing this bird: Is it real? Now I found myself on the \u2018L\u2019, wondering something similar.I\u2019d heard it many times during the day. Is it real? A woman in front of the art gallery had jumped as if he might bite her. A baby had startled, her eyes full of fear. A waiter on his way to work had stopped to talk, and then scoffed, and then expounded on levels of \u201crealness\u201d\u2014\u201cWell, he\u2019s not a figment of my imagination\u2026\u201d What was real and what wasn\u2019t had become the theme of my two and a half day trip to Chicago.IIMeanwhile, around the web, discussions continued regarding Michael Savage\u2019s claims that 99% of all autism is no more than bad behavior. I\u2019d left my computer at home; this trip was about having fun, not working. Sometimes I forget how the two can\u2019t really be separated. Anyway, this meant I stayed out of most of the discussion online. Before leaving home, I\u2019d seen some commentary I\u2019d found somehow more disturbing than Savage\u2019s original remarks. Neurodiversity is to blame for this backlash, the anger intended for fakes like me is falling on \u201creal autistics.\u201d The one percent? Of course. Of course this is how some people would spin it. I needed a break from this noise.IIIReal autism means having different social needs and it means having different ways of communication, as well as obsessions or repetitive behaviors. Ticket, ticket, ticket. This is the word I use to say hey, that car is about to hit us or I need to stop for a drink of water or that is an amazing view of the skyline. Ticket comes out easily, and I know what I mean, and the people with me are somewhat used to it now.Ticket. I have something to tell you. This is not the \u201creal\u201d me. The real me is the one you know from the blog, okay? The written me. This is just my physical presence, stumbling along the best it knows how.IVIn another universe, real autism means screaming and silence. I have known these things too. More of the silence than the screaming, but I\u2019ve done a fair amount of expressing myself in these less conventional ways.You are a freak! This was what my co-worker said when I shut myself in the walk in cooler and howled or hit myself over and over on the head with a clipboard. Sometimes the words are there right behind my mouth, locked in a traffic jam that won\u2019t clear up until the emotional rush hour has passed. Sometimes they are far away or in a dark tunnel; they will emerge in time. When I was howling, I\u2019ll say, I meant that I could not fulfill your two conflicting requests at once. Why are you talking about it now, she will say. You are a freak.VAt the Art Institute of Chicago, I try on a chain mail glove. Rough and smooth at the same time, just the right kind of heavy. I am craving a weighted vest. I don\u2019t know what I want or expect from it, probably something like this. I know exactly where my hand is in space. I feel alert and powerful. Energized. Reluctantly, I remove the glove and feel like I\u2019ve taken off my glasses instead. My edges blur, I return to my normal state, less clearly defined to myself, if no less real.VIThe quack and screech on the train didn\u2019t matter to me. The noise was disruptive in much the same way the loud chatter of people on cell phones and the ubiquitous honking of horns was. Once it occurred to me the yelps might be the workings of a neurology which demanded them, the contrary thought that this wasn\u2019t the case had less room to maneuver, less power to offend. Maybe this was one of those behaviors that, while voluntary, can be suppressed only with great effort and at the expense of energy needed to function in other areas. I have a few of those myself. Ticket. It had cost me nothing to assume the quacking was necessary.What does matter about this, about the Savage view of autism, is that it discourages tolerance in a world where tolerance is so scarce already. What hasn\u2019t been as widely recognized is how the language used by autism charities and others calling themselves advocates has contributed to the slippery slope down which the filth of Michael Savage\u2019s words came sliding. How can people accept \u201ctrain wreck,\u201d \u201ctsunami,\u201d and all of the other inappropriate, harmful terms used in speaking of autism, only to turn indignant when somebody dares to call autistic children \u201cbrats?\u201d Where was the anger at \u201cburden\u201d and \u201cempty shell\u201d and false analogies to cancer and abduction? I saw plenty of the \u201cneurodiverse\u201d write against these things, but what about those \u201cadvocates\u201d who insisted such complaints were trivial?Note: for an excellent commentary on this topic, see this post at Whose Planet is it Anyway?VIIMeanwhile, a man threatens to burn down a house where a boy spins in the front yard. Meanwhile a mother and child are denied service at a restaurant. A family is ejected from an airplane. A child is evicted from his kindergarten class, a family is banned from attending church, a teen is given a series of shocks at the Judge Rotenberg Center for the crime of standing when he had been ordered to sit. Another autistic adult is denied a job, another is fired, another is banned from a retail shop. On and on and on.Do these things matter only if they happen to someone you have decided is the \u201creal\u201d autistic? Where is the line that defines discrimination?As always, those with power will define what is \u201creal\u201d for the rest. Power is not just in money and status, but also in the currency of language.

Quite a switch from the usual approach, but that\u2019s what you get at USD: true collaboration and support, rather than attempts at changing, fixing or eliminating autistic people.I am happy to report that a group of Autism Hub bloggers has been invited to present at the conference to be held June 23 through 25. As some of you know, Steve, Do\u2019C, and I were at the winter conference for a breakout session. This time, we will do two breakouts and a full session, presenting to the entire group of conference attendees. Rounding out the group will be Estee Klar-Wolfond and yep, you heard right, Autism Diva.The conference will be held at USD\u2019s Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace and Justice. You can find the daily schedule here and a brief description of our presentations here. I hope that some regular Hub readers will be able to join us to discuss some important issues, including self-advocacy, parenting, acceptance of differences, and how to tell the difference between science and science fiction.Again, we have Steve D. to thank for working with the folks at USD to enable our participation. There is still time to register! Join us there if you are able, and please help us spread the word. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SDZNzk2PNzI/AAAAAAAABWE/5EO8WRm8n7g/s1600-h/hub.poster.png", "http://www.sandiego.edu/autisminstitute/conferences/summerconference.php", "http://www.onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/", "http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/", "http://www.sandiego.edu/autisminstitute/documents/Daily%20Schedule%20Summer%2008.pdf", "http://www.sandiego.edu/autisminstitute/documents/Session%20Descriptions%20Summer%2008.pdf", "http://www.usd-online.org/course.aspx?id=1534"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/05/work-with-me.html", "title": "\nWork With Me\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 15, 2008", "body": "\n2005-2006Perfect. It was for the first year or two, anyway. The building was quiet, the community room empty by 9:00 PM every night. That gave me three uninterrupted hours to read and study, with no obligation to talk to anyone unless there was an emergency. Even in the hours before nine o\u2019clock, I had plenty of time to myself most nights. My job consisted of taking care of small problems, answering the phone once or twice in an evening, answering the door if someone didn\u2019t know how to reach a resident in order to be buzzed in. My primary purpose was to be there if the fire department or an ambulance was needed.Sometimes people wanted to talk, of course, but not so many that this ever became overwhelming. The residents had interesting stories to tell. Once in awhile, someone brought me a sandwich or a piece of cake. I had to work weekends and holidays, but I\u2019ve done that with every job I\u2019ve had, I\u2019m used to it. Holidays really aren\u2019t my favorite times of year anyway.2007-2008Okay, it\u2019s not the perfect job anymore. As residents have moved on, others have taken their places. The turnover has been significant. The building is louder now, with people socializing more, watching TV until 11:00 or later in the community room near my office. People have gotten used to me too (yes, it usually takes about 2 years) and I have more and more of them wanting to talk. Still, the job is easy, and leaves me some time for writing, and this is good.SUMMER 2008Now it is time to leave. I took this job when I went back to school. I\u2019ve often thought I would not have made the decision to finish college if I\u2019d had the job first. The misery of other jobs I\u2019d had certainly contributed to my desire to earn a degree. This is a job I might have been happy in until I was old enough to retire.TWO WEEKS AGOIt looked like that might happen until, a couple of weeks ago, I was offered a research assistantship that will finance my graduate studies. The project I\u2019ll be working on is a new postsecondary inclusion initiative, designed to facilitate the transition to college for students with intellectual disabilities. This seems like an ideal fit for my interests, and I am very fortunate to have the opportunity.I gave notice at the security job.LAST WEEKThey have found a replacement for me already! What have I done? This job is my security. The boss likes me, I can do the work. Who ever heard of an autistic social worker? Now I will have harder classes and a demanding job, too! I must be rapidly approaching the limits of my social aptitude. I must have been out of my mind. I think I will curl up in a ball in the corner and stay there until\u2026THIS WEEKENDThere is a goodbye party. It\u2019s low key, no one expects a speech or any tears. A co-worker comes in to take over the phone so I can have some free time. The person who will take my job is here. I tell her I am both excited and afraid for my new life. Well, she says, what do you expect, going back to school at an age where most people are starting to think about retirement? That\u2019s an exaggeration of course. Hey, I\u2019m not even 50 yet.Still, it reminds me how I got here. Sometimes a person isn\u2019t ready for college at 18. Sometimes a child starts speaking at 4 or 6 or even 12. When I was 12, I had the reasoning skills of an average 18 year old, but at 18, I did not have (at least not consistently) the social skills or oral communicative ability of even an average 12 year old. Since I\u2019ve learned about autism, I\u2019ve realized this has been the perfectly normal course of my development. Since I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve come to understand that there are infinite options for a life, not just the few cookie cutter designs that seem sometimes to be on offer. There will be consequences, of course, but I can write my own plan, define success or failure on my terms.It is time to say goodbye to the job that has been my safety net. I get a clear message from the party, not just that I have been appreciated and will be missed, something more meaningful than that. I\u2019ve been accepted here. I\u2019ve been seen. It\u2019s written in red icing. Squawkers\u2019 name is on the cake. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SKXSKJ9WIRI/AAAAAAAACGs/rykSBOKoOy8/s1600-h/sqmc_cake.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/08/o-perfect-aspie-job-goodbye.html", "title": "\nO Perfect Aspie Job, Goodbye\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 7, 2008", "body": "\nThis was something I did. I never knew why, I\u2019m still not sure I can explain. With the best of intentions, I\u2019d enter the store. With or without a list, it happened either way. The list, if I had one, was perfectly ordered, the way I\u2019d learned from my dad. You visualize the store, writing each item in order, checking it off as acquired. Efficient, yes.But something happened as I entered the produce aisle. I changed my mind. Over and over I changed it. Though I\u2019d been clear about what I\u2019d wanted, I couldn\u2019t imagine why. The pros and cons of Swiss Steak and vegetable soup swirled endlessly under the bright lights. Onion. I need that for either one. Onion. It\u2019s on the list. Check. Everything smelled good and terrible at the same time. Vegetable soup. Potatoes, carrots, tomato. Green beans and corn. Should I make it with V8 juice this time? On to the next aisle.V8 juice and Worcestershire Sauce. Worcestershire, harder to say than it is to spell. That goes in Swiss Steak, too. I could have mushrooms in it. The sound system in the grocery store has a filter that turns happy music to sad. I don\u2019t know how they do it or why. Maybe people eat more when they are sad. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so loud. To remind them: You Are Sad. You are sad and here are the Twinkies.Nauseating, the thought of Twinkies. I can\u2019t eat anything with that white fluff in it. Why did I let myself think of it? Twinkie, Twinkie, Twinkie. I\u2019m not feeling so good. Worcestershire back to the counter. I have some at home. Is it enough? For what? I can\u2019t put it back, too many people standing in front of the condiments, reading ingredients. Worcestershire has anchovies in it. That doesn\u2019t ruin it for me. Things have things in them all of the time.It\u2019s not just the lights and the music. The crowds are the worst part. The shoving, the smells, the voices all blending together into one huge blahblahblah. I\u2019ve never learned how to not run into someone. Whether I think about it consciously or not, I will choose wrong nearly every time. Someone is screaming, a child who must feel the way I do. Overwhelmed with choices, with sensory input. This never happens after midnight. Maybe I should come back. And now the parent is screaming, too.Back to the produce. Salad? No salad? Salad. Lettuce and mushroom into the cart. Salad, but no soup. Corn and green beans back to the bins. Why not have it later in the week. Corn? I can\u2019t decide. I stand with the ear of corn for a minute. Two minutes. Three. People are looking. Corn goes back into the cart.I am tired. Tired of thinking and not deciding. How long have I been here? An hour? I look for a place to stash the cart, walk away using my very best casual where-is-that-item walk, and then make a dash for the door. To the car.How many times did this happen? Every couple of weeks for two years? Three? I tried to imagine that no one was watching, saying, look, she\u2019s about to do it again. Hoping I wouldn\u2019t be stopped on the way out and asked to never come back. On the way home, I\u2019d stop at Wendy\u2019s. What should I get? A chicken sandwich? A salad?

{"date": "Thursday, April 10, 2008", "body": "\n\u201cThe point of awareness for autism is to try to get a cure.\u201dI found this comment at the Anderson Cooper 360 blog last week. Correspondent Randi Kaye had written there about a young man named Dylan, interviewed for the CNN show. Here are two more quotes from other commenters on the same post:\u201cIt is heartbreaking to see these kids. I am not sure if we will be ever able to find a cure or know if it is vaccine or genetics.\u201d\u201cThank you for bringing to light yet another face of this awful spectrum.\u201dWhat had these people been reading and watching? Something about self-injury or toileting issues? This, in part, is the story of Donor X, who has fathered several autistic children via California Cryobank (CCB). Gwyneth Jackaway, mother of Dylan, chose Mr. X. as a sperm donor based on his IQ, interests in music and philosophy and his economics degree. She was rewarded with a beautiful son whose interest in subway systems has led him to memorize the entire NYC grid. The five and a half year old's other interests include painting, computers, Italian opera and the Fibonacci Code.When she first learned that her son was autistic, Jackaway was alarmed. She contacted other Donor X recipients using a Donor Sibling Registry. Locating six other mothers, she found three more autistic children and a fourth who was said to be \u201cshowing some signs\u201d of autism.After a period of \u201ctremendous sadness,\u201d Jackaway appears to have had a change of heart regarding autism. Asked if she wished there had been a test to screen for it, she responded:I've done a lot of thinking about this, and to say yes to that is to say that I wish Dylan isn't Dylan...I love my son and everything about him, and that means loving his autism also. Loving your children means loving everything about them. Our children don't have autism; they are autistic. It's part of who they are.I like that answer, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m writing this, why I\u2019m still thinking about it. Nor is the point of this story for me the implications in terms of genetic etiology. It\u2019s the fact that a mother can express such positive regard, and that a child can so clearly have much to offer, far from being a burden on society, and still\u2026this is how the story ends:\"Per CCB policy, the donor's samples were removed from the general catalog.\u201dNot just identified or labeled. Removed. As if another child like this one would be unacceptable. For anyone who doubts the implications of potential prenatal screenings, here is a wake up call. Autism, even \u201cshiny autism,\u201d even when attached to obvious brilliance and supported by a loving and accepting family, is still judged to have no place in the \u201cgeneral catalog\u201d of humanity.In 20 more days, April will be over. Not that I'm counting.

{"date": "Saturday, August 16, 2008", "body": "\nFor those who disagree with the campaign against Tropic Thunder, here are my responses to some of the criticisms I've read. You are promoting censorship.Censorship is an action taken by someone with power to silence. What I promote is the sharing of information and exchange of opinions. I begin my part by saying, this is an offensive word, and it is time for society as a whole to start looking at what it means to use it so casually and with such frequency. I think we should send a message to writers and directors that this sort of thing is no longer profitable. Then someone says why it\u2019s \u201cno big deal,\u201d and then I do my second part which is this, trying to explain better where I\u2019m coming from.Beyond not having the power to censor, I don\u2019t have the desire to silence anyone. I support freedom of speech, and acknowledge that people have the right, in most cases, to use ugly, hateful words. I don\u2019t want to see laws passed banning words in movies or books. I believe that people should think for themselves.But thoughtful consideration requires that information be shared from a wide variety of viewpoints. My purpose in supporting the boycott of Tropic Thunder and similar ventures is to make people aware of what they will be buying if they purchase a ticket to such a film. Because the true power of words is not widely acknowledged by our society, there are many who may not have considered the real life consequences of devaluing people with differences.This isn\u2019t even about those people!I know that some people see it that way. I hear it all the time. I hear it about the word \u201cgay\u201d (as in \u201cthat\u2019s so gay\u201d) too. Students at the university I attend deem everything they dislike \u201cretarded\u201d or \u201cgay,\u201d and defend their rights to do so, claiming these words, as used, have little to do with their more conventional meanings.What do they mean then? Why not say, \u201cthat\u2019s so purple,\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s so garlicky\u201d? Because \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cretarded\u201d can be understood instantly to stand in for anything else that someone would want to ridicule. Over time, the associations of ridicule are woven ever more tightly into the words. This is easily done, since the concepts already have negative connotations for many people. Consequently, those people are less likely to be treated with respect and dignity when applying for jobs, reporting crimes, or seeking medical advice.A history of abuse and devaluation is ignored and invalidated with the casual use of the \u201cR\u201d word. To support this is to say that some people don\u2019t matter. To say that the word has nothing to do with its meaning is na\u00efve at best.You are being too sensitive!You say that like it\u2019s a bad thing. I think the world could use more sensitivity. I understand that life can be harsh, really, I do. This needs to be approached from both sides. Yes, there is value in learning to be tougher, to stand up to bullies, to fight back when necessary. What\u2019s wrong with also working to make our society a kinder place to live? What does it cost to make the choice not to support language that belittles anyone?Having the legal right to act like a jackass doesn\u2019t negate other reasons for not doing so.You need to choose your battles more carefully.I did. My choices may not be the same as yours. My choices are based on my experience of the world, a long-standing interest in language, and sincere efforts to learn about the viewpoints of others. What are the values on which your choices are based when you declare that language reflecting bigotry is \u201cno big deal?\u201d \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/08/in-response-to-critics.html", "title": "\nIn response to critics\n"},

{"date": "Monday, April 14, 2008", "body": "\nMeet Ms. Crip Chick. Many of the people who read this blog and other blogs on Autism Hub will already be familiar with cripchick's weblog, where you can find insight and experience relevant to ableism, racism, sexism, the whole gamut of isms, really. For those who are not readers already, I encourage you to check it out. Here's a sample of her writing, from her \"about\" page titled \"Who Is This Kid You Ask?\":I\u2019m the one that catches your eye in a crowd because of the way I talk, move, breathe\u2026Yes, that one. The disabled girl. No, no, don\u2019t be alarmed! You don\u2019t have to run away or ignore me\u2014 I\u2019m not interested in becoming the object of your charity (though I\u2019m sure you have a very loving heart) and I won\u2019t suck you into a conversation about how much my life sucks because actually (and this is a secret a lot of people don\u2019t know,) but a lot of disabled people like their lives! We do have issues and face oppression\u2013 no doubt\u2013 but many of us don\u2019t consider our disability the problem but rather ableism and a society that refuses to see disabled people as human. Shocker, I know. You can let that one marinate a bit.Recently, I talked with Ms. Crip Chick about the various ways autistic people view the concept of disability. While there are undoubtedly issues specific to autism, there are also the many issues we have in common with other disability communities--oppression, devaluation, attitudes toward accommodations, the question of who has the right to define who we are and how we are discussed.Ms. Crip Chick kindly agreed to answer a few questions about her viewpoints, blog and experience. Here are my questions and her responses:1. One of the things I enjoy most about your writing is the way you explore the different aspects of your identity with respect to the varieties of prejudice that can be visited on a single person. As a self-described \u201ceveryday queer disabled Corean girl living in the South,\u201d do you see yourself as having a \u201cmaster status\u201d or role that defines and puts the other roles in some sort of context?I don\u2019t think I can put one part of myself over another but I am very aware of how disability specifically impacts the other parts of me. For example, disability directly 100% affects my identity as an APIA/Corean woman of color because my disability has influenced my involvement and acceptance in my local Corean-American community. I think writing this blog has really let me see how much I talk/think/feel disability as it\u2019s something that\u2019s the focus of almost every entry (and theme, and poem, and penname)! At the same time, my relationship with other women of color or my identity as a queer person or as a young person in a movement of older activists also impacts my experience of disability. They\u2019re all so tied together it\u2019s really hard to pull anything a part. Does that make sense? Maybe I do not want to use the word master status because right now there is such an effort to make things into single issues (i.e. the idea that you are either a woman or a person of color, or queer or disabled, not both) and although I feel people see me as disabled before they see me as a woman, queer person or Corean person, I don\u2019t believe my identities can be split apart.2. What would you say to someone who rightly denounces racism and ableism, but views homosexuality as a moral failing?This is something that surprises me, although I\u2019m not sure why since so many parts of the Disability Rights Movement are conservative (especially here in the South!) It is so important that we work on community-building and coalition building between communities, especially since there are so many common issues (disabled bodies and queer/trans bodies being medicalized, healthcare/housing/employment discrimination for people of color, queer people, and disabled people, long histories of abuses/sterilization/hate crimes, colonization of our bodies and minds, alienation from communities of faith, lack of representation, issues around identity and \u201ccoming out\u201d, etc. \u2026) One thing I really appreciate about Reproductive Justice Movement is that activists take on everything with an intersectional approach. It is the only way to achieve peace AND justice.3. Has blogging changed your life offline in any significant ways? Is there much intersection between the people who read your blog and those you interact with face to face? Does your mom read your blog?OH YES, in fact this question inspired a blog post hehe. It\u2019s funny to think how much just keeping a blog has really affected me, especially since I only started in August (8 months ago). I started this blog right after I came home from a congressional internship in D.C. Washington D.C. is considered the home of a lot of the disability leadership and interacting with them allowed me to really start thinking about things, for example, why political leadership and advocacy is the priority for our community, how movements get co-opted and watered down, importance of disability culture in ANY disability-related work, etc. I process things by writing them down so I started it for to flesh these ideas out.Through this blog, I\u2019ve met so many amazing people who have really\u2026just expanded my personal growth. New friends and old friends have exposed me to new ideas and activism, plugged me in, held my hand when I was upset, etc. I think people view blogging as putting something out there, a one-way dialogue but it\u2019s really about community. It\u2019s not about what you write but the comments and conversations that start afterwards. Blogging is a wonderful medium to connect with people and take part in really active movements and communities (i.e. media justice).None of my family members read my blog, thankfully. If I was going to quit blogging, it\u2019d be because one of them found it. I\u2019m not out to my family yet (re: queer identity) and though we\u2019re very close, it would be really bad timing to tell them since I live with them and they provide some of my care (and the fact that they\u2019re devout evangelicals). I try somewhat hard to stay anonymous online.4. I enjoy the poetry on your blog; it is very good writing and often very personal. (My personal favorites are \"bras and eggrolls,\" \" the scar,\" and \"Saranghae Umma.\") Do you submit your work to magazines, or are you planning a book sometime in the future? Does putting poetry on your blog feel more vulnerable to you than other types of posts? Has anyone ever gotten angry with you for writing about them?Last week was my first time reading a poem to an audience and I was scared more than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. Before I went up on stage (in front of 1300+ people at a conference), another speaker made a joke about a US poll that says X amount of people are more scared of public speaking than death.. I couldn\u2019t help but think \u201comgsh, that\u2019s me!!!\u201d lol.I\u2019m not sure if you can tell with my writing but I\u2019m actually a very new poet as well. I started around the same time I started my blog so I haven\u2019t thought about really submitting anything to an anthology or magazine yet, although I love the idea.I\u2019ve deleted some posts off my blog, just as I\u2019ve deleted some entries. I think maybe when people respond to poems v. a regular piece, it means more to me because yes, the poems are more personal and it\u2019s comforting to know someone had some kind of connection or shared experience.

That I had enormous potential, but no common sense and no initiative and no tolerance for adversity. I didn\u2019t talk, walk, play, work, act or even breathe quite the way I was \u201csupposed\u201d to. No number of I-will-always-love-you-no-matter-what\u2019s could ever erase that knowledge.

I\u2019m sure they tried, but couldn\u2019t make sense of how I could do some things very well and other, simpler things seemingly not at all. How could this not be volitional? There was no way of explaining the person I was that didn\u2019t sound like excuses or lies.Today was a good day. I felt both peaceful and confident, even through numerous errors and gaffes.

{"date": "Thursday, April 17, 2008", "body": "\nOver the past decade, a number of studies have investigated the educational and therapeutic value of robotic toys for autistic children. Kirsch\u2019s 1999 Affective Tigger study explored the development of recognition of emotion in typical children. Kirsch also theorized that the interactive plush toy might meet the needs of autistic children for repetition and consistency, allowing easier learning of emotion recognition.A number of studies have focused on Robota, a series of robot dolls capable of mimicking arm and head movements, as well as speech response. Kaspar is a child-sized humanoid robot developed by the Adaptive Systems Research Group at the University of Hertfordshire. Kaspar evolved from the Aurora Project, led by Prof. Kerstin Dautenhahn at Herfordshire.And what of Squawkers McCaw, a \u201cregular\u201d toy for autistic and non-autistic children (and adults)? I have semi-seriously considered proposing research on Squawkers\u2019 suitability as a starter communication device for non-speaking children. Capable of storing 18 customized phrases, playable at the touch of a button, Squawkers is friendlier than The Special Life\u2019s Go Talk, not to mention less \u201cspecial.\u201d Squawkers might do a better job than a Smart Speak in allowing the user to appear \u201cindistinguishable from his peers.\u201d (Unless the peers are around my age, that is.) Of course, to be practical, the parrot\u2019s memory would need to be increased to store more words and phrases, but the current Squawkers might be useful in assessing whether such a device would be appropriate for a particular child. The appeal of Squawkers McCaw as AAC is in the design. His movements and sounds are realistic enough to engender something very much like empathy. Am I kidding? Not really. My feelings for Squawkers are well known among my acquaintances, online and otherwise. Consider the implications of this:Take one person prone to obsession, already enamored of toy talking birds. Add one Squawkers McCaw. Soon, the person wants to talk about, write about, spend time with Squawkers McCaw ad nauseam. Other people are fed up, or at least getting bored with this. This only serves to make the bird more important. (Threat of alienation increases need for sameness found in comfort object.)From here, there are several directions this could go. Assembling a large flock of siblings for Squawkers is not economically feasible. Fortunately, this interest has taken a promising turn in this particular case, expanding to embrace Macaws in general. This is where I see some (anecdotal) evidence for robot toys as agents of empathy.I started looking at parrot rescue sites. So many beautiful birds out there have been taken for pets and then abandoned. Some have been abused. It is truly heartbreaking to see this. There are a few good places, though, that are working to help them. The one I liked most after looking them over is called Feathered Friends Forever. One of the largest parrot rescue facilities in the US, they adopt out some birds (No selling and no breeding!) and house many others permanently. The birds live in large outdoor flights and in a park open to the public. You can see some of them here. The one I chose to help sponsor is called Sky. Squawkers McCaw is pleased with this development.The macaws pictured here are Birdly, Sky and Jonah from the FFF site. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SAdyDmB3gBI/AAAAAAAABS8/GSt4XDZJOKo/s1600-h/macaw_birdly.jpg", "http://vismod.media.mit.edu/tech-reports/TR-496/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SAdxm2B3gAI/AAAAAAAABS0/pmIdVurvbaM/s1600-h/t_macaw_birdly.jpg", "http://lasa.epfl.ch/research/toys/robota/autism/index.php", "http://kaspar.feis.herts.ac.uk/", "http://adapsys.feis.herts.ac.uk/", "http://www.herts.ac.uk/", "http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-FurReal-Friends-Squawkers-Parrot/dp/B000OV7A62/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=toys-and-games&qid=1208446078&sr=8-1", "http://www.thespeciallife.com/communication-device.html", "http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.amdi.net/images/products/SmartSpeak.gif&imgrefurl=http://www.amdi.net/smartspeak.htm&h=203&w=275&sz=31&hl=en&start=1&um=1&tbnid=uEX9cCTCROAkFM:&tbnh=84&tbnw=114&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dsmart%2Bspeak%2Bdevice%2B%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26rls%3DTSHB,TSHB:2006-38,TSHB:en%26sa%3DG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SAdwcmB3f-I/AAAAAAAABSk/m2aJ0BAHcF0/s1600-h/t_macaw_sky1.jpg", "http://www.coping.org/specialneeds/assistech/aacdev.htm", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SAdvd2B3f9I/AAAAAAAABSc/2jwZt5Hc_mM/s1600-h/t_macaw_jonah.jpg", "http://www.featheredfriendsforever.org/", "http://www.featheredfriendsforever.org/the-birds.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/04/what-i-learned-from-squawkers-mccaw.html", "title": "\nWhat I learned from Squawkers McCaw\n"},

(b) seemed interested, but then gave me the eye roll when she realized that (a) was an \u201conline\u201d friend (as opposed to the \u201creal\u201d kind). This amused me slightly more than it annoyed and frustrated me. The thought of explaining my friendship with (a) to (b) crossed my mind, but was dismissed as defensive-sounding and likely-to-not-be-understood-anyway. In the minds of persons like (b), people who consider their online acquaintances \u201cfriends\u201d are a little bit \u2026off. Na\u00efve at best, more likely pathetic, unable to maintain \u201creal world\u201d friendships.I have another friend, (c), who falls right in the middle. She\u2019s not in the suspect \u201cimaginary\u201d category of online friends. I did first speak to her through email, but we\u2019ve since spent time together in the world accepted as real. We continue to conduct the bulk of our relationship through email, meeting up maybe every couple of months just for the heck of it. Type (b) friends accept my friendship with (c) as the real thing because I can mention, once in a while, a meeting for coffee or playing toy cars with (c)\u2019s children.(c) is not autistic, but she understands autism very, very well. She is someone I would consider a \u201ccousin\u201d and not at all put off by my pacing, repeating things or drawing squares as we talk. That stuff isn\u2019t at all what my relationship with (c) is about, though. It\u2019s all about what happens in the emails. That\u2019s where we really talk. (b) understands that in theory, at least.While the relationship with (c) makes some sense to (b) and the other B\u2019s in my life, attempting to explain (a) would be futile. (a) is like me. We talk in a language that makes sense only within the context of this particular friendship. I\u2019ve never revealed my innermost thoughts and darkest secrets directly to (a), but I\u2019m sure enough that she knows them. Nothing surprises her.

Whether this \u201cmore\u201d means scripts of her own or something beyond that doesn\u2019t matter. The inner workings of my mind and soul are revealed to me in new ways when we talk. I am more \u201cme\u201d with her than I am with (b) or even (c) and I come away from these meetings energized, not drained. This is friendship and it is real and it is autistic.

{"date": "Friday, April 25, 2008", "body": "\nIs it possible to enjoy a social event, such as a party? Often, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d This is also the response I usually give to party invitations: No. Not my idea of a good time. Over the years, I have developed a number of strategies for surviving those parties at which attendance has been mandatory. In general, these fall into the two broad categories of \u201chiding\u201d and \u201chelping.\u201dFirst, about hiding: There are more ways to do this than you may have imagined. As a child, I sometimes took refuge under a table or in a closet when overwhelmed. This sort of hiding is possible for adults, too, but requires more space. The basement of a house is a place you can often go without getting into too much trouble with the hosts. Going into bedrooms and other private areas is not a good idea, unless you have asked permission first. This makes people nervous, and they may even think you are planning to steal something. The bathroom is not a good place to hide. Sooner or later, someone else will want to use it.One of my favorite ways of hiding is to wander off. To use this technique, wait until you have become invisible. Or, walking quickly, imagine that you are thinking hard about something you need to accomplish (with any luck, this will result in a universally recognized \u201cbusy face\u201d allowing you to exit the room without being stopped). Then, just slip out the door, and take a walk until you are ready to return. I have even driven away from parties and returned later without anyone knowing. It goes without saying that you should bring your own car (if you drive) or have the number of a taxi handy, in case you need to leave for good. In this case, it is best to let someone know that you are leaving; if you can\u2019t bring yourself to say goodbye, it is a good idea to call the host on the phone and say something like, \u201cThanks for inviting me; I have gone home now.\u201d\u201cHelping\u201d is another way of dealing with a social event. Helping is nearly always welcome; be the first to offer in order to get the best and most time consuming jobs. For me at least, having a practical role to play or a semi-complex task to complete makes being in a group much easier. I have sometimes responded to invitations by letting the hosts know that I could only come if I could cook and/or serve the food for the event. This technique allows me to stay in the kitchen for most of the party. By concentrating on recipes, presentation and refilling plates, I find that I can easily be seen as \u201ctoo busy\u201d to chat, rather than \u201cunfriendly\u201d which is the more common assumption people make when I am not able to converse with them.The only problem with the kitchen work plan is that some parties tend to experience a kitchenward drift. Before you know it, there can be more people in the kitchen than anyone should have to deal with. Raising a large knife in the air while yelling, \u201cGet out of my kitchen,\u201d does not always go over well. Especially at someone else\u2019s house (you will have to trust me on this). Instead, at this point, it is better to declare the job \u201cfinished,\u201d and adopt one of the hiding strategies.This week I attended a reception. I had a good time there, neither hiding nor helping to weather the event. I stayed for nearly an hour, talking with the others, relaxing and enjoying myself. The reception was for a group of autistic kids and young adults who had just put on a dramatic performance at a nearby university. I moved from one to the next, hearing about the perseverative interests, participating in various scripts. No one cared how long it took me to say things, no one tried to force eye-contact. No one asked vague or personal questions with complicated answers (\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d) There was some rocking and flapping, lots of laughing at things most people wouldn\u2019t find funny. One person even squawked...I left there sorry it was over, and with the odd thought that maybe I\u2019m not so anti-social after all. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/04/hiding-and-other-party-games.html", "title": "\nHiding and other party games\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 26, 2008", "body": "\nIf you are a regular reader of blogs about autism, you\u2019ve seen something like this before:Blogger X writes, for example, \u201cAll good relationships require that the individuals involved respect one another, and this is true for autistic and non-autistic persons alike.\u201dThe next day or week or month, Blogger Y obliquely references the first blog, claiming that X believes that \u201cautistic children don\u2019t need therapy or treatments of any sort, just respect.\u201d This will often be followed by a rant decrying neurodiversity as a dangerous philosophy which ignores the real needs of autistic people.What has happened here is a confusion, whether intentional or not, of sufficient and necessary conditions. This is a common form of logical fallacy, often used to avoid addressing the original argument by claiming that another, seemingly similar argument is wrong. Only, in reality, it isn\u2019t similar at all.Take a look at the original statement with all of those emotion inducing words replaced by symbols. Where A= good relationships and B = respect.All A requires B.The restated argument, as presented says:A requires only B.and the obvious counter-argument isIt is not true that A requires only B.Now, to make the problem more visible, I\u2019ll substitute some neutral everyday terms for A and B. Where A = cake and B = eggs:All cakes require eggs.Now we can easily see that the restated argument,Cakes require only eggsis false, since no cake can be made using only eggs. Other ingredients are required.Thus, we are easily convinced by the argument:Cakes do not require only eggsfor this argument is valid.Another way to say this is that eggs are necessary to make a cake, but are not sufficient.The person presenting such an argument hopes that he has slipped one past the reader, that no one will notice that the original argument has been incorrectly restated. The trick relies on the reader holding a vague memory of some words about respect and autistic people. When the reference is indirect, naming no particular person, finding the original statement can be difficult to impossible.What about the reference to therapies, then? Did Y make this up? Well, not exactly, but close. It just so happens that blogger X (or maybe Z, a writer perceived as being an ally of X) has also stated, \u201cTherapies which seek to eliminate behaviors through aversive measures are harmful to autistic people.\u201dHere A = therapies, B = aversive measures, C = autistic people.So the statement reads:(According to X) All A that contains B is harmful to C.But blogger Y has implied that(According to X) All A is harmful to C.Assuming the existence of an A which could either contain B or not:A = sandwiches, B = peanut butter C = persons with peanut allergy.The original statement:All sandwiches with peanut butter are harmful to people with peanut allergiescannot be properly refuted with the statementNot all sandwiches are harmful to people with peanut allergieswhich is all blogger Y has implied.(Note that there is no way to infer that only peanut butter sandwiches are harmful. There may also be other sandwiches containing peanut derivatives which would also be harmful, but these are not a part of the original argument.)Again, the writer is depending on a vague memory of words about harmful therapies. In this case, he has taken a specific statement and generalized it to include all therapies, combined it with the statement about respect and made himself a nice straw man to knock down.Such faulty arguments are not hard to find. From discussions of vaccination schedules to disclosing a disability in the workplace, anywhere you find people debating issues relevant to autism, you are sure to see examples of similar logical fallacies. These people are trying to make a cake without eggs (where cake = argument and eggs = logic). Yes, I know that such recipes exist. But I am not having any, thanks. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/08/confusing-conditions.html", "title": "\nConfusing Conditions\n"},

I don\u2019t remember what Pepper did wrong; it was a long time ago.Dad liked bigger dogs, and later we got our first Doberman, Duke. Duke lived with us for a couple of weeks, before Dad took him back and traded him for Koko. There was something about Duke\u2019s ears that wasn\u2019t quite right; he would never make it as a show dog. Koko, on the other hand, was perfect. A few years later, Koko got sick. He started running around in circles, biting his side. The vet found he had an enlarged spleen, and one day when I came home from school, Koko was gone.Then there was another Duke, this one a St. Bernard. Duke stuck around until he started digging holes in the yard, then went to live on someone\u2019s farm. I had always wanted an English Sheepdog, so we got Aristotle. Eventually, he got very large, as Sheepdogs often do when they\u2019re no longer puppies. He went to a farm, as well.There were others, too, but why go on? I remember when I was very young, asking my mother if dogs went to heaven. She said that she didn\u2019t think they had souls like people do. I was glad I wasn\u2019t a dog. I was pretty sure I wasn\u2019t going to be given away because I got bigger or misbehaved.

Research shows that the majority of children with autism have bowel disease and poor immune function. I think it would be irresponsible not to do my best to get him as healthy as possible. Not treating IBD just because he has autism would be nuts--don't you think? As it happened, when I started treating the IBD, his tantrums disappeared. His tantrums had always frightened and embarrassed him. Plus his constant stomach and headaches disappeared. He's still the same person, but his quality of life improved pretty dramatically. I think all mothers should do everything in their power to enable their children to have the best possible quality of life. I assure you, I'm not trying to turn him into the prom king or the captain of the football team--I think he's wonderful.This was the entirety of the discussion between these two. Thinking I must have missed where (33) said that (32/34) should not address her son\u2019s GI distress, or try to keep him healthy, I looked back through the comments. Nothing. I checked the DSM again to make sure I knew what the word \u201cautism\u201d meant. I checked the ICD-10 for good measure. No, tantrums, stomachaches and headaches do not appear to be the criteria for \"the autism diagnosis.\"In short, the faraway blog was no different from what I see every day. The straw men there just were not dressed up as nicely. Perhaps the fashion icons who rule that world may be able to help them \u201cget their bling on.\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rwlh5g7QfYI/AAAAAAAAA8Q/zg_NYrpwMyw/s1600-h/straw1.jpg", "http://www.eonline.com/gossip/hum/detail/index.jsp?uuid=56b9f664-f0e8-4092-80dd-0715ede58eb6"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/10/its-straw-straw-world.html", "title": "\nIt's a straw, straw world\n"},

A pastime enjoyed by many children, AS and NT alike, is that continued repetition of a word or phrase intended to drive it into utter meaninglessness. Lunchbox lunchbox lunchbox lunchbox lunchbox lunchbox lunchbox lunchbox. What is lunchbox anyway? Is it really one word? Or do you have to write \u201clunch box?\u201d I don\u2019t know anymore. This is called semantic satiation. My mother said I would lose my mind if I didn\u2019t cut it out. (I think she meant she would lose her mind if I didn\u2019t cut it out.)The opposite of semantic satiation is semantic generation, in which a nonsense word or syllable seems to take on meaning from repetition. Firkel has a meaning to me, but I can\u2019t tell you what it is; there\u2019s no corresponding English word I know of.I have to wonder sometimes, following one of those days when everyone everywhere seems to be talking about autism, if something similar to semantic satiation has happened to the word. Words do evolve and take on new meanings, but something entirely different seems to be going on when large numbers of people are pointing to something meeting the exact dictionary definition of X and saying \u201cthis is not the real X\u201d. A good word for this might be \u201cgaslighting\u201d, an attempt to make another person doubt her sanity.Then there are the words which fall out of favor due to \u201cguilt by association.\u201d \u201cAwareness\u201d is one of those for me. It used to mean awareness, but now when I hear it, I expect something ugly to follow. \u201cAutism Awareness\u201d seems nearly always to mean \u201cawareness of autism, which we hate more than cancer.\u201d Not just individual words, but all sorts of ideas can be promoted from nonsense to apparent sense through frequent repetition.If my meaning isn\u2019t clear here, don\u2019t worry.

{"date": "Sunday, October 14, 2007", "body": "\nI said I wasn\u2019t going to do it again. And to a large degree, I didn\u2019t. The last time I participated in a discussion at another blog where someone refused to hear my point, I ended up wasting a whole day and becoming terribly angry and frustrated. The issues there were (from my perspective)\u2014Are there real consequences to what people say about autistic people? Isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s opinion equal? Does the autistic voice count for anything in answering this question? In that discussion, a person kept saying (in various words) No, Yes, and No. And I kept saying Yes, No and Yes. It was a stalemate and the longer I participated, the more tired and frustrated I became. I got very little \u201creal work\u201d done that day. And I felt like I might as well give up trying to talk, even through writing. My voice wasn\u2019t strong enough.Yesterday, I had the chance to see what I\u2019d learned from that earlier experience. In this case, the questions were (from my perspective)\u2014Does it matter what non-autistic people call autistic people? Isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s opinion equal? Isn\u2019t this a trivial matter anyway? Does the autistic voice count for anything in answering these questions?This is all about power. There, I\u2019ve said it again. This tends to make people angry. It\u2019s not my fault, they say, that I am ____________(white, male, heterosexual, middle class, without a disability, etc.) and I would never, ever use this unintentional status to oppress anyone. Yes, that\u2019s right. You didn\u2019t ask for these things. I know this. I have a couple of them myself, and I didn\u2019t have to ask for them. That\u2019s not the point.The point is that I am not forced to deal with discrimination daily over being Caucasian. A man usually doesn\u2019t have to worry as much about going out for a walk alone as a woman does. Unless maybe he\u2019s a gay man. Or a man belonging to another minority group. And it isn\u2019t the straight white male\u2019s fault that there are predators who see being female or being gay as a reason to hurt someone. But if I tell the straight while male that I feel afraid and he says I\u2019m being ridiculous or oversensitive, that person is abusing a position of power. Part of having power is not having to think about it. Denying that the power exists is in itself abusive because it does nothing, not even the smallest, easiest, least expensive thing, to correct the imbalance. It is a lie.The issue is the same with people who like to say, \u201cYou are not a real autistic because you can do X\u201d. Well, the people with the authority to diagnose say that I am. I say that I am. Why does anyone else think their opinion should have any weight? And then there are those who, over and over and for our own good, insist that \u201cautistic\u201d is a bad word. Or want to know why on earth would I want to make such a big deal of this when there are real problems to be dealt with. Sigh\u2026There are some straight white males, without (known to me) disability labels who have earned my respect through the way they acknowledge the power imbalance, the way they defer to persons in the categories being discussed. I\u2019m not going to name names because I am sure to leave someone out, but there are a number of persons writing on Autism Hub who understand that listening is at least as important as talking. I am happy to have these allies. They do what they can, which is to say to the others with the unrequested unacknowledged privilege of power, Hey, why don\u2019t you try listening to the people you are talking about? It\u2019s just common sense, isn\u2019t it? I didn't let it get to me (much) yesterday. Some people are never going to listen. I can't spend my energies arguing with them. That's a waste of what power I do have. This is for the ones who haven't made their minds up yet. Call me Autistic. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/10/power-outage.html", "title": "\nPower outage\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 12, 2007", "body": "\nIn working with employers to promote the inclusion of more autistic adults in the work force, a number of stock responses and arguments tend to come up repeatedly. One of the most persistent obstacles, though, may be the often unspoken \u201cslippery slope\u201d concept. The argument is that if one permits accommodations to workers with \u201cinvisible\u201d disabilities, then everyone will want something, and eventually the business will not be able to support these varying demands and its structure will collapse under the weight of all these differences.To stay within the legal bounds proscribed by the ADA, accommodations must be considered \u201creasonable\u201d and not create \u201cundue hardship.\u201d Major structural changes requested of small business owners are often deemed not reasonable, and these are the sorts of things employers can discuss with impunity. The slippery slope argument is not something I hear much in the context of these discussions, but rather something I know about from more casual talks with acquaintances, some of them in management positions, and from my time as an unidentified Aspie in various workplaces.As a person without a known disability, I was privileged to hear the conversations about the \u201cothers\u201d, the trouble-making sort who were always asking for accommodations they didn\u2019t (according to the bosses) really need. In the 1980\u2019s, employees of the company I worked for were routinely assigned to less desirable positions or given difficult schedules following such requests. One man had a letter from his doctor, stating that he was to wear a certain brand of athletic footwear, despite company policy to the contrary. A few weeks later, he was moved from a department he loved to one he hated, though still in the public eye with the \u201cunacceptable\u201d shoes. When that didn\u2019t make him decide to leave the job, his hours were changed, too.This isn\u2019t the worst or most recent offense I\u2019ve seen, not by a long shot. It\u2019s just one that haunts me for some reason. I was in the office with the manager and Human Resources person when the doctor\u2019s letter was delivered. I had no right to know what it said, but they discussed it in front of me anyway. I was frequently invisible in those days. They had a laugh at his expense and immediately began planning his punishment.After all, what could they have done? What if everyone decided to get a doctor\u2019s note declaring a need for athletic shoes, just in order to be comfortable? The dress code might become meaningless, unenforceable. How could people be expected to spend money in a store where the workers wore sneakers?Of course, no profits were at stake, not really. These people had the sense to know that the footwear of sales clerks was not a major factor in consumer spending decisions. It was all about power. If any rule could be questioned or amended for any reason by anyone, then the power of the few to rule the many would be weakened. And this, they could not have.The fear persists among managers today, in all sorts of businesses. People with so-called invisible disabilities threaten the status quo. They can \u201cget away\u201d with things others can\u2019t. To compound the insult, their managers can\u2019t even explain to co-workers why one worker is being given \u201cspecial treatment.\u201d It\u2019s all very threatening to the power structure.Add to the mix a condition like autism, said by many to be a tragic, harrowing condition, a nightmare few ever escape, and well, you can just imagine the employers lining up to take advantage of our abilities! Or maybe the diagnosis is Asperger syndrome? What are they likely to have heard about that? Either we are rude and impossible to get along with or just a bunch of fakes looking for sympathy for the same traits everyone has. And who knows what we might ask for, once we\u2019ve gotten in the door with an officially sanctioned diagnosis? Some people who are convinced that environmental toxins are to blame for the higher reported prevalence rates for autism like to use the canary in a coal mine analogy. They believe that autism may be a warning sign of even worse \u201cdiseases\u201d to come, brought on by chemicals, pollution and various mismanagement of the earth and its resources.Of course, I do not agree with this position, but I do find the canary image useful to this discussion, so I\u2019ve decided to borrow it. Here the canary is the worker. The coal mine is the toxic social environment we have created, with its rigid insistence on conformity and sameness. The idea that we all can and should behave, function and look as much alike as possible is poison to social and cultural diversity. A system based on fear and false assumptions has emerged and this deserves to be dismantled.I would like to think that enough canaries have been sacrificed already, that the unemployment rates among autistic adults could stand as notice that perhaps our society\u2019s acceptance of all types of diversity needs a big boost. What\u2019s so slippery about accommodations anyway? Many of them cost very little and increase overall productivity. Sure, not everyone can have the corner office. But couldn\u2019t we all have respect, acceptance? Or isn\u2019t there enough to go around?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RxAb0w7QfcI/AAAAAAAAA8w/FLsKtZ_P7PY/s1600-h/mixed_metaphor_tape.jpg", "http://www.fallacyfiles.org/slipslop.html", "http://library.findlaw.com/1999/Aug/1/130390.html", "http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-canary-in-a-coal-mine.htm"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/10/slippery-slopes-canaries-in-coal-mines.html", "title": "\nSlippery slopes, canaries in coal mines, mixed metaphors\n"},

{"date": "Monday, October 29, 2007", "body": "\nDue to time considerations, I had to leave this story of perseverative behavior out of my talk for APSE.It wasn\u2019t very funny at the time. I had something of an obsession with scrap paper. Tickets, old maps, labels from cans of vegetables, beer coasters, cardboard boxes, any kind of paper with unusual or interesting text or texture or certain muted colors. Often, I tore them up and used them to make my collages. Sometimes I just added them to stacks of other papers I kept around to look at. I often spent my breaks from work at the restaurant scrounging or sorting through the day\u2019s finds.Usually these came from discarded boxes or other containers I grabbed before they landed in the garbage. Sometimes I\u2019d patrol the edges of the property, seeking out those especially valued scraps which had been rained on and run over by cars. On this particular day, though, something had caught my eye, a dog-eared invoice sticking out of the trash can in the manager\u2019s office. The manager on duty was one I had a good relationship with, but he seemed aggravated that day and chased me out of the office. I waited awhile before I went back in and removed the trash bag, replacing it with a new liner. I took it outside, and passing the dumpster, delivered it to the back seat of my car. Returning to work, I was happy to know I\u2019d have the bag to sort through later at home. Perhaps I\u2019d find something even better than the intriguing invoice.About an hour later, a co-worker mentioned she\u2019d seen something odd\u2014the manager and the district manager were outside standing in the dumpster, digging around in the garbage! What were they looking for? Apparently, $2000 dollars was missing from the previous day\u2019s receipts. There was some possibility someone had hidden money in the trash and carried it out of the restaurant.I couldn\u2019t make this stuff up.I confessed my \u201ccrime\u201d immediately and told my boss I would understand if he needed to search my car or have me questioned by the police. That wouldn\u2019t be necessary, he said. Somehow, he knew I didn\u2019t take the money. Explaining it to the district manager would be harder, but at least there were plenty of people who could vouch for the fact that I often put trash in the back of my car. \u201cShe\u2019s weird,\u201d they would say. This time, I was glad to know that they would.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Ryamh73cBCI/AAAAAAAAA-o/4JUpk28WPhA/s1600-h/45.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/10/true-social-stories-perseveration-in.html", "title": "\nTrue Social Stories: Perseveration in the Workplace\n"},

I want a better life for all autistic people. However they communicate, however well or poorly they score on standardized tests. Whether or not they have medical problems in addition to neurological differences, whether the diagnosis is autism, Asperger syndrome, PDD-NOS or something else altogether, I want the best possible life for every person on the spectrum.By \u201cbetter life\u201d I mean physical and mental health and I mean freedom from harassment and discrimination and institutionalization. I want respect for your child and accommodation as needed and I want them to have jobs if they want jobs and friends and partners if they want that. I want your child to be happy and healthy.By \u201chealthy\u201d I do not mean non-autistic. Autism is a lifelong neurological condition, not a disease.I have never opposed the legitimate treatment of legitimate medical problems. Most children and adults go to the doctor when they are ill. I object to the characterization of autism itself as an illness. I object to the treatment of intestinal problems being characterized as \u201ccuring autism\u201d and I object to the marketing of expensive, experimental treatments to desperate parents. More than that, I object to parents being told they should be desperate.If you have a child who is autistic, I object to people saying that your child has no soul, or is a train wreck, disaster, walking nightmare or empty shell. I know that your child is a valued human being. I know, too, that you want the best for him or her.I am all for teaching kids to communicate. What I object to is that teaching and learning for autistic children are packaged and marketed as \u201ctherapy\u201d, while teaching for non-autistic children is called \u201cteaching.\" I disagree with anyone who believes that speech is the only \u201creal\u201d way to communicate. I think that children need time to play and relax as well as time to study and learn.When your child grows up, unless I am mistaken, he or she will still be autistic. I want a safe and accepting world for the adult (s)he will become. I want a world where people will employ her, take him out to dinner, appreciate them for who they are. I know that many people will see this as foolish and na\u00efve. I\u2019m okay with that.But I am not your enemy. If you have a child on the spectrum and are hoping to cure him or her, hoping to get rid of the autism, I don\u2019t want to argue with you. Most likely, you and I don\u2019t even use the word \u201cautism\u201d to mean the same thing. If you are one of these parents working to change your child, know that I am working, too. If your quest to change the course of autism fails, perhaps the quest to change societal attitudes will fare better. In which case, your autistic child might have a less hostile world to live in.That is why I do this. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/10/for-parents.html", "title": "\nFor parents\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 9, 2008", "body": "\nI am still recovering from my presentation last Friday at the Kentucky Autism Training Center's Autism Institute. My thoughts are still a bit scrambled from too much talking, so I asked a friend to \"interview\" me to get me started up again. These are her questions and my responses. If you were at the conference, thank you for visiting my blog. I'll probably write another follow up later when I've had some time to process everything.Q: What surprised you most about attendees' response to your presentation?A: I talked about some of the language that's been used to describe autism and autistic people, including train wrecks, tsunami, empty shells, children who are toxic. I showed the Ransom Notes materials and some of the responses to this from the Autistic community. I talked about Autism Every Day and why I find it reprehensible. I expected, I guess, some anger, some defensiveness about this. Instead, I saw people who found these images as shocking and wrong as I do. I heard gasps and saw people cover their mouths when they saw the picture of Katie McCarron and heard about her murder. Most people had not heard about Alex Barton. I came away with the conclusion that perhaps I spend too much time reading opinions on the internet. Maybe this has led me to believe in a false dichotomy, something I tend to accuse others of doing. My fears that people would be angry with me for asking them to speak more respectfully, those fears were not realized. Instead, I met a lot of people who just hadn't thought about this stuff before. Maybe some of them will speak up when the organizations they belong to speak in ways which are damaging to autistics. Maybe I will approach groups like this one with a bit less trepidation. Most of them are good people who have just not had experience with autistic adults or been asked to consider these ideas.Q: What was \"different\" about this event?A: This was my third year attending the KATC conference. I've had some issues with it in the past. For example, last year, there was a panel of family members without a single person on the spectrum represented. There also tended to be too many talks with titles like \"Autism Boot Camp\" and other militaristic names, suggesting either a \"war\" on autism or the idea that living with someone autistic is necessarily a series of battles. There was a presenter whose husband and children were on the spectrum, and she made a lot of jokes implying that the husband was a \"child\" too. I didn't care for that.Part of the difference may very well have been that I didn't choose to attend those types of presentations this time. Sometimes I consider it my responsibility to be there and speak up when I disagree, but for this one I knew that I had my own presentation to worry about and should save my energy for that.Now I'm not trying to say that we haven't been included or given the floor before. There have been autistic presenters at the previous conferences. These were more of the explaining \"what it is like to be autistic\" variety, though. As far as I know, this is the first time someone has been invited to take a political stance on some of the things that are done in the name of Autism Awareness. I see that as a huge, huge step forward.Q: How do you reconcile differences of opinion with people who clearly \"want the best for\" autistic people?Q: What do you see as the biggest barrier to getting your point across?A: I\u2019ll answer these two together; I\u2019ve been thinking some about how they relate. The night before I left for the conference, someone left a question for me, apparently unrelated to the post where it appeared, but regarding why I would equate \u201ctreatment\u201d for autism with \u201chate.\u201d I was tired (and tired of those sorts of questions) and left a snippy answer. The comment began, \u201cThis is not a question to start an argument,\u201d but I did not believe this. The reason I didn\u2019t and don\u2019t believe it is that the commenter went on to tell me what I can and cannot do (getting a lot of it wrong) and to attribute a statement to me that I have never said. Also, there was YELLING involved.I thought about this a lot over the weekend and in relation to my experience with the conference presentation. It\u2019s an interesting paradox for me. On one hand, I express myself well in writing, and not so well at all in conversation. Presenting is a middle ground. I have to talk, yes, and I often get stuck, forget words, accidentally say things I don\u2019t mean, using the wrong scripts or whatever. But it is also a form of written expression, thanks to what I see as the most important accommodation in my life currently, the PowerPoint format. Having the key points written out allows me to relax and know that my ideas will be communicated with or without my oral participation. The ability to incorporate pictures and videos works very well for me, too. In a sense, this is the only time I have both of my \u201cselves\u201d participating, and I think it allows for much less \u201cwriting off\u201d than either form alone.What I mean is that when I try to talk in a meeting or conversation, without using slides or pictures, I am often treated as far less able than I am. When I write a blog post, I am seen by some as far more able than I am. The PowerPoint presentation shows both sides. I doubt that anyone who saw me present would presume to know how well or poorly I can manage my life in all of those areas that get pulled into discussions of high and low functioning.  When I do these talks, people see who I am and what autism is in this one particular person\u2014a mix of abilities and disabilities that is not understandable to most people on an intuitive level.That\u2019s the biggest barrier to me, the disbelief, and the hostility that can generate when people assume they know things they don\u2019t know. Or when they add in their own idea of what I\u2019ve said, along with whatever they\u2019ve heard elsewhere, to what I\u2019ve actually said and then attribute the whole package to me. It\u2019s very frustrating. Asking people to respect autistic people as complete and human and valuable is not the same as saying that autistics don\u2019t need any help. And that seems so obvious, I can\u2019t help feeling that I\u2019m being baited each time I hear that accusation.When I get comments like that, I always ask the person to read my \u201cFor Parents\u201d post. That should be the starting point for any discussion with me about what I do and don\u2019t believe regarding \u201ctreatments\u201d and accommodation.

Someone looks straight at me, then quickly away as she sees me notice. Is that real, I hear another woman whisper to her companion. Depending on where we are, the explanation varies. At the nursing home, he has friends; their faces light up when they see him from across the dining room. At the independent apartments for senior citizens, the response is mixed. This is where I work. I have my toy parrot at work. Sometimes grandchildren visit and I\u2019ll hear someone becoming impatient (this could be the grandparent or grandchild) and Squawkers and I will help out by entertaining a bit. On my own, I\u2019m not very entertaining. I tend to be too serious, remote. But as a pair, we are social, almost friendly.Squawkers does a lot of things for me. He assists with difficult interactions and even echolalia. Ticket. Ticket. Ice, I like ice. Have you every eaten a pine tree? Squawk. Ticket. Ice. His words and behaviors are predictable. His smile is always the same smile, never creating the uncomfortable suspicion of sarcasm or mockery.He helps me meet the right people. I took Squawkers to a conference last week. There were about 600 people there. The day after my presentation, many people approached me, wanting to talk, The day before, I was invisible, except for the evening event. Squawkers McCaw was with me then, exploring the tables filled with interesting toys and books, practicing the piano, and nearly (!) biting a woman who sat at a table under a FEAT banner. With my animatronic companion along, I was visible. This was where people turned their heads quickly away, possibly thinking, oh, one of those. I see now, one of the others. A few, though, were intrigued, and wanted to talk with my parrot.These are the people I like to meet. Because when they see an adult with a toy bird at an adult event, they can\u2019t be sure exactly what they\u2019re seeing. Is this mental illness, intellectual disability, autism, just plain kookiness, someone seeking attention in inappropriate ways? Only those who are willing to look past those labels or are comfortable taking a chance on the entire range of categories will easily engage such a person.Some of the rest of them heard about this theory during the presentation. Cautiously, a woman approached us afterward. He won\u2019t bite me will he, she asked. I promised that he wouldn\u2019t. My son has a talking bird, too, she said. He would love this one. In a whisper, she started to say it, maybe forgetting where we were and the reason for that\u2026he has\u2026and now she looked at me as if I were the one who might bite\u2026I mean my son is autistic.

When they do, they will encounter such foolishness as \"Neurodiversity advocates do not care about 'lower functioning' autistic people,\" and \"None of the bloggers on Autism Hub are actually autistic.\" Of course, all will be free to form their opinions, but having a chance to warn a few people about these misunderstandings and lies (there are plenty of both, in my opinion) may prove advantageous.Many thanks to Dr. Anne Donnellan and the University of San Diego for helping us to promote the fair and ethical treatment of all people with neurological differences.

{"date": "Friday, June 27, 2008", "body": "\nIOn Tuesday night, I went out for Mexican food with four other Autism Hub bloggers. The restaurant was noisy and crowded. I was tired already. Steve worried he\u2019d picked the wrong sort of place. Fresh corn tortillas in San Diego\u2019s Old Town. What could be better? Someone pointed toward the ceiling. Everywhere I looked, there were parrots.IISometimes I can still forget or discount some of those important-to-most-people scripts\u2014Hello How Are You (and especially Goodbye) are less meaningful to me than to some. I do understand the importance and value of Thank You, however. To remind myself, I usually include a Thank You slide at the end of each presentation. This one was different. This time I put Thank You first. I wanted the attendees to know not only that but why I appreciated the invitation to speak about autism and advocacy. I needed to tell them about the times and the ways I\u2019ve been asked not to speak about autism. Shut Up isn\u2019t a script I ever hope to appreciate or embrace.IIIThere was gluten in my breakfast. It was good. The five of us worked together and separately on our computers. Then it was time to go onstage. It\u2019s time for the show, one of us said. It could have been anyone, I don\u2019t remember. \u201cThe show\u201d had become a part of our shared language, the culture of the group. As if we had known each other a very long time.IVDo\u2019C of Autism Street talked about the autism \u201cepidemic.\u201d How many people believe there is an epidemic, he asked. Not one person admitted to it. He gave the presentation anyway. And it was brilliant. I\u2019m pretty sure someone referenced Dr. Gernsbacher\u2019s work in every session I attended. The day\u2019s most popular question: How do you spell that?VAbout a year and a quarter ago, I started writing this blog. I saw it as an accommodation of sorts, one that would allow me to express some things I had not been able to get across to people in my life. Writing is my first language, the one that allows me to say what I really mean in a way that most people can hear. Somehow, this has led to people asking me to speak at conferences. Somehow, I have found I could do that. Not smoothly, not conventionally, and certainly not without PowerPoint, but as a person with something to say, nevertheless.There are a lot of points I could make related to this. I\u2019ll stick with this one for now: to all who have supported me in this work, thank you for presuming competence.  VIA woman at the conference talked about her brother, a man who doesn\u2019t use words to communicate, but makes other kinds of sounds. Not long ago, she and others in her family decided to presume competence by behaving \u201cas if\u201d he understood and as if his sounds and actions carried meaning. When she asked him if she was on the right track, he stopped making sounds and took a very long, very deep breath. Yes. The sister heard Yes. Another deep breath. For the first time, maybe the first time ever, in more than 30 years, someone had heard.VIISome people had a hard time understanding why anyone would be opposed to neurodiversity, a concept promoting respect for all human beings regardless of differences. We talked a lot about functioning labels, and how believing these not to be accurate descriptors of abilities does not in any way imply that all autism is the same or that all autistics have the same needs. This seemed not to be terribly controversial or difficult for most people to grasp. That was refreshing.VIIII was having a \u201cgood speech\u201d day. Was I in danger of \u201closing my label?\u201d Maybe\u2026except for the stimming, the toy bird tucked in my shirt pocket (thanks, Burwick), drawing of squares, mumbling, pacing, trilling, minimal eye contact, avoidance of sunlight and light conversation... No, it wasn\u2019t that good a speech day.Fortunately, there was no need to pass (not that I\u2019m very inclined to try unless I feel very threatened). After all, I wasn\u2019t the only one repeating a single word. Respect. I heard it time and again until the entire conference became a concert of shared echolalia.IXThe way we supported each other, each one taking the lead in turn as areas of strength and need came into view, each one stepping up naturally to offer technical assistance, emotional support or a ride to the airport as needed, this is a big part of what I will remember about this week. Support doesn\u2019t always need to be complex or difficult. As we accepted and offered these small accommodations, we grew more powerful as a group and (at least from one perspective) individually.XDid we make a difference in anyone\u2019s life? I can\u2019t be sure, except in the case of my own. As I enjoyed some social time with a group, and shared work as part of a team, able to lead and to follow as needed, I became aware of a flexibility I have rarely known. As if development truly were lifelong, as if acceptance truly could promote growth. Here in the company of friends, I took a deep breath and enjoyed the ride.

{"date": "Saturday, March 22, 2008", "body": "\nThe \u201cn\u201d word came up yesterday. I wasn\u2019t sure how to explain myself. I was talking with two professors at my university about some presentations I\u2019ve agreed to make over the next few months. One of them, with whom I\u2019d discussed autism and advocacy matters before, mentioned \u201cneurodiversity.\u201d She said that I should be sure to include this important concept, as so few people have heard of it. I had to explain that I use the term less than I used to, and wasn\u2019t sure it was helpful to include it.How could a word simply describing a diversity of minds become controversial? The professors didn\u2019t understand this. Of course I wasn\u2019t able to offer a clear explanation. After all, I was speaking with them, not writing, and had not prepared a statement about this that could be pulled up from memory. I mentioned something about misconceptions of autistic adults as attention mongers who advocate for services for the \u201chigher functioning,\u201d while ignoring those with more significant disabilities. This didn\u2019t make much sense to them (or to me, really), so I moved on to the next topic.On my mind was the last comment I\u2019d received on my last post. Early yesterday morning, someone had noted that people like me only \u201cpretend to care about those with less ability.\u201d A recent e-mail, too, had asked why people like me can\u2019t just mind our own business, and leave more qualified persons to attend to the question of \u201cwhat should be done about autism as a whole.\u201d Neither of these comments mentioned the \u201cn\u201d word, but both of them referenced a stereotype which I\u2019ve seen applied sneeringly to a semi-mythical group called \u201cthe neurodiverse.\u201dThe idea that my intention is to take anything away from autistic people labeled \u201clow functioning\u201d troubles me. I do not know how to be any clearer about this than I have been. What I support is respect and accommodation for all autistic people. There are many, many ways to approach this. As an individual, not an organization, my time and energies are limited. I tend to focus on the power of language and on images of autism in the media, and the ways these can impact the lives of autistic people, creating very real and disastrous consequences.Language is an area of special interest to me. Given that, I am very aware that the term \u201cneurodiversity\u201d is not exclusive to autism. It is about respect for a much broader range of differences. To me, this includes those who are sometimes called typical, non-autistic, NT or normal, and also those with intellectual disabilities and those believed to have intellectual disabilities whether or not this is actually the case. I don\u2019t believe there is a difference in value of human beings based on ability or any other type of categorization. But in the interest of efficiency, I cannot state this in every post I make. There simply isn\u2019t time to write lengthy disclaimers stating everything I do and don\u2019t believe. Most of my standard disclaimer can be found here, and I\u2019ve made it easily available under the heading \u201cStarting Squares.\u201dSometimes people make assumptions. Hearing the \u201cn\u201d word creates for some a picture of parent-hating, problem-ignoring, head-burying disability deniers. I could spend my time fighting that, or I could let it go. The concept of neurodiversity is an important one. The word itself seems to be most popular among its detractors. For now, I\u2019ll save my arguments for those who would deny the right to \u201cautistic\u201d to people like me. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/03/talking-neurodiversity-blues.html", "title": "\nTalking Neurodiversity Blues\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, October 27, 2007", "body": "\nThis week I gave a presentation on autism and no one, not even one person, during or after the presentation, or even the next day, mentioned the movie Rain Man to me. This is a first. Rain Man has come up at every talk I've done before this, through, I promise, no fault of my own. I have always tried to respond politely that yes, that is one way autism can look, one of many, many ways. It was nice not to have to do that. What was even better, what was amazing to me about this particular group, was the way they listened. No one argued against what I said about person-first language. Instead, someone asked me afterward how professionals could help spread the word about the preferences of autistic adults without appearing to be ignorant of the more accepted standards used in particular fields. No one even tried to steer the conversation toward the imaginary epidemic, though I'd opened the door for them to do so. As a matter of fact, every question directed toward me was thoughtful and relevant to the materials presented and given in a spirit of obvious respect for the autistic persons in the lives of the askers. I felt almost as if I had landed on a different planet. The name of this planet is APSE (formerly the Association of Persons in Supported Employment). These are the folks who work with employers to develop, facilitate or create jobs for people with a wide range of what society views as disabling conditions. What they do best is listen. They listen to what employers need and to what the individuals they serve need and value and want to do. As a group, they understand the true meanings of words like \"ally\" and \"empower\" and they know how to step aside when they start getting in the way.The talk I gave this week was for the APSE conference in my state. It was about Autism at Work, and partly based on my personal experiences and those of other autistic people I know. It was attended by a variety of professionals, several of whom also have autistic family members. None of them said anything like, \"You are not like my child; my child is really autistic.\" In other words, they didn't disrespect, disregard or call me a liar. They listened. They shared their own stories with me. They waited patiently and respectfully as I tried to remember the words for things.Not everyone was so perfectly nice, of course; these are human beings after all, and there was an incident I didn't appreciate in the least. I may write about that in a day or two, after I've gotten some distance from it. It was a different experience overall, though, and one I'm very happy to have had. I made it through almost the entire three days without a word about Hollywood portrayals of my people (other than Jerry Espenson, of course). Then on the way out, someone stopped me. \"Have you seen the movie...\" I was reminding my eyes not to roll. No worries, though. She just wanted to know if I'd seen Mozart and the Whale, if I'd liked it. I gave it a mixed review. At least it was something from this decade.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/10/planet-apse.html", "title": "\nThe Planet APSE\n"},

Bonding tightly with Joe\u2019s Autism Label, I have the power to make Joe\u2019s Autism \u201cmild,\u201d or less real. (Please note: Though I am not an official part of the diagnosis, this does not make me any less real.)In discussions of Joe, you may hear that Joe is Notlikemychild (NLMC). NLMC is simply another name for High Functioning Autism. Joe, like other persons with this form of Autism, does not self injure. Joe may have a history of suicide attempts. Joe may have damage to vital organs from years of alcoholic drinking. Joe may have scars from burning or cutting himself. These do not count. Joe is High Functioning; therefore these things have nothing to do with Joe\u2019s Autism. Joe should really know better. Though he may have head-banged, bitten himself and pulled his hair out as a child, Joe no longer does these things (at least not that anyone knows about).Joe has self care skills which are adequate. Joe\u2019s fear of eviction due to his inability to throw anything away is a result of Joe\u2019s Laziness, not Joe\u2019s Autism. Joe\u2019s fears of legal repercussions due to the bills he forgot to pay are signs of Joe\u2019s Irresponsibility. People with Real Autism lack self care skills on a more fundamental level. Joe remembers to go to the toilet almost every time he should. Joe prepares meals for himself daily. Please do not ask me to be more specific. Joe\u2019s Nutritional Deficiency is not my fault.Joe may communicate well by typing. As Joe\u2019s Functioning Label, one of my responsibilities is to ensure that Joe not use this skill to speak about Autism. I sometimes fail at this, and in these cases Joe may be subjected to harsh criticism, ridicule or even threats for having forgotten that he is NLMC.Sometimes, I prevent Joe from needing accommodations in school, and later in the workplace. Often, Joe will be unemployed as an adult. Sometimes he is underemployed, working at low paying jobs which do not engage his interests or make use of his skills. Joe may misunderstand directions or find himself unable to break inefficient patterns, even when warned by his employer. Joe may have difficulty relating to co-workers, quickly finding himself without allies. He may misinterpret the culture of the business he works for, making remarks which are \u201cinappropriate\u201d or failing to appear at the Optionally Required Social Event.When Joe is fired, I am there to remind him (and everyone else) that this is his own fault. When Joe protests that the employer\u2019s failure to accommodate his Autism may be at least a part of the problem, everyone looks at me in disbelief. I am the evidence Joe needed nothing.

Code Orange today, a heightened state of alert, I\u2019m not sure why. Be careful.  Now what was I wanting to say about this latest discussion of autism as a disability? So many things, but it\u2019s hard to remember, not enough sleep. In the airport, I run into someone. What are you presenting on? I tell her. All of the words are there, advocacy, internet, adults.  Oh, she says, autism. That is a huge problem, so many kids have it. I wonder if I am wasting my time. The LCSW beside me has something to add. It\u2019s the diagnosis, she says, quietly. Over-diagnosis.Well that\u2019s one way of looking at it. Too early in the day to argue. Don\u2019t act weird in the airport. People have been detained for being autistic. Not long ago, a man was told he would have to leave the plane. Try not to act weird in the airport, don\u2019t act weird in the plane. I talk to myself some. Repeat things. Pace. Have you ever eaten a pine tree? Ever? Ever? I have a talking bird toy in my carry on bag, a small one. Repeating is something I do all of the time, echolalia, but even more when I\u2019m nervous. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing it all, she said, it\u2019s such a huge problem.My partner wonders if she should come to my presentation. Will this upset you? Here is the Powerpoint handout.  Here are my thoughts, my feelings. Here is some of the work that matters to me. This is a long flight. The battery to this laptop won\u2019t last. I have to say one more thing. Does this matter?This presentation is about the Hub, but necessarily it is about me, about this blog and my life as an autistic person. Is it a disability to talk to oneself, to repeat things, to carry a toy bird, to stumble over curbs, stare into space, nod in response to questions and sometimes not even? I don\u2019t think so. Not this, not these things.When I get to the conference, most likely I\u2019ll be able to talk. It\u2019s not guaranteed, though, it\u2019s an act of faith every time I say I\u2019ll do this. Whether I\u2019ll say anything near what I mean is something I won\u2019t know until late Tuesday, after.  I have prepared the accommodations I\u2019ll need, Powerpoint with plenty of visual aids, reminders, words in black and white, pictures I can point to if necessary. The people there will understand a bit about autism. That helps, and then again\u2026I have to wonder sometimes, do they think, well that was a pretty good job for someone like that. Still I have to admit a preference for that condescension over the smirks and the bored or embarrassed  looks I\u2019ve seen from the others, those who must have been thinking, why can\u2019t she just spit it out? Get on with it?Someone has left a message in the in flight magazine at my seat. It is a scribbled threat, meant as a joke and an act of bravado I\u2019m sure. The sort of thing you can\u2019t say out loud on a plane or anywhere near the airport.  I picture the guy who wrote it; I\u2019m pretty certain he\u2019s not autistic. I try not to breathe fast, try not to look around, quietly put it back. Later, I realize I\u2019ve left my fingerprints all over the \u201cevidence.\u201dWhat makes it a disability is don\u2019t act weird in the airport. Should she come to the presentation? Too early in the day. A preference for condescension. Looking one more time to be sure the handwriting doesn\u2019t look enough like mine to be mistaken.  Don\u2019t be yourself, not too much, you could be detained and arrested. Back at the terminal, I\u2019d seen a man I\u2019d thought might also have been autistic. He and I had exchanged a look past each other, like code for something. A kind of fear? Code Orange today. Color of  my life. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/01/code-orange.html", "title": "\nCode Orange\n"},

{"date": "Monday, January 14, 2008", "body": "\nSometimes I have a hard time getting started, initiating action, or \u201cswitching sets.\u201d For a lot of reasons, I\u2019ve found it difficult to start writing my review of USD\u2019s Winter Autism Institute which I attended last week. It was, in many ways, a revelatory experience for me, far removed from any similar event I\u2019ve witnessed. Upon returning home, I found myself in a rapid cycling mix of joy and sadness. I had read about this place before, a program where respect and inclusion are not just buzzwords but concepts put into action. Now I have seen it for myself, and am fighting the requirement to return to a more familiar world, one determined to change autistic behaviors before it even understands them, determined to eliminate all that is autism while so few even agree what autism is.At the Autism Institute, autistic people were not presented as puzzles to be solved or problems to be overcome, but as people with whom different types of interaction might be necessary. Behaviors were analyzed for their communicative intent, not treated as abnormalities to be extinguished. Common sense responses were shared to such difficult behaviors as biting, kicking and other forms of injury and self-injury. None of these responses involved countering these behaviors with violence, restraint, medication or imprisonment.The key was shown to be in recognizing the purpose served by the actions and finding other ways to meet the individual\u2019s needs. Instead of asking, for example, \u201cwhy does he do that,\u201d we were instructed to ask \u201cwhy does he need to do that?\u201d A subtle change, yet it can make all the difference in attempting to uncover meaning. Once the behavior is seen as communication, the obvious next step becomes finding a more efficient and less painful way to meet the needs being expressed.Every human being, the presenters stressed, does communicate. It is when behavior is the only way of getting through to others that we have a real problem. The challenge is to find a means of communication the person can use. This might mean typing or speech therapy, signing,  facilitated communication or using objects or pictures to express needs, desires and other thoughts.I was not the only self-advocate presenting. Peyton Goddard shared her video presentation with an attentive crowd. Peyton is a facilitated communication user and was valedictorian of her class at Cuyamaca College in 2002. She is a poet and artist who devotes much of her time to advocacy work. Is she \u201chigh-functioning\u201d then? Well, I suspect few people who met her before the age of 22 would have said so. Peyton had no reliable means of communication for the first twenty years of her life and spent her time in special education classrooms. Her webpage defines autism as \u201ca misunderstood condition that makes purposeful movement undependable.\u201dMuch of the discussion at the conference centered on movement differences in autism. Participants were asked to consider why so many find it necessary to impose a social meaning on the neurological differences which result in \u201cstimming\u201d in autism, but not on the \u201ctics\u201d associated with Tourette syndrome. Rather than ask whether or not such behaviors are intentional, Donnellan and Leary prefer to question whether or not treating the behaviors as intentional would be helpful. If the intent is unknown, perhaps assuming the behavior results from innate movement differences might be more reasonable.Donnellan and Leary use a definition of \u201cmovement\u201d which includes not only observable physical actions, but also speech, thought and emotion. In their book, Movement Differences and Diversity in Autism/Metal Retardation, the authors describe how these differences might influence the development of early relationships and result in the masking of competence.********Question and Answer segmentThere is much more I would like to write about Donnellan and Leary\u2019s presentations, about Peyton Goddard and the other presenters. Possibly, I\u2019ll continue this in another post. I\u2019ve learned not to make promises about this, as it sometimes makes the writing more difficult. As far as the Autism Hub presentation, I wouldn\u2019t know what more to say about that. Meeting Steve D. of One Dad\u2019s Opinion and Do\u2019C of Autism Street was in itself worth cross-country trip. If anyone has questions about the content of our presentation, please leave them in the comments here. If I get several, I\u2019ll address them in a separate Question and Answer post. *********One more thought from Dr. Donnellan\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to change the way people think about autism,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe need to stop thinking about it in terms of the deficits, but to think about how hard these people are trying to be in the world with us. We need to change to support them, because it\u2019s easier for us to change \u2014 we\u2019re the ones with the flexibility. Most of the social skills programs assume that all the changing has to be from the side of the person with autism. That\u2019s not a very realistic idea.\u201d\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/07/good-things-at-usd.html", "http://www.sandiego.edu/autisminstitute/", "http://peytongoddard.com/index.html", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/08/movement-differences.html", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/", "http://www.sandiego.edu/publications/usdmagazine/summer2007/featureb.php"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/01/moving-toward-respect-for-all.html", "title": "\nMoving toward respect for all\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 9, 2008", "body": "\nThis post is for anyone who saw the Hub presentation yesterday at USD. Others are welcome to read it, too.Sometimes people are invited to speak to groups not because they are good speakers, but because they do a good job of expressing themselves in writing. Sometimes this works out well; frequently it doesn\u2019t. It is often the case that these skills, writing and speaking, do not come packaged together, and this is also true for people not on the autism spectrum. For someone like me, though, the transition from written to spoken word can be dangerous, a word I use here not in a metaphorical sense, but in the very real sense of creating false impressions which could ultimately cause very real harm to oneself and/or others. Physical harm, irreversible harm.There are times I almost forget that I can\u2019t always make my mouth say the things I tell it to. There are cues on the slides I use to remind me of what I mean to say next. Nevertheless, these thoughts might fail to assemble themselves unless written out word for word. This is for anyone who attended the talk at USD yesterday, because these things cannot be left out, and this is the way I have to tell you that I know will work.First, I need to say how very much I appreciate being invited here as a member of Autism Hub, and how much more I appreciate the work being done at USD\u2019s Autism Institute. I have attended a number of mainstream autism conferences; this is the first one I\u2019ve seen truly dedicated to understanding and supporting autistic people and our differences, rather than discussing how to change us. Thank you for that, Dr. Donnellan and Martha Leary, as well as all others involved.The idea of supporting people rather than trying to force them into those behaviors the majority can more comfortably tolerate, the correctness of this seems so very self-evident, I often forget what a radical concept it is, how much we are sometimes hated for expressing it. This is what I wanted to tell you:The video by Kev about the history of Autism Hub was well received. So many of us are indebted to the work he did to start this and nurture it into what it is today. What we didn\u2019t talk about is why Kev wasn\u2019t there with us, why he isn\u2019t writing here on the Hub anymore. Kev\u2019s family was threatened by someone with an agenda. His daughter was mocked, funds were falsely solicited in her name, words denouncing Kev were falsely attributed to her.Kev is not the only person who has been attacked for speaking out about the rights of autistic people. Threats have been made against scientists, researchers, bloggers. Yet there are some who accuse us of \"attention seeking.\" Why would threats and intimidation not be worthy of attention? Why would we not seek to show the dangers of being autistic, of speaking out?I wanted to tell this small piece of Kev\u2019s story as an illustration of why this work matters so much to me. Far more important though, is the story of Katie McCarron. I didn\u2019t put her name on the slides; I was sure there was no way I\u2019d forget to talk about Katie, and I knew exactly where the story fit, but somehow, knowing I had already exceeded my allotted time, I didn\u2019t manage to say it.Katie was killed by her mother, Karen McCarron on May 13, 2006. She was three years old. Karen McCarron has said that she wanted to \"take the autism out\" of her daughter, that she wanted a \"life without autism.\" This was several days after the release of the video Autism Everyday, in which Alison Tepper Singer discussed her thoughts of killing her own autistic child. I'm not saying there is a cause and effect relationship; she may or may not have seen the video. I am just saying what happened because some of you, some who may be new to the Hub, haven't heard it before. McCarron's trial started Monday, the same day as this conference. For more information on the trial, see Autism Vox. Think this is just horrible, but surely an isolated incident? See more reports of violence against autistic people here. Does the way we talk about people, the words we use, the layers of meaning behind those words influence the treatment of those groups by others? Possibly? Discuss. If not here, then somewhere. I'm asking you to consider the possiblity that it does. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/", "http://community.livejournal.com/autistic_abuse/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/01/i-wanted-to-tell-you-this_09.html", "title": "\nI wanted to tell you this\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, January 26, 2008", "body": "\nNo, I don\u2019t know anything about the sort of moderation that means avoiding extremes or keeping enthusiasms in check. You are at the wrong blog if you are looking for advice on that. This post is about the moderating of comments, wherein the blog owner decides which comments get published, with the option of rejecting for any (or no) reason any statement (s)he doesn\u2019t want to appear on the site. Asperger Square 8 has always been a moderated blog.I\u2019m considering making a change in this. The impetus for this was the accidental loss of a comment yesterday.It has never been my policy to reject a comment because it disagrees with my views. In fact, I have rejected a total of 4 comments (excluding spam) in the history of this blog. Three of them contained links to a site which regularly publishes threats and libelous statements; another made a violent threat within the comment itself.Disagreement is welcome here. Yesterday, I realized, not for the first time, that I am probably giving some people the impression that it isn\u2019t. I have also come to understand that there are people who won\u2019t comment on moderated blogs. Some of them are people I respect and would like to have input from.Yesterday, I received a comment from a person who was taken aback at my disdain for DAN! The person wanted to state that his/her child had benefited from treatments received at the Rimland Center in Virginia. I hit the \u201cpublish\u201d button (I thought), but then I couldn\u2019t find the comment. I must have hit \u201creject\u201d accidentally. I have restated what I remember of the comment here. If the person who left it would like to clarify or add to this, I have no problem with that. My intent is to avoid not only censorship, but also the appearance of censorship. That doesn\u2019t mean that this blog will provide a space for abusive language; there are plenty of spaces where that sort of thing is accepted.In making the move from moderated to unmoderated blog, very little will change. Threats and personal attacks will be removed; links to hate speech will be removed, as will links to sites about \u201ccuring\u201d or eliminating autism. I won\u2019t always be the first to see them, but I can live with that. Let me know if you like this change or you don\u2019t. If you think DAN! is great, feel free to mention it.

{"date": "Sunday, December 2, 2007", "body": "\nI\u2019ve been asked by a few people, \u201cWhy do you call yourself autistic if your diagnosis is Asperger syndrome?\u201d Most of the time, I don\u2019t feel compelled to answer such questions. I don\u2019t go around challenging people on what they call themselves. I imagine I\u2019d be perceived as quite rude if I did! And I understand the layers of implication behind this one. It\u2019s a heavily charged question, usually posed by someone who has a stake in what is and isn\u2019t called \u201cautism.\u201d What they want to know may be, \u201cAre you trying to speak for my child?\u201d or in some cases it\u2019s more like, \u201cHow dare you use that word to describe yourself when you can do things my child will never do?\u201dThe answer to the first question is simple. No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m talking about my own experience here, and occasionally about things I\u2019ve learned from other autistic adults. The second one is far more complex. To answer it would take several pages of text explaining what culture and language mean to me, the history of various civil rights movements, the concepts of medicalization and of disability as a social construct.  Beyond that would need to be a discussion of the variability in normal autistic development, what it means to believe a child will never do something, the fact that there are some things I can\u2019t do that might surprise the askers of these questions, and the absurdity of anyone assuming they know something about my general level of functioning just because I can write.These are only a fraction of the issues this seemingly simple question can stand for. There are people who want to see Asperger syndrome removed from the Pervasive Developmental Disorder umbrella, away from autism in the DSM to an area in the ADHD or NVLD neighborhood. Now I can\u2019t say for sure, but I think their goal is to shut people like me up. There are people who imagine that my statement regarding my identity, \u201cI am autistic,\u201d will cause harm to someone who needs a particular treatment to live a fulfilling and happy life. Maybe the general public will see that autism is multi-dimensional and not such a tragedy after all. Contributions to \u201cautism charities\u201d might decline. The all-consuming search for a \u201ccure\u201d could come to a halt. People might start to think autism means something like the condition Kanner described in 1943, that it has more to do with social and communication differences and with repetitive interests and activities than it does with using the toilet.I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t have that kind of power.Then there is the opposite question. Why use the term Asperger at all? Are you trying to set yourself apart from other autistics? And that\u2019s a reasonable question. Because I\u2019ve seen people do that, and I\u2019ve seen it be quite ugly. I would like nothing better than to draw a line between myself and those few people who believe they are superior, either to neurotypicals or to so-called low-functioning autistics. My relationship to the term Asperger has evolved considerably over the past few years, and if I were starting this blog today, it\u2019s likely I would give it a different name.On the other hand, there are particular brands of stigma that go with \u201cAsperger syndrome\u201d and these need to be addressed, too.  In some contexts, AS is seen as \u201cworse\u201d than autism, as we are seen as fakers, whiners, or excuse makers. Check out Urban Dictionary to see what some people think about those with the AS label. Of course, these negative images of AS may have a lot to do with the vocal minority of arrogant Aspies and their superior race rhetoric. By identifying myself with the Asperger label too, I can hope to attract a few to this site where they can read another perspective. That we are not better or worse than non-autistic people. That we are not better or worse than other autistic people, either. That diversity really is not about scrambling to be the best or the worst.In assigning my \u201clabel,\u201d the diagnostic team made a decision based on whether or not I was able to use meaningful phrases by the age of three. That\u2019s what they told me it came down to. They considered me to be autistic. And so do I.My next post will address autistic culture and why I find it important to align myself with it. I expect other topics will evolve from this post, as I\u2019ve scraped the surface here of quite a few subjects requiring  further exploration. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/?p=271", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Asperger"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/12/by-any-other-name.html", "title": "\nBy any other name\n"},

Certain people, had they seen me during that year or two, might have proclaimed me \u201ccured\u201d of something, whatever was supposed to be \u201cwrong\u201d with me. Miraculously, it seemed, I had started talking to people, sometimes even to more than one at a time. Various explanations were offered\u2014a twelve-step program and anti-depressant medication certainly each played a role. The combination of the two might have looked like a sure-fire cure for my social difficulties. I\u2019m sure I seemed less obsessive, too.The story of Medication and Me is a philosophical tale of a weirdo determined to hang on to qualities others found useless. I was often unable to speak to people, preferring quiet solitude. I was averse to many of the alleged pleasures of physical existence; too many things in the world I couldn\u2019t stand to touch, to hear, to be anywhere around. An allergy to air, I called it. I sometimes had the feeling my hands were made of paper. Yet I didn\u2019t hate these qualities.As a teenager, I had been offered many a trip to the psychiatrist, the sort of doctor I knew would be waiting to help my parents extract what I thought of as \u201cself\u201d from myself. I refused these offers of help, and I am glad that I did. Far into adulthood, I continued to think of psychiatric medications as a form of cheating and a denial of self. I did not view my constant attributes as separate from \u201cme.\u201d I still don\u2019t.There came a time, though, when I found myself unable to get through a day without uncontrollable crying. I still went to work everyday, but was often found in the corner, sobbing for reasons I couldn\u2019t explain. Clearly, I needed some help. A few months earlier, a person I knew (not a doctor, not any sort of authority on such things) had diagnosed me with \u201can untreated anxiety disorder\u201d for which she recommended I seek medical assistance. \u201cYou are not able to see how people feel about you,\u201d that was the way she put it.I had read Peter Kramer\u2019s Listening to Prozac. I\u2019d seen some familiar situations there, and read some amazing stories of what Kramer described as \u201ctransformative\u201d experiences with the medication. These were said to be rare, but the descriptions of the people who had had these transformations sounded a lot like me. They were at the extreme end of \u201cshyness\u201d or \u201csocial anxiety\u201d and were said to be both obsessive and deeply depressed. I decided, reluctantly, hopefully, to give the stuff a try, if a qualified doctor agreed that I should.A few weeks later, I found myself able to do things I\u2019d never done before. I spoke up in groups of people. I went to a party and \u201cworked the room.\u201d I started making art, something I\u2019d always wanted to do, but had never gotten around to. I decided to go back to school and finally get a degree.Was I acting less autistic? I\u2019m not so sure about that. While I\u2019d started talking more, this may have actually made me seem more different than before. Now instead of staring vacantly, for example, I was scripting and repeating constantly. Sometimes what I said made sense to the listener and sometimes it didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t much care or notice either way, I knew what I meant! Being misinterpreted was nothing new. I wasn\u2019t aware of my autism then, but I was pretty sure I was \u201ccured\u201d of something.I understood that the effects of the medicine would not continue to be so powerful, that I would level out and no longer be Super. I was more decisive for a while, and I used that time to make what must have looked like some \u201cgood\u201d decisions. For better or worse, I made commitments based on a level of energy and optimism I no longer quite possess.My fears of losing my \u201cself\u201d did not come true. I was still me, but with more energy and confidence and without the crying jags. For awhile, I wasn\u2019t sure of this. I thought of myself as Me-before and Me-after, and later as before, early-after and later-after versions. A re-sorting process was going on.I am still learning and making decisions about what is essentially Me and what isn\u2019t. Decisions, yes, the definition and boundaries of what is considered \u201cself.\u201d I am privileged with a fairly high spot, at least for the moment, on the Maslow pyramid. The struggles for survival and shelter, for safety are for the most part met. It\u2019s a more fluid situation than I like to think about.Did you hear what I said? She said \u201cBev\u2019s not shy anymore.\u201dYes, I heard you. I was just thinking\u2026\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://changingminds.org/explanations/needs/maslow.htm"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/12/just-thinking.html", "title": "\nJust Thinking\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 7, 2008", "body": "\n Okay, I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m one of those people who just like to complain. I say we need representation. Autistic adults need to have a voice in the decisions being made about services for autistic people. I get angry when we are not included, when agencies claiming to serve autistic people have no autistic representatives. What am I willing to do about it? What can I do? Lately, I\u2019ve been invited to sit on advisory boards for two organizations. Now I\u2019m thinking, what do they want from me, a rubber stamp? Crip-on-a-stick?  A name they can use to say, yes, well, we listened to this person, sorry she didn\u2019t say what you thought she would, sorry we all disagreed with her, but we did listen, here is the evidence, sorry about your luck. Sorry.There is a line I fear crossing. It isn\u2019t well defined or stationary, but hovers always near the edge of consciousness. More general than token anxiety, it has to do with power and membership, identity and authenticity. Who am I, if I am not in some way the Outsider, the Other? And who do I become if I make the decision to join something?How willing am I and how willing should I be to participate in systems I see as so deeply flawed that really we might be better off to dismantle them and start anew? How willing am I to work with members of groups who have not considered our thoughts important enough to seek out before? How able am I to hold onto my own truths? I am not na\u00efve enough to consider myself immune to the pressures of Groupthink. Why would I not fear contamination of a mind which would then not recognize itself as contaminated? How can I share what I know and what I believe, and not expect to have it twisted and packaged as What Autistics Think: The Pretzel Version?That\u2019s a lot of questions, and not even half of them.I wrote about the Supported Employment organization, APSE, here. That one was a relatively easy decision.  I\u2019ve had time to get to know many of the participants in my state. Lots of disabled people are involved. The positions they hold are as good as the jobs of their non-disabled peers.  I\u2019ve talked to some of them about their experiences as well as their beliefs, their politics. I have gotten to know the officers here; I am comfortable with them, nearly past the stage of suspicion. So yes, I can fit here, at least for awhile.  I really don\u2019t question my purpose or what they want from me. All of this could change, of course.The other organization is a trickier question. It is specific to autism, associated with a university nearby. I have seen positive changes over the past year with this organization. A year ago, I had requested a table at their Provider\u2019s Expo during a conference. I\u2019d wanted to recruit participants for a research study and to distribute literature, including some graphics I'd used on this blog. They said yes to the research, but felt the graphics would be too controversial for their target audience. I felt censored by that, and insulted by the omnipresence of puzzle pieces I\u2019d seen at the tables the year before. I had considered skipping the entire event.This year, they have invited me to speak at the conference, on a topic of my choice.  I have already contributed a statement of beliefs for a resource handbook they are putting together. I fully expected to be asked to tone it down, but that didn\u2019t happen. Instead, they have asked me to expand it. A small trust is established, measured and fragile.Trust may be the wrong thought here. Possibly, I shouldn\u2019t be considering this if I need it, or if I imagine I need anything from this. What is offered, at best, is the possibility of influence. Expecting more would be foolish. Asking for more is another matter. Asking for much more inclusion in, direction by autistic people in entities claiming to serve them, that is a responsibility.All of which provides me no answer, but helps me to distill the question: Is this a reasonable way to exercise my own responsibilities? \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/R6s7GdSGQdI/AAAAAAAABNY/EkK_AOZnBWs/s1600-h/TOKEN8.jpg", "http://crip-power.com/2007/11/25/ba-and-bfp-always-get-me-going/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RkNMoKz9ofI/AAAAAAAAAZA/2wLVvlK-68Y/s1600-h/blender.bmp"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/02/tokenize-me.html", "title": "\nTokenize Me?\n"},

He's done a bit of modeling, but has stated that he does not wish to \"go pro.\" 2) I meant no disrespect to Bobby Watson when I spotted another bird I just had to bring home. Unfortunately, I don't have a current photo of Bobby Goren, but this guy looks exactly like him.What's special about Bobby Goren? He repeats everything twice. Twice! Double echolalia. I couldn't resist this one, although he has to stay on his stand and is therefore less cuddly and portable than Bobby Watson. Bobby Goren enjoys watching TV and chirping.3) For ultimate portability, Burwick is the bird of choice. Also extremely versatile, Burwick is no toy, but an ink pen and flashlight combo that just happens to repeat back what you tell him. He is my newest bird and current favorite, occupying the inside pocket of my jacket on most days. He has never yet uttered an inappropriate word in the workplace. Pictured here, Burwick is patiently awaiting breakfast and a PowerPoint presentation.4) The very latest in toy talking birds: Squawkers McCaw. Squawkers is programmable; in addition to repeating words and phrases, this bird can be \"trained\" to respond to questions. Scripts, anyone?

You can read that announcement here. The thousands of people with disabilities, family members, professionals and others who have written, called, e-mailed and signed our petition have been heard. Today is a historic day for the disability community. Furthermore, having spoken directly with Dr. Harold Koplewicz, Director of the NYU Child Study Center, I have obtained a commitment to pursue real dialogue in the creation of any further ad campaign depicting individuals with disabilities. We applaud the NYU Child Study Center for hearing the voice of the disability community and withdrawing the \"Ransom Notes\" ad campaign. Twenty-two disability rights organizations came together to ensure the withdrawal of this advertising campaign. Our response to this campaign stretched continents, with e-mails, letters and phone calls coming from as far away as Israel, Britain and Australia. The disability community acted with a unity and decisiveness that has rarely been heard before and we are seeing the results of our strength today. Our success sends an inescapable message: if you wish to depict people with disabilities, you must consult us and seek our approval. Anything less will guarantee that we will make our voices heard. We are willing to help anyone and any group that seeks to raise awareness of disability issues, but those efforts must be done with us, not against us. This is a victory for inclusion, for respect and for the strength and unity of people with disabilities across the world. It is that message that has carried the day in our successful response to this campaign. Furthermore, we intend to build on this progress, not only by continuing a dialogue with the NYU Child Study Center and using this momentum to ensure self-advocate representation at other institutions as well, but also by building on the broad and powerful alliance that secured the withdrawal of these ads in the first place. We are strongest when we stand together, as a community, as a culture and as a people.Thank you to all of you who have made this victory possible.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 27, 2008", "body": "\nIn my family and among my acquaintances are a number of non-autistic children. Some of their parents prefer to call them normal or typical or neurotypical. Still others insist upon calling them by their given names. Everyone seems to have an objection to one term or the other. I have been taught to call them youthful individuals with normalcy, but I am willing to change this if anyone can provide a convincing reason why I should. Why bother with such niceties when youthful individuals with normalcy are notorious for not listening to adults anyway?Based on a sample of eight of these children I\u2019ve known (a very reasonable number, I\u2019ve been told), I have determined that most youthful individuals with normalcy (ages 2-5) share three core characteristics: 1) They tend to be sloppy eaters, often presenting with spaghetti or Kool-Aid stains on their shirts; 2) they run rather than walk when they are in a hurry to get somewhere; and 3) they grow at a frightening rate, sometimes requiring new clothing several times during a single year! For convenience, I will call this combination of traits the Triad of Endearments.Many of the people now calling themselves non-autistic, normal, typical, or neurotypical adults did not have the same experiences which affect the youthful individuals with normalcy today. Sure, I know of a few adults who run when they could be walking; I\u2019ve run into several who need to carry a Tide-to-Go stick at all times. There are others who find themselves buying new sizes of clothing well into adulthood. Remember, though, that all of these traits together are needed for the diagnosis. Truly, how many adults do you know who fit this profile? A few, perhaps, but 149 out of 150? I hardly think so!These are the official markers of normalcy. But what has been overlooked? Call it an associated factor or even co-morbid if you must, but don\u2019t be surprised to find an additional criterion added to the diagnostic literature in the near future. I don\u2019t even have to tell you what I\u2019m talking about, right? It\u2019s become that widespread. Far too many of these children exhibit the same inexplicable and disturbing behavior: they wear shoes with lights in them.I am not exaggerating when I say that growing up I did not know one single child who had shoes that lit up. Think about that. Zero. Not. One. Nor do I know any adults who exhibit this behavior. Sure, there may be a few; I don\u2019t doubt that they exist. But not in the numbers some people are trying to claim. What could this mean? Can the shifts in the definition of normalcy account for all the difference? You do the math! Along with other researchers in the field, I am looking for the hidden horde of non-autistic adults. Where are all of these adults in stained t-shirts, running everywhere, lights flashing with every step? Ask yourself, is this something that could have gone undetected?There are those, belonging to a radical happy-talking movement of mildly \"normal\" adults who would have you think that this can be accounted for by the natural maturation patterns of individuals with normalcy. Did any of them wear light up shoes? I doubt it.  No epidemic? Yeah, right. You believe it. But keep the Tide-to-Go handy. Sooner or later, somebody's going to have to clean up the stains from that Kool-Aid.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/R8Ye0NXJ7RI/AAAAAAAABPQ/gq4tXGVtk9I/s1600-h/BluffPo.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/02/search-for-hidden-horde-continues.html", "title": "\nSearch for the hidden horde continues\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, November 21, 2007", "body": "\nI very much appreciate all of the comments on my last couple of communication themed posts. It seems that a lot of us have similar issues with speech, which is not too surprising. Today, I will talk about a few of the things I have found to help. I am going to try to stick mostly to my own experience, though I may refer to other autistic people I know personally and what they have told me. This is not an attempt to speak for anyone else. If you can use this window into my mind to help you understand an autistic person in your life, you are more than welcome to do so.The most important thing to keep in mind is that speech is not the same thing as language, and that communication is a much larger concept still. Listening is at least half of the work. When I am not speaking, I am still communicating; most of the time, I am using some form of language. If you do not try to see what I am already offering, why would you expect me to try harder to give more?As I have mentioned before, writing is easy for me. I can tell you much more in an e-mail than I can in person. Telephone calls are the hardest method of communication. I would love to see some of the money collected in the name of autism awareness go toward purchasing keyboards for autistic people who don\u2019t have access to them.I carry a small notebook with me, primarily for drawing squares, but I have also used it to help get my words together. I appreciate people who do not roll their eyes when I write something down before saying it out loud.Drawing squares is a great way for me to listen. I\u2019ve encountered people who have let me know they see this as rude (for some reason they view it as flagrant inattention when it\u2019s really quite the opposite!) Drawing during a conversation helps me to relax and I can focus on what the other person is saying if I am not forced to look at him/her or the surroundings. Other stims can be useful, too, but a visually oriented repetitive task works best for me. I am much more likely to talk if I am doing these things that help me listen.I have always used metaphorical language to communicate, especially where emotion or feelings are involved. Sometimes this is in the form of stored scripts, other times it emerges along with the particular situation. This can be a problem for people who feel they are being expected to guess what I am talking about. For that reason, I use it far less than I did in the past, and this is always reserved for ongoing relationships and the necessity to communicate something for which I don\u2019t have access to the proper words.Often, the things I do to communicate are seen as pure silliness. Using gestures instead of words is one that nearly always evokes this response. For some reason, if a person can use speech most of the time, it is assumed that she should always use it. This is somewhat like asking a person who can speak fluent English and passable French to always and only speak in French. At work or school, we usually have to speak the dominant language. Accommodations in these areas might increase the productivity of autistic students and employees considerably. Certainly, with friends and family, we would like to be able to relax and communicate in the ways that come most naturally.When someone allows me to use these techniques\u2014writing, drawing, metaphor and gesture\u2014without criticism, I feel valued and accepted. When another person actually participates in some of them with me, trust is more easily established. I recently passed a two hour car trip with a brother-in-law by saying sentences backward the whole way. It began quite spontaneously and relieved the tension of having to be in the car with another person. In this case, the playing field of conversation was leveled by each of us having to think as hard as the other before saying a sentence.Beyond respecting these self-created accommodations, what can a person do to help make speech easier?~Consider whether or not this is the best time for a conversation. First thing in the morning is never good for me. As soon as I walk in the door isn\u2019t good. Pick a time when we are both relaxed and have some time to spare. I you know I didn\u2019t get enough sleep last night or have had a bad day, save this conversation for later.~Turn off the TV! This goes for stereos, too. I can\u2019t process more than one voice at a time. ~Talk to me about things you know I am interested in. I don\u2019t know how to \"talk about the weather.\"~If you are telling a long story, allow ample space for me to comment. I will always have trouble \u201cbreaking in\u201d to a conversation, even on a day when my speech is fairly good. If you can pause once in awhile, but without expectation I will say anything, this is best.~If you are asking questions, please ask only one at a time. Double barreled questions\u2014Would you like to go to the store, and then to visit Kate?\u2014can be very confusing, and can contribute to speech shutdown. ~Allow for opportunities to say \u201cMe, too!\u201d I have had times when I could not ask for something simple, like a glass of water. But I could agree that I wanted one also, if someone said it first. ~Don\u2019t make a big deal about eye contact. The autistic person may hear more of what you are saying if you don\u2019t insist on this or try to force it. ~Don\u2019t jump to conclusions based on body language. I have often had people interpret my posture or facial expressions to mean something far from what I was thinking or feeling. If you know someone is autistic, be aware that that person\u2019s face or body may be speaking a foreign language. Nothing kills a conversation faster for me than having someone tell me what I am thinking. Don\u2019t assume.~ Don\u2019t take my silence personally. If you attribute ill will to my not speaking, this will only make talking more difficult. Nobody wants to work extra hard to please someone who has already decided she is hostile! Other autistic people who read this may disagree with some points. We are all different. Please feel free to add your own suggestions in the comments. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/11/are-you-listening.html", "title": "\nAre you listening?\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, November 17, 2007", "body": "\nThere are people who don\u2019t believe that autistics exist who are able to talk at some times and not others. They view this as a very different phenomenon from the autism they know, the autism that means never speaking or having access to only a few words. At least one such person refers to people who have \u201cchosen\u201d to become non-speaking autistics. There is probably nothing I can do to change the minds of people who have so much invested in seeing clear dividing lines between categories they call LFA and HFA. I don\u2019t waste my time trying to convince them any more than I argue with people who don\u2019t believe in evolution. My time and energies are limited.This blog is for people who know this to be true, or are at least trying to get it: sometimes, for some of us, talking is not possible. Sometimes it is barely possible and uses up energy that could be spent more productively in other ways. Sometimes talking hurts. Fortunately, there are many other ways to communicate. I believe that nearly everyone can benefit from at least one of them.Several comments to my post on therapists I\u2019ve known and their collective aversion to silence suggested that this problem of disbelief is widespread. Being yelled at or disrespected for not speaking is far more common than it should be. One person also asked if there are particular stressors which contribute to problems with speech. I will address here just a few of the mechanisms I am aware of which make speaking (and also listening) difficult. In order not to make this unmanageably long, my intention is to follow up this post with one about things I have found helpful.The first thing you will need to recognize is that conversation is a complex skill. Though it may come easily and seem automatic to you, speaking is never a smooth process for me. Suppose I am asked a question, \u201cWould you like to go to the store now?\u201d First, I have to figure out the literal meaning of this. Which store? Does \u201cnow\u201d mean immediately, or could it mean in ten minutes? By \u201clike\u201d do you really mean to ask if I would enjoy such an outing? Or is this something I will be required to do, if not \u201cnow\u201d then later?Once that is sorted out, there is the subtext to consider. Are you asking me to go with you or alone? Are you going to be upset if I choose the \u201cwrong\u201d answer? I will need to interpret this in the context of what came directly before, and also any history I have with you about \u201cgoing to the store.\u201d I will need to observe your facial expression which, like your speech, I will need to analyze one part at a time. Is that a real smile or fake? To know this, I understand that I must check the eyes; I think I know that a raised eyebrow means impatience, but is this with me or something else? I will need to interpret the tone of your voice and also see if this fits with what the facial expression and posture seem to indicate.Now I am ready to construct a reply. If I say simply \u201cYes, I am ready,\u201d will this be taken as overly formal, or will you think for some reason that I mean the opposite? Is my face expressing the right level of agreement. I know that the word \u201csure\u201d can be misinterpreted as sarcasm, so I won\u2019t use that one. \u201cOkay,\u201d in this situation might possibly sound like I think I\u2019m being coerced. So the answer is, \u201cYeah, lets go now.\u201dBut it\u2019s too late! You are already going into detail about how I never want to do anything.As you can see by this description, conversation can be exhausting. How many exchanges like this one, and how many of far greater complexity does a person have to navigate in a day? At some point, the system will shut down, just as you will eventually need to sleep after working a full day or sit after walking a long distance.If you accept that talking is a complex skill and difficult for me, think of it as analogous to whatever you can do fairly well with concentration and effort. This might be calculus or playing a difficult piece of music or speaking a language you have studied but don\u2019t use often. What makes these things easier for you? What conditions are necessary for you to be able to do them?A setting free of distractions is important if I will need to process spoken language. Background noises make this more difficult, and sounds you might not even notice may seem very loud to me. A TV on, even in the next room, can make interpreting language much harder. For some autistic people, lights and visual patterns are an issue. Most people on the spectrum have some sort of sensory issues; like everything else about us, these are highly variable.Lack of sufficient sleep is a common occurrence for me and can also contribute to shutting down. Anxiety, depression and physical ailments will also affect my ability to process language. Pressure to respond more quickly (or otherwise respond in the way you would prefer) is nearly always counterproductive. This is something that will impede rather than enhance my ability to talk.It is important to acknowledge that no matter how hard you try you may not know the reason for the disappearance of speech. In some cases, I won\u2019t be able to figure it out for myself and there may truly be no better answer to the question than \u201cI am autistic.\u201d Furthermore, I may know the answer, but not want to tell you. That is my right. If you are able to understand and respect these things, there is a chance I will want to talk to you, though it will still be difficult.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/11/lets-have-conversation.html", "title": "\nLet's have a conversation\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, May 3, 2007", "body": "\nI have a confession to make.I've been blogging.I know, I know, writing a blog is not illegal, immoral, harmful or bad in any way. If you are reading this and are not the Whom referenced above, you may be wondering why a person would need to confess to a thing like this. But to Whom, this may come as a shock, simply because I usually tell you most of what's going on in my life, at least the important things, and you've not yet been invited here.This is my effort to correct that. I was going to say \"that oversight\" but really, it wasn't. I started writing this blog a couple of months ago, just to have a place to put down some thoughts you seemed not to want to hear. I need a place to talk about my life within the context of what I now know about myself and about autism. I had grown tired of the discussion boards where most of the members were quite a bit younger and had different interests and concerns from mine.As you know, I have been reading blogs by autistic people and friendly others for some time. It seemed a natural development to start one of my own. I didn't tell anyone I know in \"real\" life. For the first month or so, I didn't link to anything. I wanted to get comfortable doing this before I opened all those doors. Writing on the internet is different from anything I've done before. It's not that I think a lot of people are going to read what I post, but the knowledge that anyone could makes this feel like a very public endeavor.I want you to know that this was never meant to exclude you. Everything I've said here is something I've either said to you or wanted to say. But wanting to be honest and open has conflicted with my need to avoid the pointless and draining arguments which have often ensued when I've tried to tell you these things.I know, too, that you sometimes find the disparity between my written and spoken \"selves\" disconcerting or even alarming. This is perhaps the most apparent hallmark of my autism. It's not about hiding things or being secretive, but about the fact that talking aloud is like speaking a foreign language to me. Yes, I can do it, on occasion I can even do it seemingly well, but that does not mean it suits the way I think or has the capacity ever to express my thoughts and feelings with accuracy. Writing is the form in which language works for me, and doing it has always been vital to my sense of being whole.I used to have the strangest feeling that I was lying when I said this, even though I wasn't. I think now that I had internalized a lot of garbage from people who assumed I wasn't trying hard enough, was just shy or looking for attention. Since I have known the truth, I have started to like myself much better.As you said to me tonight, I can not un-see what I have seen. Nor would I. I will never go back to being confused about why some things are difficult for me. Blaming oneself for what could not have been otherwise does not define responsibility. Neither is it the key to personal improvement.I have been writing a lot here about disclosure and visibility and the importance of these in negotiating societal change. I have had several opportunities lately to speak in classrooms and at conferences about autism and my life. I find that I must now go a step further in making myself heard, even when you have shown me that you are not ready to listen. It isn't any secret that I hate personal conflict and will go to great lengths to avoid it.I can't do that anymore. Not without becoming a liar. And then I would hate myself again.Coming out to family, to those who have the most invested in their images of who their loved one is, is always hardest. It's never just a one shot deal, free from obligation to repeat. This is who I am. This is always who I am. Please accept this invitation to what goes on in my head. Welcome to my blog.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/to-whom-it-may-concern-confession.html", "title": "\nTo whom it may concern: a confession\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 1, 2007", "body": "\nJerry was back in Boston for the second week in a row, this time defending a sorority accused of kicking out members for \"social awkwardness\". Last week, Espenson had struggled with his new found \"persona\", a wooden-cigarette-chomping blustering a-hole capable of holding his own against opposing counsel Alan Shore. In the end, he pocketed the prop and delivered an eloquent closing as his charmingly autistic self.This week, he only flirted with the idea of morphing into SuperJerry, maintaining his Aspieness throughout the episode. He argued that as a social club, the sorority had every right to reject those it found to be lacking in sociability. He added that the student had learned a valuable lesson regarding life's unfairness and the penalty she'd have to pay for having a perceived disability. He pointed to the cruel remarks made by his own colleagues who had recently used his diagnosis against him in attempts to undermine his confidence. These he painted as incidents of cruelty executed by basically kind and moral people in times of weakness, the sort of unfortunate thing one must expect to encounter in a flawed society.I hadn't planned anything specific for Blogging Against Disablism Day, but the questions addressed by the show seem fitting as well as tying in with some of the arguments I've been running through my head this week. One has to do with conflicts between professional and personal responsibilities and has so many components it will require a full post to scratch the surface. Best to let that wait until after finals week.The other one I will mention here is partially an offshoot from a discussion on Whose Planet Is It Anyway re: Hillary Clinton. I had remarked there that I suspect Clinton is oblivious to the facts, but probably not ill intentioned. Two points in the reply from abfh gave me the opportunity to reflect on the basic concept of intention and how much weight it deserves compared with place of importance I tend to grant it.The first point was that in her position, Clinton should know better than to spread harmful propaganda and make such ridiculous statements as she has about eliminating \"anything along the autistic spectrum\". I agree absolutely with this; every senator and representative must accept the responsibility for critical thinking and information gathering. Certainly, one who aspires to the presidency must recognize that the current discussion of autism goes far beyond the surface picture and the concerns of the organized and monied faction seeking to force its own agenda. It's not like she doesn't have plenty of staff to assist with this gathering and thinking.Yet we are still a small voice among many louder ones. There are a number of autistics working hard to spread the message that the popular War on Autism is more properly seen as the promotion of not only institutionalized discrimination, but potentially, genocide as well. Abfh's second point was about the evils done historically by persons who just \"didn't know any better\" than to follow the lead of a charismatic but depraved figure. One has to wonder how the course of history might have been changed had an equally strong and articulate voice of reason been able to intervene.How can we become that voice against the rising fanaticism surrounding this issue? How can we best demand the attention of mainstream media to the cause of autistic human rights? The internet is a powerful tool and there are many powerful writers and thinkers on the Hub and elsewhere. I believe in blogging as a medium for spreading ideas. I see it as a necessary but not sufficient action to write about injustice as well as about my daily life in the context of being \"differently brained\".When I find myself wondering what more I can do, I think about the other \"isms\" still plaguing society. Every minority movement has had to begin with waking the twin sleeping giants of denial and ignorance. Sometimes that means jumping up and down on their heads, knowing how cranky giants can be when roused from a deep sleep. As an \"out of the closet\" autistic, I know what I am risking. There are consequences and there will be more repercussions to come. I know what it feels like to be swatted down by people with \"good intentions\" but without an active interest in and commitment to learning the truth.These consequences, however real, must be measured against the cost of invisibility and silence. The person who cannot hide, who cannot \"pass\" will always pay the price. The price must therefore be lowered through the participation of some of us who have at times the choice to \"play the part\" of neurotypical.Sometimes, when I catch myself doing it, I think about Jerry, far from the ideal role model, but a visible Aspie at least. I picture myself at those times with a goofy wooden cigarette between my lips. Spit it out, I say to myself. If I say it out loud and twice, so much the better. I'm an Aspie and sometimes that's what I do that's what I do so deal with it.The longer the giants sleep, the bigger they get. Let's make some noise.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RjgPfaz9oEI/AAAAAAAAAVc/Yb3nnisV6v0/s1600-h/jerry+3.jpg", "http://www.boston-legal.org/", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/04/hillary-clintons-final-solution.html", "http://ani.autistics.org/jane.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/crane-poole-and-schmidt-and.html", "title": "\nCrane Poole and Schmidt and Neurodiversity\n"},

{"date": "Friday, May 4, 2007", "body": "\nReading some of the recent posts about rude comments and the difficulties in distinguishing them from the \"just curious\" comments or actually harmless ones, I reflected again on the number of times I've encountered people who saw it as their right to amuse themselves by imitating the way I walk. I tend to exhibit what was recently referenced on a discussion board as the \"Aspie Bounce\", and this was a great source of entertainment to fellow students in my junior high and high schools. This was long before I knew I was an Aspie. Aspies did not exist yet and autistics, as everyone knew, were children who did not speak and certainly did not make appearances in the hallways of \"regular\" schools.Often, I would notice a \"follower\" or someone approaching me would see fit to show me how ridiculous I looked to him or her. Mostly I ignored these as well as possible, though I did sometimes stop in my tracks to stare down the offender. A few times I offered instructions on needed improvements in the imitator's technique. Secretly, I wished that I could confront them with the shocking news that my walk was due to a neurological condition, that they were in fact making fun of a disability. Not that I thought that was true or anything.It was the bounce that offered my first glimpse into my autistic nature. I was reading a book by an autistic woman when I saw it. The book happened to be Donna Williams' Nobody Nowhere. I had been finding pieces of myself throughout in the \"talking in poetry\", the stored scripts, the role playing needed to relate to other people, in many other details. When I got to the page where she described the way she had walked as a child, though, I knew. It was the Eureka to end all Eureka moments in my life.I started to read all of the literature I could find, both professional and biographical. I saw it everywhere. Odd gait, awkward gait, toe walking. Frank Klein, for one, has written somewhat wistfully about having had the walk trained out of him. Where had it all been before? Invisible, I suppose, like so many things have been until I was ready to see them, and then, suddenly everywhere.The behavior of children had never surprised me. The pre-teen and teen years are a time of boundary exploring and drawing which seem for some to bring cruelty to the surface. What threw me for a loop, though, was finding out the adult world was not really all that different. People who have seen fit to mock my way of walking have included store clerks, co-workers, bosses, and even a social worker I met through other acquaintances.Unlike some others I've read about, I never unlearned or outgrew the Aspie bounce. I tried a few times, but thinking about every step was exhausting and tended to produce a very foul mood. I'm glad now that it didn't work. This walk is a part of who I am. Not an important part maybe, not an essential part of my spirit or personality, but a part nevertheless and there is no reason on earth I should be expected to give that up.For forty years, I never talked to a single person about this and how I felt about it. I honestly believed that other people acting like jerks meant that I had a problem. The only problem I had was living in a world that expects everyone to be alike.I guess that's why when I found out I was autistic, I wanted to tell everyone. I was finally okay with myself, reasonably happy, and it had taken such a long time to get here. When I started to talk about the walk, a longtime friend responded, \"You mean you don't walk that way on purpose?\" I guess she had imaginined I must think it was cool or something. And you know what? Now, I kind of do.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RjtYaKz9oJI/AAAAAAAAAWM/WqH6yHhqP_0/s1600-h/sillywalks2.jpg", "http://home.att.net/~ascaris1/abnormal.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/can-you-walk-walk.html", "title": "\nCan you walk the walk?\n"},

{"date": "Monday, February 11, 2008", "body": "\nYesterday, a person known to me, I\u2019ll call her Ellen, reported that she had met a \u201cnonverbal autistic boy\u201d in a group she\u2019d attended. He had seemed to understand everything that was said in the room. He had laughed at all the jokes, though he had spoken only one word during the two hour event. As she had expressed surprise, I explained, not for the first time, that yes, autistic people do tend to hear and understand conversation, much like anyone else. Ellen knows me well. We have discussed autism on many occasions. She wanted to know how anyone could be sure of someone\u2019s understanding if that person did not speak. I talked about alternative means of communication, again, not for the first time. I talked about people I know of who write or sign or gesture or who otherwise communicate, though they do not speak.Ellen\u2019s next question disturbed me. This was not the first time I\u2019d heard it. Did these people not speak by choice, or because they truly were not able? I tried to explain why \u201cchoice\u201d is a difficult word in this context. I talked, once again, about the huge variability of people on the autism spectrum. I have told Ellen about the \u201cautism advocate\u201d who not so long ago stated that some adults have \u201cchosen\u201d to become non-speaking autistics. I was not in the mood, by this time, to further elaborate on that story, or to discuss the controversy over the NAS spot which was criticized by many for a statement made by an autistic man who prefers not to speak.Instead, I talked about the things I had written here, in a post which I believe Ellen has read. The point I stressed was that talking is a lot of work for me, and that I understand that this is so for many if not most autistic people. Yes, I can produce speech, but not in the quantities or at the rate expected by most non-autistic persons, and not with any confidence that what I really mean is ever being heard. Isn\u2019t my energy better spent on writing, a medium which allows me to say, with reasonable consistency, what I really mean, and allows others to understand my thoughts as well? Oh, she responded, finally seeming to understand. A strengths perspective. Yes, that\u2019s right, I said, relieved to have this opportunity to declare the conversation finished, at least for the moment.That was last night. Today, I happened to be at lunch with Ellen and her brother and some other family members. Ellen\u2019s brother is not autistic, but has worked as a special education teacher for years. He knows about autistic people, you see. Still, I was more than a little surprised to hear Ellen announce to her brother that she had met a \u201cnonverbal autistic boy\u201d the day before. He\u2019d seemed to understand everything people had said! Hmmm. That was what the brother said about it. Hmmm. As I listened to the story of The Boy Who Understood, I had to wonder, not for the first time, why I spend any of my energy on speaking at all. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/02/again.html", "title": "\nAgain?\n"},

I have a bird that repeats what you say to it. Oh, all right...I have two of them.2) Stored scripts. It's amazing how they come to the surface as needed, bits from TV shows and advertising. Sometimes I don't figure out until later why it was relevant, but most often, it was.3) Understanding that there is much more to people, all people, than is readily apparent. This is what makes no sense about the Theory of Mind concept. It seems to me that NTs are the ones making the wrong assumptions so much of the time. The autistic people I know are much more willing to accept that we don't know the motive behind every action and word, and to not assume malice without reason.4) Logic. I took a course in it this semester and found out there's a lot I don't know about logic. I enjoyed it thoroughly, though. Credit for arguing and playing games!5) Abstract art. Autistics are sometimes said to be bad at abstract thought. This is a myth due to neurotypical tendencies to constrict the definition to the types of abstract concepts they prefer to talk about, emotional words like love and hate. I prefer the kinds of symbols for which there is no direct translation into words. When I see (or draw) a square it means exactly what I see it to mean.6) Humor. Finding a common sense of humor with others has been one of the greatest gifts of diagnosis. NTs are forever asking me if I am joking or serious. I finally figured out that for most of them, it's either one or the other. What's the point of that, I wonder?7) Visual imagination. I don't think in pictures generally, but I do get a lot of cool visual images, many of them based on another trait sometimes described in the mainstream literature as a deficit: taking things literally. These are not only a source of amusement, but many times offer an alternate and richer perspective than would have been available without the dual meanings of the words merging into one.8) Routines. Deciding what to wear, for example, is easy. A t-shirt, usually black, and jeans. A soft long sleeve shirt over that if it's cool. And shoes, black skateboard style shoes. For dressier occasions, I'll add a blazer from the thrift shop. I do have a suit for special occasions. I thank Ellen every time I wear it for showing the world that it's okay to wear sneakers with a suit.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rj6am6z9oQI/AAAAAAAAAXE/JvqXiVuc1nM/s1600-h/8-ball.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/eight-more-things-i-like-about-being.html", "title": "\nEight more things I like about being autistic\n"},

{"date": "Monday, May 7, 2007", "body": "\n I am visiting a nearby clinic, having lunch with a friend and colleague who works there. A student clinician is having some trouble with her new autistic client today. It seems that he throws things when he's frustrated, and he frequently is. He's well behaved as long as his mom's in the room, but goes ballistic as soon as she leaves. He kicks the clinician and refuses to play nice with toys. She's come to my friend's office to ask what she should do.We talk about what might be making him unhappy. He is four years old and is being asked to answer what color is this, what color is that, work on his ABC's and on sharing. They are trying to use a reward system. I throw out a couple of ideas about using his interests, not so much as external rewards but to make the lessons rewarding in themselves. I suspect this kid knows all about colors and ABCs and isn't too interested in performing this show that's being asked of him.I end up offering to make some more interesting materials for the clinician to use. I try my best to make my point about not talking to people (and this includes 4 year old people) as if they were none too bright. Right now, this is all I can do.What I want to do is go down the hall to where the boy is and try to find out what it is that he wants to work on. Maybe he wants to go outside; it's a beautiful sunny day and there are plenty of rocks and cracks in the pavement to be seen and bricks to be touched, blades of grass to be shredded. But those are my ideas of fun. I don't assume this is true for everybody any more than saying what color the sky is or what comes after \"C\". I do know that the letter \"D\" is easier to talk about when I am shredding grass. Or drawing squares.I wonder if anyone has ever listened to this boy, really listened to whatever form of talk or alternate ways of saying things he uses. I wonder if he is bored with blue and wants to talk about turquoise, aqua, cornflower, periwinkle. Or if the existence of all those shades might make \"blue\" an intimidating concept. I wonder mostly if I've made a really bad choice, deciding to work in this field. I feel discouraged before I've even started, doubting my ability to make a difference in a world that seems already to have made up its mind.My main interest is in working with autistic adults around employment issues, where the right to self determination will only need to be defended against disability based bias, without the additional concerns inherent in working with minors. To be more honest and precise, I want to work with the employers and co-workers of these adults, to help them understand how the different thinking styles and behaviors of their autistic compatriots can benefit their organizations. Sometimes it's a good thing to have someone around who doesn't think \"blue\" is a good enough answer.But right now, I want to go and sit with an autistic kid and stim. And look at the sky and not think about the words for sky because words put limits on things that are so much bigger than that and really mean so much more.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rj6zRqz9oTI/AAAAAAAAAXc/hzVLz9fIyiA/s1600-h/ABA+color.bmp"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/behavioral-issues.html", "title": "\nBehavioral Issues\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, May 9, 2007", "body": "\n I've spoken up for Jerry  and Boston Legal a couple of times here. I've never, ever condoned the Asperger's Defense as an excuse for criminal behavior, whether the perpetrator is fictional or real. But I like Jerry that much, I identify with his quirks and am willing to view pretty much anything that occurs at BL as a part of the general surreality of the firm. The very implausibility of the situations the show presents is what makes it fun.So I've given Boston Legal time off for good behavior. After all, some recent story lines have gone on to explore the discrimination and ridicule Jerry encounters and his growing acceptance of himself as a \"very odd man\". The strategies he has used to navigate the ultra-neurotypical world of courtroom law have been believable and poignant. Damn it, I just like Jerry.Last night, a parole violation occurred, when Shirley, for no good reason, blurted out that Jerry's Asperger's was a mitigating factor in his earlier attack on her. The statement added nothing to the scene, in which Shirley discussed with partner Paul Lewinson the possibility of giving Espenson his job back. Yes the whole plot is ludicrous; only at Boston Legal could a person be re-hired after threatening to kill the boss. But what an opportunity the writers missed here!Boston Legal, for all its shenanigans, sometimes does a pretty good job of whittling away some of the nonsense surrounding current issues. This would have been the place for a discussion of what it really means to use a diagnosis of autism as a legal excuse for violent behavior. This would have been so much more compatible with the recent development of Jerry's character, as well as a boost to the show's credibility. In the crucial balance between social satire and buffoonery, BL could use a little ballast on the satirical side. Instead of an argument though, Lewinson responded with a shrug.No, I'm not giving up on Jerry. I won't boycott the show. I like his company, even as I recognize the huge flaws in his character and in the show's general understanding of AS. I do think they are trying, but they've still got a long way to go. And they are not the only ones. By which I mean, if I want to see a visible, out-of-the-closet, bona-fide Aspie, what are my other choices? If Jerry's the only one \"representing\", I want to see him and his colleagues doing a better job of it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RkIS_6z9oaI/AAAAAAAAAYY/60QBxpSNH0Q/s1600-h/bl-sueme-billboard-350.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/shirley-youve-got-lot-of-explaining-to.html", "title": "\nShirley, you've got a lot of explaining to do...\n"},

Another interesting Ramen site can be found at the Tokyo Food Page. This one describes a Ramen museum and theme park in Japan. The museum even has Ramen themed video games. \"What's Next, Ramen Noodles?\" is a Wired satire asking the question, \"What if noodles had their own industry association?\" Wikipedia notes that \"RAmen\" is an affirmation used in the faux Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Fun reading.Far less fun is the daily task of reminding people that human beings should never be classed as inferior goods. I had more than my fill the last few days. It seems everyone has an opinion and is behaving more and more like someone who deserves the name of that other associated attribute everyone has. For the moment, the less said about this the better. For now it is sufficient to say that there are some neurotypicals who will be protected from my blatant use of free speech. They are sensitive persons and must not be offended by the presentation of materials that might be upsetting.Umm..by the way, is that a puzzle piece on your t-shirt, or are you just unhappy to see me?Tomorrow, I may have more to say.

{"date": "Friday, May 11, 2007", "body": "\nI hate mayonnaise. I hate it as much as the sound of packing styrofoam and that is a lot. This is just one of the many reasons why I support accommodations in the workplace. I want mustard on my sandwich. It's not too much to ask. For years, I've gone to the same Wendy's, and it's been dependable. Only not so much in the past year. The people who work there can't seem to remember which is the name of the yellow condiment. This is not their fault. English is not their first language.This has nothing to do with the politics of citizenship, \"official\" languages, fences or any other xenophobic nonsense (and any comments to that effect will be deleted). It's a simple matter of economics. If a business cannot meet the customer's need for any reason, the customer will go elsewhere.The solution to the problem is so simple it's laughable. I'm sure it's been used for years in other areas of the country where ESL workers have been in the majority for longer than they have in this region. It would cost almost nothing to program the restaurant's computers to display and print bilingual tickets. This would help the employee, the company and the customer, and in the area where I live, it is long overdue.What is the barrier to this simple and logical accommodation? Surely, it can't be that no one has thought of it before...I am just not that brilliant or innovative. Why the resistance? Could it be...prejudice? The need to define \"the other\", to draw the \"not me\" line is so pervasive and ingrained it escapes the notice of even the most enlightened among us from time to time. I see it in myself every time the subject of the Milgram experiments comes up. Yes, a large percentage of people would torture someone nearly to death under the guise of science, under the urging of perceived authority and given assurance that they would not in the final analysis be held responsible. Shockingly, this has been shown to be true in these and other experiments. But not me. I would never do that.Right? I wonder how many of Milgram's subjects would have said the same, had they been asked hypothetically how they would behave in such a situation. I'm betting every last one of them, though of course I can't prove it. All I know is that \"not me\" gets a lot of mileage. A heated discussion has been going on at another blog regarding Cho's crimes and the questions of individual vs societal responsibility. There is a lot of \"not me\" being traded.I wish I could look at Cho or the Milgram subjects and say \"not me\" with that kind of certainty. I can name times when I've chosen not to do wrong and times when I haven't. I think I have a pretty good idea what I would and wouldn't do in most situations, given my own personal history and current mental health status, but even then I've surprised myself at times. No one has died because of my bad choices. That's not something to be really proud of. Some problems are as easy to fix as adding a second language to a restaurant ticket. Others, like seeing the parts of ourselves we are so determined to disown, require a lifetime of effort and mindfulness. I have heard the remarks some of the less evolved customers at the neighborhood Wendy's are making. It appears that their hatred of Hispanics increases with every wrongly sized order of Frosty or fries. If they can't do the job right, I've heard, they don't deserve to have the job. Meanwhile, others are saying the same about people with disabilities. Who is responsible for these displays of hatred and ignorance?Partly the business owners who have not provided the simple, inexpensive tools that would make the jobs feasible. But it goes beyond that. The artificial lines we draw between not only ourselves and others but between concepts like individual and societal responsibilities are to blame as well. I am very guilty of \"other-izing\" the construct of Government. Not Me is waging a pointless and immoral war in Iraq. Not me has convinced the citizens of my country that civil rights are something we can do without so many of for a while at least. I am so angry at this not me, this \"government\" that I want to disown it. Because as an individual, I would not ever do these things. I vote, which is the minimal level of participation a person can take and still be considered a participant. I decline, most of the time, to engage in political discussions. They upset me terribly; some days I won't even look at the news. There is so much more I could be doing, like helping to register voters and taking part in online political discussions. I don't want to be associated in any way with many actions my government is taking. Instead of working to change the course of history, I become overwhelmed with despair at the thought of these actions and the people, those people who have allowed this to happen. Denying that those people and I are one and the same, and not just in some grand metaphysical way, but in the concrete sense of uncounted numbers of silent and overwhelmed would be dissidents. I shake my head at those who don't understand why people of varying races and abilities deserve to be seen and treated as equals. Sometimes I forget to check for my own blind spots, of which there are many. Sometimes it can be as simple as looking at persons with obvious prejudices, failings more apparent perhaps than my own, as though they were less than human. After all, I would never ever--in their position, with their upbringing, education, life experience, neurology and other circumstance ad infinitum--ever act that way, would I? No, not ever, not a chance. Not me.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/of-mustard-and-milgram.html", "title": "\nOf Mustard and Milgram\n"},

It is clearly something I do in order to appear more autistic than I really am. This is evidenced by the fact I started doing it around the time I realized I was autistic. Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc? Nah...2. I am even worse at eye contact than I used to be. Another intentional exaggeration? Giving up on life? Or giving up on pretense? You be the judge!3. Not answering the phone. I let the machine get it. That's what they are for (my opinion). I might call back when I feel up to talking. I never have quite figured out why anyone, autistic or not, is expected to be available for chatting on demand. You see my ways as rude? Tu quoque, friend, I see your insistence on instant chat gratification as just a tad impolite myself. To each her own.4. I say \"meaningless\" phrases and repeat myself. Seven times seven is forty-nine. It is. It is. It is. It is. It is. What's that you said about your day at the office again? Wait, didn't that happen yesterday, too? And last week on Tuesday, only that time it came up in your conversation with Rita, and today it was with Mac? You think I don't have this scenario memorized by now? I don't mention that, though. It would be very rude to do so.5. I spend an awful lot of time writing. If I could have just one day where no one expected me to chitchat or answer any questions, that would be such a gift. Writing isn't a luxury to me. It's my best way of getting things said and helps me to organize my thoughts. Want to hear what I'm saying? You guys read, don't you?6. Drawing squares in little books. All the time.7. Sometimes I am asked to do something and I don't do it or I don't do it right away. Noncompliance? Free Will? Let's call the whole thing off?8. Chirping, rocking, tapping, facial contortions, growling, pacing, odd finger movements. These are so much worse than the things \"normal\" people do like throat clearing, jangling keys and that lovely sound some people like to make with chewing gum. I could go on, but eight really is such a lovely number.

It has been suggested that I show up there in a \"polite\" neurodiversity t-shirt to offer an alternate perspective to the clueless. Guess what? I don't feel like being polite. I feel like pulling the most blatant in-your-face anti-cure shirt from my drawer, deciding it's not quite enough, and buying or making something a little more to the point. Something containing a level of profanity I don't use in this blog. As I pointed out to my (very supportive and wise) NT friend, I wouldn't feel very safe in this crowd no matter how sedate the message on the shirt. I suggested a counter-rally to be held the night before the walk at a slightly less hostile location as an attempt to draw a little public attention to the fact that autism is not a disease and not really something to be crying about all the time or a reason to flush your hard earned money down the curebie toilet.  Sure, showing up at the Main Event would be purposeful and direct. But a subtle message would defeat the purpose and a more truthful representation of what I believe would most likely result in my being removed forcibly from the area. I know a couple of anti-cure parents here, and maybe one other autistic person who might be persuaded to join me. Still, I'm thinking I might have more success attracting people to a counter rally, where they could feel more hopeful of not being verbally or physically attacked. Either way, this is not a time and place for being overly polite. I'm pretty sure Rosa Parks would not have been invited to take the front seat if only she'd smiled a bit more or said \"please\".

{"date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2007", "body": "\n Long before I knew I was autistic, I was being told that I rely overly on logic. Picking statements apart to reveal inconsistencies is not always prized in relationships with NTs who often just want to say things in order to \"connect\" emotionally, regardless of whether these things make any sense or not. I get that, kind of, but only on a superficial level of understanding, akin to the way NTs grasp that, although I don't always talk well, I am not an idiot. The information, though valid, doesn't really penetrate in such a way as to alter the behaviors.So I expected an introductory course in logic would be a breeze. After all, I have lost about 3 arguments in my life, right? More than a few people have referred to me as \"Spock\" and several have been so bewildered by my refusal to accept their logically flawed declarations of affection that they simply disappeared from my life. I enrolled in the required class with what I viewed as confidence, only later to realize it was more like unfounded arrogance, and four months later emerged with a new found respect for what logic really is. The first sections on identifying the parts of arguments and various logical fallacies confirmed my suspicions that I already knew everything there is to know in the field of logic. Deductive, inductive, syllogism, red herring, check, check, check, check. No problem. I learned some terms to add to my arsenal, like amphiboly and the delectable tu quoque. I hit a speed bump around here at diagramming arguments. A lot of this seemed disturbingly counter-intuitive, as if the word \"because\" had suddenly developed an evil twin also meaning its opposite. Then there was the problem of truth tables, which really are quite simple as long as you're not sloppy about it. A four color pen came in handy here; I highly recommend it for all types of academic work and drawing squares in small notebooks. Needless to say, mistakes were made in this section. I never got very good at cursive handwriting or keeping a tidy house--sloppiness is my middle name. No, not literally.Mostly, things went fairly well, though, up until something called natural deduction. It sounds friendly enough. The rules are straightforward and fit together in elegant, neatly structured forms. They have cool Latin names like modus ponens and modus tollens that are fun to say. Some combinations of the rules have a clear order of operations; others are more flexible, allowing for multiple approaches. These proved to be the bane of my existence for a while.Why were the \"easy\" problems found at the ends of the problem sets instead of the beginning? Why was I being asked to prove that if I need a pencil and eraser for the test, and I have a pencil, I need only a eraser--in eight steps? Eight steps to answer what a first grader could tell you? I just couldn't get this stuff. Every time I had to prove that the sky is blue through an intricate series of steps, including the fact that it is not not blue, my brain froze up. This just did not seem logical to me.I started to have nightmares featuring scandalous headlines: Asperger Student Fails at Logic! Witnesses Say She May Be Typical After All! I found myself translating the dilemma into symbolic logic. I figured out how to insert the appropriate symbols into a Word document. Then found I could not solve the problem once I had transcribed it. Not a good sign.Some of the things I learned in this class will stay with me for a long time. One is that I am very good at spotting logical fallacies. Another is that this can be very dangerous if I only use this ability to construct more complex fallacies which will remain undetected by most others. Now I am able to see the ways I have done this, without even knowing it. Yet another lesson is that there is no such thing as a positive stereotype. What if I had failed at logic? Would I lose my autistic cred? Was it really worth stressing about, or did I have just way too much of my self esteem tied up in my ability to reason in this strictly defined way? Have I worked so hard to free myself from the expectations of neurotypical society, only to constrain myself through yet another set of expectations--to be some sort of \"autistic ideal\"? These are examples of rhetorical questions. There is no such thing, I believe, as a positive stereotype.All's well that ends well, I suppose. I still suspect my professor of adding at least half a point to my final grade due to my anxiety and love of the subject. I hope she didn't take too seriously my offer to translate the complete works of Shakespeare into symbolic logic for extra credit. I've got a busy summer ahead of me, and still so very much left to learn. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RlR6x3yASHI/AAAAAAAAAfU/GLk3V6CENK4/s1600-h/herring.gif"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/logically-speaking-everything-i-need-to.html", "title": "\nLogically speaking: Everything I need to know, I learned in PHI 120\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 20, 2007", "body": "\nAt a seminar I attended, a woman was concerned about her daughter, who had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The girl refused to say \"hello\" to people, which it seems, is considered the height of rudeness, right up there with ignoring a ringing telephone, in the NT community.The speaker responded with several approaches to social skills training for the errant young woman. First, though, she listed a number of reasons an autistic person might not be saying and doing what she \"should\". The most likely possibility seemed to be that she was absorbed in her own thoughts (perhaps that separate world we are said to inhabit?) Also mentioned was the Theory of Mind deficit that was probably keeping this girl from knowing that other people expect you to say hello upon seeing them.What wasn't mentioned, what seemed perfectly obvious to me, was the fact that \"hello\" is a basically meaningless word. Or to look at it from a different angle, it's nothing but attention seeking. \"Here I am, and yes, I see you are here too!\" As far as I can tell this is what \"hello\" means. It seems pretty illogical, to this Aspie anyway, that every encounter should need to begin with this statement of the obvious. I've gotten used to it of course, and regularly say hello to people I meet. As a teenager and younger adult, though, I was far more loyal to my logical instincts and very much resented the requirement to greet everyone. I did not at all appreciate being given a script of what to say. I like to choose my own repetitive (meaningless? not to me) scripts. Hello was a thorn in my allegedly non- metaphor-understanding autistic side. These days it's an annoyance of smaller magnitude, but make no mistake, it still is one.How many times in a day is one required to say \"Hello\" to a single person? I'm talking about someone who works or resides in the same building and no one has left and come back. I would think one time, possibly twice on a long day, separated by several hours in between. But no. Several residents in the building where I work behave as if they've been slighted if I don't say \"hello\" upon every passing in the halls. A couple of them will comment, \"Not speaking today?\" or \"You don't say 'hello' anymore?\".Sometimes I think about saying it in my own words. \"I see you\" or something similar. It would be seen as rude, I guess, to try to improvise on the word. One must adhere to the script in this case, or risk being viewed as hostile.

{"date": "Friday, June 1, 2007", "body": "\n Lately, while reading comments from some parents on posts I've written here, I've noticed that some of my writing has made them sad and fearful for their childrens' future lives. This is something that always puzzles me (oops, she said \"puzzle\", whatever will the search engines think?) I usually consider myself to have a pretty positive outlook on life as an Asperger adult and I frequently write about the things I like (sometimes in sets of 8) and other happy aspects of autistic living. So when I read comments about fear and sadness, I stop to reconsider what kind of message I'm presenting and why it comes across differently to NT parents than it does to my differently brained sisters and brothers. Have I become a Sad, Sad Aspie or what?Well, I think not! Sure, I write about unhappy events, prejudice, misunderstandings, sometimes even outright abuse resulting from the same. I write about the people in my life who sometimes wish I would be a bit less me. Some of these things make me sad and some make me really really ticked off. These are things many many autistic people experience with far more frequency and intensity than I do. I really am one of the lucky ones in that these events are even noticeable. For some, they are constants, no more worthy of mention than the color of the walls in their living rooms. If they have living rooms at all, or any of the other rooms composing what we casually refer to as a home. For some, there is no home.Yeah, okay, I see it. I can be something of a Downer. Wah-wahhhh.Early in my blogging career (yes, all of two months ago) I complained about a study of internet sites which claimed autistics only discussed negative emotions in their blogs and websites. I did my own quick survey of sites and found a number of positive perspectives available to anyone who might choose to read them. It never occurred to me that my own blog would be viewed as depressing by others. After all, I am one funny Aspie!I believe this is somewhat related to differences, both neurological and cultural, between autistics and NTs. We are often accused in the literature about us (that to which we are infrequently asked to contribute) of being overly serious and having no sense of humor. I've not met an autistic yet who didn't find these statements preposterous. Yes, I laugh at this stuff all the time. Who has no sense of humor?Studies have shown (and I'm feeling entirely too blase to bother with citing one) that people who are clinically depressed are better at predicting events and outcomes than those who are not depressed. What does this mean? It seems to imply that people, in general, need to be wrong about the state of the world in order to be happy. Yes, things really are as bad as we feared! And maybe we are engineered to not notice the indicators of doom and gloom around the corner so that we can go on about our business and possibly prevent the sky from falling. Autistics may tend toward a kind of detail oriented observation which does not allow us to as easily ignore those indicators. Some of us may be less able to overlook contradictions which escape the attentions of those who are busy trying to do what is socially required. In contradiction, much humor can be found. As Debbie Downer frets about salmonella during Thanksgiving Dinner, she seems pretty miserable. But she who notices the undercooked stuffing will be the only one not making the trip to the emergency room later on. We laugh at Debbie and think she is a sad sad person. Maybe she's just realistic. As usual, I've gone off on a tangent. I meant to say that I'm really very happy being autistic. That doesn't mean I don't have to talk about problems. It just means I don't wish to trade them for NT type problems. So don't be sad, parents. Just keep on appreciating your unique and observant children for the wonderfully different individuals they are. They probably will be about as happy as you are to have them in your lives right now.**This claim not backed by scientific evidence. No expressed or implied warranties. Confusion could result. Generalizations about autistics and NTs are or are not intended to be taken with or without a grain of salt every 4 to 6 hours. Consult your local autistic adult before beginning any questionable treatment program. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RmBPol7AI7I/AAAAAAAAAhM/UBDrdt0ngRQ/s1600-h/fortune.bmp", "http://home.att.net/~ascaris1/Sad_aspies.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UszX_NkkOk"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/06/positive-perspectives-from-one-autistic.html", "title": "\nPositive perspectives from one autistic point of view\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2007", "body": "\n I happened to catch part of \"On the Lot\" Monday night. \"On the Lot\" is a FOX network reality show for aspiring film makers, and is directed and produced in part by Stephen Spielberg. This week's task was to produce a one minute comedy film. Jason Epperson's entry, titled \"Ghetta Room\" was described as the story of a \"nerd\" trying to be cool.The main character exhibited several traits sometimes associated with Asperger syndrome, including physical and social awkwardness, and misunderstanding of slang. The gist of the story is that he uses a popular expression inappropriately, offending an elderly couple and is subsequently evicted from a movie theater and into the street. There he is run over, killed and transported to Heaven, where he tries the same line again, this time forfeiting his claim to eternal salvation. The studio audience found this quite humorous; the judges, however, were not amused. Each in turn gave the director a dressing down for mocking the \"mentally challenged\". All three judges (Carrie Fisher, Garry Marshall, and Brett Ratner) were clear in their criticisms: This would be funny if the character could be clearly identified as a \"nerd\"; it falls short of the mark and becomes offensive because the butt of the joke seemed to them more properly described as \"developmentally disabled\" or \"retarded\".Well, at least it's agreed that ridiculing someone with a cognitive disability is in poor taste. Exactly what qualifies for exemption is less clear. Does it count if you have a disability that doesn't show? That shows part of the time? Should a person wear her diagnosis on a t-shirt? Does it depend on how able (or likely) he seems to retaliate? In this case, the judges' opinions seemed to be based on how they perceived the victim's intelligence. Nerds are presumed to be smart, I guess, and thus have the resources to defend themselves. Wondering what others might have to say about this, I looked around the web and ran into this essay by Paul Graham, titled \"Why Nerds are Unpopular\". A sample:Because they're at the bottom of the scale, nerds are a safe target for the entire school. If I remember correctly, the most popular kids don't persecute nerds; they don't need to stoop to such things. Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes.The trouble is, there are a lot of them. The distribution of popularity is not a pyramid, but tapers at the bottom like a pear. The least popular group is quite small. (I believe we were the only D table in our cafeteria map.)So there are more people who want to pick on nerds than there are nerds. As well as gaining points by distancing oneself from unpopular kids, one loses points by being close to them. A woman I know says that in high school she liked nerds, but was afraid to be seen talking to them because the other girls would make fun of her. Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense. The need so many of us seem to have to distance ourselves from persons perceived as mentally retarded is deconstructed eloquently by Amanda here.How difficult it makes life to need to draw these lines. Why not promote respect for everyone instead? It's a nerdy idea, I know, but I like it. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rl18bXyASRI/AAAAAAAAAgk/w_iy1j_Zx34/s1600-h/nerds.jpg", "http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?cat=49"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/nerds-r-us.html", "title": "\nNerds 'R Us\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 27, 2007", "body": "\n To distinguish is to recognize the characteristic features belonging to a thing. This seems like a positive activity. It does to most parents of typical children I know. They work hard to help their offspring learn the difference between cars and trucks, between airplanes and helicopters without once worrying that there is some unspoken message being conveyed that one in the set is superior to the others.Likewise, when discussing their children, I've noted that moms of typical kids like to point out those things which make the child unique, be it a precocious ability, a trait shared with a beloved uncle or a fondness for broccoli, and that these things, neutral as they are, are usually stated with obvious pride.Somehow, parents of autistic kids are not supposed to want that.In the (far from distinguished) movie, House of Cards (1993), a psychiatrist played by Tommy Lee Jones reprimands a mother who marvels at the conversation in prime numbers carried on by two autistic boys. He cautions her that this type of behavior is commonplace at the facility he runs; the ordinary, the unremarkable is what he wants to see more of. And so should she.Of course the main character's daughter turns out not to be autistic after all. It's okay for her to have her \"special\" traits, since somehow these resulted from having undergone a very traumatic event. Never mind the ludicrousness of that whole scenario. The point is, she is \"normal\" so her being special is no longer a problem. Plus, her elective mutism is \"cured\" magically after two or three therapy sessions.Is this really what our society wants for it's autistic citizens? Suppress your weirdness, suppress your gifts. Be like the others. Be average. If it isn't good enough for parents of typical children, why should it be a goal for those whose children happen to be autistic?Distinguishing and being distinguished are good things. As far as I'm concerned (I'll speak only for myself here), distinguish away. Just don't discriminate.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RlmacHyASLI/AAAAAAAAAf0/A3r42kEIHEI/s1600-h/distinguished.bmp", "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/distinguish", "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/discriminate"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/not-indistinguishable.html", "title": "\nNot indistinguishable\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, June 5, 2007", "body": "\nI am not a leader of any sort and I\u2019m a lousy follower. I think of myself as more of a getter-out-of-the-way, but then I can\u2019t seem to stay out, I\u2019m always coming back to put my two cents in.I know that everyone is already loaded down with too many analogies and metaphors, but I can only tell you how I\u2019ve been thinking about the recent Hub discussions in this way: Somebody started talking about who should be driving the bus. Everyone agrees more or less that autistic people get to drive; this is an autistic bus we are talking about. (Unless it\u2019s really a neurodiverse bus, and that\u2019s a separate issue.)The first problem for me is that I don\u2019t see the bus. I see people in cars, on bikes, in chairs, on foot and even on horseback all moving in approximately the same direction. At some points we diverge and then come back together; some veer off on other paths, but mostly we are headed in the same general direction. We are each driving our individual vehicles, sporting the bumper stickers with which we most identify. On the way, we do our best to find other vehicles to join us. If there was a bus, I missed it.The second problem is that I find myself getting nervous when people aren\u2019t what I consider \u201cnice\u201d. A funny thing happens though, over a couple of days, I find myself making excuses for the mean, rude or insulting statements of some, while continuing to hold others accountable for similar indiscretions. I start to realize that 1) I am not the Autistic Miss Manners of the internet \u2013it\u2019s really none of my business how anyone expresses him or herself; and 2) I\u2019ve formed a lot of opinions about people whom I\u2019ve never met, based on the judgments I\u2019ve made which have more to do with their writing styles than anything else.Someone made a remark that seemed rude to others, who then made more insulting statements and the whole thing snowballed out of control before the actual discussion of the issues even got underway. Now a person who is an experienced and knowledgeable activist wants nothing more to do with the rest of us. And others are talking about leaving not only the Hub, but the whole neurodiversity \"movement\" as well. Everywhere these discussions continue, I see the same thing over and over: I didn\u2019t mean this, you don\u2019t understand that, \u201ca failure to communicate\u201d. And I believe all of it. I really believe that no one meant any harm or offense.I try (and often fail) not to generalize about autistics, but one thing the DSM seems to have right is that we all have \u201cdifferent\u201d ways of communication, both expressive and receptive. Not that NTs don\u2019t have plenty of misunderstandings, but from what I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019m not the only autistic person who has to say things in several different ways to have even a hope of getting my point across. This is one reason I sometimes prefer pictures to words. And even knowing all this, I forget sometimes, that I might not be seeing the big picture, I might be missing the \u201cgist\u201d of what\u2019s being said. I get hung up on details, often concerning the use of language. And that\u2019s not even wrong, it\u2019s the way my mind works.In addition to having what I see as an identifiably autistic communication style, I also admit to being a specialized thinker. I am not a generalist, by any means. I will never be able to do what Diva does or what Kathleen does; I don\u2019t have that kind of drive about collecting and analyzing the types of information they do. I\u2019ll never be as eloquent as Andrea or as smart as Amanda or as unswervingly compassionate as Joel. No matter how much I sometimes wish I were, I\u2019ll never be an Autistic Bitch From Hell. And Larry is so unique I can\u2019t even put a name on the many ways I\u2019ll never be like him.And I\u2019m fine with that. I think it is a strength of our community, if you want to call it that. I do what I do and when I try to do something else it sometimes works less well. One of the things I do, though, is less than helpful and that is avoiding conflict. Duck and cover, stuff is flying and I don't want any of it to land on me. I can't afford to get fed up with other autistic people and true allies to the point I want to say I'm done with advocacy and neurodiversity altogether. There are too many actual enemies of autistics out there, people I must fight whether or not I like it. Sometimes conflict is necessary. Sometimes repeating oneself ad nauseum is necessary. It's not really possible to be an activist of any sort and not participate in what's going on in the community of like-minded persons. So point me to the bus. I won't drive it-- I hate driving almost as much as I hate conflict--but I won't sit in the back either. I'll do what I do, and hope its enough, knowing there are many competent autistic people also doing what they do best. I want it to be a red double-decker. The NT allies can drive the top level. It's good to have them on board.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RmVL94IC9LI/AAAAAAAAAjk/3MG5lcM7xuo/s1600-h/token+1.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/06/ride-invisible-bus.html", "title": "\nRide the invisible bus\n"},

She\u2019s sure FC is a sham and a scam and a really bad thing. She\u2019s heard things.This person and I have a relationship conducted mostly through email. Sometimes we talk in this way for an hour or so, writing back and forth. It\u2019s fun and meets my companionship needs well. Here\u2019s the weird thing, though. Sometimes, I can tell whether or not her husband is home just by the way she writes, even though he hasn\u2019t been mentioned. How come?There is a different tone and tenor to the conversation.

I mean the classic retro-futuristic style robots from the fifties and sixties. The clunkier and boxier the better. Rosie from the Jetsons over R2D2 any day. But in a pinch, just about any friendly robot will do.Although in many ways I am a certifiable grown-up, I still love talking in a stereotypical robot voice. There was a TV show in the eighties, by all accounts a terrible show, Small Wonder, which featured a robot girl stuck in a non-robot family. She never smiled. But then, she never cried either. She took language very literally and always left me in stitches (!) much to the annoyance of those who got to listen to me repeat Vicki's lines for the rest of the week. Now lest anyone think this is a statement that deserves being twisted into some ridiculous lie about autistic people not having feelings, I should be clear that this is most definitely not the case. I have found that people do not read me well, that I am not conventionally expressive, and am in fact \"oddly\" expressive in such a way that I am frequently accused of feeling things quite removed from the reality of what's really going on. Pair this seemingly counter intuitive nonverbal behavior with a conversational style NTs tend to perceive as evasive or even hostile, and maybe you get the idea why presenting as a robot might be easier and actually enhance one's ability to communicate. For one thing it takes some complicating factors out of the equation. For some NTs, robots are a more familiar concept than Aspies. This may help them \"translate\" the language and behavior better, resulting in less confusion for allI met the robot pictured above tonight at one of those pizza buffet/game arcades.

{"date": "Sunday, June 10, 2007", "body": "\nThere is a blog I've started looking at recently which has caused me to think more that usual (which is a lot by the way) about the concept of master status. I found this blog when it popped up on Blogger as a Blog of Note; it is called T-shirts Around the Internet. I have always thought of t-shirts as an important sociological phenomenon as well as a good alternate means of communication. Growing up autistic without knowing there was a name for this collection of oddities, I found myself using t-shirts (some would say excessively) for the dual purposes of identity exploration and public redirect. If I appeared sometimes \"strung out\" or addled, the addition of a Wittgenstein shirt was sufficient (in my mind at least) to transform my public identity from \"loser druggie\" to \"person distracted due to heavy thought\". Throughout the years, as my master status transformed from hippie (tie dye) to communist (hammer and sickle) to lesbian feminist (womyn's music logo) to punk (too many to list) to artist (Klee, Kandinsky), I collected the shirts of various fringe and outsider movements. Sometime in my twenties, I settled on the plain black t-shirt, identified with multiple aspects of my self image, which remains something of a uniform today. It not only says a lot without saying (directly) much of anything, but is ever so helpful in solving one daily problem of choice which is still at times an issue for me.Except of course when I'm wearing  an oddizm design or another autism t-shirt (edit). I'll never give up my older collections (most of which will never fit again) but I'm firmly convinced I have found my true master status, the thing which makes me who I am and determines most about what I do and don't do and how people view me. (This idea is met with some derision from those who have known me throughout many years of t-shirt collection, but never mind them, they have statuses of their own to contend with).Reading the recent posts around the hub about Neurodiversity and its relationship to Autism Advocacy and to general disability advocacy, I took a quick count of recent purchases. The score is as follows:Autism: 5 (one is a sweatshirt, but I'm counting it anyway)Asperger syndrome: 2Neurodiversity: 2I realize now that autistic has always been my master status. I just didn't call it autistic. I called it \"being different\" or \"being weird\". Other people called it things like \"why don't you just grow the hell up\" and \"anti-social\" and \"rude\". I think I prefer being called autistic. It doesn't erase or negate any other status you might want to label me with. It doesn't mean I don't have other differences or that I think the ones I have are more important than those of others. For me, it just puts the rest of my life in perspective. It makes sense of seemingly disparate, even conflicted traits. The shirt fits, so I wear it.The next step will be designing my own.

I can't locate the lyrics, but have found that it was written and performed by Tim Cavanagh. It was all about the deaths of Andropov, Brezhnev and Chernenko, along with speculation that Gorbachev must be feeling fairly safe, as his name did not begin with \"D\". Heard once, stuck in my head ever since.Two: The word \"No\". Need I explain this one? For maximum effectiveness, say it out loud.Three: \"When you get to the Spanish looking buildings on the left, turn right\". This direction, given by a passenger in my car, is something I tend to repeat whenever giving or receiving directions under similar circumstances. Somehow, this dropped from its specific place down to the \"template\" level for general driving directions. It seems to alleviate some of the anxiety of not knowing exactly where I'm going.Four: From the album Echolalia, I repeat (!) here for clarification, \"Which Bobby Watson do you mean?\" This line from Ionesco's The Bald Soprano got stuck way back in high school and is a general indicator of confusion upon hearing words or names. It is his wife that I mean. She is called Bobby Watson, too.Five: General Cinema's theme song. Sublime. Perfect. Serve with extra salty popcorn.Six: \"Maxwell Smart is going to be the chief. But first the chief has to be the chief\". This line was spoken in a dream had by my best friend in 1978. It means, things are going to work out, but you must be patient. I had this line engraved on a Zippo lighter. I don't smoke anymore, but a Zippo is a nice thing to have. Seven: \"There is a bigger one down the road\". Similar in meaning to number six, but more about serendipity than success. This was stated by my brother on vacation in Florida (early 70s) about a Piggly Wiggly store. He thought we should shop at the bigger one; we never found the bigger one. We were quite hungry when we got back to the small one. \"There is a bigger one down the road\" applies not only to businesses, but to anything in life which has temporarily eluded.Eight: \"Ticket!\" Left over from my days of restaurant work. Accompanies the sound of a ticket (order) coming out of the printer. More generally, used to indicate something which needs urgent attention. Tiiiicket!!!!Note: The ticket pictured here is courtesy of says-it.com ticket generator. You can make your own!

{"date": "Tuesday, June 19, 2007", "body": "\nI had never heard the story of Piers Bolduc, but came across it yesterday over at Larry's blog. It's very much like other stories I know much better, but somehow this one hit me in just such a way that I was able to grasp at a deeper level what before I had known intellectually. I am Piers Bolduc, or would have been if my life had been just slightly different.From the time I was 13 or 14, I was encouraged (no encouraged is not the word, it was implored, I think) by my parents to \"see someone\" about whatever it was that was \"wrong with me\". I am so very lucky, that however many ways they discounted my true nature and individuality, they did not force me physically into the car and on into the office of the psychiatrist they knew would have the right pills to make it all better.They were not alone in thinking that something was wrong. I read a lot of books, and recognized in myself some signs I was sure were indicators of incipient schizophrenia. The odd jumbled language I used when I talked at all, my lack of typical interest in others, an all too vivid imagination which was always arranging random patterns to form meaningful, often frightening images. Of course, I had not lost touch with reality (well, no, because I wasn't schizophrenic), but I saw in the textbooks that this was scheduled to happen some eight to ten years later.When my parents said psychiatrist, I said NO. I was allowed to say NO, though they protested I was wrong and they cried and told me how many hours of sleep they lost because I was, well, just basically, weird. I knew exactly what they wanted the doctors to do and I told them, I remember it distinctly. \"You want them to make me not me anymore\". They had no answer to that, it was the truth. Probably, they felt some guilt about that, because after all, they are basically good people, loving people who wanted the best for their children. Their definition of \"best\" and mine were at odds. Though I was denied the rights to many decisions that should have been mine, I got to say NO this time, when it counted the most. I know that they wouldn't be particularly pleased if they read this. It's not the kind of praise I imagine parents want from their adult children, but my gratitude today is sincere.It is a sad state of affairs that I feel the need to say \"thank you\" that I was not forcibly drugged, imprisoned and otherwise abused by institutions. So many others have not been allowed the word NO. Some of what follows has been documented here and here. I want NO for everyone, adult and child, with every type of difference. NO is a most fundamental of rights and a prerequisite to a life worth saying \"yes\" to. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/08/08/nasper08.xml", "http://laurentius-rex.blogspot.com/", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?page_id=259", "http://community.livejournal.com/autistic_abuse/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-in-parallel-universe.html", "title": "\nNo: In a parallel universe\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, June 21, 2007", "body": "\nDear conference attendee, In case you didn't know, I'm autistic. You say you have a child who is autistic? Or you work with autistic people? Yes, I know, you call us \"people with autism\", that's what you've been taught is correct, and I can't blame you if you haven't heard that this is not the preference of most autistic adults. I have a copy of Jim Sinclair's Why I Dislike Person First Language for you. Here you go, no charge. I've printed out lots of copies, along with other information which I fully expect to see lining the trash bins later. A few of you will read it, and that's all I can reasonably hope for.Oh, you didn't know I was autistic? I wondered, with all that experience between the 600 or so of you, if you might not recognize it. Maybe the way I walk is like your son or the way I stare at the pattern in the carpet is like one of your students. Just in case, though, I wore a shirt with a statement of my identity in very large letters. No, it wouldn't have been considered rude to comment of that. You see, I have some problems initiating conversations. I have a hard time standing up in a group to say, uninvited, that some of the things I'm hearing are missing the mark by a mile. I don't always come across as intelligent or sensitive when speaking, either. Maybe you've noticed this about someone you know, too? Maybe that person can write pretty well, and you don't even know it yet, or maybe she will develop the ability to communicate well in this way. That's something I would think might encourage you. From what I've seen, you could use some encouraging. And so could I. I'm going through a bit of culture shock right now, though I've been to several of these conferences before. This year is different, mostly because I have spent the past several months communicating with autistic people via the internet, and also with a very small number of autism professionals (N=3) who have supported the idea that my views about my own cognitive and social differences do count for something and are worthy of respect and discussion.Yesterday, I attended the panel of family members. Where, I wondered, were the autistic members of these families? Why were we not represented by even one voice on this panel of \"experts\"? Whose needs are being served by this? There were questions which seemed to baffle the parents. They knew a lot about negotiating the IEP process and finding respite workers, but I might have been able to clarify some things about bullying, depression, and friendships for people on the spectrum. Did you think of asking the autistic adult in the room? Yes, I could have spoken up, but I am not likely to do that without being asked. Remember what I said about the trouble initiating? Can I tell you what this was like for me in a way that might make sense to you? It was much like you were discussing the rights of a racial minority in front of a member of that group, while pretending she wasn't sitting there. I was hearing words like \"burden\" and \"imposition\" used about my people by those who are closest to the individuals being discussed.Maybe the problem is that I seem too \"high functioning\" to have anything relevant to say. I know some of you think that anyone who drives a car, lives somewhat independently, has a job, goes to college, etc. could not possibly understand what your child or student or client is going through. You may be right. I'm betting, though, that my brain is more like his brain than yours is. I might know something you don't about what it means when he says that line from a movie, always in a certain type of situation. I might have a clue why she seems so angry all of the time.This is your invitation to ask. If you are reading this because I gave you my card with the name and address of this blog, thank you for visiting. Your comments and questions are welcome here. I will also be at the Provider's Expo later today. The directors of this conference have allowed me a table to recruit subjects for research and to distribute some literature on the rights and concerns of autistic adults. I hope you stop by and talk with me. It may be difficult, yes, I might seem uncomfortable and so might you. That's nothing to worry about, it just means we are trying something different. It might be a good place to start. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/person_first.htm"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/06/when-words-on-t-shirts-fail-me.html", "title": "\nWhen words (on t-shirts) fail me\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, June 23, 2007", "body": "\nDr. Bombay (not his real name) wants nothing more than to help autistic children and adolescents learn how to fit into neurotypical society, so that they can achieve their goals of having jobs and relationships. He isn't all that concerned with making tons of money, but he would like to be known as the \"go to\" guy for parents who are concerned that their offspring might pick their noses in a job interview.Dr. Bombay is a good guy, basically, and has many positive things to say about autistic people, and sometimes even remembers that many of us prefer \"autistic\" to \"person with autism\" and can explain why without even rolling his eyes.However, Dr. Bombay commits a serious faux pas, when he lets it slip that autism is \"no excuse\" for bad behavior. The word \"excuse\" becomes a virus, quickly spreading throughout the conference setting. At every subsequent session, parents and professionals are hearing that we must not use autism as an excuse for failure, which is defined in various ways by the speakers and listeners. Comments from the floor are presented in the same language. The next day, an autistic (adult) speaker continues the theme, and also paints disclosure as (sometimes) a form of or avenue toward the increasingly amorphous concept of \"making excuses\". The final straw is added as a much younger person \"with autism\" lets the parents in attendance know that they should not view their childrens' autism as an excuse for not trying. Now the whole conference is abuzz with the word, repeated echolalically, losing all meaning and context. Now anyone wishing to discuss accommodations in society and the workplace is looked upon with suspicion, and compelled to nervously tack on the now standard disclaimer.What has gone wrong here, and what could Dr. Bombay have done differently? Let us consider that perhaps there has been an error in perspective taking. Dr. Bombay is not autistic, which is not his fault, but does perhaps hinder his ability to define what any particular autistic individual can or cannot do. More importantly, though, he has failed to take into account that we have every right to choose not to exert our energies toward social niceties, that these monumental efforts are most often unrecognized and unappreciated by NTs who continue to find fault with our acting abilities, and most importantly, that however much employers and others may wish to have an army of identically behaving clones, this is not a thing which would ultimately benefit the species. Dr. Bombay has failed to consider just how sick and tired an autistic person can get of hearing the word \"excuse\". This is a loaded word he has used. This is a very anger-provoking word, often used as a weapon by people who have no clue what being autistic is like. Dr. Bombay has forgotten to take into account the subtext, the possible connotations, the ignorance and hatred so often attached to this word. Now I'm not going to tell you there is \"no excuse\" for not knowing the power of this word or any word to hold people down. I don't know your situation well enough to say that. I am going to ask, however, that in future presentations, you practice some perspective taking. You are a respected person, speaking to a group starved for information. The words you choose are every bit as important as the concepts you are trying to impart. Yes, I know, this talk was not directed at us, but at those who must live and work with us. That doesn't help me one bit, Dr. Bombay. From here, these professionals will go back to their jobs in their cities and spread what they have heard to more parents who will then experience relief that they were right all along, telling their children, \"No excuses!\" And the children will push themselves harder, or not, and will take another hit to their self worth either way, and their future employers will feel quite smug in their conviction that no accommodations are needed, and nothing will change, again, for the better, and people behaving autistically will continue to be marginalized and blamed, and yes the run-on sentence is intentional, it goes to state of mind.I will keep coming to your talks and offering my own viewpoints, which will continue to be disregarded as irrelevant by parents and professionals alike. I see it in their eyes as I hand them my flyer or raise my hand to speak. I see it pass through them like a storm. They see a person asking for recognition of rights and respect for autistic people. Just another lazy, impertinent nobody trying to make excuses.Tomorrow (or, possibly the next day): A very positive encounter with a professional at the same conference. Seriously...I promise. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/06/social-stories-for-autism-professionals.html", "title": "\nSocial Stories for autism professionals\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 24, 2007", "body": "\n1)I spoke with one of the presenters I had met a few times before. He asked me if I'd heard of someone called christschool. He had recently discovered some enlightening work on youtube and was including it in his presentation. He also used (unprovoked by me!) the word \"eugenics\" in reference to autism cure groups. 2)Actually viewing christschool's videos in a room of people who had never seen them before, who had not been exposed to the ideas presented and watching their reactions. This was a nearly transcendent experience. \"16 Ways Neurotypicals Can Empower Autistic People\" was at the very beginning and worked well to set the tone for the session. The highlight, though, was watching \"Repetitive Behaviors like Rocking and Flapping\", which is my very favorite christschool video.3)The same presenter asked me to meet with him and an autistic man for whom he is trying to find employment. This is someone working in the field who really \"gets it\" and understands that as autistic people, we may have something to offer other autistic people beyond what NT's have. This was the last session of the conference and left me feeling significantly more hopeful.4)Though few people I met had ever heard the word neurodiversity, \"neurotypical\" has made a lot of progress. Last year, no one was using it (at this particular conference); this year, every single presenter I encountered used it. I find this somewhat encouraging. If we have been able to affect the language in even this small way, there is hope that sometime in the near future, professionals will start getting over the idea that \"autistic\" is a negative word.5)Toward that end, I was able to distribute nearly all of the literature I had brought, and to speak with several people individually and in groups about the use of person first language and other matters of importance, such as expectations of conformity. After the first day, I decided I would just speak out every chance I got. Someone may be listening...I can't always tell for sure.6)I met some cool autistic people, mostly there with their parents. When the keynote speaker was unable to keep the engagement due to an airport closing, the coordinators chose a nine year old autistic boy to fill in. He did a great job, using a PowerPoint he had given before in smaller groups. Though I did not agree with everything he said (or for that matter with everything said in the presentation given by two autistic adults), the choice to include these voices here was an important one. 7)I made several useful connections which I hope will result in finding more participants for my research study. They have been difficult to come by. 8)Seinfeld episodes as studies in effective vs. non-effective social behaviors were discussed at length by one presenter and he uses these with his clients frequently. I nearly didn't include this as a positive point, due to Seinfeld's association with an organization I despise. However, the show's humor is something I've always found very autism friendly. Jerry was never that important to the show, despite his name in the title. Larry David rocks (in more ways than one, just possibly). The same presenter did an exercise which required everyone to engage in a conversation while looking only at his/her shoes. This was fun, though it seemed to make the NTs a bit uncomfortable for some reason. I found that I had a better sense of who my conversational partner was through this exercise than through the more \"normal\" appearing conversations I had with others throughout the 3 day conference. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rn6KroIC9qI/AAAAAAAAAnc/rirtf8BYmBc/s1600-h/eight+stamp.bmp", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgH65hXp0Vk", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f15JexiQt4U"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/06/eight-mostly-positive-encounters-from.html", "title": "\nEight (mostly) positive encounters from the conference\n"},

I checked out the site, where I saw an autism charity listed, one whose goals and values do not correspond with my own. I also saw a post with something about \"fighting autism\" in the title.I informed Mr. LaPlante that I would not be supporting this program and the reasons for that. I fully expected that would be the last I ever heard from him. The next day, though, I received another email. The reference to fighting had been removed. GBA was interested to hear that there are people who do not support a cure and would prefer to see funding for services that might be of actual use to autistic people. They had not heard of neurodiversity, and wanted to learn more.GBA wrote to several other bloggers on the Hub. It seems that a number of us suggested the same organization be included, The Autism Acceptance Project. I am writing this post to thank Rob and GBA for asking questions, listening to answers, and respecting the opinions of (at least a few) people who are autistic. This is a rare and beautiful thing, and I want to express my appreciation for it.GBA also supports many other organizations, including a wide spectrum of animal rescue charities. The way it works is that you visit the GBA site first when you plan to shop with a major retailer (they have over 200 listed there). Buy through GBA rather than the retailer's main website, and a portion of the purchase price is donated to the organization you select. No additional charge is incurred by the consumer.Thank you, Give Back America, for the opportunity to support The Autism Acceptance Project and for increasing the visibility of the autistic rights community.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.givebackamerica.com/index.php", "http://www.taaproject.com/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/06/another-way-to-support-acceptance.html", "title": "\nAnother way to support acceptance\n"},

{"date": "Monday, March 12, 2007", "body": "\nRecently I decided to start an organization for students with AS at the university I attend. I met with the director of the campus Disabilities Resources Center to find out if they knew of any students there with Asperger syndrome or autism. I was told that there were only two registered, and that both \"deny that they have it\". This is at a university with over 25,000 students.Now, of course not every autistic student is going to register with the disabilities centers. Some don't need accommodations; others may suspect the \"services\" offered to be far from those things they really need. Some may be rightfully rejecting the disability model for autism. Others still are undiagnosed and unaware they may meet the criteria, if they have even heard of Asperger syndrome.So I don't see the paucity of AS students knocking at DRC doors as a problem. The problem is that in concert with this absence is the co-occurring lack of an Autistic Pride group on so large a campus. And the more young adults I talk with, the more I am convinced that it's not the Autistic, but the Pride that's missing.Both online and in \"real\" life I encounter far too regularly AS teens and young adults who are unhappy and ashamed of being \"labeled\" autistic. I have been asked by such individuals questions which include, \"Have you ever been called a 'retard'?\" The idea of Autistic Pride is foreign to many, and to some, incomprehensible.Chalk it up to Aspie naivete, but this has come as a shock to me. My first contacts on the spectrum were, like myself, adults who had come to realize later in life that there was a name and a reason for what had always been thought of as their \"weirdness\" and/or \"not fitting in\".The experiences I had heard and read about echoed my own, including a sense of relief followed by joy and new found purpose, and these had appeared to be nearly universal.There are many factors which may contribute to the discrepancies in attitude. Youth itself is one, being difficult for AS and NT alike. Years of living bring perspective unavailable to teens. Those who would assume that having a \"label\" attached is the crux of the problem miss the point. The consequences of being different were real for me and for my contemporaries who grew up before the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome was available. We were also bullied, berated, told we could \"do it if we just tried harder\", excluded from peer groups, mocked, etc.The diagnosis, or \"label\" is not the problem. Societal pressure to conform is the problem, and this pressure exhausts the resources of the best of us, whether we attempt to concede or rebel. The energy needed to get through a day, asserting the right to autistic self expression, deflecting stigma, ignoring or responding to criticism, is difficult to come by. Without support and role models, the task is overwhelming. Enter a host of \"inappropriate behaviors\", followed by even more stigma, criticism and what is commonly known as \"blaming the victim\". (I hate using the language of victimization, but in the context of social coercion, it seems appropriate.)As activists, we are responsible for carrying the message of neurodiversity into a society which still views autism as a problem. The cure movement with its plague rhetoric and fear mongering tactics has access to resources we don't have. They have the numbers, the money, the celebrity spokespersons, the media's attention. For change to occur in the attitudes which continue to oppress autistics, we will need to continue speaking out and being our autistic selves. But we will also need to raise our voices. Apparently, we are quite the sizable minority. Imagine the one in one hundred fifty voices united in insistence on societal change.For this to occur, for the concept of neurodiversity to reach the \"tipping point\" where an idea becomes a part of the general consciousness, there must first be sufficient understanding of the idea within the autistic subculture. I believe that we are at this time witness to a valuable window of opportunity. As the first large wave of children diagnosed in the nineties grows up, many of us who have come to the realization of AS later in life are still sufficiently young and energetic to mentor, encourage and support autistic youth in their efforts to navigate a society which has not yet evolved to embrace differences.I envision the campus group not as a support group for talking about the woes and difficulties of being an autistic student, but as a forum dedicated to forward thinking, a place to discuss positive aspects of autism, to brainstorm ideas for public education and political action. Our needs are not so much for traditional \"services\", but for societal change of a type which expands rather than contracts possibilities for personal expression. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/index.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/03/window-of-opportunity.html", "title": "\nA Window of Opportunity\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 8, 2007", "body": "\nDo people with Asperger syndrome have empathy? What about these five?Scenario 1:Arriving at the meeting, I look around for a chair next to someone who won't by crying today. I don't know what to do when people cry, and it makes me nervous. I am good with the instrumental stuff, like getting the tissue box passed in the right direction. The problem is mostly I don't know what to do with my face. A concerned look is called for, but how do you make that face?Eye contact is out of the question, as the person's face may ask me to do something, and I won't understand. For me, looking at someones face when they are upset is as silly as pretending to speak another language when you don't. You can sit there and nod as if you understand, but when the speaker asks a question and you can't answer it, the jig is up. So what happens is I end up staring into space, hoping the rest of the room doesn't notice I'm not doing anything.Scenario 2:I heard a song on the radio about a teenager whose girlfriend had died. He talked about looking at the desk where he had carved their initials, knowing that she wasn't coming back. It was early morning when I heard the song, I was around eight years old, it was summer. My father tried to comfort me; then he left for work. When he came back that evening and found me still crying, he was exasperated. Did I not know it was just a made up story? What on earth was wrong with this kid, crying all day long over nothing?Scenario 3:I am in the community room at work with Bob and Marge. Sally walks in, says hello, talks to Bob for a couple of minutes, then goes on. I say to Bob, what was wrong with Sally. Nothing he says. Marge says what do you mean. The next day I find out that Sally had just come from the hospital where her mother was very ill. She hadn't mentioned it to anyone.Scenario 4:I am ten or eleven years old. My mother and I have an unexpected visitor. Mom has already fixed dinner, and asks the guest to stay and eat. My response, given out loud, is to ask, \"Do we have enough?\" My mother calls me aside and scolds me for being so rude. I spend the rest of the evening in my room.Scenario 5:I am at lunch with Kate and Joann. Joann mentions that her father had died from Lupus.I start laughing and can't stop. They don't understand how I can be so cold.Possible responses from mental health professionals: Number one is not autistic, because she cares what people think of her. She most likely has narcissistic personality disorder. Number 2 is a case of clinical depression. Three is overly empathic if anything, not autistic. Four and Five are classic presentations of AS, people who blurt out whatever comes to mind appropriate or not.So what's really going on? All of these are true stories taken from my life. Here's how they looked from the inside:(1 and 2)People crying is scary. It's hard to understand what it's about, they never tell you everything. Songs are different, and movies and tv shows. You get the whole story, beginning to end, it makes sense. I can feel the sadness of it then. I kept seeing the desk and the initials in my head.I need a visual link with the emotion to make it real. The song was descriptive and the image iconic enough that it represented everything sad in the world. There was a lot to cry about.(3)Sally had a smudge of dirt on her shoe. Her shirt was not tucked in. These things are out of the ordinary, she tends to be perfectly neat in her presentation. Marge and Bob did not notice these things; they were focused on Sally's eyes. Apparently, she is good at hiding her feelings.(4)The reason I asked that question was so I could offer not to eat, in deference to the guest. I never got to tell my mother that because I was so upset by her perception of me as rude. Not that I was being entirely altruistic; I wanted to be seen as valiant. My failure to acheive that goal was harshly ironic.(5)For several years, I couldn't hear the word \"lupus\" without laughing. This had absolutely nothing to do with the word's meaning, just the sound of it triggered that response. I still don't know why, and there have been other words which had strange effects on me. As a child, I could not stand the word \"cold, among others; hearing them upset me terribly. The word induced laughing fits always made me think I was bordering on madness.Autistic empathy is different from what the typical person experiences. It is no less real, no less deep or emotional. And I would argue that it's no less useful to society. Some people give hugs; others get the tissue. Otherwise you end up with people blowing their noses on their sleeves, which is unbecoming and very untidy.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/03/white-painting.html", "title": "\nEmpathy?\n"},

{"date": "Monday, March 19, 2007", "body": "\n Published in 1967, this was one of my earliest obsessions. I was the first kid to check it out of the school library, and I went back for it as often as they'd let me. I never got over it, not when I was 12, not when I was 30. This is the story of George Stable, a budding musician with \"issues\" and the story that told me I was different and okay. The Teddy Bear Habit contained in its pages a blueprint of the world I wanted to live in. The illustrations depicted a wacky Greenwich Village filled with stereotypical beatniks, drinking espresso, snapping their fingers, wearing all black, and speaking in slang laden riddles. (Unfortunately, these cool Daddy-O's turned out to be jewel thieves, but thats almost irrelevant.) George's father was an action painter, \"like Jackson Pollack\", who drew cartoons for a living, listened to jazz and hated television. George drank egg creams often at the soda shop alone, feeling grown up in his solitude. George was self deprecating and trying hard to be cynical. His internal monologue far overshadowed his output of spoken words. He had few friends, and tended to hang out with adults. He was bright, but naive enough to get himself entangled with the jewel thieves. He considered himself a loser and a screw-up. He ate the same sandwich everyday, and was inordinately disturbed by the smell of his piano teacher's Wint-o-green LifeSavers. George, just possibly, was another pre-DSM IV-R Aspie.George's perseveration was his teddy bear, which he carried everywhere, often inside his guitar to hide it from cooler kids. George was to the bear as I was to the book, like a picture in a picture in a picture. Over the years, as I moved from one \"comfort object\" to the next, I thought of the bear, stuffed, unbeknownst to its owner, with rubies. The rocks and ancient coins I carried in my pockets glowed with recognition. An empathy of things.At eight, nine, ten, reading and re-reading the book, I formed a stubborn bond to a mythical New York, especially Greenwich Village and the idea of beatniks, so obviously smarter and more interesting than the hippies who had replaced them in the popular imagination. These were the ultimate outsiders, providing me a frame of reference both cartoonish and dangerous. Being as I am, I took it all too literally. Not that I stole anything; I'm an Aspie. I bought a black turtleneck and wore it every day. Once in awhile, I still play the bongos, sometimes with a confidential charm tucked inside.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rf9fYHvJLhI/AAAAAAAAAE0/ZWnZOt04Jvg/s1600-h/beatnik.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rf9HrXvJLgI/AAAAAAAAAEs/iWxTF8C17jw/s1600-h/habit+big.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/03/belated-review-teddy-bear-habit-by.html", "title": "\nBelated Review: The Teddy Bear Habit by James Lincoln Collier\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2007", "body": "\n Yesterday marked my first official appearance as an autistic person. I had been invited to join a seminar discussion of empathy in autism. Most of the students were nervous, as they had never met an autistic person (that they knew of) before. And I was feeling a bit divided. Though I was looking forward to the opportunity to share the message of neurodiversity, I have also been reluctant to become some sort of \"professional autistic\" on parade. In my (supposedly limited) imagination, I had NT's calling me a freak, certain other NT's calling me a nitwit, and even some of my fellow neurodiverse joined in with charges of token and lab rat.Of course this is the kind of social pressure which, although I am rumored to be immune to it, has plagued me all my life. \"Coming out\" gradually at my own school and to other acquaintances has been a surprisingly difficult experience so far, given the peace of mind my diagnosis has brought me. People have disappeared, others have told me to get over myself. Some who I was sure knew better seem to find themselves unsure what to say and do in my presence. None of this matters much. Mainly, I just didn't want to mess up. Messing up would mean presenting myself as the Quintessential Asperger-Person, capable of speaking for or representing hundreds of thousands of unique individuals. It would mean unleashing arrogance to an extent that minds would slam justifiably shut, or letting false assumptions stand unchallenged. And of course, I messed up in just these ways. Not everything, most of it went pretty well, but some. I wouldn't be human otherwise.And that is the myth I most hope I challenged. The seminar was on empathy, after all, and this was my point, to make clear that empathy is not the exclusive province of the neurotypical. I was allowed to choose two readings for discussion; one was Gernsbacher's \"Toward a Behavior of Reciprocity\". The very first student comment was that reciprocity is not possible with \"low functioning\" autistics, because they are \"not interested\" in interaction with anyone and also have low intelligence. Oh, brother! Was I being set up? I knew that a couple of students had already been in the professor's office, worrying about what I'd be like. Were they looking for an \"outburst\", or \"tantrum\", or was this truly their level of understanding? I couldn't be sure just yet, but I knew I would get my chance to speak soon. So no outburst, though I did get a visual of steam coming out the top of my head. (Actually, it was a picture from a video game called \"Incredible Crisis\", in which, as a Japanese office worker, the player is allowed about 4 mistakes in each mini-game before his head turns bright red and explodes. In case you wanted to know.)When I got my chance to talk, I talked about assumptions people make, and about the different types of empathy, about autism as a culture and a valid difference. At least I think I did. When it comes to talking, I am never sure I've gotten anything across. I have no idea if they liked me, if they took me seriously, or thought my opinions were valid. I don't know that kind of stuff. After a while, they did start asking questions, and I did my best to answer for myself and not for every-autistic-ever-born. What they wanted to know was do I have problems with friendships? (yes) Am I married? (yes, but not legally) Do people treat me differently when they know I have AS? (often) What is the difference between autism and Asperger syndrome? (none in my opinion, but there are others)Do I wish I had been diagnosed as a child? (yes and no) What obsessions or special interests do I have? Do I care what people think of me?What they wanted to know, I believe, is am I human, do I have feelings, am I like them? All this time I was drawing my squares, mumbling under my breath, clicking my pen, being my autistic self. Did I pass the test? Was I human enough to count? Did I do a disservice to others on the spectrum by saying too much or too little? I wonder. Like most every experience I've had, it was flawed, and I was flawed, and I wouldn't change a thing.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RgIX4HvJLyI/AAAAAAAAAHA/4dsIg9pXmdQ/s1600-h/dog+pony.jpg", "http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:oPH7oExDPZ0J:psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Gernsbacher_reciprocity.pdf+gernsbacher+reciprocity&hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/03/this-is-no-dog-and-pony-show-i-think.html", "title": "\nThis is no dog and pony show!

{"date": "Friday, March 23, 2007", "body": "\nI'll admit it. I have a fear of being told to stop using so many parentheses. I posit (if that's the right word) that this is a function of having an autistic mind (the punctuation itself, not the fear). I seem to recall that Seymour's older brother Buddy Glass had a similar style of writing, and that quite possibly the rest of the Glass family did as well. Certainly their author, Mr. Salinger is known to have his share of autistic traits. But this is not and never will be about J D Salinger about whom far too much has been said already. I'm done with all that (but only for now).Faulkner was another bad influence, all of those drunken sentences, staggering over the page. And he was another perseveration, as well. A whole family vacation was ruined for all but me when my intermittently indulgent parents allowed me to hijack the trip and we all went off to glorious Oxford, Mississippi (pop. est. 9,556 in 1978) for a week. What was there to do there? Why visit the drugstore, of course, that's what he did and what I wanted to do, as well as roaming around the house he had lived in and buying a black and white 8\" X 10\" photo from the library for 20 dollars (well, my dad did that, paid for it I mean).And now I've completed a paragraph with almost no \"incident\" (until the last few words, that is) and even without them there, the entire paragraph was parenthetical. That's what I mean about autistic punctuation, sentence structure and such. But I haven't yet begun to explain, so this is out of order (a bit) and I will now back up.I propose (if one is allowed to do so) that parentheses (as well as the semi-colon) are a natural form of presentation for autistic (as opposed to NT) thought. Note that each of the parantheticals in the last sentence serves a discrete purpose, and note also that this entire sentence (yes, this one) could well be housed in ( ), since it is not the thought I originally intended to appear next, but rather a tangent or an aside. But now we are in sub tangent territory, so back to the main aside, sentence one of the paragraph and the varied purposes of the parentheses found therein, which are, in this order (aside), (semi-extraneous adjunct) and (clarification). And these, of course, are only a few of the many purposes served by parentheses.If you are about as old as I am, you may have learned sentence diagramming in grade (or grammar) school English, and if you have taken a logic course, you may have been required to diagram arguments. In either case, you will likely understand what I mean when I talk about speaking in \"trees\". Having read countless writings by autistic individuals and spoken with many, I am willing to (here it comes, duck!) go out on a limb and say that this is a fairly common thought pattern among us.Before the tree analogy, before my current understanding of autism, I thought about my difficulties with spoken communication as an air traffic control problem. Several planes would be ready for takeoff and the guy who says which one gets to go was always sleeping (why it was a guy, I can't tell you, something about the extreme male brain in autistic females, I suppose).Now I prefer to frame my thinking as trees, as for one thing, the consequences seem much less dire. Speaking with neurotypicals requires much pruning of smaller branches, as most are not inclined to listen to whole \"trees\" but want just the information from the select branches they consider important. Thus, when communicating this entire post to an NT, it might be best to state it as follows:Autistics are more inclined toward detail than neurotypicals. Some neurotypicals find this distracting and superfluous. Some autistics, on the other hand find the NT way of speaking equally baffling. Note that in the NT-approved version, no hint of personality was allowed to escape. That is because I am not NT, I am autistic, and was speaking in a somewhat foreign language. I am not saying that NT speech patterns are dull, impersonal or even less complex, just that I don't get the finer nuances of the language, and understand that they don't get mine. Not a problem, really, unless only one of the conversational partners is expected to be fluent in both languages.This I suppose was my point, though I didn't know it to begin with. Only by following each branch that catches my attention, do I find out what I am really talking about. I enjoy this sort of thing, and (for me) it is functional.When I was younger I was all root and no branch. The thought paths were as numerous and even more twisting. Little broke the surface. Underground, the parentheses multiplied, but what others heard from me was curt or even monosyllabic. Some days my speech is still like that.My internal dialogue can also be that way, unless I have a pen or a keyboard. I don't know how it works, but I have a hunch it has more than a little to do with punctuation. NT speech comes \"standard equipped\" with italics, ellipses and exclamation points in the form of what they like to call non-verbal communication. When I try to use it, someone always seems to get hurt or angry or impossibly confused. Since I like to express myself somewhat thoroughly, and with as little conflict and fuss as possible, I prefer to write. If you need the information pruned, you may do it yourself. I'm done (for the moment) with that sort of thing.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/03/on-autistic-use-of-parentheses.html", "title": "\nOn the (autistic) use of parentheses\n"},

{"date": "Monday, March 26, 2007", "body": "\nLong before I accepted the possibility of anti-depressant medications, the ususal treatment was poetry, carried close to the body. Never my own poems, a literary home remedy wouldn't do; I needed the real stuff, approved by the modern canon and dispensed within proper books. Most potent were the scripts torn directly from these books, but this required a back-up copy and could thus be costly. For less debilitating occurrences of sadness, a photocopy would suffice.To be effective, a poem need not be more than tangentially related to the perceived cause of distress. A line or two would be delivered, most often in the morning, by the method sometimes referred to as \"non-functional repetition of stock phrases\". Several days of dwelling on the lines would lead me to the bookshelves and the potion would be placed in a wallet, pouch or pillbox for a period of seven weeks to seven years, depending on the nature and severity of the problem. I admit that I sometimes held onto them longer than necessary, and this may have been an early warning sign of graver addictions to come.For the remedy to take effect, reading of the poem was not required. Knowing it was with me was somehow different from just knowing it. The poem in question could be no longer than one printed page. Other rules applied. Once a poem had been removed, it could never again be reused for medicinal purposes. A poem discovered or revealed to another resulted in its curative powers being cut in half, exactly. This rarely happened, as the need to \"bring or share items for mutual enjoyment\" was hardly my downfall.Sometimes I would find myself checking to be sure I hadn't lost it. Repeated folding and unfolding left deep creases, and eventually a separation of lines.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2007", "body": "\nIt happened again, this time at Michaels, the arts and crafts store. I saw you go into the store. I watched without saying anything, because I know sometimes I am wrong, but this was you, I swear it was. Still, I waited until I heard you speaking to your companion. Yes, it was you, I was sure now, so I walked to the end of the Prismacolor counter, up to the endcap where you were standing and said a long drawn out, amusing I thought, hello, and you looked at me like I might be crazy. At least I think that's what that look means. Then you were someone else, suddenly. Wrong again.I call these events \"reverse\" prosopagnosia, since they are opposite the more common occurrence in which the other person says hello, not me, and suddenly they are...well, still nobody I know. Sometimes those are easier, sometimes I can \"fake it\", but most often the person catches on that I don't have a clue who she is or where I know her from. But still, that's easier, being seen as merely oblivious and/or uncaring. As opposed to insane. As opposed to suddenly, every clerk in the store is asking if they can help me find anything, help me at all, help me get the hell out of there as soon as possible.Shopping while autistic, dining while autistic, walking down the street minding one's own autistic business, chirping a bit, repeating the fact that seven times seven is forty-nine, stopping perhaps to howl in the Speedway parking lot, these are not approved activities in our society. Like saying hello in a silly way to a stranger, they draw unwarranted suspicion and fear.That really is a shame. None of these activities is harmful or threatening to anyone. They are natural to me, as much as chatting about celebrities, politics and sports are natural to NTs.Most of us hide our \"stims\" in public if we can. I find that I do this less and less, at the risk of alienating NT acquaintances who are embarrassed to be seen with me. They accuse me of \"acting out\" or \"giving up\" sometimes. They remind me of those heterosexuals who would require gays and lesbians to stop \"flaunting\" our sexuality. To blend in. To be invisible. To not dare ask for or demand equal standing with those who adhere to social norms. Autistics aren't even there yet.We haven't had our Stonewall. We haven't been de-medicalized. I have had the occasion several times lately to speak about autistic civil rights. I bring this into conversations whenever I can. Outside our own autistic community, the idea is often seen as bizarre, if not ridiculous. And I believe that this is not out of spite but of ignorance and fear. People don't know us. And if we keep hiding our stims, keep up the act of \"being normal\", how will they ever?Hostility toward gays is still rampant, but impressively less so than thirty years ago. The biggest factor in this is that some (not all, not most) gays and lesbians stopped hiding who they were. People started to realize that the people of whom they spoke so hatefully were members of their families, people they respected. Among enlightened people at least, being gay is no longer shameful; prejudice is shameful. But first they had to see us.In an ideal world, I would say to the person I mistakenly greeted, \"Oops, I thought you were someone else. I'm autistic\". And that would be no big deal, she would know what I meant and be less afraid. Unfortunately, as things stand, such a statement might have made her more afraid.I wish I had said it anyway. It's the sort of thing I think we need to do.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.prosopagnosia.com/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/03/reverse-prosopagnosia.html", "title": "\nReverse Prosopagnosia?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2007", "body": "\nIt's come up a couple of times lately. First, a young man with AS, then the parents of another asked me, \"Can someone with Asperger syndrome drive a car?\" Short answer: Some can; I don't know about everybody. Which category I fit into depends on who you ask and what day of the week.Here are my thoughts on my own experience with driving while autistic. First, driving is scary. Unlike most teenagers, I did not look forward to getting my license. I remember my father saying that I'd get used to it, that the car would feel like an extension of me, driving would become as automatic as walking. Well, that was a problem! Had he not seen me walk lately? I still bump into people no less than 12 times a day, and that's when I'm really trying!Amazingly, I have had very few incidents with automotive clumsiness. I attribute this mostly to being very aware of my attentional deficits and sometimes slow reaction times. I leave a distance between my car and the one in front of me through which two semi trucks could waltz if trucks could waltz. This is not to the liking of other drivers, who know that no rigs will be dancing through the streets and take advantage of the opportunity to cut in. No problem. I don't answer the phone, drink coffee, look at the mail or even turn on the radio when I'm driving. I can do one thing at a time pretty well (like steering, shifting, attending to lights and traffic, if I think about it I'll stay home for a month). I drive under the speed limit. I use my turn signal. I don't wear my seat belt. I don't change the oil on time. I do let the gas needle hover around \"E\". I do let papers, books, food containers, clothing and other junk take up permanent residence in the back seat (and the front) and even though I stopped smoking months ago, there are still cigarette butts in the ashtray. Driving is something I need to do alone. I don't mind paying for gas, but explaining the rules about the radio, the windows, and the not-talking-while-I'm-trying-to-merge would wear me out in the first mile. The car is a private space, too, like the home. I can say the times tables out loud if I need to. If you want to go somewhere together, I might go along with that, on a good day, but first I'll need to ask you, \"Can you drive?\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RhR_thawJTI/AAAAAAAAAKA/o84Y-FSMZAE/s1600-h/matchbox+3.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/04/todays-question-can-you-drive.html", "title": "\nToday's Question: Can you drive?\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, April 7, 2007", "body": "\n For years, I was so \"private\", I wouldn't answer questions like \"where did you go to high school?\" or \"what kind of music do you like?\" I got furious when my partner repeated a conversation I'd had with a server at a restaurant to some friends.Most of my life, I lived by these rules: (1) If someone wants to know something about me, it is his/her responsibility to ask, (and) (2) It's really not anyone's business! But then, that's defining it someone else's (NT) way. Seeing stubbornness in a harmless, innate inclination to be quiet and/or reserved.There is also, of course, the fact that the presence of a question can cause the answer (especially in spoken format) to temporarily disappear. This was an issue for teachers, as they were sure I was lying when I didn't know the answer in class, and had just written a 2000 word essay on the very topic. If they liked me, I was then \"shy\", pathologically shy, until that became the larger part of my self-definition. If not so much, then I was \"stubborn\" or \"difficult\", and that too I swallowed whole. \"Private\" has sometimes been a euphemism used by friends and family to explain various facets of my character. It has stood in for \"secretive\", \"selfish\", \"pretentious\" and \"rude\". It has explained \"vacant\" looks and harsh glares and thus satisfied the general need to explain and categorize some foreign and unfathomably autistic behaviors.\"Sharing\" as it's sometimes called in touchy-feely circles has never occurred to me as a useful thing to do, unless there was a specific and practical problem to be solved. Anxiety, certainly, has played a large part in this too, as the presence of more than one other person has often presented a problem. Mostly, though, I have been surprised when people have said that I don't talk much. I have never counted the number of words people said or didn't say.The thing I am trying to get at is separate from my expressive communication pattern. It's about the \"nobody's business\" part of it, the thing that made me say to co-workers, when asked if I had any children, or where I grew up, \"I don't talk about my personal life at work\" or \"why would you want to know that?\" And more than that, how I got to here from there.By \"here\", I mean discussing my thoughts on a weblog for anyone to see, telling students and professors about autism, speaking on panels of autistic adults, and posting my photo on A2P2.How did this happen? How did my life become, seemingly overnight, an open book? I was going to say that it comes down to responsibility, but I realize now that's not quite it, it's more like gratitude (for the diagnosis itself, for finally knowing) or a combination of the two. I believe that visibility is the key to eventual acceptance. A few years ago, when straight people tended to believe that all gays fit certain stereotypes, it was easy for them to hate or ignore us. To think that making derogatory statements was okay as long as no one fitting their particular stereotype was in the room. It took a lot of people coming out to get to the point where we are today, which I'm not saying is anything like ideal or correct, but it is better. I want to see \"better\" for autistic people, too. Following that logic, I want to be visible.So when someone asks me what \"Aspie\" means on my wristband, I tell them, and I wear my neurodiversity t-shirt to work and I tell them. Because as much as I hate it when people say, \"No, you're not autistic!\", I think it's my job to at least put the question in their minds. I want to see the day where this is no longer considered \"disclosure\" or \"revelation\" or \"coming out\". A time when I don't need to \"take pride\" in who I am, because there is no stigma attached to begin with. After all, I don't disclose that I like jazz. I just say it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rhhg8RawJmI/AAAAAAAAAMc/gNLTJMAQKc0/s1600-h/square+book+1.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/04/open-book-thoughts-on-privacy-and.html", "title": "\nAn open book: thoughts on privacy and silence, disclosure and pride\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, April 10, 2007", "body": "\nLike a certain percentage of autistic kids, I learned to read well before kindergarten. I was around three, and of course I had a particular book I liked and insisted on hearing every night and it happened also to be a book about a piglet who insisted upon the same food over and over again. Donuts were the culprit in Betty Engebretson's What Happened to George. An unhappy ending ensued when he ate so many he burst or \"popped\" as my mother preferred to say, and consequently vanished. Though I cried every single time he popped, the story remained my favorite and the mystery of the text alongside the pictures demanded solving.Following along with my mom, I was soon able to recognize the words, and tell the story exactly as she had. This was not reading, she insisted, though I had no problem identifying each word individually and in any order presented. When my father got wind of this development, he resolved to put an end to the ridiculous idea that I could read. This he did by placing a newspaper in front of his three year old daughter and asking for a report on state and local politics. When I could not deliver on this request, his theory was \"proven\"--I wasn't reading at all, but merely memorizing words. Along with their meanings, pronunciation and spelling. Real reading was something else.The logic of this strikes me as frighteningly similar to that of certain cure fanatics who insist that only the most extreme (in their view) forms of autism count as \"the real thing\". This is a black and white worldview in which something either is or is not and the only operational definition applied is the one already assumed to be optimal. By this reasoning, recognizing words and their meanings and being able to paraphrase is not reading, and people who can talk (or drive, or hold a job, or have a relationship, or whatever they want to insert here) are necessarily not autistic. It's all very much based on what someone (with little or no authority to do so) arbitrarily decides should be the definition.Ignoring the reality of a continuum upon which many many points are reasonably defined as autism, they use their chosen definition to defend the need to cure these more disabled \"creatures\". Their autism is not my autism. How could it be when I am able to attend college? How dare I claim I could read at three, without knowing words like legislature and referendum?Therefore, since I am not autistic, I should probably shut up about autism not being a disease and so not needing a cure. Yet the people who say this are openly and happily non-autistic. Shouldn't they also, by their own logic...But no, that assumes that what we are talking about is logical Which it is not.After the newspaper incident, I read more discreetly. I would sneak books into my room to look at away from the eyes of my skeptical parents, learning more and more words and their meanings and nuances daily until eventually everyone had to admit that I could read. When I started school and did my best to coach the others along as they struggled with Dick and Jane, I suddenly became a very bright little girl. I was five then, so it was okay. Look how quickly she has learned, said the parents and the teachers and they were all so proud they could have burst (or popped, if you prefer). See Bev. See Bev Read! As I was no longer three, the definition fit.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RhudvrkMvOI/AAAAAAAAANE/J-curwMaT1E/s1600-h/george.jpg", "http://open-site.org/Society/Philosophy/Logic/", "http://www.rickwalton.com/funstuff/skyfall.htm"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/04/combating-hyperlexia.html", "title": "\nCombating Hyperlexia\n"},

Unlike the one in Delaware, as reported yesterday by abfh on Whose Planet is it Anyway? Doctors in the state of Delaware (including podiatrists and dentists!) are being required to report all cases of autism diagnosed or suspected in persons under 18 for the expressed purpose of \"develop[ing] preventive strategies to decrease occurrences of autism\". The law applies also to other caregivers such as physical and occupational therapists.Often, I will meet a person, who having heard that I am an autistic advocate of some sort, confuses this with the more popular eugenics movement and expects that I will join them in gushing over the Oprah show or the \"victory\" implicit in the Combating Autism Act. I try to set them straight as calmly and politely as possible (never even mentioning the word eugenics--I am just that considerate) in case they have not been already 100% committed to that agenda.It is due to such confusion among persons who are not heavily invested on either side of this issue, that I would like to launch a registry for persons who support the death of autism, and thus, of autistics.

This information is not intended for purposes of harassment, but to call attention to the stated beliefs of well known public figures and the entities they support, so that citizens who believe in the rights and dignity of all persons may make informed decisions in exercising their purchasing power.At this time, the registry is in development and will be made available by request.

We were getting along well, agreeing (seemingly) that autism is a natural variation and of value to humanity, noting the prejudice and bullying endured by autistics, discussing the need for improving self esteem among AS teens, and then suddenly...the \"C\" word. It wasn't \"cure\" this time, but \"chelation\" as in \"my grandson gets...\" that made my heart sink and my mind fill with chaos and my mouth forget how to close. It seems that her grandson has \"tested positive for heavy metals\" and is \"more himself\" after being chelated. He has gastric problems, which otherwise keep him from reaching his potential.

She thinks that I can be of service to a community of professionals whose knowledge and understanding are lacking. That I can do it on my terms. That I can talk about the rights of autistics and help alter negative views of autistic people. I don't know what to think. When she sends the article, I'll read it, and send back a thoughtful reply, along with relevant studies I have read, IRB approved and peer reviewed. In writing, I'll know how to handle the claims, to present a logical, constructive argument, one that respects fact, common sense and the dignity of all people.If she sees the lag in response time or written form as weakness, I'll know that she has not been honest about her respect for autistic thinking. I will then know how to proceed with her. What is less clear is how I might defend my position in the future. I do fine with a powerpoint or script. But do I really belong in the arena with the big cats, the curebies and chelators, who may see an unexpected silence, or hesitance even, as a \"win\" for their side? Or should I go out there with the data in my pocket, along with my little book of squares, and hoping for the best? \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/04/other-c-word.html", "title": "\nThe other \"C\" word\n"},

Somehow awareness has become code for tragedy and plague rhetoric. The word has been so thoroughly usurped by cure groups, it has no positive connotation left for most of us who are autistic.Teddy Willis doesn't know that yet, he's only eleven. Teddy has AS, and is an autistic activist. The young man was silenced by his teacher and principal, told that autism is \"personal\" and shouldn't be talked about. He didn't understand why he shouldn't talk about it, especially during Autism Awareness Month, especially during a class where the subject of autism was being addressed. I don't understand that either.This reminds me of Amanda's definition from the Curebie Bingo game:Curebie (n.): a person who wants nothing more than to teach child autistics to talk and adult autistics to shut up.Welcome, Teddy, to the community of autistic adults.

{"date": "Thursday, April 19, 2007", "body": "\n Yesterday was a bad day for me. I had a presentation to make in class and it did not go well, though I had practiced it and knew the material thoroughly. Now I'm putting way too much time and energy into trying to figure out why I'm overreacting to something that happens fairly often, and what it really means about my acceptance of my autism.First of all, I was just having a \"bad communication day\". If you are autistic, you know what I mean. For anyone else who might see this, it is important that you understand that the autistics in your life don't do this stuff on purpose.Some days I talk very well, other days I don't. For the neurotypical, think about your level of competence at math, the kinds of problems you can solve on your best day, rested and undistracted. Now think about those same problems, having a strict time limit to solve them in a room that is way too hot, and you didn't get any sleep last night, and next to you, someone is screaming. Oh yeah, you also don't get a pencil and paper; you do this in your head.No one else in the room thinks it is hot, they can't hear the screaming, and whether or not you can solve the equation will determine how they view you, if not forever, then for a long time to come. That is a bit what talking is like for me. And the shift from \"passing for normal\" to \"passing for nuts\" can happen at any time with no warning. Then people say we are \"acting out\".That's why, before a presentation or a social situation, you'll see me acting more stereotypically autistic. I may go outside and howl a bit, or make quieter animal noises inside. I like to repeat words and syllables or numbers. And of course, I'll be drawing some squares. Pretty much the way I am all of the time, but with the volume turned up a notch. It doesn't make me self-conscious to be this way around people and ususally I don't mind if someone comments on it, as long as the comment isn't judgmental. My normal is not your normal. I'm okay with that.A lot of things did go wrong yesterday, including unexpected time pressures, last minute plan changes and (at least in my perception) being singled out and treated noticibly differently from the others in the class. And like I said, it wasn't the best day for talking, words were getting lost and coming out too slow. I didn't say everything I needed to say, and some of what was left out was important, most important to me. Time's up.The presentation had much to do with autism. I felt like Teddy Willis for a minute. Then I realized what that meant. Teddy's story is all about going on to the next day, where there will be another chance to talk, and under better circumstances, finding a way to say what needs saying, even when it gets difficult. Maybe next time, I'll put what I really want to say most at the beginning. Making it fit there logically might be an interesting challenge. The next presentation is on Monday.Time's Up! is a party game for teams of two or more players (best with teams of two). The same set of famous names is used for each of three rounds. In each round, one member of a team tries to get his teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed. In round 2 no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted). In round 3, no words are allowed at all. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rid6hPplV-I/AAAAAAAAAQk/N_TZ3Ea4uAU/s1600-h/time%27s+up.jpg", "http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-04152007-1330719.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/04/talking-about-talking-about-talking.html", "title": "\nTalking about talking about talking\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 22, 2007", "body": "\nI received an email today from Monica Moshenko. Not having heard her name before, I was not aware of her being a somewhat public figure, so I wrote back asking if she would mind if I posted her letter here. I don't like to assume that communications to me at my email address are for public view; I prefer to ask first. This is what I wrote:Monica,Thank you for your response. You make some good points here as well as some others I disagree with. I would like to publish this Email to my blog, either under comments or as a separate post with a response from me. Many bloggers do not believe in the need to ask permission before publishing mail they receive, but I prefer to err on the side of good manners. Therefore, I ask you, may I add this to the blog?Thanks,BevAnd this was her response:HI BevThanks for writing and sharing.. I am speaking from the heart and as a parent and advocate of many, I know that the autism community is having a difficult time digesting Autism as a diagnosis for this individual Cho but autism is not the what killed people.. an individual did.Best regardsMonica NTs really are hard to understand sometimes. I would have included a word like \"yes\" or \"no\" somewhere in response to a question, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, I'm taking this as a \"yes\", since that's my best guess of what it means. So here is the original e-mail, with some commentary provided: I have read that Cho was indeed diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at eight years of age\u2026 but no intervention took place. It wasn\u2019t autism that killed people in Virginia Tech but an individual that had exhibited symptoms of a learning disability at a young age and the people that came in contact with all the years in school did nothing to intervene. Why ..because he was smart, a loner and Korean\u2026.. and probably because his own family didn\u2019t accept the diagnosis (this isn\u2019t so unusual is it?) Some good points here. Kids who get good grades and are quiet don't tend to set off alarms as easily. All students deserve to get the services they need to be successful. Some families have a very hard time accepting a diagnosis for their children.I think it is wrong to deny that Cho exhibited autism traits... It is not autism that killed people but this individual Cho who never received help or interventions for years.......... Again, I agree. It's the presence of these traits that prompted my original post. However, I am not qualified to diagnose anyone, dead or alive. Certainly, whether or not Cho was autistic, autism is not responsible for these deathsThis is so important for parents to remember and a lesson for all people who try to deny children services/support or say they are too smart to receive services at all... even though they have a diagnosis. All the years that Cho was in school, all the teachers that had in class didn't see that he had a disability and did nothing speaks volumes to me. It is not so unusual to hear about kids that are smart, shy, lacking social skills that continue to get pushed through the system for a myriad of reasons......schools don't want to provide services, parents don't want to accept the diagnosis, parents don't know their rights under law for interventions, and some parents have issues that compound getting help for their own child...If we don't accept that Cho was diagnosed with autism and learn from this, we are compounding the problem of getting help for thousands of children now and inthe future.This is where I start having a problem.While I admit that children on the autism spectrum are not usually violent, keep in mind this young man was someone who never had interventionI never had intervention either; I am not and was never violent. This is true for many many people on the spectrum.and who knows what it was like for him to deal with day to day issues..which I am certain most people didn't even know as he didn't share his feels.. How many kids on the autism spectrum have challenges with sharing their feelings?Or alternately, how many of the typical persons in their lives take the time to learn how to listen to what they are saying? Why is it always the minority who is said to \"have challenges\"? We are supposed to understand and use typical ways of communication rather than NTs learning more about autistic communication, yet we are the ones who are said to be disabled. Logic?Remember this individual Cho does not represent Autism - Who said he did? I know it wasn't me...he was diagnosed with it and no one did anything to intervene. Can you imagine being diagnosed with cancerPlease, no, please, please don't let this be another of those autism = cancer fallacies!when you are eight-years old and then no one does anything for years, even though they suspect something is wrong? Something was wrong, alright. It's called bullying.Then you \"suddenly\" do things from rage...because you are dying inside and no one did a thing to help. Autism = dying inside? Well, no... I am not trying to justify what Cho did as right, what I am saying is that this individual needed help, was diagnosed with autism and lived without any treatment/therapy for years\u2026 not able to have friends, social issues, etc. along with other emotional problems that compounded his mental state.He needed help. Yes. He was diagnosed with autism. Apparently, yes. But note the (illogical) implication here: He needed help because he was diagnosed with autism. No. No. No.Where are all the experts that saw the signs and symptoms which Cho exhibited for years\u2026 and did nothing but push him through the system? By denying the diagnosis now, people will further contribute to other\u2019s not getting the help they so desperately need\u2026 If I understand your point here (and I'm not sure of that), you are saying that autistics need help to prevent them from becoming violent. Or is it maybe that this looks like a delicious red herring to serve up to anyone who might contribute to the causes of research, cure, prevention, etc?Monica Moshenko, Parent, AdvocateHost \u2013 DisAbility News & Views RadioI appreciate the understanding that autism did not commit the crimes. What's missing is the understanding that Cho did not commit the crimes because of autism. I'm all for making sure people get the interventions they need. Social exclusion, bullying and forced conformity need to be addressed as the enormous problems they are. Parents, teachers, lawmakers and advocates must insist that the (mostly) typical kids who engage in these practices receive the proper treatment and instruction needed to prevent further tragedies.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.unitedspinal.org/publications/action/2005/06/21/walk-the-talk-radio-monica-moshenko-and-disability-news-and-views/", "http://www.buffalo.edu/reporter/vol34/vol34n2/articles/Moshenko.html", "http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com/2005/08/autism-is-not-equal-to-cancer.html", "http://www.aspergerinformation.org/", "http://www.autismvox.com/on-some-comments-about-cho-seung-hui/", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/bullying.html", "http://www.autistics.org/library/dontmourn.html", "http://www.fallacyfiles.org/cumhocfa.html", "http://www.autismwalk.org/site/News2?news_iv_ctrl=-1&page=NewsArticle&id=8457&AddInterest=1421&JServSessionIdr007=fgjpnzql82.app7a", "http://autismspeaks.org/inthenews/naar_archive/naar_volunteers_ask_legislators.php"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/04/letter-from-monica-moshenko.html", "title": "\nA letter from Monica Moshenko\n"},

According to his mother, who phoned the recruiter to complain, the 18 year old plays with buttons and is afraid of the sounds of lawn mowers and toilets.\"Guinther started talking about joining the military after a recruiter stopped him and offered him a $4,000 signing bonus and $67,000 for college, his parents say. His parents said he didn't know there was a war in Iraq until last fall, shortly after he spoke with a recruiter, and asked them about it.\"I admit, I am of two minds on this one. One less person going to war, attention to recruiting policies that border on coercion, I'm all for that. The problem is in statements like this one:\"To place someone in his condition in a combat role would create a wholly inappropriate and unnecessary risk of harm \u2013 not only to him, but all other members of his unit who would have to rely on him,\" Blumenauer wrote in his letter to the Pentagon.\" (emphasis added)The implication that a person is unfit for service or for any work solely due to being autistic is troublesome at the least. Yes, I believe that this particular man, if he is afraid of lawn mowers, would not do well in the combat job he enlisted for. He might do well in another capacity; the army has all sorts of jobs.My own form of prejudice tells me that war is a mess neurotypicals create, that we are too logical and peace-loving for it. And I am aware that this thought is biased, I own it as such. I don't expect all autistics to agree.I am disheartened, however, that once again, the public is being sold the story of autism as an occupational liability and disqualifying factor. How many typical persons are found to be unsuitable for service? Where are the stories about their fears and quirks? The stories are unwritten; they are not real news. Neither is this one.What it is is an attempt to use an autistic person to make a point about the current recruiting methods.

I was reading Donna Williams' Nobody Nowhere, when gradually, then suddenly, I knew, and everything that had always worried and confused me finally made perfect sense. Mu! Enlightenment. Autism.It took a couple of years to decide to go for the formal diagnosis. Replacing the questions I'd lived with all my life were new ones: What's the point of a diagnosis at my age? What could it possibly change? Wouldn't it only limit my options, make things more difficult? The questions weren't only mine, but came from the people around me, the ones important in my life. They worried about me accepting a label, confining myself to some sort of box.I looked around and saw myself inside a box already. The walls were constructed of false beliefs, that I was lazy, uncooperative, immature, and sick. The bottom of the box was made of even sturdier materials. Formed of expectations--how a person should act, what counts as intelligence, who gets to be taken seriously, etc--this was a foundation having nothing to do with my perception of the world.The box had plenty of labels on it. Someone had pasted on psycho and freak. Friends had covered those over with shy, introspective, different. Someone else had come along and scribbled a list of ingredients in languages I didn't understand. A sunburst sticker was added: 100% Motivation-Free. I stepped out of the box and looked around. I saw nothing but people in boxes. Some of them had fashioned their own containers, but most were like mine, designed by people who were only guessing what was inside. Others didn't know that there were any boxes. Most saw everybody's box except their own. Returning to my own box, I peeled off the labels that didn't apply. I decorated it with squares I cut into it.

I have an arsenal of arguments for this topic, filed under names like Affirmative Action Comparison, The Handedness Argument, The Social Construction Explanation, Definitions Please, and the ever popular Because I Said So (\"not an argument, it's just contradiction!\").

The point of it is to reduce, however slightly, the fear that affects employers and taxpaying citizens upon hearing words like \"accommodation\" and \"supports\". 1) A written, prioritized list of job assignments. If someone tells me more than two things I need to do, I need it in written form. I have long made a habit of carrying a small notebook for this purpose. For someone who finds writing by hand slow and laborious, though, providing him or her with a list could be helpful. For me, the prioritizing part of this accommodation would be the most help. See the next point for further explanation.Cost: $02) Clarity and specificity. I don't automatically know what the boss sees as most important. Left to my own devices, I will approach a task list by starting with the easiest and quickest so that I can mark it off. Second, I'll do the most difficult job, to get it out of the way. Then back to an easy one. If something needs to be done NOW, it really helps to be told that. If \"sweep the dining area\" means \"sweep the dining area and front entrance area\", that would be a really good thing to know. Being direct in requests is equally important. Some autistics won't pick up on sarcasm, such as \"great job on that sweeping\" when it hasn't been done adequately or hints like \"It would sure be nice if someone swept this floor\".Cost: $03) As much as is possible, consistency. I have always had problems in settings where I've had to report to five or six different managers, all with different preferences for how things should be done. Often, these managers have been at war with one another and tended to use their employees as pawns in this game. This is a level of strategy I'll never be able to negotiate on my own. Could it be understood that some employees really do need to be accountable to one particular manager?Cost: $04) Exemption (within reason) from wearing the company uniform. Cotton is good. I like cotton. Polyester, anything scratchy or \"slippery\" feeling, these sort of things guarantee that I will not be able to focus on anything except how uncomfortable I am. I am sure this is true for many NT employees, too. I hope that someday all corporations will recognize how truly unproductive some types of uniforms can be.Cost: minimal (purchase of similar item might be necessary)5) A less hostile workplace culture. Locking someone in the walk-in cooler because you think he's a geek is not funny. Encouraging a co-worker to break an important rule is not funny. Mocking, excluding and criticising people for stims isn't funny either. I've seen bosses not only turn the other way, but actually join in the \"fun\". Someone needs to be doing some education and training at corporate and local levels. Autistic people deserve a workplace free from harassment, just as women, gays and persons of all races and ethnicities do. Cost: (?) Management workshop or seminar; inclusion in company non-discrimination policies; training for co-workers6) Patience. I learn routines quickly, but if the routine changes, it might take me 4 or 5 times as long to relearn it. I know this doesn't make sense to NT managers, but really, it's not some kind of game to me. Understand that it will take some employees a while to give up the \"old\" way of doing things. Also, if your employee is trying to tell you something, it might take a very long time to get it said. It is really not helpful to finish her sentences for her or otherwise show impatience. Cost: $07) Understanding schedule requirements. Some autistic employees will happily work a standard 40 hour week consisting of (5) eight hour shifts. Others will do better with shorter days or a four day work week. The benefits to the employer include not paying for time which is not going to be productive due to overload or exhaustion. Understand that the energy we must put into being around people is draining. Being in a break room with others may actually be less relaxing than being on the factory floor in a more isolated area. Performing job tasks while in the constant presence of others can tire an autistic person significantly. Cost: $08) Consideration in type of work assigned. Not every worker fits well with every job in a company. I have been lucky enough to have some employers who saw my strengths and knew what type of work would suit me. I have worked in some very chaotic environments which I survived by finding a place for myself in the background, away from the demands of direct customer service. I had no problems managing an eight hour day working in the stock room of a department store, but found doing similar tasks on the sales floor very draining. Managers need to know that employees with this type of profile are not just \"being difficult\". Cost: $0This list of free to inexpensive accommodations is far from exhaustive. I'm sure every autistic person who reads this will have something to add or change. Clearly, the price to be paid for these \"supports\" is not financial, but is traded in the currency of attitudes. Employers fear the development of a \"slippery slope\" or situation whereby more and more employees will demand \"special treatment\". Co-workers may harbor resentments that someone who is not obviously \"disabled\" is getting \"preferential treatment\" in scheduling or work assignments. Until autism is better understood and accepted by the general public, problems will persist. Providing some of these accommodations would be easy. Getting past the idea that everyone is the same and that treating everyone identically should be maintained as the gold standard of fairness, well, that's another story, isn't it?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/07/autism-at-work.html", "title": "\nAutism at work\n"},

The study will cost very little because it will be conducted entirely by volunteers at flea markets and garage sales.Various unnamed parties have suggested that the presence of lawn gnomes in the yards of their childhood homes may be to blame for some adults' persistence in believing in \u201cchangeling\u201d type fairy tales. Further anecdotal evidence indicates that at least some members of the organizations in question did indeed express the opinion that the gnomes are \u201ccute\u201d.The alleged representative of one such rumored organization voiced outrage at the very idea of the gnome connection. \u201cThey are very much not our class of lawn ornament\u201d, she retorted. An inside source, though, verifies that the organization's \"founding family\" does indeed own a manufacturing company which produces the gnomes.

{"date": "Saturday, July 7, 2007", "body": "\nOne of the dubious benefits of autism is that it often comes with a reputation for honesty. Whether due to perceived deficits in the theory of mind or to some mysterious (to me) radar detecting a lack of intent to deceive or to a known history of bluntness or simply to incompetence in lying, Aspies are sometimes granted a \u201cpass\u201d in cases where others might undergo more intense scrutiny. I can\u2019t say this hasn\u2019t gotten me out of a jam or two in my life, as having a reputation for truthfulness can do. Both my parents would swear I was all but incapable of deception and backed up some pretty weak stories at times. The one that comes to mind involves a wrecked car, a wet road and imaginary rabbit. Sorry, Mom and Dad. I lied.My inability to grasp the importance of \u201cwhite lies\u201d was a source of distress for them, too. How could I say that I liked the doll my aunt gave me when everyone knew I didn\u2019t play with dolls? At what age is someone supposed to figure out that the answer to questions about looking fat is always (and emphatically) \u201cno\u201d? By now, of course, I know the answers, but that (just slightly extra) hesitation before answering gives it away every time.Silent deceptions, the kind most non-autistic people don\u2019t even think of as deception, like makeup and hair coloring, these never even occur to me. Dressing up is reserved for job interviews and funerals. Why would a person choose an uncomfortable and/or expensive outfit for the sake of presentation? Maybe this lack of expected pretension adds to the autistic \u201caura of honesty\u201d, I don\u2019t know.On the other hand, the \u201chonesty pass\u201d has often been revoked at exactly the wrong times. In the academic realm, I\u2019ve dealt with more than my share of unjustified suspicions. From grades one through twelve, teachers refused to believe that I could not retrieve the answer to a question in class. They knew I had learned the information; it was evident from my papers and tests, so how could I possibly not be able to just say it? Accusations of plagiarism have been leveled as well, though never officially, and the last of these is not yet far enough in the past to alleviate anxieties of future problems in this area.These are issues I understand, however inexcusable the accusations may be. They are based on familiarity with the motives, abilities and patterns of typical students, and on lack of exposure to many people for whom writing and speaking are two completely unrelated abilities. In an ideal world, one might expect that the current \u201cfocus\u201d on autism would lead to these incidents becoming less common. Instead, the patholigizing of different learning styles has more likely led to such students being segregated for individualized instruction and \u201cintervention\u201d. (Thank God I escaped that kind of \u201chelp\u201d, anyway.)There are other ill conceived exceptions to the \u201chonesty rule\u201d about which I steadfastly refuse to be understanding. These are the ones which fall into the category of truths about being autistic. The big one, \u201cyou are not really autistic\u201d and all its variations (such as \u201cyou\u2019re confused\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s only Asperger\u2019s\u201d and \u201ceverybody does that\u201d) is no longer being entertained here, thank you. All such comments are best met with stony silence, a skyward glance, a swift departure or combination of the three. There\u2019s no reasoning with people who are determined to call me a liar at this level. My energies are thus reserved for the many lies about autism and autistic people in general. I\u2019m not even going to get started listing those here.The idea that autistics always tell the truth, well, that\u2019s a misconception, but is it a damaging one or more in the \u201cwhite lie\u201d category? I do believe it is harmful, as it contributes to the probably less than accurate \u201ctheory of mind deficit\u201d concept. More dangerous still is the way the idea of the perfectly honest autistic child dovetails with the \u201cautistic angel\u201d stereotype. While less clearly hurtful than the \u201cchild stealing demon\u201d myth, angels are no more accurate descriptors of the autistic child. Perfect, mysterious, ethereal and mythical, it\u2019s yet another way of implying certain people are not quite human. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Ro_atgSqrVI/AAAAAAAAAsg/B4so5WTEWU8/s1600-h/lies+and+rabbits.bmp"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/07/to-tell-truth.html", "title": "\nTo tell the truth\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, July 17, 2007", "body": "\nI've very much been enjoying abfh's counterpoints to my recent posts, so I thought I'd reciprocate with my own take on Welcome to Holland. It's not as funny as hers, Welcome to Italy, but it's something I've had on my mind to do eventually. Today's as good as any I suppose.Welcome to NowhereI was born in Italy to a nice Italian family. Or so I thought. My parents were so proud of their heritage. Mama started breaking me in on the music of Verdi and Puccini before I was even born. We spoke only Italian at home, though Mama and Papa were fluent in several languages. I never did get the hang of Italian. I hated to be such a disappointment, but it just didn't make sense to me.The house was nicely decorated with Da Vinci prints and replicas of ancient Roman sculpture. On Sundays, Mama cooked a big meal, working all day in the kitchen to prepare huge servings of linguine with clam sauce or fusilli pomodoro, which we ate with the finest Italian wine the family could afford. It was good, I guess, but very heavy, I always felt tired and cranky at dinner. In school, we learned about the Caesars, Napoleon and Mussolini. Why does history have to be so full of violence?There was a Dutch boy in my school. Everyone felt sorry for him because he was from Holland. I tried not to stare at him, and sometimes I took up for him when the bullies picked on him, but not if the cool kids were watching. I was never mean of course, but you have to be careful not to be seen hanging out with someone like that.Papa explained there was nothing wrong, exactly, with being Dutch, that it was just an unfortunate circumstance into which some people were born. I was somewhat curious about this place, Holland, and started to read a little about it.The strangest thing happened. I started to have memories of being a little boy in Holland, happily watching windmills spin, pacing in circles around tulip gardens, building a dam out of alphabet building blocks, making a nonsense pattern of letters: Afsluitdijk. It must have been a dream I guess, I'd never been to Holland.Or had I? The more I read about Holland, the more familiar it seemed. I was noticing many more Dutch people now, and they seemed less strange than before. I seemed to understand their language. It was frightening and disorienting.When I first mentioned this to my parents, they said I must be crazy. People from Holland were not at all like us. They were slower, they had different habits, and most of them would never amount to anything. Finally, one night, I heard them talking about High Dutch and Low Dutch, and where I might fit in.So that's it. I'm Dutch. They brought me here so I wouldn't have to know, so I'd be like the others. But I'm not like the others. I'm not Italian after all, but then I'm not sure I'm quite Dutch either. People keep saying I can't really be Dutch because I act so Italian. I don't know anything about Dutch history and culture. Is there a Dutch history and culture to know about? Is it really bad to be Dutch after all? Why would they hide it from me otherwise? I'm so very confused. It's a pain that may never, ever, ever go away.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rp0C3a9yvhI/AAAAAAAAAt4/hQn6Sg3GzGw/s1600-h/windmill.jpg", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/07/diversity-at-work.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/07/autism-causation-mad-libs.html", "http://www.our-kids.org/Archives/Holland.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/07/welcome-to-italy.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/07/welcome-to-nowhere.html", "title": "\nWelcome to nowhere\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 14, 2007", "body": "\nThis week I received an email from a teacher with some questions and observations about stimming. The writer expressed concern about some aspects of ABA training and parent reactions to her refusal to help stamp out young students' autistic behaviors. Cool! I like this person already. In response, then, some random thoughts on stims, their functions and value:(Note: there are many possible ways of organizing this information. Some activities fit in more than one category and my categorization will likely not be the same as that of any other person.)Comfort stims:Some of the things that help me relax are repetitive finger movements, bird and animal sounds, rocking, pacing, scribbling or drawing and repetition of words and syllables. Some of these (especially the bird and animal sounds) have at times been taken for \u201cattention seeking\u201d behaviors. This is a truly bizarre idea, as 1) I usually seek to avoid the attention of others and 2) the types of attention these actions draw is usually far from desirable.Are these voluntary actions? Yes, I can choose not to do any of these. The most likely result will be that I remove myself from the situation and retire to a place where I am more comfortable. Failing that, I may become irritable. Most people don\u2019t like me when I\u2019m irritable.Attention focusing stims:These are the things that help me organize my thoughts and concentrate on what\u2019s being said. They include making a low, rumbling sound, rubbing the back of my head, drawing squares, birdlike head movements, stretching and rocking. I\u2019m sure some people think I\u2019m not listening while I\u2019m tracing the pattern in the carpet, but in truth, I retain far more information when doing this than when busily trying to fake \u201cproper\u201d eye contact.There need to be more studies on this sort of thing with autistic children. Educational leaders might be more inclined to respect autistic learning styles if they had more empirical evidence to back this up. I once heard a speaker earnestly explain the difference between \u201ccompliant\u201d and \u201ccongruent\u201d classroom behaviors. She described an autistic boy who drew tornadoes during math class as compliant (not disruptive) but not congruent (not on the same topic as the rest of the class). Weeks later, I looked at the drawing (squares) I made during her talk. I still remember every word of it.Ritual stims:This is the category I use to describe some of my echolalic utterances and preferences for sameness. My need for some types of security has decreased gradually, but for years I had a certain table I needed to sit at in each restaurant I visited regularly. I still can\u2019t enjoy a movie unless I sit near the end of the back row, but I don\u2019t drive across town to visit the single acceptable gas station anymore. Echolalia, immediate, delayed, scripted or otherwise, remains a relaxing and enjoyable activity. Some of the stored scripts have become treasured rituals, reliable anchors in a confusing and ever changing world.Stimming one\u2019s way to success:Repetition is useful in conventionally accepted ways. Music, poetry and other arts depend upon it. Science benefits from careful replication. The ability to endure a level of sameness that would bore many NTs to tears has allowed many an autistic person to flourish in fields which require repetition.Stimming as an expression of culture:It is always an occasion of joy to see another autistic person behaving autistically. It\u2019s like finding a long lost family member in a foreign country, the instant sense of recognition and fellowship. More than that, it\u2019s a powerful affirmation of survival in a world determined to extinguish any hint of difference. I\u2019ve had meaningful and wordless conversations in unexpected places which are among my happiest memories.Take the NT Stim Challenge:What some people see as purposeless behaviors are anything but that. Stims serve a number of purposes for autistics and NTs alike. You think NTs don\u2019t do these things? Please watch this video by christschool if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, for just a few examples. There are many other repetitive behaviors that could be added to this list, including gum chewing (and popping!), remote control channel flipping, whistling and the all but meaningless \u201chello\u201d and \u201chow are you\u201d rituals. The activities themselves may be different, but the functions are similar. If you think it\u2019s not the same thing, try identifying a couple of your own \u201crepetitive behaviors\u201d and then just stop doing them. Ask your closest friend or a family member to point out every time you tap your fingers, twirl your hair or say \u201cyou know\u201d and see how quickly you become exhausted from the effort. Observe how your attention to other, more important tasks is affected.If you think maybe \u201cmild\u201d aversives are okay, wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it when you \u201cact out\u201d. If you do the behavior more than a pre-set number of times, also deprive yourself of something you enjoy, like a cup of coffee or tea in the morning. Notice whether or not you feel angry or frustrated. It\u2019s still not the same? You are right about that. You can stop the experiment anytime you want to. Society recognizes your right to set your own goals. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rpjq769yvdI/AAAAAAAAAtY/KPeXILuSmzU/s1600-h/pink+squares.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f15JexiQt4U&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Faspergersquare8%2Eblogspot%2Ecom%2F2007%2F03%2Frocking%2Dand%2Dflapping%2Dand%2Dstims%2Doh%2Dmy%2Ehtml"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/07/stimming-life.html", "title": "\nThe stimming life\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2007", "body": "\nI was considering the possibility of going to the NATTAP /OCALI (Ohio Center for Autism and Low Incidence) conference in Columbus this September. I read the information on their website and looked over the schedule for the conference. There were references there to issues of concern to autistic adults: higher education, employment, relationships. There were several autistic presenters listed including Stephen Shore and Jean-Paul Bovee. It seemed like it might be a worthwhile trip, though it would require missing a day or two of classes and work, for which I wouldn\u2019t be paid.Expenses in addition to this would include gas, a hotel room and conference registration. I checked the page for registration rates and saw that the price for three days was listed as $250 dollars. Not too bad I guess, if you are a professional working in the field and need to earn the CEU credits anyway. But for a student with part time employment, that\u2019s a lot of money.All of the autism conferences I\u2019ve attended in the past have offered lower rates for autistics and family members. I looked around and found the registration fee for parents of autistic individuals: $185. Nothing about autistic people themselves, though. Believing this to be an oversight, I wrote the contact person and inquired. But no, apparently what they said on the page was exactly what they meant. No discount for autistics, only parents. I suppose the information presented is not intended for us, not really. It\u2019s for people who are working to help autistic individuals \u201cachieve their full potential\u201d.How silly of me to think I might contribute something there.

{"date": "Monday, July 16, 2007", "body": "\nIt seems that one of the hardest things for typical people to understand about autism is the way skill sets can seemingly change overnight, so that although, for example, I spoke very well yesterday, I can barely manage to put a sentence together this morning. I understand the skepticism I\u2019ve encountered about this; before I knew much about autism, it\u2019s one of the things that most made me doubt myself and question my sanity. This doesn\u2019t apply only to speech and it isn\u2019t always about short term changes either. That\u2019s just the aspect of life I\u2019ve chosen to talk about today.Some of the people I interact with on a regular basis are familiar with some of the scripts I use on days when speech is hard, but mostly, they assume unless (and sometimes even if) told otherwise that I do this to be either funny or annoying. Scripts are different from stimmy things that are just relaxing or invigorating to say. Nonsense words, syllables and simple random facts (seven times seven is forty-nine) fall into the latter category. More complex repetitions of lines from movies, songs, TV shows or earlier conversations are more likely an attempt to communicate something.A funny thing about that: sometimes I am completely unaware of what this \u201csomething\u201d is until later, when I am alone and able to process the situation. It\u2019s hardly ever a clear cut case of what most people would consider symbolism, wherein one thing substitutes for another; it\u2019s rather more tangential or loosely associative.One of the common forms goes like this:First someone asks a question and I can\u2019t think how to answer it. Either several possible (equally valid) answers compete to be said and confound my ability to choose, or I can\u2019t, at the moment, figure out what the question means. I\u2019ve tried saying \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means\u201d, or \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer you\u201d, but this tends to anger many people and even (perhaps especially) therapists and other \u201chelpful\u201d types have accused me of lying in these cases. Other times, I may be unable to formulate even that much of a response.Sometimes, though, the answer comes as easily as I imagine most answers do to most people, that is, almost automatically. Only the answer isn\u2019t \u201cfrom\u201d me. It\u2019s one of my scripts, which may or may not make sense to the other person involved. The answer to \u201cHow was work today?\u201d might be \u201cwhat of \u2018what of'' ?\u201d (from a Frank O\u2019Hara poem) or \u201casafetida\u201d (a spice referenced frequently in a cooking show I watched in the 80s). Then again it might be \u201cfine\u201d, but what people don\u2019t know is it isn\u2019t today\u2019s \u201cfine\u201d but from a conversation I had with a teacher in high school or a \u201cfine\u201d clipped from last night\u2019s Law and Order episode. It has layers of meaning which are not expressed and are not available to me through speech (though I could possibly write about if I had a reason to do so).Of course, things go more easily when the answer is \u201cfine\u201d rather than \u201casafetida\u201d. No one thinks I am being a smartass, though they might wish for more information. Yet, I haven\u2019t answered any more authentically. The response is \u201ccut and paste\u201d whether or not the listener thinks I have made a legitimate effort to converse. Indeed, very long and credible conversations can be made up, unbeknownst to the conversational partner, of many of these bits and pieces strung together. And, in some ways, it\u2019s for the best they don\u2019t suspect.The idea is foreign to most non-autistic people, and would disturb some who might assume that the scripted nature of my talk indicates the entire interaction has been meaningless to me. Actually, I may have had a pleasant and comfortable experience, imagining that the other person understood what I meant, just as he or she imagined I couldn\u2019t possibly find a \u201csimple\u201d question (\u201cHow was your day?\u201d) confusing. I\u2019ve always understood that people mostly talk out of habit and anxiety to be seen / heard, that not much is really accomplished through these rituals beyond the mysterious strengthening of social bonds.So I talk this way and when the \u201cright\u201d scripts are selected, the people around me feel heard, they feel secure and understood. The funny thing to me, is that they seem to perceive my speech as more authentic or more valid at these times when I\u2019m scripting than at other times, when I\u2019m working hard to do what comes naturally to NTs, generating sentences \u201cfrom scratch\u201d.When I do this, even on a \u201cgood\u201d communication day, it is hard work. When I am \u201creally\u201d talking, the speech is labored, full of long pauses, missing referents, backtracking and parenthetical thoughts. The very slowness of the process triggers both annoyance and suspicion in many people. There is a dangerous misconception that having to stop and think about something too often equals dishonesty. They are not used to having to painstakingly construct spoken language, so why should I find it so difficult unless I am busy \u201cmaking things up\u201d? They\u2019ve seen me speak fluently, easily, sensibly. And they assume that was the \u201creal\u201d me, since it is closer to what they know about themselves.If not dishonesty, then the slowness of speech can be taken for nervousness. Just relax, someone might say. \u201cJust be yourself\u201d is a line I\u2019ve heard a few times, ironically, just at the time I was doing that very thing. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/07/scripted-language-and-authenticity.html", "title": "\nScripted language and authenticity\n"},

Some are fairly predictable, though they probably don't get the searchers quite what they were looking for.\"Social Stories\" is a popular search, and one which surprisingly doesn't always lead to the person clicking away in horror.

They don't tend to stick around as long.\"Autistics in the army\" pops up several times a week, and there are still a few people wondering if autism is responsible for the Virgina Tech tragedy.

{"date": "Thursday, July 19, 2007", "body": "\nA new autism blog was brought to my attention. I tried to ignore it, convincing myself this would be the best thing to do. The person who writes it is clearly meaning to be helpful and says that she enjoys working with people on the spectrum. I thought I\u2019d give her a bit more time to get her bearings before leaving a comment. I never got the chance to comment, though, as this blog I\u2019ll call autismadvocacy4dummies no longer accepts comments. This happened shortly after another autistic adult left a comment questioning the author\u2019s statement on the importance of person first language. Here\u2019s what the blogger (I\u2019ll call her HappyGoodWeather) had posted:\"Before you start reading this article I'd like to say that I have a serious problem with people referring to our kids as \"autistic children\". To me it sounds so derogatory. I prefer \"children or people with autism.\" A commenter politely offered the information that most autistic adults prefer to be called \u201cAutistic\u201d and included a brief explanation. HappyGoodWeather responded with a new post, thanking the commenter, but reiterating the reasons she felt the term autistic to be demeaning. Shortly thereafter, a post along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s my blog, I\u2019ll say what I want to\u201d appeared. I am not able to offer any quotes from these two posts, because they were taken down the next day, and comments for all posts were disabled.I wish that Happy had not taken that action. She has every right, of course, to use her blog for one way communication or to hide it from public view if she wants. I don\u2019t dispute that. My problem with this is that she started a conversation, she claimed to value the commenter\u2019s opinion, and then, when she heard some things she didn\u2019t like, she basically told her visitors to shut up. So what I want to say to HappyGoodWeather, I\u2019ll have to say here.First, about the name of your blog. If you want to call people ignorant, uninformed or something of that nature, be aware that some people, autistic and neurotypical alike, are going to take offense at that. This would be true even if you had an advanced degree or other standard \u201cexpert\u201d credentials.A commenter at your blog also mentioned a problem with the banner illustration. Puzzle pieces, yes, but beyond that even, the statement \u201cEnough is Enough\u201d, however you meant it, has offended some of us. You have made it clear that is not your concern. I would be curious to know if you would take a similar position if an ethnic or religious minority took issue with a statement suggesting they be eliminated.Another problem is, of course the content of your posts. A couple of examples:\u201cAs someone who is immersed in the Autism World, I can tell you that most people categorize having a child diagnosed with Autism as a death.\u201d\u201cEver wondered what it's like to live with Autism Everyday? Ever wondered what it's like to listen to your child scream incessantly? Take a look at this video. It will change your view of Autism. It will show you the stories of strong, powerful families who live through this.\u201d (link to the infamous Autism Every Day)I struggled with myself over writing this. What difference does this one little blog make, why call attention to it? Maybe just because someone directed my attention to it and it made me feel queasy and I haven\u2019t been able to forget. Maybe because there is still a line in one of the posts that says \u201cI look forward to your comments\u201d But probably most because of this:\u201cMy job is working with the children with Autism and the family as a whole. I try help the family make sense of the diagnosis and inquire as to how we could make the situation a little more manageable.\u201dHappyGoodWeather sees herself as knowledgeable and helpful. She calls herself a \u201cstudent\u201d, a \u201ctherapist in training\u201d, who hopes her blog will \u201cserve as a tool for many people\u201d.I fear for the children she works with. She says she wants \u201ca better world\u201d for them. Will she also say to them \u201cI look forward to your comments\u201d and then turn away? Or will she listen patiently, if condescendingly, to their concerns, until the day they join the ranks of autistic adults, and therefore need be silenced?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-not-to-support-autistics-texbook.html", "title": "\nHow (not) to Support Autistics: A Textbook Case\n"},
{"date": "Monday, July 23, 2007", "body": "\nExcuse me, I have something to say. It\u2019s about the difficulty I have in entering a conversation. This has always been a problem for me, and one which seems not to have gotten much better over time. This works differently for different autistic people; some of us may appear rude, constantly talking over others, changing topics abruptly or making \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments. In other cases the person may appear detached and disinterested in the conversation. I would usually fall into the second category.But the reason for this may not be intuitively perceived by the neurotypical partner in conversation. What appears to be \u201cspacing out\u201d in my case is in part the result of my effort not to engage in the more actively \u201crude\u201d behaviors of the first category.Intellectually, I understand that typical people use their eyes and voice inflection to offer others a chance to speak, and there must also be some corresponding behavior a listener uses to indicate she would like to join in the conversation, though this escapes me entirely. What I mean here is that I think I know how to do this, but apparently I don\u2019t since it rarely works for me. Most often, when I try to indicate that I would like a turn to speak, this isn\u2019t noticed or acknowledged. After a number of failures, I tend to give up the attempts and sit quietly in what others may perceive as \u201cmy own world\u201d. And truly, I may \u201czone out\u201d at these times and enjoy the pattern in the floor tiles or Formica tabletop.I have tried alternative approaches, such as raising my hand. For some reason, this seems to annoy most people. Perhaps it is seen as sarcasm or silliness. It isn\u2019t intended that way.Here is how I perceive a typical conversation with one other person:The person is telling me a story. At the second sentence, I have a question, but he does not pause for it. I must choose between remembering the question to ask later and paying attention to the rest of the story.If I hold onto the question, it may lead me far off topic as a free association about the details unfolds in my mind. The connection to the conversational partner is lost.If I let the question go, then I listen as the story is continued.At the third sentence, I would like to make a comment, and try to indicate this. But if my effort isn\u2019t noticed, the decision between listening and remembering my comment is repeated. This can happen any number of times as the person continues to speak.Finally, after maybe eight or nine sentences, my friend stops talking, and looks at me expectantly. Though I could repeat back word for word what he has said, and though I have had several thoughts by now which are relevant, I say nothing, because the proper time for the comment has passed, as he has moved swiftly from subtopic A and B all the way through H. Now, if I say what I had to say about B, he will certainly think I am not \u201cgetting the gist\u201d and I haven\u2019t yet thought of anything to say about G or H. So my choice is between saying something which will surely be perceived as odd, starting a sentence I may not be able to finish, or remaining quiet.Now the person, if he doesn\u2019t know me well is confused or perhaps offended by my silence. Possibly he thinks I am either rude or not too bright. In either case, he will probably not bother trying to talk to me again.Or maybe I\u2019ve succeeded this time. I have made a timely and relevant comment. Now I have a chance to expand on it, right? Well, maybe. Now there is the matter of \u201cholding\u201d the floor to be negotiated. Because equally difficult to entering the conversation is the problem of indicating that I am not ready to be interrupted yet. Invariably, I will pause at the wrong time, in the wrong way, or for too long, and this will be interpreted as a green light for someone else to speak. I have absolutely no choice in this matter. I cannot construct speech any faster than I do.So, how do I tell someone I\u2019m not finished speaking? Instinctively, I raise my hand to say \u201cstop\u201d or cover my ears to continue thinking. These are not gestures which are well received by many. If I am using my square drawing book, I might make a note in the margin and try to return to the topic later, if it still seems relevant. Most likely, I won\u2019t though. I am tired by now. Conversation is exhausting. This is only one of the reasons.Possibly, cards like these, to be placed on the table or worn on a lanyard would be helpful. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RqUz_GxmQBI/AAAAAAAAAwU/vxx_2YVA7dI/s1600-h/talking+cards..jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/07/excuse-me-i-have-something-to-say.html", "title": "\nWe Interrupt This Program...\n"},

I recently finished up my summer research project on university students with Asperger syndrome, taking a series of qualitative interviews with students and campus disability resource centers and comparing the responses from the two groups. I hope to post some details of this soon.I\u2019ve started a new practicum working with two projects to employ people with disabilities. I\u2019m assisting with a mentoring program and will be compiling information on autism for employers, which I will also present at a statewide conference. Very much in line with the work I hope to do following further education.For the past year, I have been coordinating a social group for teens with Asperger syndrome through a non-profit agency in my state. We are starting to pick up more members (finally); this month we are visiting a science museum. Still trying to put together an advocacy group here for adults, meanwhile working part time as a security guard and taking classes, hoping to graduate this December (but it might not happen until May), taking out just enough time to photograph a floor tile or draw a brick wall every once in a while in my notebook. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RssZ27lhU_I/AAAAAAAAA1s/kQ3oO5y_hvw/s1600-h/ft+101.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-im-working-on.html", "title": "\nWhat I'm working on\n"},

As she has done many times before, she holds the loaded gun to her head while looking in the mirror. Someday she will do it. But not now, not like this.\n\nAnne is drunk again. She is always drunk. She has climbed onto the roof of the neighbor\u2019s house and is looking for an unlocked window. She is angry that they said she could not come in, and is determined to prove them wrong. Soon, the police will arrive. The ladder has fallen, and Anne must jump from the roof.\n\nSally has clinical depression. Anne is an alcoholic. There is something in the brains of these women that makes them these ways. They will get help eventually. Sally will get treatment for her depression after 20 years of struggling with suicidal thoughts and persistent sadness. Anne will join AA after many years of uncontrollable drinking. A happy ending? Perhaps, if they keep up the treatments and the treatments continue to work.\n\nThere is more to the story. Anne and Sally are autistic. Anne\u2019s mother has said to her many times, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like the others?\u201d and \u201cDo you want people to think there is something wrong with you?\u201d Sally\u2019s father has complained, \u201cI am ashamed to take you anywhere\u201d.\n\nThe parents know each other. They get together and talk about how hard it is to deal with a child who barely talks, who acts younger than she \u201cshould\u201d at her age, who is only interested in reading and doesn\u2019t make friends with other young people. It is so hard, they say. Sally and Anne don't talk much, but they hear acutely. They hear this.\n\nIt is almost certain that Sally is prone to depression for biological and hereditary reasons. There are others in her family with the condition. Anne, likewise, is a member of a family in which there are several alcoholics. Probably, these struggles would have occurred, even if Sally and Anne had been fully accepted by their parents as unique individuals with every right to their differences.\n\nPossibly, though, the challenges they faced would have been less severe. Possibly, the disdain of these parents served as the environmental trigger which caused the depression and the alcoholism to manifest in the ways that they did. Sally and Anne might have gotten help earlier had they understood that they were not defective or fundamentally flawed. It took them a long time to find out.\n\nThis is a semi-true story. Only the names have been changed and the fact that Sally and Anne are one person. She considers herself very lucky indeed to be alive today and writing this blog. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/08/environmental-triggers.html", "title": "\nEnvironmental Triggers\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 22, 2007", "body": "\nSometimes I wonder where I would be without the natural supports I am lucky enough to have: a caring partner who makes sure the bills get paid and that I call my mother once in a while; a boss who understands that my way of getting things done may be different, but is no worse than the way of my co-worker; a best friend, who explains, for example, what Sally meant when Sally said X after I did Y and what consequences might arise. These people help me. None of them do it because they have to or because they see me as damaged or incompetent. Of the three I\u2019ve mentioned here (and there are others), one views me as clearly autistic, one rejects the \u201clabel\u201d, but accommodates the differences, and one is unaware of any label which might describe me. These people value me for who I am and have decided they want me in their lives. Making these small adjustments is as natural as holding open the door for someone whose arms are full of packages. It really is no more or less than a matter of respect and common sense. I reciprocate by taking occasional bad tempers in stride, remembering important dates, pointing out two shades of green in an outfit that don\u2019t work well together, and in other ways so automatic I don\u2019t even notice them.Others, of course, have not been so kind. What Sally said, for example, was not a thing you would ever say to a person you meant to appreciate, befriend or understand. And there are far more Sallies in my world than I care to think about.And certainly, not every autistic person has been this fortunate. For all of us, but especially those who have not found these natural supports, the short and mid term goals of assistance must be supplemented with the long term goal of societal change, acceptance. On Kristina\u2019s blog today was much discussion of the term acceptance, whether or not it can coexist with a hatred of autism as a condition, whether it is an active or passive value, whether it equates with giving up, what effect it might have on the development of independent living skills.One commenter worried that his son would never drive a car or flirt with a girl. How, he asked, would societal acceptance of autism help his son achieve these goals? The answer is obvious to me. Societal attitudes cannot help a person learn to drive safely, but they can change how much importance we place on this skill as well as on the increasingly necessary development of alternative modes of transportation. True and widespread understanding of autism as a valid and worthy way of being human would also have to include the knowledge of differing verbal and non-verbal communication styles.Picture this:A young man arrives by bus to the restaurant, meeting his date, who is waiting near the entrance. \u201cI have taken the number 88 bus and have spent 47 minutes in transit, stopping 16 times. Seven people got on the bus; four got off before me. The bus returns to this stop at 9:45 and at 10:50, and will be heading due East at that time. This bus was a New Flyer model D45V, but the one that comes later may be different. I hope I have not kept you waiting\u201d. \u201cYou have buttoned your shirt incorrectly,\u201d she says. She smiles at him, he looks at the wall, and they walk into the restaurant, where he orders what he always orders and she tries something new. She understands when he says something \"awkward\" and he deals with it when she asks a too personal question and they begin a new difficult uncertain and rewarding life together. A better world. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/what-qualities-does-the-parent-of-an-autistic-child-need-to-have/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/08/independent-living.html", "title": "\nIndependent Living\n"},

I\u2019m about to step up and give my order when I realize she\u2019s talking to the guy behind me! I\u2019ve been \u201coverlooked\u201d enough times by sales persons to have gotten used to it. That doesn\u2019t mean I accept it, however. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say, \u201cI think I was here first\u201d. The counter person seems a bit flustered and redirects her attention but doesn\u2019t apologize or anything.Since this sort of thing has gone on all my life, I\u2019ve given some thought to it. Is it because I am short? No, I don\u2019t think so. I am below average height, but not nearly so short as to be unseen over the average sales counter. For a long time I assumed the problem, when occurring in higher priced establishments was based on class perceptions. If I was wearing a shirt from a thrift shop (often my preference), I must not have enough money to pay for something from Macy\u2019s, so they would naturally ignore me.But now I\u2019m thinking that wasn\u2019t it either. I think it is something like what Joel has written about here. There is something unassertive about my very presence I\u2019ve been told. I just seem to \u201cseem\u201d like I\u2019m not really there somehow. Spacey or something. Maybe without knowing what it is they are seeing, people perceive that there is something different, and therefore frightening about me.Or maybe they think that I will go away if they ignore me. For a long time I did. For years I walked away from situations like the one I described here, frustrated and confused. Without getting what I\u2019d come for, I just left, with the feeling I had slipped into the twilight zone, unsure the experience had even really happened. I never told anyone about these encounters. Why would I expect them to believe me? I was half convinced myself that this couldn't really be true.Not long ago, I worked in a business where one of the employees had taken a dislike to me. When I said hello to her in the morning, she pretended not to hear. She said nothing at all, unless someone else was there to witness it. The few times I needed to ask her work related questions, she also ignored me. I was determined not to \u201ccatch\u201d her rudeness, and always made a point to say hello in the morning and to include her when I offered to get coffee for other staff members.I described the situation to another person I know. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou must have done something!\u201d I really don\u2019t think I did, but I may well be wrong. I tried to ask her once if there was something we needed to talk about, but I never got an answer.

Can you spot the fake?1) I\u2019m on my way out to dinner with a friend. We are talking about general stuff, or she is, politics, work, the weather. Suddenly, out of nowhere, in reference to a conversation from the previous day, I hear that \u201csome autistic people just can\u2019t function in the real world\u201d. Don\u2019t I understand that such people may have to be institutionalized?2) In a work setting, four of us are discussing ways to help people with disabilities find employment. A presentation I\u2019m working on comes up; it concerns autism and employment. Services for adults are scarce, we all agree. Someone interjects that the main issue regarding autism is \u201cfinding out what causes it\u201d.3) In class this week, we are discussing ethical dilemmas that might occur in the practice of social work. All members of the class are seniors and will soon graduate with social work degrees. One student describes an event at her practicum agency, concluding with the statement, \u201cI felt like such a retard\u201d.4) At the grocery store, a mother and son are in front of me in line. The son is pacing and counting to himself, not causing any trouble. He seems to be around ten years old. The mom sees me looking at him, leans toward me, and whispers, \"he\u2019s autistic\u201d.  I understand she is used to being judged, and does not necessarily mean to indicate that this is a terrible secret. I tell her I am autistic, too. She glares at me, pulls her son closer, and whirls around to face the front of the store.5) I am working on a paper with an autism professional I know. In the first paragraph, she describes a time early in her career when an autistic man explained to her why he found person-first language inappropriate to discussions of autism. \u201cI am an autistic man\u201d, he told her. She goes on to talk about how other autistic people she knows are helping her to learn more about respect and self-determination. Throughout this same paper, she has used the term \u201cperson with autism\u201d no less than twenty times.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/09/call-my-bluff.html", "title": "\nCall my bluff\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 14, 2007", "body": "\nOnly recently, I discovered, through a link at Amanda's blog, the odd and irreverent, often disturbing world of the website passiveaggressivenotes.com. The point of this site is to post those notes found in workplaces, apartment buildings and other shared spaces, directing others on how to behave in a more civil manner. Often the notes are things that really do need to be said, but being aimed toward specific persons, might best be said more directly. Commenters rate the notes for originality and scrutinize them for grammar, style and spelling errors. Whether or not a note fits even the site's very generous definition of passive aggression is a frequent topic of debate; often the person who contributes the PA note to the site is deemed more PA than the note's writer.My fascination with Passive Aggressive Notes has much to do with my own, admittedly often indirect, style of communication. Much of what I say in this blog might better be directed at the individuals who have offended. Sometimes I do that; sometimes I don't. Sometimes I rationalize that the message is needed by many people beyond just the one who has recently said or done something prejudiced or otherwise offensive. The likelihood that I am correct in this belief does not negate the fact that I have also rationalized, especially if I have not directly confronted the person who said for example, \"that is so retarded!\" And at times I have not.As a person who communicates far better in writing than through the more popular spoken word, I often give myself a pass on this one. Whether or not this is an accommodation I truly need or a passive aggressive act varies from one situation to another, depending on  factors only I can adequately judge.

{"date": "Sunday, September 16, 2007", "body": "\nThis is what happens. We meet. I don\u2019t talk much. For a long time, I say hardly anything and when I do it\u2019s cryptic or odd to you. After a period of time, probably months, I start to say more things, but the things sometimes are even more strange, and now there is chirping and trilling and repeating. Here and there you may recognize a line from a very old movie or TV show. Then comes a period of time where I seem much more \u201cnormal\u201d to you with less chirping, less repeating. Even my jokes make sense during this time. And then it\u2019s over, and back to Gilligan\u2019s Island and the birdhouse.Let me break that down:Phase 1. Quiet.Phase 2. Less quiet, more odd.Phase 3. Less odd with variable quietness.Phase 4: Less quiet, more odd.This is how some people interpret that:1. You are shy.2. You are shy, but getting used to talking to me. You are nervous due to the shyness, so you behave oddly.3. You are over the nervousness. You are finally okay and we can relate like regular people.4. You don\u2019t like me anymore. You are being as annoying as possible to push me away. Why don\u2019t you just tell me it\u2019s over?Or it can be seen this way:1. You are shy2. You are really weird, but that\u2019s okay with me.3. You understand it\u2019s not okay to be weird all of the time. You are making the expected efforts to fit into society and this is good. This is what a person of good character does.4. You have \u201cdecided\u201d you are autistic, even gone so far as to get a diagnosis. Now you don\u2019t care about fitting in anymore. You are using this as an excuse for bad behavior. Why don\u2019t you just grow up?This is how it looks from the inside:1. I don\u2019t know why it is, but I\u2019ve never been comfortable talking. Some days it takes all my energy just to say a little. I am almost never able to communicate what I actually mean by speaking. I am surprised you are even still trying to have this relationship with me. Most people give up after one conversation.2. This is part of the way I relate to the world. Sometimes the repetition is a means of communication, sometimes the chirping is my way of expressing happiness. If I am doing these things around you, I am starting to get comfortable with you. If you accept me at this stage, you may have a friend for life, but if you get angry or ask me to stop, I will know that I will never be able to truly relax and be myself around you. It\u2019s okay either way. I am not so invested in this friendship yet that rejection will hurt very much.3. You are still here? That\u2019s great. I appreciate that you like me for who I am. You know what? I can sometimes have what appears to be a normal conversation. If I am well rested and not stressed, I am more likely to be able to do this. There are lots of factors that play into this. The medicine I take for depression made a difference for a long time. Not so much now, but that\u2019s fine with me, that\u2019s not what it\u2019s for anyway.4. It has been a while, I understand so much more about myself and my communication style than I did when we first met. I have found that there are other people like me, too. I am autistic. Don\u2019t worry, though. I am exactly the same person I have always been. I can take care of myself better now that I understand I am not a defective person. I have to play the \u201cnormal\u201d game a lot at work, but when we are just hanging out, I can be myself and relax, right? Right?

Is there a regular time of day when you compose your posts?I tend to write early in the morning or late at night. If I\u2019m working on something visual, that could be any time of day, but words are harder to come by in the afternoons.2. Do you prefer to write a certain number of posts per week (or per month)?Prefer to, yes. I like to make three or more posts per week, but have failed at that a lot lately.3. Are you more likely to write a post when you're happy about the topic, or do you mainly blog when you feel like ranting?It\u2019s more based on what I see, either what others are writing or things in my immediate environment. It\u2019s always great to find positive things, and I do write about these when they happen. Few people seem to take an interest in that. The last post I wrote about something I appreciated got two comments. Angry posts seem to resonate with more readers. None of this affects the balance of positive vs. negative subject matter, though. I write what I see going on, and my reactions to it.4. Do you write from notes or an outline, or are your posts mostly spontaneous?My posts are not of the type which require outlines. I enjoy reading blogs of a more scientific bent, full of long quotes, citations and well constructed arguments. That kind of writing is a lot of work and I very much appreciate the writers who take the time to do it. This probably has a lot to do with my still being in school and required to write a number of formal papers. While I enjoy doing that, my blog is for relaxation as well as advocacy. It\u2019s a quick snack as opposed to a meal. Sometimes the snack is candy and sometimes it\u2019s celery.5. Do you try to maintain a central theme for your blog and avoid random topics that don't fit the theme?This question is probably the reason I\u2019m responding to this meme. There are a couple of things I\u2019m working on figuring out about this. I started Asperger Square 8 with the intention of writing about autism, autistic advocacy and my particular obsessions (including rectangles and the number eight). I never intended to adhere to a strict interpretation of advocacy. But, I find I have written lately very little about squares, eight and my other obsessions. I don\u2019t post as many of my drawings and photos as I did in the beginning. And I hesitate to include my more stream-of-consciousness or \u201coff topic\u201d writings. \u201cOff topic\u201d by whose definition? To write what I think I\u2019m supposed to write, what kind of advocacy would that be?Naming the central themes of my blog is easy. The questions I am struggling with as the blog matures are more complex, questions of range and scope and questions of purpose. Can I include some poetry here? What is my relationship to the larger disability community and culture? For whom am I writing this stuff?6. Are there any interesting rituals associated with your blogging?Obsessing about things, drinking coffee, sometimes rocking a little. Same as anything else I do. Which I guess means \u201cno\u201d.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/09/randomness-and-meme.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/09/blogging-meme.html", "title": "\nBlogging meme\n"},

The person in question is a regular reader of this blog, someone I\u2019d come to see as a friend. I didn\u2019t know she had this life, the one I had once expected to be mine. In a matter of seconds, I had gone from a reasonably happy person certain I\u2019d finally found my place in the world to a total wreck, filled with envy and regret. I had clearly wasted my life.What happened during those hours yesterday morning and into the afternoon was that I didn\u2019t get my work done. Now I have more than I can finish today. A beautiful late summer/early fall day passed by with barely a nod from me. I forgot, just briefly, how to appreciate the many worthwhile, even perfect things that surround me. I also decided that writing Asperger Square 8 was a big waste of time. I quit this blog.Returning to my senses, I realized once again what a gift acceptance is. Rarely do I take these vacations from reality, bitterly rejecting the truth of my existence, cursing myself for not having been otherwise, squandering the energy I need for useful work, blaming the universe for not having delivered everything in just the sizes, styles and colors I had ordered. I wasn\u2019t wishing to be non-autistic, but I might as well have been. Some twist of fate or some personal defect had to be blamed. Blamed for what? I had only imagined that anything was wrong.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Rum_ZovByNI/AAAAAAAAA5g/JXCyUTJlEt0/s1600-h/moleskine.4colorpen.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-i-became-quitter.html", "title": "\nHow I became a quitter\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, September 25, 2007", "body": "\nI got in trouble not long ago for repeating things (repeating things). What does it mean to \u201cget in trouble\u201d when you are an adult? I didn\u2019t have to sit in the corner, I just got the silent treatment (yes, I noticed it!) and later was told I had hurt someone\u2019s feelings. I was sorry when I found that out, but not for the behavior (repeating things). The \u201cbehavior\u201d was my participation in the conversation. It was not appreciated, not being standard. I was very much enjoying the conversation, or what I had thought was conversation, but must have been more like a turn-taking monologue. Instead of being overly offended at the rejection of my contribution, I tried to see it as the sort of thing that could happen if a word in one language sounded too much like a word in another language one was more familiar with. She might have thought I had called her an expletive, when all I had said was \u201cplease pass the coriander\u201d. Or maybe I mistook something like a performance of classical music for the call and response of jazz. It made me very cautious for a few days, quieter than usual.The problem with this, of course, is that I work very hard to speak the language of the majority. Most of the time, I do this, using \u201cordinary\u201d speech to ask questions, make comments, solve problems. This other \u201cbehavior\u201d of mine, this forced (by me) conformity, takes its toll in exhaustion, frustration and knowing that the person most people see me to be has very little to do with the way I perceive myself.In order to do at least the minimum society asks of me, I offer up my best facsimile of \u201cnormal\u201d speech throughout the work day. In return, some of the things I receive are: being told I don\u2019t really mean what I say, being told what I do really mean, having my sentences finished by others, having my comments ignored, having people walk away while I\u2019m still talking and a variety of other \u201cbehaviors\u201d, few of which make the job of talking easier. Last week I was treated to an impromptu \u201cdance\u201d with a person who was determined to force eye contact, despite knowing I\u2019m autistic. Needless to say, I don\u2019t remember what that conversation was about.Is it really too much to ask that non-autistic people make the effort to include us? To be sure, I have people in my life who make this effort, but there seems always to come a point where they \u201cjust can\u2019t take it anymore\u201d and tell me to \u201ccut it out\u201d or \u201cact normal\u201d just for once. A point at which I realize that what I had taken for acceptance was something else, tolerance at best. I understand that. I feel the same way about their behaviors sometimes, the endless stream of chat, the debriefing after every minor event. Only guess what happens if I point out how annoying this type of speech can be? Yep. Wrong again. Rude autistic behavior. Some people never seem to get it.  That\u2019s why I was sorry. This shouldn\u2019t be so hard.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/09/maybe-ive-said-this-before_25.html", "title": "\nMaybe I've said this before\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 17, 2007", "body": "\nThe New Yorker magazine this week (August 20, 2007) features a personal history by Tim Page, a fifty-two year old Pulitzer Prize winning music critic for the Washington Post. In the six page article, he talks about a childhood spent memorizing the World Book Encyclopedia, spinning records on the phonograph and seeking out adults who would listen to his lectures. He discusses his teachers\u2019 and parents\u2019 frustrations at the young \u201cgenius\u201d who failed classes and couldn\u2019t consistently distinguish right from left. He tells about finding his calling in music and writing, and about falling in love. He talks about having been given credit for \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d, without having realized there was a box to begin with. If you are not already a New Yorker reader, this one is well worth picking up.In one of my favorite passages, Page describes a powerful connection to certain things:What anguished pity I used to feel for pi\u00f1atas at birthday parties, those papier-mache donkeys with their amiable smiles about to be shattered by little brutes with bats. On at least one occasion, I begged for a stay of execution and eventually had to be taken home, weeping, convinced that I had just witnessed the braining of a new and sympathetic acquaintance.This touches on an aspect of autistic life I don\u2019t hear much about. Sometimes a \u201ccomfort object\u201d is more than an object. To call such things \u201cfriends\u201d is not a hyperbole or metaphor; I have known such friends. I remember a particular hematite crystal, purchased for less than five dollars, which I wore around my neck every day for maybe three years. Chosen for a variety of symbolic reasons, it acquired more and more meaning as I kept it with me through a troubled time in my life. After losing it, I was inconsolable. I still miss the Beany doll who was my childhood companion, still remember the exact spot on his cheek where the color had rubbed away. Like it was yesterday.Yes, I realize even non autistic people feel this way at times about jewelry or stuffed toys. Like the pi\u00f1atas (I also have a history with these), a broken rocking horse, discarded by a neighbor, rescued by me and not so much loved by the rest of the family was at least \u201cunderstandable\u201d as a friend. A friend with a face on it, like Thomas the Tank Engine, is within the acceptable bounds for affection, even for adults. It\u2019s the other kinds of \u201cfriends\u201d autistic people make that I really want to talk about. Tea kettles, for example. Hammers, potholders, that sort of thing.As a young adult, I stocked shelves at a Kmart store; my section was cleaning supplies and pots and pans. The cheap enameled metal tea kettles, in almond, harvest gold and avocado, were often dented during shipping or through mishandling by customers. It was my sworn duty to discard these items and record their cost in a book to account for the loss. Instead, I hid them behind other items in the stockroom, promising myself I\u2019d throw them out \u201clater\u201d. Of course, later never came and the collection grew larger, as the year\u2019s end approached, when they were sure to be discovered during the annual inventory. The kettles were on my mind a lot during the months before the inventory. I visited them less often, out of guilt, I suppose, but was comforted by their presence nevertheless. Returning after two days off, I peeked behind the boxes of cookware and saw the empty space between the cartons and the wall. The tea kettles had been \u201ctaken care of\u201d by a co-worker who wanted to protect me from the manager\u2019s anger, as I was about to be found out. It had to be done, I understood that, but I felt sick. I think I went home early that day.I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to translate what these objects mean into terms accessible to others who have not had these sorts of relationships with things. I started to make the effort here, but I\u2019ve changed my mind. It should suffice to say there are things I love that some people do not understand. They are a part of who I am. That should be enough. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newyorker.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beany_and_Cecil"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/08/thing-about-things.html", "title": "\nThe thing about things\n"},

{"date": "Monday, June 29, 2009", "body": "\nThe first thing you notice is the fruit. Huge bowls overflowing with grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, watermelon, blueberries, strawberries, lit by the morning sun. The contrast with the usual conference fare of bagels, pastries and small anemic fruit plates sets the tone for the entire event. There will be little \u201cjunk food\u201d here, little talk of an epidemic and what could be causing it. Participants have come to learn more about how to understand and support autistic people. How to listen to different voices, how to think about differences in ways that nourish and enrich human lives.In the auditorium, I am greeted warmly by Dr. Anne Donnellan and Martha Leary. They have brought a gift from Australia, a companion for Squawkers McCaw. They point out the autism-friendly green room just off the stage, inviting me to make use of this space when I need time away from the crowds. Long before my co-presenters, Steve and D\u2019oC have arrived, I am among friends.I settle into my chair to listen to the first presentations of the conference. I hear that nearly everything commonly said to be true about autism is based on the observations of non-autistic people. Motives are attributed to observed \u201cbehaviors,\u201d interventions are designed based on these interpretations, each step moving further away from the reality of autistic experience. Built upon this \u201cinvented knowledge\u201d are a number of lucrative fields for \u201cexperts.\u201d Yes, this is a problem, one which can only be solved by learning to listen to those who have direct experience of autism.Most of those in attendance are educators. They are attentive, eager to participate. Each session could easily have been twice as long; there are so many questions. Relevant questions. Thoughtful responses. Two rows ahead of me, a woman types every word she can catch into her laptop. The typing is loud, but I know she will carry important thoughts away with her to share with others. I have a little book with me for drawing squares, and this helps make the sounds of the keyboard go away. Later, before Nan Negri\u2019s session, she asks for anyone with sensory sensitivities to speak with her. She wants to warn us that loud music and noise will be used in some of her activities. She wants to know what accommodations we might need for this. She will let us know when something is about to happen, in case anyone needs to leave.At one of the breaks, a woman approaches me and says how happy she is to see Squawkers. My daughter carries a Spongebob everywhere\u2026I know from a comment she made earlier that her daughter is twenty years old. I know from the way she looks at me that she does not see this as a problem. Throughout the days of the conference, I have several interesting discussions about parrots. One man tells me about the Amazons that live at Ocean Beach. He has seen macaws flying over this campus several times throughout his years in San Diego.Early Friday morning, Steve, Do\u2019C and I take the stage to discuss autism blogging and a variety of issues important to the three of us. The audience cheers as Steve reads the conclusion of The Best Story Ever. Do\u2019C asks some questions of the group. Who here has a child on the autism spectrum? Would you be willing to stand up and say that your child is not broken? One after one, they do this, with increasing intensity and conviction. The room echoes with the voices of women and men expressing pride in their children. Like any other parents.They gasp at the depictions of autistic children as soulless and tragic. These sounds are important to me. They mean that the images are shocking and inexplicable, not necessary and matter of course as some would have you believe. They laugh at the idea that I am \u201cnot really autistic,\u201d or entitled to a voice, as I have sometimes been told by others. They are as puzzled as I am that ideas like understanding and acceptance of differences have proven so controversial. After the presentation, a young woman, one of the teachers in the group, comes to the stage. I have been hiding, she tells me. She has not told many people about her diagnosis, she has been told that a \u201clabel\u201d could only make her life more difficult. Nodding toward Squawkers, she asks me, Do you ever let anyone\u2026Yes. I place him in her arms. I have an animal too, she says. Later, she will bring him in from the car. She will join the panel session, speaking openly from the stage about her experiences as an autistic woman. Many others speak to me\u2014the teacher who took off (for good, she promises) a puzzle piece necklace during the presentation, the mother who wept because she has searched for ten years for someone to agree with her that her son is an acceptable human being and did not need to be fixed.They ask me to continue. They want to know more. I am happy for this, but unable to say much. I go to the quiet place for a long, long time. There will be a question and answer period this afternoon. There will be more time, another break, another bowl filled with apples, bananas, cherries and plums. Again, I am refreshed and revived by the spirit of acceptance at the core of USD's Autism Institute. As always, I will leave here with so much more than I brought to the table. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Skkp0dOBgnI/AAAAAAAACYI/AVTKEN8CJzw/s1600-h/king.jpg", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/06/way-beyond-awareness.html", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=344", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2007/10/best-story-ever.html", "http://www.sandiego.edu/soles/centers/autism_institute/conferences/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/06/what-happens-in-san-diego.html", "title": "\nWhat happens in San Diego\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 7, 2009", "body": "\nMany changes suggested by commenters have been incorporated. Items on employment and education have been added. Some items have been combined to make room for other points that had been overlooked. The introduction has been expanded to clarify issues around the words \"privilege\" and \"neurotypical.\" A link to an article on confronting privilege has been added. Headings have been included to facilitate easier reading.This is intended as a semi-final draft, and is still open to modification as needed. Please discuss any concerns in the comments section. As with the other posts on this topic, attempts to derail the discussion are not welcome, and will be deleted. A Checklist of Neurotypical PrivilegeSince its publication in 1988, Peggy McIntosh\u2019s essay, White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack, has come to be seen as a standard tool for examining the often unacknowledged advantages conferred on the white majority. The article has since been adapted to reflect the advantages of many other majority groups, spawning lists of straight, thin, cisgender, class, (temporarily) able-bodied and other forms of privilege. As far as I know, the advantages of being neurotypical (having a neurology that roughly corresponds to societal expectations) have not previously been listed in a systematic way, with the goal of encouraging a similar analysis. This explains the genesis of this list, but not its reason for being. As autistic adults, we have often found ourselves excluded from organizations claiming to speak for us. We have been told that our thoughts and experiences are of no value in general discussions of autism. Autistic adults who dare to speak openly on topics related to autism are often treated with condescension, ridicule and disdain. Autistic children are restrained in isolation rooms, bullied not only by peers but by teachers, while some of us have been told this is not our concern. Autistic adults are tasered by police for their communication and movement differences. Every year, autistic children and adults are murdered for no reason other than their neurology. A life in which a person can be fairly sure these things will not happen to her/him is a privileged life. Having one\u2019s views taken seriously on these subjects is another example of privilege. Autistic people are not the only ones affected by neurotypical privilege. Neurodiversity is a broad concept, including the entire range of human experience. We recognize that people labeled with ADD, ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, and a multitude of other conditions considered disorders by society also experience marginalization. However, this list was constructed by autistic people and allies, and will surely fall short of addressing neurotypical privilege as it impacts other groups.Additionally, the authors of this list acknowledge that the term \u201cneurotypical\u201d has been identified as problematic, since even persons who may not have a specified neurological difference may not see themselves as \u201ctypical,\u201d and that there is technically no such thing as a \u201ctypical\u201d brain. We understand\u2014and celebrate\u2014that every single individual is complex and unique. We have chosen \u201cneurotypical\u201d precisely because of its neutrality\u2014it is neither positive nor negative. This is not the place to entertain long discussions about the perceived implications of the term. Those discussions only serve to derail conversations about truly vital issues, such as exclusion, abuse, torture, and murder.In compiling this list, we have been acutely aware that the topic of privilege is one many people find hard to digest. For anyone who has not come across the concept before, or who feels that he or she does not fully understand what it means in this context, I highly recommend reading the original McIntosh article in its entirety before beginning the list of neurotypical privilege presented here. For those who find themselves feeling defensive upon reading, you are not alone. For most of us, this is a necessary part of the process of acknowledging and understanding privilege. Here are a few basic things to remember about privilege:Privilege is not your fault. It is an artifact of systems that favor some people over others, systems that have evolved naturally to meet the needs of the majority, but have failed to provide adequate accommodations for those outside it. For more information on understanding and confronting privilege, please see this link. Privilege is not, in itself, a terrible thing. Having any form of privilege does not make you a bad person. Just about everyone has some form of privilege. No, that doesn\u2019t mean it all somehow \u201cbalances out.\u201d A person can have, for example, white privilege, male privilege, class privilege, and heterosexual privilege, while still lacking neurotypical privilege. Likewise, not all autistic people have had the same experiences; other forms of privilege can act as a cushion against many of the harsher realities endured by those who belong to multiple disenfranchised groups.The statement that privilege exists is not an accusation or attempt to blame. It is an invitation to see your experiences and the experiences of others in a new light. It is not an admonition to change the world, but a simple tool with which to begin considering if, possibly, some changes might be worth working toward.Checklist of Neurotypical PrivilegeSafety1. I have never been told, because of my neurology, that I am incapable of feeling pain.2. If I have a medical problem, I do not worry that my doctor will dismiss it as part of my neurotypicality.3. When attempting to purchase health insurance, I know that I will not be rejected because I am NT.4. If I am bullied or abused, people will not assume that my neurology means I am at least partially to blame, or that the abuse would stop if I tried harder to behave like someone else.5. I can assume that police officers will not become alarmed at my natural body language and find it necessary to subdue me in advance of any wrongdoing.6. I do not have to carry a special card or bracelet with me to explain my natural body movements or the sounds I naturally make.7. I am not considered more dangerous and more likely to commit a crime because of my neurology.8. People of my neurology are not generally considered burdensome to our families or to tax-payers.9. Nobody will murder me because of my neurology.10. If I am murdered, my murderer will not be let off because my murder was deemed \u201can act of mercy,\u201d or given a light sentence because of the stress caused by interacting with me.11. I do not have to fear that important decisions about my life will be made by others who are considered more qualified based on their neurology.12. I am not expected to accept seclusion rooms, restraints, or neuro-enhancing drugs as conditions of my educational experience.Inclusion13. For a child of my neurotype, everyday teaching of the skills they will need to live in this society is called education or parenting\u2014not therapy, treatment, or intervention.14. If someone of my neurology can do something well, I will not be punished for being unable to do the same thing well or at all.15. People do not constantly tell me that I need to work on the things which I am very bad at, at the expense of things which I am good at and enjoy doing.16. People who have power over my education will probably not decide that, instead of receiving the academic education most of my peers receive, it would be best for me if my time in school were spent learning non-academic \u201cskills.\u201d17. I can reveal my neurology to my boss and coworkers without fear of losing my job.18. I can ask for technical or social support on the job without being seen as a troublemaker or charity case.19. People do not automatically assume that the best place for me to live is an institution.20. The majority of people who make the laws of my nation share my neurology.21. The services that I need to survive not only already exist, but even if I use those services on a 24-hour basis, I will still be considered independent.22. When I need help performing a particular task, I can ask for help without having to produce documentation to prove I actually need help with it. The help will most often be provided in a manner I can understand, and will not be considered an inconvenience or an act of pity.23. No one sees my neurology as being in need of elimination or cure.24. If I am visibly upset, people generally assume something must have upset me, and will generally try to help me.25. People do not suggest that groups that are made for the benefit of people of my neurological type be led and ruled by people of a different neurological type, because mine is seen as inherently incapable.26. I have never had to take a single test that determines, for my entire lifetime, whether I get to communicate.Relationships27. My family, friends, and significant others are not told that I am incapable of relating to other human beings.28. If I am an adult, I can be a sexual being without the assumption that any partner attracted to me must be a predator or pedophile.29. I am never told that I should not have children lest I pass on the genes that cause them to share my neurological type.30. No one speculates about whether I am competent to raise children based solely on my neurology.31. People do not assume that living in the same household as me is inherently \u201ctragic\u201d or \u201cdevastating,\u201d or that my family, friends and partner will need a support group to deal with living with me.32. I will not be asked to leave a public place, or to change where I live, because people are uncomfortable with my neurotypical behaviors.33. If I am unhappy, people do not automatically assume my unhappiness is the result of me being who I am.34. My opinions on social mores and societal issues are not dismissed based on my neurology or on the assumption that I am incapable of understanding how these things work. Likewise, my gender identity and sexual orientation are not discounted because of my neurology.Respect35. I expect people to presume intellect and competence with me.36. If I fail, most will encourage me by telling me that I will ultimately succeed.37. If I fail to understand autistic people, this is attributed to a deficit inherent in autistic people rather than in me.38. If I have a particular talent or ability, I can demonstrate that talent without being called an \u201cidiot savant\u201d or my talent being called a \u201csplinter skill\u201d or some other demeaning word.39. The definitions of rude and irritating conduct were developed by and for people with my neurology.40. I am not praised for acting less neurotypical or punished for acting more neurotypical.41. I am not expected to alter or suppress my natural ways of moving, interacting, or expressing emotion in most circumstances.42. If I fail to alter or suppress my natural ways of moving, interacting, or expressing emotion, I do not fear public ridicule or exclusion because of this.43. When prospective parents and others speak of wanting a \u201chealthy child,\u201d I know that they mean a child like me.44. People don't accuse me of grandiosity or derisively dismiss it if I suggest that some admirable historical figure might have been neurotypical.45. It is considered good for people who are not like me to try to act more like me.46. My natural movements and traits are not used by my peers to ridicule others of their neurological type, either jokingly or maliciously.47. I am never told that the fact I have a certain cognitive skill means that I am lying when I say I lack another cognitive skill. Nor am I dismissed as incapable of things I truly can do because I lack certain cognitive skills.48. I can discuss my interests at length without this being viewed as a \u201csymptom.\u201d49. When I communicate, people do not gather in crowds around me and gawk.50. My behaviors, abilities, and skill levels at age 2 or 3 are considered indicative of an immature phase of life that will pass naturally, not as representative of my prognosis for the rest of life.Definition of termsMajority: The dominant group.Minority: (1) A racial, religious, political, national, or other group thought to be different from the larger group of which it is part; (2) A group having little power or representation relative to other groups within a society; (3) a member of one of these groups.Neurotypical: (1) Having a type of neurology that is expected and/or favored by the society in which one lives.

{"date": "Sunday, June 7, 2009", "body": "\nII have never appreciated the dynamics of group friendships. I have been able to have satisfying one-on-one interactions sometimes, with some people, in some situations. But until very recently, I had not been able to participate in groups. Sure, I could be there physically, but that is very different from participating. For years, I never said much, and most people assumed that this meant I was shy or had nothing to say. My comments, when I did make them, often came across as odd or \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Of course I understand the reason for this now. To communicate well with one person requires a large expenditure of energy on my part, and a great deal of patience from the other party. Even in these one-on-one conversations, I am often left behind. For each additional person added, the energy drain and frustration increase as I try to keep up.The time it takes me to process another person\u2019s words and then formulate a response in words of my own is probably about four times as long as for the average person. This means that by the time I am ready to make a comment, it often seems no longer relevant. Far easier to remain quiet than to try to make the comment and also explain that it applies to something said a minute or two back. Then comes the dreaded point where someone realizes I have not said anything in awhile. What do you think about this, Bev? This person is trying very hard to include me. I appreciate that. I do. But I will disappoint her just about every time with a blank stare or a quickly cobbled string of words that has little to do with what she thought was the topic. Alternately, I will interrupt and talk over people, trying too hard to get a thought out. This is considered rude, of course, and I don\u2019t mean to do it. It\u2019s another expression of the same processing issues. I have experienced many conversations in which interrupting was the only way I had a chance to speak. For most of my life, being in groups of people has made me feel very alone.IISquawkers has two brothers now. They are cockatiels, Dylan and Brubeck. Deciding to adopt these birds took me a long time. Did I have the time to devote to a parrot (or two) who would require daily interaction with me? Could I ever know enough about birds to keep them safe and happy? Could I afford the food and toys and other enrichments and veterinary care they would need to be healthy? But these were not the real questions, and I knew it. While I talked about their vulnerability, it was my own I feared. Loving them would open a place in my heart that had never been touched. I wasn\u2019t sure I could stand it.IIIYears ago there was a flock of people I wanted to join. God knows why, but at the time, it seemed important to prove I could do this. The flock had a leader who liked to claim she was not the leader. She continued to argue that what everyone else saw was not true, and nothing ever changed, and she continued to orchestrate all the group\u2019s activities. To earn one-on-one time with the flock leader, a situation in which I could communicate well, I was required to attend gatherings of the larger flock, a situation where my participation was impossible.During these gatherings, I had many opportunities to reflect on my issues with people in groups. My struggles with finding a way to be included were not all about speech processing time. One incident that stands out in my memory involved the group watching TV in a restaurant. The TV was showing one of those home video shows where people make mistakes while other people film them so that many more people can be entertained with the mistake-makers\u2019 incompetence. In this episode, people were slipping on ice. It\u2019s a popular theme with these shows, people falling down. Everyone at the table laughed, except for me. This went on for several minutes. The more painful the fall appeared, the louder the laughter at the table. A deep sense of unreality set in. I didn\u2019t see anything funny about it, and I didn\u2019t understand why I was supposed to pretend, or how I had broken the social contract. I didn\u2019t know at the time that I was supposed to lack empathy.IV Does he talk? This is the first question people usually ask when someone adopts a parrot. Some cockatiels can learn words and phrases, others never do. There are a lot of variables, including the amount of time you work with them, absence or presence of other birds, variations in natural abilities, motivation to bond with humans. Brubeck knows how to say \u201cHello,\u201d and seems to be working on a few other words. Dylan speaks in quiet little chirps most of the time. Both of them communicate very well, letting me know when it\u2019s time for us to gather as a flock, when they are happy or angry or nervous, and when they want me to change the TV station (they don\u2019t like Law and Order or CSI or anything else that might include police sirens). Learning their language has not been too difficult. Sure there are things I don\u2019t understand, but I understand enough.Does he talk? This is the wrong question. The birds enrich my life by teaching me their ways, not by learning mine. Of course they don\u2019t mind if I repeat myself, which is nice. Cockatiels are creatures of habit, too, preferring the same foods and routines over and over. Preferring sameness and repetition. Resistant to change. Somewhat like me.VSeven times seven is forty-nine. This has been a favorite bit of echolalia for quite awhile. I\u2019m not sure why, other than that it is a square number. Seven times seven is forty-nine has a strong and confident rhythm, and states a fact that will never change. Cannot be argued with. It is. It is. At the age of forty nine, I have small groups of friends I am comfortable with. It has taken me a long time to learn to do this, but that is okay. The course of development in autism can be unpredictable. I worry when I hear people say He will never do this, or She will always need this same type of support. There are many things I could not do at 6 or 16 or 36 that I can do now. Ten years ago, I would have sworn that my degree of comfort with groups now would never happen. That my current way of being was impossible.I learned things I needed to know from the laughing flock. While my ways remained foreign to them, I learned about theirs. Part of what I know now is to choose friends more carefully. The friends I have now take time to listen to me. They notice the signals that I am ready to speak. They leave a space for me without making a big deal of it. There are no leaders in these groups, and that helps. The things we do together are somewhat structured, including predetermined activities and/or a clear time frame. I laugh a lot with my friends. Usually, nobody cares if I laugh too loud or too long or at the wrong time, or fail to laugh at a joke I don\u2019t understand. No one seems to think it is funny when someone gets hurt. I can wander off to be alone for a few minutes. When I come back into the room, I know that any incidental laughter is not at my expense.IVParrots in the wild are trapped by unscrupulous traders who first take one parrot as a decoy to attract others. Parrots are fiercely loyal to their flock mates, and will nearly always come to the rescue of the decoy, who is nailed to a branch or entangled in a net and crying for help. They are easy marks for the trappers. Many wild parrots are injured and many die before ever being exported into the pet trade. Those who live are sold to breeders who keep them in tiny, filthy cages, or pet stores who pass them on to buyers who think they might look nice in the corner by the sofa. When the bird turns out to be noisy, demanding and messy, she is often abandoned, passed from home to home, finally euthanized or released into a world she is unable to navigate safely. Meanwhile some species are on the verge of extinction. The story of the parrot trade is terribly sad.VIOne of my human flock is terribly sad. Her beloved cockatiel, a treasured companion for nearly eleven years now, is dying. I don\u2019t know how to help her. I have never been good at comforting. People like me have been said to lack empathy because we don\u2019t say the right words or offer the right hugs at the right times. I have learned to do some of that stuff too, but I don\u2019t do it naturally or consistently. People like me have been said to break the hearts of our family members because we are \u201ccold.\u201d Destructive groups like FAAAS claim that getting too close to an autistic person can cause mental and physical illnesses. Easier to blame, I guess, than to learn how to listen to the language of autistic empathy. The pain I feel for the impending loss of this little bird, Sugar Franklin, although I have never met her, is deep. I have known her mom less than a year.Yesterday, our flock gathered around her. We talked about Sugar, but not a lot. We ate lunch and talked about our lives, even laughed a bit. Squawkers McCaw was there. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said. We were on our way back to the car, his face was turned away from the group. Though nobody heard, it was part of the conversation.  Updated 9/30/2009: Rest In Peace, Sugar Franklin. I am glad you had a few more happy months here with us. You will always be remembered.

{"date": "Friday, July 31, 2009", "body": "\nMany thanks to all who have contributed to the working document on neurotypical privilege. Because I want this to be accessible to as many people as possible, I would like to make it available through autistics.org, ASAN's website, and any other site that would like to use it. While a few people have already weighed in to advocate for keeping the entire list (at this time 261 points long!), others have remarked that it becomes hard to read at a certain point. I believe that 50 items is about the maximum for ease of reading and comprehension. I have made an attempt at a first edit by choosing those items I believe best illustrate the core concept of NT privilege. The document will be open here for review for a period of one week. Everyone who has contributed, or would like to contribute will have the opportunity to critique the list, and to make arguments for including other points. Those items which receive multiple votes or especially well reasoned arguments will be given extra consideration. The longer list will remain here, and will be linked from the sidebar for easy access.Suggested questions for discussion:Which points from the unedited list (not included in this one) are most important to you, and why?Are there points on this list you would choose to remove in favor of others?Would the list be equally effective with 60 points? More than that?Does the document need a different title? Someone has suggested that \"neurotypical\" be replaced with \"neuroconvergent.\" Personally, I am not fond of the term \"neurotypical,\" as I think it lacks accuracy. However, it is a term many people have become familiar with, and I hesitate to introduce a less familiar term. I don't see \"non-autistic\" as a good choice in this case, either. Suggestions, anyone?Note: While civil dissenting opinions are generally welcome at Asperger Square 8, I will not be allowing comments on this post that deny the validity of the overall concept of neurotypical privilege, or in any way attempt to derail the discussion. Thank you for understanding.The Checklist of Neurotypical PrivilegeSince its publication in 1988, Peggy McIntosh\u2019s essay, White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack, has come to be seen as a standard tool for examining the often unacknowledged advantages conferred on the white majority. The article has since been adapted to reflect the advantages of many other majority groups, spawning lists of straight, thin, cisgender, class, (temporarily) able-bodied and other forms of privilege. As far as I know, the advantages of being neurotypical or neuroconvergent have not previously been listed in a systematic way, with the goal of encouraging a similar analysis.This explains the genesis of this list, but not its reason for being. As autistic adults, we have often found ourselves excluded from organizations claiming to speak for us. We have been told that our thoughts and experiences are of no value in general discussions of autism. Autistic adults who dare to speak openly on topics related to autism are often treated with condescension, ridicule and disdain. Autistic children are restrained in isolation rooms, bullied not only by peers but by teachers, while some of us have been told this is not our concern. Autistic adults are tasered by police for their communication and movement differences. Every year, autistic children and adults are murdered for no reason other than their neurology. A life in which a person can be fairly sure these things will not happen to her/him is a privileged life. Having one\u2019s views taken seriously on these subjects is another example of privilege.In compiling this list, I have been acutely aware that the topic of privilege is one many people find hard to digest. For anyone who has not come across the concept before, or who feels that he or she does not fully understand what it means in this context, I highly recommend reading the original McIntosh article in its entirety before beginning the list of neurotypical privilege presented here. For those who find themselves feeling defensive upon reading, you are not alone. For most of us, this is a necessary part of the process of acknowledging and understanding privilege. Here are a few basic things to remember about privilege:Privilege is not your fault. It is an artifact of systems that favor some people over others, systems that have evolved naturally to meet the needs of the majority, but have failed to provide adequate accommodations for those outside it.Privilege is not, in itself, a terrible thing. Having any form of privilege does not make you a bad person. Just about everyone has some form of privilege. (No, that doesn\u2019t mean it all somehow \u201cbalances out.\u201d)The statement that privilege exists is not an accusation or attempt to blame. It is an invitation to see your experiences and the experiences of others in a new light. It is not an admonition to change the world, but a simple tool with which to begin considering if, possibly, some changes might be worth working toward.Checklist of Neurotypical Privilege1. My family, friends, and significant others are not told that I am incapable of relating to other human beings.2. I have never been told, because of my neurology, that I am incapable of feeling pain.3. For a child of my neurotype, everyday teaching of the skills they will need to live in this society is called education or parenting\u2014not therapy or treatment.4. People do not constantly tell me that I need to work on the things which I am very bad at, at the expense of things which I am good at and enjoy doing.5. I can reveal to my boss and coworkers that I am neurotypical (NT), without fear of losing my job.6. If I am an adult, I can be a sexual being without the assumption that any partner attracted to me must be a predator or pedophile.7. I am never told that I should not have children, lest I pass on the genes that cause them to be like me.8. No one speculates about whether I am competent to raise children based solely on my neurology.9. People do not assume that living in the same household as me is inherently \u201ctragic\u201d or \u201cdevastating,\u201d or that my family, friends and partner will need a support group to deal with living with me.10. If I have relationship problems or get divorced, people do not automatically assume that my neurology was the sole or main cause for these problems.11. People of my neurology are not generally considered burdensome to our families.12. People of my neurology are not generally considered burdensome to tax-payers.13. Nobody will murder me because of my neurology.14. If I am murdered, my murderer will not be let off because my murder was deemed \u201can act of mercy,\u201d or given a light sentence because of the stress caused by interacting with me.15. People do not automatically assume that the best place for me to live is an institution.16. If I am bullied or abused, people will not assume that my neurology means I am at least partially to blame, or that the abuse would stop if I tried harder to behave like someone else.17. If I have a medical problem, I do not worry that my doctor will dismiss it as part of my neurotypicality.18. When attempting to purchase health insurance, I know that I will not be rejected because I am NT.19. The majority of people who make the laws of my nation share my neurology.20. I can assume that police officers will not become alarmed at my natural body language, and find it necessary to subdue me in advance of any wrongdoing.21. I do not have to carry a special card or bracelet with me that explains my natural body movements or the sounds I naturally make.22. The services that I need to survive not only already exist, but even if I use those services on a 24-hour basis, I will always be considered independent.23. When I need help performing a particular task, I can ask for help without having to produce documentation to prove I actually need help with it. The help will most often be provided in a manner I can understand, and will not be considered an inconvenience or an act of pity.24. If I fail to understand autistic people, this is attributed to a deficit inherent in autistic people, rather than in me.25. If I have a particular talent or ability, I can demonstrate that talent without being called an \u201cidiot savant\u201d or my talent being called a \u201csplinter skill\u201d or some other demeaning word.26. The definitions of rude and irritating conduct were developed by and for people with my neurology.27. I am not praised for acting less neurotypical, or punished for acting more neurotypical.28. I am not expected to alter or suppress my natural ways of moving, interacting or expressing emotion in most circumstances.29. If I fail to alter or suppress my natural ways of moving, interacting or expressing emotion, I do not fear public ridicule or exclusion because of this.30. I will not be asked to leave a space, or to change where I live, because people are uncomfortable with my neurotypical behaviors.31. When prospective parents and others speak of wanting a \u201chealthy child,\u201d I know that they mean a child like me.32. No one sees my neurology as being in need of prevention, treatment, or cure.33. People don't accuse me of grandiosity or derisively dismiss it if I suggest that some admirable historical figure might have been neurotypical.34. It is considered good for people who are not like me, to try to act more like me.35. Even if I completely lack a conscience, I am automatically considered less dangerous than autistic people.36. My natural movements and traits are not used by my peers to ridicule others of their neurological type, either jokingly or maliciously.37. I can assume that most restaurants, theaters, stores and other places I would like to go will not be so loud or brightly lit or crowded that I will become unable to function at a basic level.38. My behaviors, abilities, and skill levels at age 2 or 3 are considered indicative of an immature phase of life that will pass naturally, not as representative of my prognosis for the rest of life.39. I am never told that the fact I have a certain cognitive skill means that I am lying when I say I lack another cognitive skill. Nor am I dismissed as incapable of things I truly can do, because I lack certain cognitive skills.40. I can discuss my interests at length without being seen as strange or obsessive.41. If I am visibly upset, people generally assume something must have upset me, and will generally try to help me.42. If someone of my neurology commits a crime, people do not automatically assume I am more likely to commit a similar crime.43. If someone of my neurology can do something well, I will not be punished for being unable to do the same thing well or at all.44. If I am unhappy, people do not automatically assume my unhappiness is directly caused by my neurology.45. People do not suggest that groups that are made for the benefit of people of my neurological type be lead and ruled by people of a different neurological type, because mine is inherently incapable.46. I expect people to presume intellect and competence with me.47. If I fail, most will encourage me by telling me that I will ultimately succeed.48. I do not have to fear that important decisions about my life will be made by autistic or other non-neurotypical people, just because I am neurotypical.49. I have never had to take a single test that determines, for my entire lifetime, whether I get to communicate.50. When I communicate, people do not gather in crowds around me and gawk.Definition of termsMajority: The dominant group.Minority: (1) A racial, religious, political, national, or other group thought to be different from the larger group of which it is part; (2) A group having little power or representation relative to other groups within a society; (3) a member of one of these groups.Neurotypical: (1) Having a type of neurology that is expected and/or favored by the society in which one lives.

{"date": "Thursday, January 28, 2010", "body": "\n Frustrated by an autistic student who had fallen down, Akron school aide Ingram Myers dragged the young man \"50 to 100 feet\" by his ankles through the school hallway. This is not the first time Myers has been investigated for harming a student. In 2004, he was accused of striking a high school student, and was subsequently transferred to his current position. He has been placed on paid leave pending investigation of the January 14 incident involving the autistic child.\"I really want to see that this aide is not only removed from the school district but from his place of employment,\" Powers-Fabian [the student's mother] said. \"Something should be done criminally so that they're (sic) something on his record so that he cannot work with this population in a school district.\"Who is to blame? According to Kim Stagliano at Age of Autism, well, of course, you know...autism...is to blame. \"As the numbers explode,\" she writes, \"expect more horror stories of abuse and neglect.\" She is certain the solution to such actions is to eliminate autism. Protecting autistic children from harm is as simple as removing the behaviors associated with the disability. Isn't it?Minority populations have always been vulnerable to abuse by those intolerant of difference. Take away autism (as if that were even remotely possible), take away the behaviors that make a person autistic (problably some annoying person would still fall down), and abusers will easily turn to another target. For the record, I disagree not only with Stagliano's position, but with Ms. Powers-Fabian's assessment as well. It is not enough to protect \"this population\" from violent acts perpetrated by unethical authority figures. All human beings deserve better.\"Blaming the disability\" is no more than \"blaming the victim\" dressed up in charity model clothing. The issue here isn't autism. The issue is the abuse of power, and how this abuse is supported and enabled by views asserting, however covertly, that some people are less worthy, less valuable than others. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/S2HYErm9iHI/AAAAAAAAChA/dlY1gKgoLI8/s1600-h/INDEED.jpg", "http://www.theautismnews.com/2010/01/28/akron-school-aide-placed-on-leave-after-allegations-of-assaulting-autistic-student/", "http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming", "http://www.sinnlos.st/help/eng/help1.htm"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/01/blaming-autism.html", "title": "\nBlaming Autism\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 1, 2010", "body": "\nI Consider the square who wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t say hello. Circles continue to believe that the square has failed to communicate. The square is further excluded. Next time, maybe, no one will say hello to the square. The circles might create a mythology wherein the square inhabits its \u201cown world,\u201d oblivious to the rollings around of the circles. Some will want to rescue the square, others to vilify. To a larger group, the square is simply invisible.This is only the starting point of one set of consequences. The square does not live in some separate world, but in the circular world, where majority rules. If an action (or inaction) is deemed to mean certain things, if most shapes have agreed upon the meanings, this becomes a thing elevated to the status of \u201creality.\u201d The square notes that not saying hello equals rude, indifferent, uncaring. Less capable, less intelligent. What are the other qualities and behaviors that go with these concepts? How can the square go about completing some sort of package that would make sense to other shapes, perhaps becoming visible again, a part of \u201creality?\u201d IIThere was a time when I didn\u2019t say much. I didn\u2019t know that I could. The spaces where words were to go were never big enough for me to find out. Interrupting was said to be rude. There was the sleeping air traffic controller, never on duty to say which thought had permission to land. They circled, crashing invisibly as they ran out of fuel. What was left was a texture or pattern. My hand reached again for brick or corduroy. Evidence.I had nothing to say; the information was not yet in words. It took many years to learn how to participate. A big part of it, still, is being willing to ask for the time, and I don\u2019t always do that. Slower still means less capable, silence still looks like indifference. The people who care most about me intend to include me. I know this. Sometimes a person or group will show acceptance of my rhythms, responding casually and without agitation to the \u201cirrelevant\u201d comment I offer several minutes after the subject has passed. It cannot be expected that this will always happen. IIISome people are talking. I scribble on the piece of paper what I intend to say.IVSometimes I have been able to work around the control tower issues through writing. Writing has always been easier, I have always said that written English is my first language, spoken English being a distant second. I never quite achieved fluency. What about the times when I don\u2019t write? Who am I then? I hear things. I hear that this blog is closed and that I have given up. I wonder if this is true. It could be true. This is not a new story, yes I\u2019ve said this before. Sometimes the forms of communication that work best shift and crumble under my feet. Sometimes ways of expression are lost, maybe forever. This is a familiar pattern, one I have always known. Some months of writing followed by nothing. This latest absence was just the longest one that has happened in a semi-public space. VSeveral people are in a room, mooing. The ones who are not mooing may be embarrassed by this, I don\u2019t know, but no one is saying to stop it. I am comfortable here. Later we will talk about the movie and mooing. I will tell them that there are many points on which I don\u2019t agree with the movie\u2019s subject, Temple Grandin. One of the non-mooers will promote Grandin as a role model for all of the mooers and I will want to discourage this. When the time comes, what the non-mooer says is that Temple Grandin had many fears but she never gave up. I say how loud the fan blades were. VIThe conversation goes on without me. Some people write to ask if I am okay. I don\u2019t really know what to tell them. If I no longer write, then I am not who I thought I was. What other characteristics go with this package? I don\u2019t know how to answer.The blades turn and the air whispers. It is in the air that people who fly are not quite autistic. People who travel on planes, drive cars, attend college, have jobs are called \u201cshiny.\u201d Meanwhile, more autistic people are dying. Another child is murdered, another adult beaten, another trapped in a van and left to die. If I tell my rectangular stories, it is in the hope that someone will understand that silence does not equal indifference or irrelevance. Silence is not the opposite of communication. My voice, when present, is not meant to replace anyone's voice.VIISometimes the squawk is all there is. Voluntary? Involuntary? I always get asked. I squawk for many reasons. Sometimes it is a way of staying engaged until I know what else I have to offer. Sometimes I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m squawking.The conference was not autism friendly. I\u2019m sure they tried, and everyone was polite and engaged and appreciative, but directions to the location were sketchy at best. I arrived to find that the workforce development event I had agreed to speak at had been titled \u201cBehind the Mask.\u201d Shiny, glittery decorations were on every table and wall. Mardi Gras masks. I sat down, overwhelmed and confused and waited for someone to welcome me. And then I told stories of employment and squawking and answered the usual questions. I wanted to tell them there was no mask. I hadn\u2019t been wearing one, hadn\u2019t removed some mysterious facade to show the human shivering behind it. I didn\u2019t come from a separate world. There was no secret to reveal, only the value of accepting and appreciating differences. Everyone knows that by now, right? Is there anything left for me to say? I don\u2019t know. Sometimes the squawk is followed by other sounds, sometimes it isn\u2019t. VIIII should have said this before. I\u2019ll say it now, then. Squawk. Squawk. Squawk. Squawk. Squawk squawk squawk squawk. That\u2019s it. For now, that\u2019s all I know. \n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/11/squawk.html", "title": "\nSquawk?\n"},

When it becomes commonplace to pair the words autism and tragedy, the pairing seeps deep down into the collective mind. When the puzzle piece becomes the recognized symbol for autism, the message comes over and over that there is something unfinished about the person. Something mysterious that the general public cannot be expected to understand. Now when someone hears \u201cautism,\u201d tragedy echoes in the background. Puzzlement reverberates. This one is not like the others. This one is out of our range of understanding and compassion.\n\n\n\nSomebody calls my request for respectful language and symbolism \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d Although this respect exists barely anywhere, it is portrayed as enforced, and therefore something that must be rebelled against. Somebody gets the bright idea to light buildings up blue for awareness. Everybody is more aware of the tragedy and the mystery and otherness. Nobody asks autistic people what this might mean for their futures.\n\n\n\nShe wants a job, but the employer has heard that people like her are prone to violence. She wants to live on her own, but she carries the luggage stickered with claims of eternal childhood and helplessness. She needs a communication device, but someone knows this is pointless because she is empty. Someone has heard things. Out of frustration, she bangs her head. Somebody takes this as evidence,\u00a0now she is locked away. \n\n\nSomewhere else, another child has been diagnosed with autism. He is forced to drink bleach, drowned in a bathtub, or smothered to death. This is the true meaning of tragedy. The voices are crying for understanding, not for the murdered but for their killers. The difficult, difficult lives they have led, autism is to blame. A puzzle piece is affixed to another bumper, the\u00a0enigma of autism advertised, along with the pleas for an end to it, spewing out into the air as someone else\u00a0drives on into the darkness.\nThis post is offered for Blogging Against Disablism Day in honor of Katie McCarron\u00a0(2002-2006). \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sPNCnhFarT8/T5__OidZBHI/AAAAAAAAAAg/aNPHbawr_5s/s1600/BADD.png", "http://disabledfeminists.com/2010/02/13/what-is-splainin-and-why-should-i-care/", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2012/05/blogging-against-disablism-day-2012.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2006/06/katie-mccarron/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2012/05/badd-connecting-dots.html", "title": "\nBADD: Connecting dots\n"},

Other challenges will be more difficult. \n\n\n\nTo participate, leave a comment whenever you have accepted a\nchallenge. Let other readers know how it went or what you did to fulfill the\nmission. You will score one point for each challenge you complete.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 6, 2009", "body": "\nCanine Advocates Urge Removal of Pomeranian, Shih Tzu, Others from the Dog Spectrum Should all dogs be considered equally doglike? Well known canine advocate Darrell Hogarty doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cPeople who live with some of these smaller breeds have become too vocal,\u201d he explains. Hogarty believes that the enthusiasm of small dog aficionados obscures the problems of real dog owners. \u201cThey claim they can live in apartments and condos. The general public is starting to think that dogs like my Rotweiller don\u2019t need large fences to keep them from bolting.\u201d What\u2019s worse, Hogarty says, is that the claims of small dog owners that food costs and training needs are manageable may keep the owners of real dogs from receiving the services they need.People are starting to think that dog ownership is some sort of \u2018cutesie club.\u2019 It\u2019s anything but that,\u201d adds the canine advocate who prefers to be known only as WTF. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I have anything against them. I have a toy poodle myself, but I can tell you he\u2019s no dog! My Saint Bernard goes through a large bag of Purina Dog Chow each week. Who can afford that?\u201dPoop is a major problem for the owners of real dogs, too. Canine advocates point to the statistics or rumors indicating that nearly 80% of canine affected marriages fail due to arguments over whose turn it is to scoop the yard. \u201cI\u2019d like to invite any of these diversity loving types to come over and give my dog a bath,\u201d declared WTF. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see the Dawgz R Lovely crowd lining up to give it a try, do you?\u201dThose who prefer keeping small dogs as part of the spectrum are quick to point out that the Chihuahua\u2019s bark can be as disturbing as that of a Weimaraner. Small dogs sometimes bite, too, explain diversity advocates, some of whom reject the words \u201cpet\u201d and \u201cowner\u201d in favor of more radical terms like \u201ccompanion.\u201dClaims that size shows no correlation with ease of training do not impress Hogarty, for whom defining a dog is a simple matter. \u201cIt\u2019s just common sense. Is it bigger than a dirt bike? Can it be used to scare people? That\u2019s a dog.\u201dHogarty adds that removing these smaller, cuter breeds from the current definition of \u201cdog\u201d could go a long way toward solving the canine overpopulation problem. \u201cOf course their numbers should still be counted when new pounds and shelters need to be built,\u201d he added. \u201cWe ought to get some use out of them, eh?\u201d************All kidding aside, there are many dogs and other animals in need of homes.

{"date": "Thursday, March 19, 2015", "body": "\n\nYou want awareness? Here are some things to think about.\nAutistic people are at extremely high risk for unemployment and\nunderemployment.\u00a0 Some of us have a hard\ntime getting jobs or even interviews due to differences in social interaction\nstyles. \u00a0Others have been shunted into\nsheltered workshops where they are paid wages that would be illegal if the\nworker did not have a disability. Some of us have been beaten down by a\nlifetime of being told we were worthless. \u00a0When we get a Nickel and Dimed type job, we\nare grateful, sure it\u2019s the best thing that could have happened. \n\n\n\nI stayed at Kmart for fifteen years. I couldn\u2019t imagine my\nway out, not having gone to college, not having the sorts of skills employers\nlooked for. I never would have lasted so long had it not been for a manager who\nnoticed that I was very efficient at sorting things. She saved me from the\nsales floor where constant customer interactions threatened to tear me apart,\nand found me a place in the stockroom where my tasks revolved around organizing\nand categorizing. While my coworkers haphazardly unpacked items and threw the\nindividual packages on carts, I did my best to make the job of the shelf\nstocker easier by sorting the many brands of aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen\nonto separate shelves of the rolling cart. Lining them up in perfect rows. \n\n\n\n\u00a0In the stockroom, I\nwas in a good position to notice when certain items began to pile up. One\nsummer, there were more than 30 cases of orange and black wrapped peanut butter\ncandy. These were left over from last Halloween, waiting for October to roll\naround again. Sometimes the overstock wasn't the merchandise manager\u2019s fault.\nSome special sale items were sent as \u201cgeneral orders\u201d by the home office.\nPeople who had never been to our state would make decisions about what we could\nsell. A lot of this stuff was made of wicker for some reason. It was dusty and\nit smelled bad. Then there was the \u201cDollar Days\u201d merchandise. \u00a0Dollar Days was the big sale that came only 2\nor 3 times a year, with lots of things nobody needed priced at 2/$1.00, 3/$1.00,\netc. Markup on these items ranged from 25% to 400%. Half of the gadgets and\ndoodads were probably broken and thrown away within a month. \n\n\n\nWhenever we had too much of a particular cheap and useless\nitem, an associate would be required to roll out the blue light and announce a\nsurprise sale. There was a strict script for the Blue Light Special: \u201cAttention\nKmart shoppers, for the next 15 minutes in aisle X, we are having a Blue Light\nSpecial on Y!\u201d Then the light would start to strobe while making a sound like\nThing from the Addam\u2019s Family when the mail came, casually putting people at\nrisk of epileptic seizure for the sake of commerce. The clerk would stand by\nwith the pricing gun, ready to label each chosen item at its new temporary\nprice as customers rushed over to see what the fuss was about. \n\n\n\nIn those years, when Kmart lit it up blue, most people\nwalked away with nothing for something, a scratchy t-shirt, mildewed dish towel,\nstale candy, a wicker tchotchke. Nothing they wouldn't survive. The excitement\nof blue lights flashing and other customers swarming must have seemed worth the\ninevitable letdown when the toy broke on the way home. Everyone who worked\nthere knew that while bargains could sometimes be found at the store, those\nitems that made it to blue light status were well beyond redemption. \n\n\n\nThe Blue Light Special Autism Speaks (also beyond\nredemption) will run all through the month of April, is not so harmless. If you go to this sale, the\ngap between what you are buying and what you meant to purchase will be more\nextreme. \u00a0Most people still seem to think\nthey are helping autistic people by supporting these \u201cawareness\u201d efforts. But\ngroups like Autism Speaks have cheapened the very concept of \u201cawareness\u201d to the\npoint that many self-advocates cannot stand to hear the word. Autism Speaks has\ndiscounted autistic voices for many years now, refusing to hear us when we have\nsaid that their dehumanizing tactics are harming us. \n\n\n\nPlease try something different this year.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you go to your local Light it Up Blue event, this will\nhappen: You will feel the rush of excitement that comes from moving in the same\ndirection as the others. You will listen to speeches affirming what you already\nbelieve. You will purchase a shirt or a button or something and believe that\nthe profits are going to benefit autistic people. You will feel good about\nyourself because everyone there will be saying that you are doing it right.\u00a0Autism Speaks will use the money to finance its next awareness campaign or its\nnext PSA claiming that our existence is tragic, pay its exorbitant salaries,\nand fund the research they believe will put an end to autistic people. People\nwill continue to look at us with fear and pity. Autistic people will continue\nto be unemployed or underemployed. The research requested by autistic people\nwill continue to go unfunded. Autistic people will continue to be shocked at\nthe Judge Rotenberg Center. Autistic people will continue to be murdered by\ntheir caregivers. Nothing will change. \n\n\n\n\nIf you continue to lend your voice to the already huge and\npowerful and non-autistic run Autism Speaks, the things actually autistic people\nhave to tell you will continue to be shouted over. What we have to say will continue\nto be ignored because we are so Not Like Your Child, the one who will maybe work\nat Kmart someday, the one who will struggle so hard to believe they could ever do better.\u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Nickel-Dimed-Not-Getting-America/dp/0312626681", "https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Autism_Speaks_Flyer.pdf", "http://www.autistichoya.com/2013/11/an-unholy-alliance-autism-speaks-and.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2015/03/blue-light-special-on-awareness-in.html", "title": "\nBlue Light Special on Awareness in Aisle 5\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, December 13, 2009", "body": "\nOne must make an appearance. This is the holiday party, an open house, with visitors to the office, with foods you would never make at home, broccoli casserole, sausage balls, apple stack cake, standard holiday fare in this part of the country. Accidentally, I\u2019ve blocked myself in. I will have to ask the man next to me to let me out. People are chewing in the noisy way people do, and talking about\u2026well, I never know. A favorite childhood memory, one is asking a man who grew up in another country. This sounds like an interview but there is a subtext. I know this because she told me so. The others at the table are saying something about sports, then politics, then television, then Christmas decorations. I can\u2019t keep up. How many minutes? I eat the small sandwich, and wrap up another one for later. No one is talking about work. I don\u2019t know how\u2026Except that sometimes I do, its own kind of problem.Sometimes I fit in (almost). Confusion ensues.The room is swarming with syllables. It sounds likeI\u2019ve never known broccoli. Not in the noisy way. Ask the one there, interviewing the table. Who grew? Tell me the other casserole subtext. The sandwiched minutes, then memory, then television, all stacked. Someone visited Keep, or planned to prefer decorations in the small sportsway. Another standard, accidentally blocked. But you would never know how many. She told, all open apperance. Next, at home, as in another country, childhood, work.The stories sounds make in the room are about something like a parallel party. It exists, I promise you. Imagination and real life are not separate things. For several weeks I have thought about the meaning of things. Of college. I meant to say years. There is a way of talking, a way of writing, another standard. There is a way of blocking the others, and not accidentally, which makes succeeding its own kind of problem. The reasons for being on one side or the other often have more to do with privilege than character or intention. I meant to say university. What types of responsibility are implied?This is called \u201cliving in your head\u201d or \u201cbeing in your own world.\u201d But the door is open, at least sometimes. You read too much. There are thinkers and doers. That\u2019s what she said. Participation was thought to consist of playing, which was defined by someone else, and in the adult world participation means working when it is time to work, and not at the other times, and there are rules about this which constantly shift and no announcement is made.On \u201cplay,\u201d the shapes and colors fall into patterns of threes, disappearing in bursts and electrified lines. A game played alone, but also with others, at great distances. Who is excluded? Anyone who lacks a computer and/or internet access. A broadband connection is also necessary for speed, for getting the best scores. Anyone without sufficient hand-eye coordination to make the game worthwhile. Anyone without at least one fully operational (standard) hand or assistive equipment to compensate. Primarily, the poor and the disabled. Surely there are others I haven\u2019t thought of too. This is the nature of privilege, taking some work to see it.Academic writing is another kind of game. There are rules that must be observed, there are scores. To play, one requires access to an extensive library online or otherwise. Access is granted with employment by or enrollment in an institution of higher education, or with a large sum of money, or with physical location near a good library and considerable time to spend there. In any case, time is needed, free from activities required for survival. The basic needs for food and shelter must be met. It is easy to see how frivolous or impossible, how absurd it might all look without these conditions fulfilled.One is saying a lake in Tennessee. One is recalling a holiday play about fighting. Two are debating the merits of reality television. I have a thought or two on these. The time to say it has passed. Lately, my favorite shows are about competition between chefs and people who can\u2019t throw anything away. There is a fictional show I should mention, but that could come later.Now it is time, and he understands the caged look, letting me go.How many minutes? Five. Something like five.Apple cake. What was that person thinking, eating, not talking, then saying two words, apparently at the wrong time, drawing a curious stare in response, standing in the middle of things, walking in circles, leaving, gone? This is the question I\u2019ve answered that nobody asked. Back in my office, I work on a proposal until I am calm and focused. I build a case based on exclusion and the right to participate. After awhile, I return with Squawkers McCaw. We visit each table, he wishes coworkers and guests a good season. Most everyone here knows him well. It is an excellent workplace and I am happy here most of the time. Fully included. I signify this with a series of chirps and trills. Several people chirp back. Seven, I think.

Maybe you think \u201cpride\u201d has to reflect some\nsort of accomplishment. If that is the case, then what right have we to be\nproud of something we haven\u2019t worked for? \n\n\n\nFor more than half of my life, more days than not, I wished\nI were dead. At sixteen, books about suicide lined my shelves. I knew I would\ndo it one day. The reason was shame. I was, in too many ways, not like the\nothers, somehow broken. I heard it at home and at school. I overheard it at the\ndoctor\u2019s office and in the shops. I didn\u2019t have to work for shame, it was just\nmine.\n\n\n\nWhen I talk about pride, I mean that I survived.\n\n\n\nI have had the opportunity to meet a lot of young autistic people.\nSo many of them hate themselves. They have been placed in segregated\nclassrooms. They have been subjected to hours of \u201cnormalizing\u201d therapies. They\nhave rarely heard anything positive about autism or being autistic. They have\nseen themselves represented by puzzle pieces. \n\n\n\nI wonder what is on their shelves. \n\n\n\nI wonder if any of them sneak into their parents\u2019 room and\nhold a loaded gun to their heads while watching in the mirror. Getting used to\nit. Wondering when. Do you think my parents ever knew or suspected? \n\n\n\nWhen I talk about pride, I mean to tell every one of them, there is nothing wrong with you. You are as valuable as anyone. It is okay to\nflap. It is okay to pace, to rock, to repeat, to communicate in whatever way\nworks for you. You are not broken. Not broken. Not broken. Not broken.\n\n\nWhen I talk about pride, I mean as in lions. How we need a\ngroup of others like us, to support us, help us grow, show us the way. \u00a0It takes a lot more than one voice to push\nback the blue light brigade (\u201cbroken, broken, broken,\u201dthey say.) That\u2019s why I pick up the pride flag. I wave\nit. I roar.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2015/04/why-autistic-pride.html", "title": "\nWhy Autistic Pride\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 15, 2009", "body": "\nHello. I\u2019m Squawkers McCaw, and I am a Sibling of Neurotypicality. While my brother Durwood is the one officially labeled with the disorder, I am here to tell you that the entire family is affected. The impact is especially evident this time of year. Like many NTs, Durwood shows signs of regression and acting out around the holidays. These are technical terms, and I\u2019ll leave it to you to look them up. Let me explain what I\u2019m squawking about\u2026 To most normal birds like me, every day is about the same. Sure, I get a little excited when I think about getting the trench coat I asked Santa to bring me, but that just means that I repeat the words \u201ctrench coat\u201d quietly to myself while rocking back and forth. Durwood, on the other hand, has issued a long list of demands, and while he believes in the superstition that being extra \u201cgood\u201d will increase his chances of receiving piles of toys, electronic gadgets and gift cards, his ability to be good decreases with each day as the 25th of December draws nearer.Last night, Durwood went to a Christmas party while I stayed home and read a book about British soldiers in World War I, who were the first to wear trench coats. I was so relieved that I didn\u2019t have to go the party, but I felt bad for my brother. When he came home, he had new toys with him (they all make noise!) and a new list of things he says he will need because, \u201ceveryone has them.\u201d It seems that the $100 LookSilly slate blue sneakers he had to have just last month are now \u201cbogus\u201d and will need to be replaced by the new LookSillier version in cobalt. He also reported that last year\u2019s eight wheeled skateboard is now \u201cso not cool\u201d and that he will require the Older But Newer brand Beaky Lasek model. He acted like he was on something (probably sugar), nearly foaming at the mouth as he recalled every detail of the party, including haberdashery habits, courtship behaviors, and the forms of music related movement rituals performed.It is because of Durwood that bells are hanging everywhere. Every time someone opens the door, I startle; it can take quite awhile to get back to work on my research. Humphrey Bogart wore a trench coat in Casablanca. Also, there is a tree inside our house! It smells\u2026well, like something that should be outdoors. When I step on a pine needle in the middle of my own living room, it feels like I\u2019m being stabbed with a knife. These things don\u2019t bother Durwood; he has sensory deficiencies. To make room for the tree, the humans here moved the sofa 8 inches closer to the door and rotated it 22.5 degrees. It is hard to be comfortable in a place where such meaningless novelties are tolerated.Worst of all, a neighbor brought by something called a fruitcake last week. I was told I had to try a piece to \u201cbe polite\u201d but I don\u2019t think the neighbor was impressed with my manners when I gagged and then regurgitated on her new coat. It was not a trench coat, but I still had to go to my cage for the rest of the night. Durwood got away with wadding his piece up in a ball and throwing it at the wall. It was so playful, so \u201cjust like a neurotypical kid\u201d they said. Sometimes I do resent the special accommodations he gets. Just sayin\u2019.As you can see, these behaviors take a toll not only on parents who must bear the burden of additional expenses, but on normal siblings like me who need peace and quiet to study the advantages of single versus double breasted trench coats. As far as other gifts, please don\u2019t bother. I like the things I\u2019ve always had. They comfort me. This is the end of the holiday letter.Squawk,S. McCaw\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SyfR8m87d2I/AAAAAAAACfg/sizSEHyrecM/s1600-h/squawkletter.png"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/12/siblings-of-neurotypicality-suffer-most.html", "title": "\nSiblings of Neurotypicality Suffer the Most: A Holiday Letter from Squawkers McCaw\n"},

{"date": "Friday, September 25, 2009", "body": "\nIf you are a reader of blogs about autism, you have seen your share of comments denouncing the views of self advocates around the web. Sometimes they are personal attacks on autistic people. Many rehash the same tired \"Not Really Autistic\" meme or promote urban myths about the causes of autism. Most feed pervasive stereotypes of one sort or another. Still others are so vile I won't describe them even obliquely.Most readers of this blog tend to be civil and capable of using reason to make their points. However, if you are someone who enjoys being abusive toward autistic self advocates and those who support their goals, you just might be wondering\u2026What kind of troll am I? Here is a survey so scientifically valid, it is sure to be linked from AoA ASAP.What Kind of (Autism) Troll Am I?1. My favorite tactics for engaging in an internet argument are:a) Logic and reason.b) Self pity and demands.c) Cursing and YELLING.d) Libel and Terroristic Threatening.2. My definition of autism is:a) A broad spectrum of conditions evidencing differences in communication, social behaviors and repetitive behaviors or intense restricted interests.b) Limited by the characteristics I see in my own child.c) A tragedy, a kidnapping soul stealer, a monster or a train wreck.d) Mercury poisoning!3. I often visit the blogs of writers I strongly disagree with because:a) I believe it is important to learn about a variety of viewpoints.b) Someone needs to help them see how wrong they are.c) I do my best to make them look foolish.d) These people are not entitled to speak. Only I know the truth about autism.4. When I read a post I disagree with:a) I go to my own blog and write about the issue.b) I jump right in and correct the person\u2019s mistake! For example, \u201cI know you think you have been discriminated against, but as the parent of someone like you, only more so, I can assure you that you are wrong again!\u201dc) I know the person who wrote it is a liar. He/she is not even autistic!d) I litter the comments section with swear words and insults. They deserve it!5. My response to someone who asks for respect is:a) I guess my input isn\u2019t needed here.b) What are they talking about? I said \u201cperson with\u201d autism, didn\u2019t I?c) What about me??? When do I get respect???d) You are an &*)#ing &%^#! and you mother is *&#@*!6. My child is different from the bloggers on the Hub because:a) The writers on the Hub are all adults.b) My child is autistic! Not like these fakes!c) I don't have children, I have a real disability.d) My child has no abilities or skills whatsoever.7. No matter how many times you tell me, I will never believe that:a) People can be so rude.b) You see autism as a disability.c) Neurodiversity means recognizing a the full diversity of neurotypes as valid human presentations.d) Autism Hub blogs are not financed by Big Pharma, the earth is round, and people have landed on the moon.8. Which of these comments best exemplifies your writing style:a) \"I strongly disagree with your viewpoint!\"b) \"I'm sorry if it hurts your feelings, but autism is not some silly little clique as you obviously think it is.\"c) \"People like you are depriving everyone else of the cure they deserve.\"d) \"Shut up, you dumb @*^#.\"Scoring: Total your responses for each letter. Are they mostly in one category or another? If so, your identity has been revealed! See below for details. Otherwise, you may find that you are a combination of trolltypes or belong to a category not listed here. Either way, don't bother leaving an offensive or libelous comment here. It will be promptly deleted.Bettroll: Bettroll doesn't mind calling a self advocate any disgusting name he can think of, and may even threaten the lives of those who are too vocal in their self advocacy. Believes autism is an injury that can be cured, but this takes around 75 years. Answers mostly (d).Lurtroll: This one claims to be silent while speaking loudly and carrying a big chip on his shoulder. Uses phrases like \"you people\" liberally. Claims to know everything about his favorite bloggers from diagnostic labels to what brand of toilet paper they use. Demands ever more personal information while hiding behind pseudonym. This may be you if most of your answers were (c).Nottroll: When disagreeing with something, this person is civil about it. His or her comments are rarely deleted or disapproved by blog owners. If you chose mostly (a) answers, you are probably not a troll.Agritroll: This troll arrives with hoe in hand, ready to dig in the dirt. Some might think she is preparing the soil for new crops. Don\u2019t believe it. Is that a shovel in the back of her pickup? She comes to bury self advocates in her generous piles of manure. If the (b) responses best describe your trolling, this one may be you.Disclaimer: These trolls are semi-fictional. They are not generally recognized diagnostic categories (though some have been proposed for inclusion in DSM V).\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Sr2NgN28vQI/AAAAAAAACdE/JfZ7ABty-5U/s1600-h/agritroll.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/09/what-kind-of-troll-am-i.html", "title": "\nWhat Kind of Troll Am I?\n"},

I have been openly queer most\nof my life and openly autistic since I found the name to describe my\nneurological differences. I also recognize that there is a load of privilege in\nthis. There are people for whom passing as non-autistic is never a choice.\nThere are also those who pass in order to protect their jobs, families, or even\ntheir lives. It is not for me to decide that everyone should be \u201cout.\u201d I do\nbelieve that changes in societal attitudes will emerge from the recognition\nthat we are here in the families, communities, and workplaces alongside the\npuzzle wearing crusaders. I do believe that it becomes more difficult for\npeople to unthinkingly proclaim that autism should be eradicated when faced\nwith the reality that this person would not exist in such a world. \n\n\n\nThink of this as less of a challenge, then, more of an invitation.\nBe autistic in public.

Be yourself.\n\n\n\nIf you are not autistic, think about the things you do that\nsoothe you. Do you twist your hair? Click your pen? Tap your foot? Talk about\nthe weather?

{"date": "Saturday, July 11, 2009", "body": "\nNeighbors, the new video from Autism Speaks, calls for an end to \"autism insurance discrimination.\" Exactly what this might mean is unclear. Certainly there is discrimination to be addressed. I have heard stories of people denied basic medical coverage because of an ASD diagnosis. The video states that \"all children who need medical care deserve the same coverage. The same applies to adults. No one should be denied care because of a disability. The nature of the \"medical care\" implied here is another matter. While I agree that all medical conditions should be covered for all, the implication that autism itself is a medical condition for which there are standard \"treatments\" is troublesome. More discussion of the video can be found here and here. I found watching Neighbors with the sound turned off a more interesting and valuable experience.  In the first scene, two boys, both autistic, sit on the grass in their respective yards while a group of children plays.Jason plays with a handheld video game.  Jack also seems to be playing a game.One of the group approaches Jason and asks him to play.Jason plays with the other children. But no one has invited Jack. He turns his head to watch the other children playing. Is he indicating he would like to play? He is at the very least showing interest in what the group is doing. He expresses frustration, clenching his fists.The story I see reveals the importance of inclusion. Each of the boys seems to choose a solitary game over the group activity. One is invited, encouraged to join in. The other is not, and becomes unhappy. It is a very simple, and very important story. Like many autistic people, Jack and Jason are willing to interact with others, but may have trouble initiating. In Jack\u2019s position, I would not be able to tell whether or not I was welcome to join the others. I might not even be sure the others could see me. Personally, I would prefer to remain on the lawn with my video game, but knowing that you are welcome is important. Growing up \u201cinvisible\u201d is confusing and damaging.Of course, the story Autism Speaks is promoting is a different one. Due to his family's insurance coverage, Jason has had the therapies he needed. Jack has not. Yet left to their own devices, each sits alone. Their actions are identical, until one is noticed and included. There is no evidence whatsoever that Jack would not also respond to being invited into the group. But if he does prefer to be alone, as I did at his age, as I often still do, must this be seen as a tragedy?Do the other, presumably non-autistic, children sense that Jason will be a better playmate than Jack? Have they heard their parents saying that Jason is \u201crecovered\u201d from autism? That Jack has been given a \u201cdeath sentence?\u201d Nah\u2026most likely, they are just looking for one kid, any one kid, to even out the teams. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://diversityrules.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/07/more-misleading-images-of-autism-displayed-by-autism-speaks.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2567", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SlieUXI8xfI/AAAAAAAACZk/jKQkMIC27U0/s1600-h/Image2.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SlieJGlCMEI/AAAAAAAACZc/HxPCAVDs0tg/s1600-h/Image3.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SlieIKUwc4I/AAAAAAAACZE/vroPZdqlGPE/s1600-h/Image5.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Slid1VICcNI/AAAAAAAACY0/E9UW5s6YU3E/s1600-h/Image7.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Slid1GaxrzI/AAAAAAAACYs/kv06_JPBq5A/s1600-h/Image8.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/Slid09fN1II/AAAAAAAACYk/wy3sQjvIp9g/s1600-h/Image9.jpg", "http://diversityrules.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/07/more-misleading-images-of-autism-displayed-by-autism-speaks.html", "http://gonzogalore.blogspot.com/2009/07/death-sentence.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/07/silent-neighbors.html", "title": "\nSilent Neighbors\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 19, 2009", "body": "\nI have one friend who likes to say \u201cno\u201d when we are out with Squawkers and someone asks the usual question. Is he real? She grows anxious, seeing someone step out of the way of his not really powerful beak, or hesitate starting up the car for fear of startling him. Another friend once mispronounced the word Karaoke, and is now afraid to say it. Today, we are seeing off two other friends on a road trip to the Northwest in a Flying Green Pea. Doodles serves shrimp and grits and beignets and French press coffee, but that isn\u2019t what I have ordered. The place fills up fast with people and noise, and when I have finished my huevos rancheros and fruit cup, I\u2019m ready to go.This building used to be a filling station. The hand dryer in the restroom (you have to go outside to get there) blows harder air than expected, and I spend a few seconds letting it whistle through my fingers. The tune it plays is Refrigerator Door. Two of the people with me will know at least some of the words. Staying put is a talent we share. Then I am back at the table, and her father comes in and we haven\u2019t spoken, not once, since the thing I did (bad) years ago. Hadn\u2019t I just mentioned\u2026no. Something else. Something else like it. Remember.Sometimes, driving in hard rain, the old lines show through clearer than the new. I turn off the radio, slow way down, and promise myself I\u2019ll replace the windshield wipers soon. Once I drove with windows so fogged, I could see nothing. I should not have had a license, I always thought that, but my father was insistent. He taught me how to watch for other people, always on the verge of making a terrible mistake. He taught me how to fill the car with gas, at the Shell on Harrodsburg Road. For several years, I bought all my gas there. Returning to the south side of town from wherever I noticed the tank was low, I knew it was not that different from the others, but I needed to be sure.I never gassed up here. I think it was a Marathon. The Shell on Harrodsburg Road was safe like the second table by the window at Wendy\u2019s and the back row left end seat at the movies, where I had to arrive 45 minutes early to be sure of not being displaced. I depend less on such assurances now. I go where I want to go, almost forgetting the many times I made it as far as the door of a business before returning home. Melodies and pictures still assemble themselves from whatever sounds and lines are available, but I am not afraid. No more or less than an unexpected squawk, these are a part of me, a way of making order. The harsh judgments of self and others, these are the lines that no longer apply. This is what I\u2019m thinking as I stand in the parking lot at Doodles, and people begin to approach me with the question.One of them has made a bet with her companion. He is still inside, eating. This time, my friend doesn\u2019t say it. Someone else says something different. I see that the script will be improvised, the words on the screen in front of me are shifting. The woman points at Squawkers as he watches through the window, and shakes her head back and forth gleefully. She\u2019s wins.Across the parking lot are two identical cars, side by side. The license plate numbers reveal no discernible relationship. I notice the hubcaps are different. Relax a little. Overnight, magically, one time a cookie with a jack-o-lantern face turned into a cookie with a ghost. My younger brother pointed out the obvious: there must have been two. That was how I knew. I was going to be okay. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.qloud.com/song/Human-Switchboard/Refrigerator-Door_Whos-Landing-in-My-Hangar--t_20646734.php"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/07/doodles.html", "title": "\nDoodles\n"},

Dr. Martin Geiger announced Tuesday that a group of autistic teens treated with HDVSA failed to become indistinguishable from their peers in what he described as a \u201ctotally random controlled experiment.\u201dThe scientific community first showed interest when Flossie McVey, a young autistic woman living in Dubuque Iowa, lost interest in her collection of stainless steel rotisserie forks after consuming two pints of the rich and reportedly awesome dessert. Upon further investigation, McVey was determined to have simply fallen asleep. Undeterred by this apparent setback, researchers carried on with the two year study. Participants gained an average of twelve pounds, but continued to study ceiling tile designs and to watch reruns of Star Trek: The Next Generation at the same rates as those who ate only Dryer\u2019s Double Vanilla Bean.All hope is not lost, according to Dr. Geiger. \u201cH\u00e4agen Dazs is working on a new Acai Berry flavor, and we have high hopes for this.

Perhaps not, so this is my disclaimer: The following is a review of a book cover, title, and promotional materials, not the book itself. I don't know what Michael Alan has written about why he wishes his children had a potentially fatal disease. I don't intend to shell out twenty dollars to find out, either. I would be willing to bet I could list every point the book makes without reading it, but that is not the same as knowing. The book's title states clearly, I Wish My Kids Had Cancer. The subtitle references \"survival\" and an \"autism epidemic.\" The book has a website, where people have left glowing comments about how \"this book has changed my life!\" There are currently 8 customer reviews on Amazon.com. All rate the book highly, and words like \"devastating,\" \"affliction,\" and \"vaccinations\" are much in evidence. There is even a facebook group supporting I Wish My Kids Had Cancer. Of course Michael Alan is not the first to make such an outrageously offensive statement. Last year, Jenny McCarthy said that she would like her son to have measles. Others have had no problem stating that autism is worse than cancer, most famously David Vardy of the Autism Society of Canada, who added, in case anyone missed the point, that autistic people have \"a normal lifespan.\" Alan's book cover also states that proceeds from sales of the book will be donated to \"charities to help families with autism.\" In case anyone is wondering which charities these might be, the facebook group's description provides a clue: ***Includes expert testimony from leading DAN! Dr. Mary Megson***So, Mr. Alan wishes his kids had cancer. How is this my problem? Well, because once again, someone is working to stir up fear of autism, and the consequences for autistic people will include continued misunderstanding, exclusion, and abuse. How terrible must a condition be that one's own parent would prefer to see his child faced with cancer? What is the value of such a life? With every such morbid comparison, autism and cancer, autism and tsunami, autism and death, these associations become more tightly woven in the collective consciousness. With each one adding his two cents worth of stigma, the jar fills up. The perceived value of autistic people declines. The thought that autistic people need not exist becomes more ingrained. Until the thought is no longer recognizable as a belief. It's \"common sense,\" background noise. Lest we forget that there are many families in which a child does have cancer, I cannot imagine that any of them would find Michael Alan's intentionally provocative title amusing in the least. Like anyone else, an autistic person can be affected by cancer. While clearly I abhor this book's title, I also hope in all sincerity, that Michael Alan's wish does not come true. I would like to thank Andrea Shettle for alerting me to this story.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/03/its-bullst-jenny-mccarthy_n_94854.html", "http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/2/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/soci-e/09ev-e.htm?Language=E&Parl=37&Ses=2&comm_id=47", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/SbJ3rrzWKHI/AAAAAAAACTQ/XUQfos3Wp5w/s1600-h/conscience.jpg", "http://wecando.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/03/judging-book-by-its-cover.html", "title": "\nJudging a Book by its Cover\n"},

In contrast, movement differences in people with Tourette\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s are usually accepted as involuntary, and rarely analyzed as if there were a psychological origin. Martha: Thanks for asking about this. In the early 1990\u2019s a small group of people interested in autism began studying the literature on what are called movement disorders. We lived and worked all over the continent and beyond: Toronto, Ontario; Madison, Wisconsin; Gainesville, Florida; Pennsylvania; Connecticut; Indiana; Bath, Birmingham & Bristol, England; and more recently, San Diego, California. We got together whenever we could at national conferences like TASH and at \u2018salons\u2019 held by Anne Donnellan in Madison, Wisconsin. We wondered if differences in people\u2019s ability to organize and regulate sensory information and movement could mask competencies and create the widely-held impression that people were behaving in an unusual manner \u2018on purpose\u2019 or because they lacked insight into how other people behave. We looked outside of the autism literature because that literature often did not reflect research in other areas of human experience. We worked on trying to understand the personal experiences of people who had acquired common movement disorders such as post-encephalitic Parkinson\u2019s disease, Tourette syndrome and classical catatonia. Although we understood that growing up with a sensory movement difference was likely to be quite different from acquiring a difference later in life, we wanted to listen to the voices of people with neurologically based sensory and movement disorders. We listened to people describe how they may intend one thing and do something quite different or how a person might be just as surprised by his own symptoms as an observer might be. We examined the common assumptions about the nature of behavior in autism. Many of our assumptions about behavior were based on the medical and behavioral literature in autism. Behavioral literature had described most unusual behaviors as learned behaviors that could be shaped, extinguished or reduced through behavioral technology. Learning challenges were categorized as intellectual and cognitive deficits without consideration of the neurological symptoms behind such challenges. The medical literature on autism used the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM) to describe autism for medical practitioners. The DSM did not name neurological symptoms (e.g. abnormal posture, abnormal muscle tone), but instead focused on the resulting behaviors (e.g. failure to cuddle). The DSM had used phrases such as \u2018prefers to\u2019 to describe symptoms with which people struggled and failed to mention the likelihood that many unusual behaviors had a neurological basis.Our learning was supercharged by a growing number of autistic people (or people with autism) who were writing and speaking about their own experiences. Without the stories from autistic people, for example: Michael; Jenn; Mark; Steven; Shawn; Sue; Peter; Ashanti; Kathleen; Art; Peyton; Thomas; Donna; Jordon; Barbara; Eugene; Cathy; Danny; Shawna; Ken; George; Jonny; Emanuel; Tito; Temple; Andrew; Bill; Kyla; Dan; Melanie; and Luke, we would have been kept in a cycle of endless repetition of assumptions. What a wonderful time to take our journey; Lots to read and more and more people to listen to as we traveled. Perfect.Bev: This really gets at the core of what I appreciate most about your work--the fact that you listen to autistic people. There are so many folks out there who seriously believe that autistic people are not qualified to explain much of anything about autism. Or who believe that anyone who can talk about such experiences somehow doesn't qualify as \"really\" autistic. The whole question of doing (or saying) things \"on purpose\" is complicated. Sometimes I squawk! I think of this as semi-voluntary. The problem with defining it is that (sometimes, at least) my choices are limited: I can either say nothing, say something that has nothing to do with what I really mean, and which might make the situation worse, or I can squawk. At other times, I have different choices, and when the choice to say what I really mean presents itself, that is what I do. But the fact that I can do that at times is taken as evidence that the other times, the silent times, the squawking times, are representative of my \"choice\" not to communicate properly. I can argue about that, or I can accept that I am seen as a rather silly-acting person. Since I'd rather be seen as silly than incompetent or uncaring, I have accepted that view for a long time .. It has, to a large extent, become part of how I see myself, so much so that I don't usually know for sure if I'm joking or not. Or I both am and am not joking at the same time, and that can either be unnoticed by people or taken as passive-aggressive or somesuch. It's a little frustrating to be aware of all these layers and possibilities all of the time, and to know that I have so little power to change how I am perceived. I guess that's why I write. Martha: I\u2019m glad you brought up the subject of intention. There have been many fine academic and research attempts to define intention, intentional, voluntary, etc. over the past century and I will not wade into those waters today. I agree that this is an extremely complicated topic and one that fascinates me. When I speak to people about the possibility that a person\u2019s challenges may be related to organizing and regulating actions, postures, speech, thoughts and emotions, the notion of \u2018on purpose\u2019 rears its lovely head. People describe an event that did not go well for someone and demand to know, \u201cWas that a sensory movement difference or was that a behavior?\u201d I like your idea of semi-voluntary squawking. A friend of mine who experiences a significant and powerful movement difference once accompanied me several city blocks to a favorite restaurant. He ran down the street backwards about 10 feet ahead of me as I walked, briskly, in the same direction. While he ran, he told me of his strong feelings for sharks and how the shark was losing habitat and being slaughtered for being a predator. It was not easy for him to express these opinions as he was running backwards, glancing over his shoulder for pedestrian traffic and shouting so I could hear. When I later asked him why he ran backwards, creating a situation where he risked physical calamity and made an interesting conversation into a shouting match, he responded that he had done this out of choice. He ran backwards as a choice over sniffing the tailpipe of each car parked at the curb of the streets we traveled. This sniffing took copious amounts of time and he thought we might be late for our luncheon date with our friends. This sounds a lot like semi-voluntary squawking to me.Bev: What have you been working on recently?:The developing understanding of sensory and movement differences for people with autism naturally leads to consideration of the numerous ways in which people have adapted to these differences and increased their participation in daily life. Phil Schwarz recently referred to autistic adults developing a \u201cparsimonious use of the bandwidth\u201d with age and experience that incorporates a \u201ccoherent autistic aesthetic sensibility\u201d that includes a love of sameness, preferred patterns and predictability. Others have referred to these as accommodations. I think of accommodations as adjustments or adaptations of an interaction, a task, situation, or the environment that assist a person to temporarily get around difficulties organizing and regulating actions, postures, perceptions and sensations, speech, thoughts, emotions and memories. Oliver Sacks (Awakenings, 1990) wrote eloquently about accommodations developed by his patients with post-encephalitic Parkinsonism. In my work, I have focused on understanding accommodations that I see people using, explaining them to others as a way of supporting competencies that people have developed. I have also worked with people to discover new accommodations that may be useful. My persistent perseveration is rhythm. Those interested in going deeper may look at the recent work of Hanneke De Jaegher.I would love to hear more about accommodations that you use to support speaking. Bev: The most important thing for me has been understanding autism and how it has shaped who I am. Before I realized that I was autistic, I saw each of my differences as separate \u201cproblems\u201d or ways I was defective. I couldn\u2019t participate in conversations with more than one person. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t speak at all, especially when someone was asking me questions. I had obsessions that ruled every minute of my days. I seemed to make people angry a lot without knowing why. The way I moved was just one more \u201cthing\u201d that was \u201cwrong\u201d with me. People would ask me, \u201cWhy do you walk like that?\u201d I had no idea. I can\u2019t walk across a crowded room without running into several people. Going to stores is a nightmare because of this, so many people moving in different directions at different speeds, stopping and starting, and I can\u2019t calculate fast enough where I am supposed to go. I end up standing still in the aisle until there is enough space around me to move freely to my destination.Anyway, figuring out that all of this is somehow connected helped immensely. I am more comfortable with my differences now, and I don\u2019t worry as much about being understood or how I am perceived by others. That reduces the anxiety a lot, allowing me to go places I would not have gone before. Speaking at conferences, traveling across the country alone, these are not things I would have imagined being able to do a few years ago. Of course, I am still autistic, but knowing this has helped me redirect my obsessions in ways that are safer, my need for sameness can be honored in ways that don\u2019t demand such a restricted life. I\u2019m interested in exploring the concepts of speech, and even thought, as types of movement. I don\u2019t know much about the research on this, but intuitively, I feel a strong parallel between the way I move and the way I talk. Sometimes, my thoughts get \u201cstuck,\u201d and sometimes my words pace back and forth or lurch forward unexpectedly. It\u2019s clear to me that the same sorts of things are going on at every level of my being. As for rhythm, I often use the repetition of words and syllables, and also tapping to keep myself on track. Drawing squares and other patterns is helpful, too. These are a few of the things that keep me focused and available to participate. Bev: I\u2019ve talked a lot here, and I want to be sure you can get the last word in. What else would you like readers to know about your work?Martha: I want you to have the last word.Bev: Squawk.Note: I met Martha in January of 2008, when several Autism Hub bloggers were invited to present at USD's Autism Institute. Steve D, Do'C, and I will be presenting again at the Institute later this month. This will be our third appearance there, and I very much look forward to seeing everyone again. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/", "http://www.onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/06/conversation-with-martha-leary.html", "title": "\nA Conversation with Martha Leary\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2009", "body": "\nFor BruceYou said, \"Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks.\"But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too.-For YouSo many times, there were no words, but swirls of emotion, pattern and image. Thoughts and feelings demanded saying, but I was mute. The other looked on with anticipation, then curiosity, then pity. Finally, I\u2019d disappear from view. The other would move on to other others, those who communicated freely the complexity of longings within them. Sometimes there would be someone more patient, more able to see. When I had spent the few words I could muster, I would choose just the right vinyl disc from my collection, the one with words and music to pull up what I meant. For years, all through my late teens and twenties, this was the way I could say. I spoke with their voices, imperfect, but useful. Once in awhile, I think, someone heard. I was less alone then, and sometimes a more standard seeming conversation would start, triggered by the words I found or by questions of the other. Words that lent themselves to echolalic use. Sometimes the words were yours.When I'm out in the streetI walk the way I wanna walkWhen I'm out in the streetI talk the way I wanna talk.-Out on the StreetThis is not a fan letter. I played those records down to nothing. The stereo\u2019s tone arm didn\u2019t lift anymore when it came to the end, and I had to grab it quickly before it skipped backward, leaving deep scratches across your words. Yes, it needed fixing or replacement, but I didn\u2019t do those things. I lived with things that were broken, choosing the inconvenient solution over and over in preference to a trip to the repair shop. Sometimes lighter scratches created an infinite loop of feedback, a word or phrase sung over and over, more mine than ever.I never walked quite like the others and you told me this was okay. The words told me there were others like me. Invisible.I wanna find one facethat ain't looking through me,I wanna find one place,I wanna spit in the face of these badlands.-BadlandsThere are some who think it\u2019s the other way around. That autistic people are not completely \u201cthere.\u201d I have been accused, but from this side of the neurological fence, it looks a little different. No one saw me. No one saw me. Sometimes this was okay, was for the best, actually. Invisibility felt safe, better than the alternative, usually disdain, criticism, anger, or worse. In the long run, it\u2019s no way to live.Imagine a group claimed your voice, but allowed you no say. They used your name to spread propaganda, and this propaganda made your life harder, all the while they claimed to exist for your benefit. This is the truth about Autism Speaks.But there's this angel in her eyesThat tells such desperate liesAnd all you want to do is believe her.-She\u2019s The OneOne celebrity after another joins. They mean well, I think. People who have the money and fame. The cultural capital that can result from the human need to identify with something larger. It is a powerful urge, the need to join something.You have been a part of my life for so long. I want to believe you meant me no harm.Well darlin' can you understandThe way that they will turn a manInto a stranger to waste away-Jackson CageThe folks who run Autism Speaks are sure that autism is a terrible thing, that it must be eliminated. The stated goal is a world where autism is nothing but \u201ca word for the history books.\u201d Autistic people are never consulted about the decisions being made by this powerful group. Those who defend Autism Speaks will tell you that people with \u201creal autism\u201d can not speak for themselves. Some will go so far as to say that these \u201creal\u201d autistics cannot communicate at all.I do not believe this. I do not believe that there are human beings who do not communicate. I know, though, that there are many who have not learned to listen to ways of communication that are non-standard. It becomes far too easy to impose one\u2019s own will on others. To say, This is autism; this person cannot speak, cannot reason. To say This is not autism; this person has no right to be included. Just like that, all of the power in the hands of others. The others are not autistic, but somehow, they are entitled.It happens just outside the sight of celebrities and \u201cnormal\u201d people. Unless you are autistic, or your family member is, you probably don\u2019t spend much of your days reading and thinking about what it means. You take the sound bites, read an article or two, watch 60 Minutes or Larry King. Nothing wrong with that, it isn\u2019t your job to figure all this out.What most people know is that there are a lot of loud voices saying that autism must be eliminated. Most people know the name Autism Speaks. Do they know the consequences of the melodramatic hand-wringing pity or the misunderstanding and the sometimes outright hatred for human diversity spread by the organization? People are denied employment, homes, and basic human rights in a world where disability is equated with helplessness and tragedy. It doesn't have to be that way.God have mercy on the manWho doubts what he's sure of.-Brilliant DisguiseI ask this of you: look at the numbers they use when they talk about us. Are there 1 in 150 people who \"cannot communicate?\" Are there 1 in 150 who are what some \u201cadvocates\u201d call the \u201creal autistics?\u201d And if there are, does this mean that Autism Speaks should be allowed to make decisions affecting their futures? And if there are not, if I and others like me are included in the numbers they use, should we not be represented among the decision makers? Are we not being silenced, effectively, as the Squeaky Wheel turns on and on?Lives on the line where dreams are found and lostI'll be there on time and I'll pay the costFor wanting things that can only be foundIn the darkness on the edge of town-Darkness on the Edge of Town Please watch the video, \u201cI Am Autism\u201d one more time. Without the sound on this time. What do you see? I see people, not vacancy. Not empty shells. People who had no idea that their faces would be used to manufacture pity.Dress him in a white shirt.

Like a puppet, the child is used to express the worries and wishes of the true speaker. Reading it, I reminisced about a few of the thoughts inaccurately attributed to me over the years by seemingly well meaning parents, teachers, psychologists and other persons in positions of power. Remembered how they all got it wrong.  The conclusions they drew. She\u2019s shy, she\u2019s rebellious, she doesn\u2019t like people, she\u2019s selfish, she\u2019s crazy, she\u2019s \u201cwarped.\u201d Yeah, warped.At least they didn\u2019t write it down and sign my name to it.Being told what I thought, the reasons I did the \u201codd\u201d things I did, having words put in my mouth constantly took its toll. As a child, I did not have the resources I have today. I expressed my disagreement with the descriptions of me by crying, howling, and hitting myself. These were valid and clear expressions, but were not understood by the others. They were not considered to mean anything. My protests ignored, I came to believe that what adults said about me must be the truth. Shy and rebellious and selfish and warped became the ways I thought of myself. Became the ways I behaved. The consequences were serious and real.At least they didn\u2019t write it down and sign my name to it.It took many years to erase the picture of me that had been created by others, the picture they felt they had a right to draw because I didn\u2019t talk much, preferred solitude, and had all-consuming narrow interests. It took more years than it might have otherwise to learn who I really was. Now, as an autistic adult, I find I must constantly defend my right to speak on matters related to autism. Meanwhile, a person without direct experience of autism seems not even to question his right to sign another human being\u2019s name to his own political agenda. After all, David is a child. His child. One who doesn\u2019t speak much. A readymade puppet.Why didn\u2019t this dad just use his own voice to make his points? I guess he thought it made a more powerful statement this way. A few years from now, David may have an interest in talking about his experiences.

Neither is having the child arrested.If I am assigned only management help positions with my school's sports team despite being an actual team member with a number, am allowed to play only in the last few minutes of the last game I am allowed to be a team member according to school policy, and I break school records, the news coverage will be of how worthless the coach was for keeping me benched for nearly four entire seasons rather than on how awesome he was for letting me play those few minutes.I can reveal to my boss and coworkers that I am NT, without fear of losing my job.People do not suddenly fire me, break up with me or refuse to be my friend when I disclose my neurology.If I have sufficient skills, qualifications and experience to do a job and I am given said job, giving me said job is not seen as an act of charity.If I'm under-qualified, but I'm still \"the best of a bad bunch\" amongst the candidates applying, people do not assume that I got the job because the employer felt sorry for me because of my neurology.I don't have to worry that if I tell my boss I am NT they will find something wrong with my work and fire me.If an NT asks for clarification from a boss, or to not work on the same schedule as a difficult co-worker, it's not seen as an accommodation that requires documentation, and the NT being too needy and difficult.If my job doesn't work out, it is not automatically my fault.If I am an adult, I can be a sexual being without the assumption that any partner attracted to me must be a predator or pedophile.My partner can express attraction to or admiration for aspects of my behavior or personality which happen to be characteristic of my neurology without his being seen as attempting to take advantage of a weaker person.If I have biological children, no one worries, or assumes that I or my partner worry, that they might inherit my neurology.No one speculates about whether children raised by someone of my neurology is likely to become feral.If I have relationship problems or get divorced, people do not automatically assume that my neurology was the sole o main cause for these problems.I will not have been socialized out of my natural ways of being to the extent that when I see other NTs I will have no clue how to interact with them for fear that I won't be accepted or that I will alienate them by being too autistic.I probably won't have to deal with feeling lonely due to being in some weird 'no-man's land' where I am either 'too NT' for the 'normals' or 'too normal' for the NTs. I won't have to feel too afraid to even try to go to a social group for NTs as there is not much chance I will be rejected for not being NT enough or alienating the other members.If I am in a relationship with another person of my neurological type, the reaction of society is not that no one else would date either of us.In addition, being told I am 'encouraging' said other person of my neurological type is not an insult but a compliment.If I am involved in a romantic relationship, it is not automatically assumed to be an act of pity on the part of the other person involved.If I am asexual, I will not be used as evidence that all people with my neurotype are asexual. I am never told that I should not have children, lest I pass on the genes that cause my neurology.I am never told I cannot be a good parent simply because of my neurology.The types of housing that is built for people of my neurological type come in all shapes and sizes, not just in forms that are big enough for just one person to live in per unit without a life partner, because they assume I will never have one anyway.If I have an autistic child, many people will consider me to be above all criticism.If I have an autistic child, I can call myself an autistic parent, even though I am not myself autistic. And people will know what I mean.If I have an autistic child, or any child at all, I can be sure that most people assume I am neurotypical.My parents are not labeled bad parents if they allow me to be myself.My parents ARE labeled bad parents if they punish me for being myself. No one makes up a poorly-defined pop-psychology \"disorder\" (such as CADD) designed to explain the negative effect we NTs have on our autistic-spectrum partners.If an autistic person criticizes any parent of an autistic child, then I can usually get away with painting that person as hating parents or believing all parents of autistic children are bad parents.People do not assume that my family, friends and partner will need a support group to deal with living with me.If my parents or spouse abuse me, I will not be told that my neurology drove them to do it.People of my neurology are not generally considered burdensome to our families.People of my neurology are not generally considered burdensome to tax-payers.Nobody will murder me because of my neurology.If I am murdered, my murderer will not be let off because killing someone of my neurology is an act of mercy.People do not assume that my neurology is a valid reason to force me to live in an institution.Spending time around me is not seen as an act of heroism.If I am bullied, people will not assume that my neurology means I am at least partially to blame, or that the bullying would stop if I tried harder to behave like someone non-NT.If I have a medical problem, I do not worry that my doctor will dismiss it as part of my neurotypicality.When seeking medical care, I am not expected to reveal that I am NT.When attempting to purchase health insurance, I do not fear I will be rejected because I am NT.If I am ever severely ill enough to wind up in the hospital, I will not have to deal with medical professionals telling each other within my earshot that I have the cognitive functioning of an infant.If I am in the hospital, and nothing in my health problem affects the functioning of my voice, I will not encounter situations where people make dangerous decisions that I am powerless to refute, and then interpret my physical resistance as failure to understand the decision.When medical professionals or any one else learn of some of my traits and needs related to my neurotype, they are not confused by them, nor amazed that they've never seen or heard someone with that collection of traits before.The majority of people who make the laws of my nation share my neurology.I can assume that police officers will not become alarmed at my natural body language, and find it necessary to subdue me in advance of any wrongdoing.I do not have to carry a special card or bracelet with me that explains how my neurology presents itself, because it is otherwise unsafe for me to be out of my house alone because of how law enforcement or other institutions might treat me for showing my natural body movements or the sounds I naturally make.The services that I need to survive not only already exist, but even if I use those services on a 24-hour basis, I will always be considered independent.Services for people like me are not considered a \"special\" add-on to ordinary life that can be taken away at any time.The skills and talents at which people of my neurology tend to have an advantage, around which the system of the society in which I live is founded, are presumed to be objectively more important than those more commonly found in people of other neurological types.People might actually have the patience to help me with things I need help with instead of assuming that I will be incapable no matter how much I am taught. This help will also most often be provided in a manner that I can understand, and teaching me in a way I can understand is not seen as some type of 'accommodation' or done out of pity.My deficits are not considered deficits at all. Instead, they are considered universal faults in human cognition (even if they are not universal). And a good deal of effort is undertaken by my entire society to compensate for those deficits.If it happens that I am better at something, more empathic, more sensitive, more honest or authentic, it is not considered a defect.If I fail to understand autistic people, this is attributed to a deficit inherent in autistic people, rather than in me.If I have a particular talent or ability, I can be sure that my talent will not be called a \"splinter skill\" or some other demeaning word.When, in order to get access to the things I need or want in life, I am required to read and understand instructions, fill out applications or other paperwork, visit offices, or navigate bureaucracies, websites, or customer service departments, all of these things will have been designed BY and FOR people whose neurological processing is similar to mine.I am not asked to continually produce documentation or forced to fight an uphill battle in order to constantly prove that I actually need some help with certain things.The definitions of rude and irritating conduct were developed by and for people with my neurology.If I find someone or something irritating or otherwise making me uncomfortable, I can assume that others around me will support me.I am not praised for acting less neurotypical, or punished for acting more neurotypical.My success is not measured by the extent to which I act non-neurotypical.I am not seen as selfish, lazy, or stupid for wanting to act in accordance with my neurology.I will not be subjected to endless impromptu annoying 'social skills' lessons 'for my own good' just because I am assumed not to understand certain things because I am NT.No one ever plopped me in a chair, held me down, grabbed my chin, and refused to let me go until I \"Show them orange crayon\". After all, my childhood, and the freedom and playtime that go with it, were considered important.I am not expected to alter or suppress my natural ways of moving, interacting or expressing emotion in most circumstances.If I fail to alter or suppress my natural ways of moving, interacting or expressing emotion, I do not fear public ridicule or exclusion because of this.If I am suppressing my ordinary body language, and then revert to my ordinary body language under stress, I am not accused of either not trying hard enough, or pretending to be neurotypical.Social orders built around my neurological type are presumed to be natural, fundamental to the human condition, and unable to be changed in any way.When prospective parents and others speak of wanting a \"healthy child,\" I know that they mean a child like me.No one expects me to gratefully embrace them as an ally when they tell me that they support an organization that's dedicated to preventing more people like me from being born.I will not be asked to leave a space, or to change where I live, because people are uncomfortable with my neurotypical behaviors.No one sees my neurology as being in need of prevention, treatment, or cure.It is very rare for people to say that people with my neurology are innately inferior to others, or that humans are hindering evolutionary progress by allowing people like me to be born.I am not treated like it is terrible news to find out I am neurologically typical.People do not say that they would rather die than have my neurology, or that I am heroic for not killing myself because of my neurology.People do not describe the births of people with my neurology as innately tragic, or seek to prevent us being born.My neurology is not classified as a mental disorder.I do not have to go through a whole month of being forced to see stereotyped, pity-party images of people with my neurotype and various intolerant, bigoted attempts to make sure that future generations of people with my neurotype do not exist and that my neurotype is \"something for the history books.\"People don't accuse me of grandiosity or derisively dismiss it if I suggest that some admirable historical figure might have been neurotypical.People don't accuse me of grandiosity or derisively dismiss it if I suggest that some fictional character whose creator hasn't explicitly declared him or her to be neurotypical strikes me as being neurotypical.I will not be patronized because of my neurology.It is considered good for people who are not like me, to try to act more like me.I can talk about my life without being asked what I think may have caused me to be neurotypical. I can be fairly sure that the mannerisms, vocal tone, and other such attributes typical of my neurology are not used as iconic symbols of stupidity in my culture. I am no one's badge of honor, just because they live with me. I am not a trial sent by God, a punishment, a blessing in disguise, a saint, or a devil. I'm just here, like anybody else. My family takes this as a given.Aspects of my personality and ways of functioning in the world are not labeled as \"symptoms\" of any kind of \"disorder.\"If I have troubles in my life, or problems doing certain things, people will not automatically blame my neurology, nor will they claim that the answer to these problems is to change my neurology instead of changing my circumstances or my society.When I behave in ways that come naturally to me, I don't have to worry that anyone will think I'm \"crazy,\" or otherwise deficient.I do not have to live with my parents waving that bleeping thing in my face about my younger sibling possibly becoming my legal guardian because my neurotype is considered defective and his isn't.I am never told that I'm a weirdo, geek, retard, or \"not a functioning human being\" simply for my quirky behaviors.I can relieve my stress in ways which other people will not automatically characterize as disturbing.If I am happy with the way my mind works, no one questions this or argues that most people with similar brains would prefer to be different.Even if I completely lack a conscience, I am automatically considered less dangerous than autistic people.I don't get praised for acting inauthentic. In fact, I may even be shamed for it, especially if I am someone important like a politician.I might not get picked last for teams in every single gym class due to having coordination issues.If I am picked on in school, the teachers are less likely to simply ignore it just because I'm 'the weird kid' and therefore the bullying can't possibly be the fault of the perpetrators.No one has suggested that people of my neurology be subjected to beatings in order to change their behavior.I have never had a bunch of people jump up and down on top of me attempting to elicit pain responses typical of their neurology.I will never have people tell me that I am a mindless waste of space and then deliberately fail to make any attempt to save my life in an emergency.My natural movements and traits are not used by non-neurotypicals to ridicule others of their neurological type, either jokingly or maliciously.I do not have to tremble in fear every time a group of bigots decides to go on a witch hunt and say to random \"weirdoes,\" \"Do you have autism?\" and then be subjected to teasing, bullying, and ridicule if I make the mistake of saying yes.I do not face insults, various objects thrown at me, and orders to leave the general area if I disclose my neurology.My behaviors, abilities, and skill levels at age 2 or 3 are considered indicative of an immature phase of life that will pass naturally, not as representative of my prognosis for the rest of life.If my abilities, sills, knowledge, and maturity at age 30 exceed those of a neurotypical 2 year old, I am not assumed to be faking my neurology. Children and adults are assumed to be different. If I am past the age of 18, treating me in a manner consistent with common treatment of a young child is considered degrading, not necessary. My parents probably won't hide my clothes when they think they are 'age-inappropriate' for me (in my case, the comfy sweatshirts that were made IN ADULT SIZES and thus FOR ADULTS TO WEAR 'make [me]look too childish and [I] should grow up').People do not use my neurology to claim I can never become an adult.When I accomplish something important to me, people do not go \"awwww\" and titter in the same voice that they use on small children who do something considered cute but ultimately meaningless.If I tell people that I am neurotypical, they will not automatically start to treat me as though I am a young child.I have never been asked to prove that I am neurotypical.NTs can lie and will be believed. ASDs can tell the truth and people will assume they're lying due to body language and lack of eye contactIf I commit any crime from harassment or abuse to murder of an autistic person, there is a good chance I will be considered a hero or martyr by a sizeable number of powerful people.If I harm an autistic person in any of the above manners or more, my word will almost certainly be given more weight than theirs, if they are alive to give their word.I am never told that the fact I have a certain cognitive skill means that I am lying when I say I lack another cognitive skill. Nor am I dismissed as incapable of things I truly can do, because I lack certain cognitive skills.If I am able to learn something that is difficult for neurotypicals to learn, and learn it only with great effort, and then lose the ability the moment I have something else to concentrate on (or lose it gradually over time), I am not accused of \"presenting as more neurotypical\" or \"seeking attention\" or \"trying to look neurotypical\".If I exhibit a skill or behavior that a good part (say, half) of the people of my neurology do not exhibit, I am not accused of being a liar and being non-neurotypical.I can tell the truth without fearing that the other party will assume I'm lying due to my natural body language and degree of eye contact. (this is similar to what someone else said - some of the other ones probably are, too).I can share my opinions publicly without fear of being accused of not really being neurotypical.When I argue, I can be right sometimes, with anyone.I am allowed to use the word \u201cwe\u201d without being accused of trying to speak for all neurotypical people.If my interests are considered typical and acceptable for someone of my age and gender, I can discuss them as much as I like without being seen as strange or obsessive.People will not tell me that I can't be neurotypical unless an autistic person tells me I'm neurotypical.People do not assume that all NTs have the same views on politics, religion and philosophy.If I tell someone my neurotype, they will not automatically assume that I must be just like another person of my neurotype that they know.If I am visibly upset, people generally assume something must have upset me, and will generally try to help me.I am never or rarely asked to explain what it means or what it is like to be neurotypical.People don't things to me like, \"You don't really seem neurotypical,\" or \"If you hadn't told me, I would never have guessed you were neurotypical,\" and expect me to take it as reassuring or complimentary.If someone of my neurology commits a crime, people do not automatically assume I am more likely to commit a similar crime.When people realize I am neurotypical, they do not ask me if I am like a particular character they have seen in a movie.People don\u2019t usually confuse me with another neurotypical person, or expect me to take responsibility for what the other person has said.People do not assume that NTs all have the same taste in food, books, music, films, television shows and similar.If an non-NT *does* say that non-NTs (or certain types of non-NTs) are better than NTs, I do not have to explain millions of times that I do not agree with this person. Nor do I have to repeatedly tell everyone that accepting my life as valuable does NOT mean assuming others are inferior.If someone of my neurology can do something well, I will not be punished for being unable to do the same thing well or at all.If I exhibit a skill or behavior that a good part (say, half) of the people of my neurology do not exhibit, I am not accused of being a liar and being non-neurotypical.If a certain amount of other people of my neurology exhibit a certain trait, no one feels compelled to claim that we must all exhibit this trait, or not really be neurotypical.If I am not religious, people do not assume this is because I am angry with God for giving me my type of brain.People are not pre-inclined to view anything I say in certain ways because I am neurotypical.If I am unhappy, people do not automatically assume my unhappiness is directly caused by my neurology.If I write an autobiography, it will be labeled a book about me as an individual and/or a book about specific things I have done (acting, mountain-climbing, sport, science, music, whatever)rather than a book about neurotypicality.My uniqueness is often treasured by my family and friends.If I do something that might be construed as selfish and self-centered, my actions will not be used as proof that all people of my neurology are selfish and self-centered. The same can be said for any other negative trait which I may on occasion display, or be misinterpreted as having.It is not seen as my job to explain to anyone that asks, what it is like being neurotypical, simply by virtue of my neurotypicalness.If I do something nice, it will not be used as evidence that all people with my neurology are incapable of lying, bullying, or meanness.I am never told that my neurology means that I will never amount to anything in life.In films or TV shows, NT characters are portrayed by actual NT actors.If I have a religion, non-religious people are unlikely to assume that I was manipulated into my beliefs because my neurology makes me unable to think to myself. Nor will they assume that my faith is a crutch to help me survive the burden of my own neurology.Nobody ever accuses me of not really writing the things I write, just because of my neurology.When I make a drawing, a story or a sculpture, or anything remotely like that, people will either like it or dislike it, but no one will say that I am not really creative, nor would they praise my work out of pity or because they think of me as a small child or some sort of animal.I am never told that my skills are impossible because a textbook says that people of my neurology are not good at that.My family, friends, and significant others are not told that I am incapable of relating to other human beings.People do not suggest that groups that are made for the benefit of people of my neurological type be led and ruled by people of a different neurological type, because mine is inherently incapable.If my sexual orientation, gender identity, lifestyle preferences or beliefs are deemed nonstandard, others will not suggest that I am pretending, incorrect, jumping the gun or unable to really know such things about myself because I am neurotypical. They will not use my neurotypical status as a basis for defending intolerant remarks or beliefs about any of these identities.Success is modeled after the viewpoints and lives of people of my neurology.When I am with a friend or my partner that is not neurotypical, people will not address them instead of me when they want to know something about me, or speak to them after I ask them a question, etc.I expect people to presume intellect and competence with me.People do not suggest that groups that are made for the benefit of people of my neurological type be lead and ruled by people of a different neurological type, because mine is inherently incapable.When I am with a friend or my partner that is not neurotypical, people will not address them instead of me when they want to know something about me, or speak to them after I ask them a question, etc.If I fail, most will encourage me by telling me that I will ultimately succeed.Nobody ever claims that I am too low-functioning to understand my own point of view, and that I am merely the puppet of people of another neurology who wish to use me for their own benefit.If I achieve some sort of success (academically, professionally, socially, or otherwise), I will not be patronizingly turned into an \"inspiration\" for other people.I am not assumed to be less capable of living on my own simply because I am neurotypical.My neurology will never be used to claim that I am more like an object than a human being.I have grown up learning about techniques and devices that can help me with my most common difficulties. If I don't know I can ask someone and get a respectful or maybe even useful response.Nobody says that my neurology makes me analogous to a robot, a vegetable or a non-human animal.I have never been told, because of my neurology, that I am incapable of feeling pain.I will never have people point to me, in my presence, and explain to each other that I am incapable of the skills that make a person human.I am not portrayed as otherworldly, mysterious, psychic, demonic, monstrous, or angelic simply because of my neurology.I do not have to fear that important decisions about my life will be made by autistic or other non-neurotypical people, just because I am neurotypical.No one tells me that an autistic person with a neurotypical child, or an autistic person with a degree in psychology, knows better than I do what I need, want, or feel, or what it's like to be me.I can pursue a particular interest or hobby to my heart's content without being told that I am engaging in an unhealthy \"fixation.\"I have never had to use physical violence as my only means possible to communicate basic information.When I learn my native language, I automatically learn the meaning of the words before I learn how to say them, and never have to explain to anyone about what it's like to have learned them in the reverse order, or to have learned them much later than usual.When I communicate, people do not gather in crowds around me and gawk.When I communicate, people do not ask me to prove that I am the person communicating, nor do they subject me to an impromptu Turing Test to make sure that I am not communicating through some sort of computerized trickery.I have never had to take a single test that determines, for my entire lifetime, whether I get to communicate.I have never had delayed processing interfere with people's perception of me as a person who can comprehend, communicate, and interact with people.Most people in my culture can understand my communication. (I know there are exceptions to this, Deaf people for example, but I couldn't figure out how to concisely cover all exceptions. Suggestions?)My natural movements and traits are not used by non-neurotypicals to ridicule others of their neurological type, either jokingly or maliciously.My neurotypicality is never used as a joke.People will never think that respect towards me entails knocking on my door 3 times before they barge in anyway, whether or not I told them it was ok to come in.If I am gifted at something, nobody, not even professionals, ever calls me an 'idiot-savant'.Nobody ever calls me grandiose if I suggest that my neurology gives me specific skills that are important to me.If I pass a first-order false-belief test, then people assume automatically that I have a theory of mind, and do not subject me to further testing of stuff totally unrelated to theory of mind in order to trip me up and accuse me of not having theory of mind.When I argue, I can be right sometimes, with anyone.If I identify as female, I will not be told that I am less female because of my neurotype.When asked to participate in the board or an advisory panel of a company or foundation or something like that, I am not the only person there that is neurotypical, nor do they ignore me and only want me there to look good to the public.I am never accused of being low-functioning or high-functioning by people who have power over my life, nor am I asked to divide people like me into the low-functioning ones and the high-functioning ones.If I am having a bad day or even a bad and stressful period where I am under a lot of strain, people will not say I am 'regressing' and panic, fret or automatically tell me I need medication or intensive treatment.I can assume that most restaurants, theaters, stores and other places I would like to go will not be so loud or brightly lit or crowded that I will become unable to function at a basic level.I can easily find other NT people in movies or on television shows that are not explicitly about being neurotypical.If I make even a half-assed attempt to look like I advocate for autistic people, I will be considered a hero, and I will not be considered to be acting out of self-interest. Autistic people will be afraid to call me out on my obvious abuses of nonautistic privilege because \"beggars can't be choosers\" when it comes to allies.As a NT, I do not have obnoxious assholes deciding that they know best the amount of pain appropriate for someone in my situation.I am not told that maybe if I didn't act so NT, then maybe I wouldn't have to feel ashamed of revealing that I'm NT.The types of housing that is built for people of my neurological type come in all shapes and sizes, not just in forms that are big enough for just one person to live in per unit without a life partner, because they assume I will not have one anyway.My opinions on social mores and societal issues will never be dismissed based on my neurology or on the assumption that I am simply \"not understanding how these things work\". Even when others of differing neurology agree with meNobody tries to one-up me by implying that their family member is more NT than I am and I must thus be incapable of understanding any of said family member's situation.When I (erroneously) assume that the person I am speaking to shares some aspect of my mental experience, or way of perceiving the environment, this is not called \"lack of theory of mind.\"The private body language I naturally exhibit when I am angry, afraid, or frustrated is not likely to be viewed by other people as disturbing, or as evidence of a mental illness.If I have difficulty understanding the behavior and perception of a person with a different neurology, I can feel safe in assuring myself that this is a fault inherent to either them, or their neurology, rather than my own lack of understanding. If a person with a different neurology has difficulty understanding my behavior or perception, I can take this as evidence of their (intrinsic) lack of understanding or insight.If am an ally to autistic people, I can quit anytime. After all, I've done my part, and have other things to do with my life. When I talk about parenting and family issues, people do not automatically assume I am not a parent. Nor do they tell me what a huge burden I must have been to my parents and how ungrateful I am for not appreciating that.If I show people a document indicating hatred and fear towards people like me, I will not be greeted with disbelief that such things could happen.But since I am neurotypical, no such document would need to exist.It's not illegal, anywhere, for me to have sexual relations based on my neurology.I have never been told that my mannerisms must be constant and identical across a wide variety of situations in order to be taken seriously as someone of my neurology.I have never had doctors randomly ask me to help them educate other doctors about people of my neurology.If I am interviewed by reporters about my ethical or political views, I can be pretty sure that topic of the story will not be changed behind my back into how amazing or inspiring it is that someone of my neurology can do anything productive at all.If I choose to, I can blend in relatively easily with a crowd of people of my general background. I am usually able to describe and recognize the basic emotions, because while I was growing up, and people told me I was 'happy', 'sad', or 'angry', they actually got it right because my emotions were recognizable to others.I am usually able to describe physical pain, because I did not spend my childhood being told something 'hurt' when I did not feel pain, and that it 'did not hurt' when I did feel pain.People do not assume that knowing me or having me as a partner or child gives them total right to speak in my stead and to be accepted and embraced in all communities for NTs everywhere.When I communicate my thoughts and opinions through writing, I will not have to worry about people trying to debunk me as a fraud and claiming that someone close to me is doing all the writing for me, that I do not really type on my own, and/or that anyone can clearly tell just by looking at me that I could never have such complex thoughts and understandings of the world.If I lose skills as I grow older, such as finding it more difficult to learn new languages after childhood, this is considered a normal thing and is not labeled \"regression.\"-People will not look on me with suspicion and question my credibility as a real NT if they find out that I was able to pick up bits of languages (or similar things) more easily in childhood, if I cannot readily do so as an adult.If someone close to me dies and I don't immediately respond by grieving in a way that other people can recognize as grief, people will assume that I am just in shock or needing time to process my grief, rather than declaring that this is proof I have no empathy and don't regard humans any differently from inanimate objects.-People will not insist that I engage in actions and gestures that trigger distressing fight-or-flight reactions in me as part of \"routine social politeness.\"Once I am no longer an infant, I can safely assume that my parents will not talk to other people about my poop in great detail on the Internet.If someone posts a video of me online in which I do anything other than scream and bang my head nonstop, people will not comment to it saying that this is proof that I am not a real neurotypical, and that they won't believe I am a real neurotypical until they see a video of me doing nothing but that.Even if people beat me, lock me up or kill me, at least they acknowledge that they are doing all these things to me and not \"to the neurotypicality,\" as if it were something alien possessing my body. If I need mental health care (eg for depression etc) i will not be turned down for treatments that would be given to others with the same needs on the basis of my neurology.Counsellors who make most of their money telling people others how damaging people of my neurology are to their partners would not be recommended to me. Occupational health departments would not be reluctant to give me a job i have been offered based on misinformation that my neurology is a personality disorder! I will not have to listen to peoples disbelief that someone of my gender can have my neurology I will find it easy to meet others of my gender and sexuality who share my neurology.If I am upset about something, no one writes it off as being a tantrum caused by my neurology rather than being wronged.If i move in politically progressive or anti-oppression activist circles, i am unlikely to meet people generally regarded as good anti-oppression activists who then turn out to work in jobs which directly oppress people like me because they think those jobs are \"socially responsible\" or \"doing good for the community\".I have a reasonable expectation of both getting an interview and of passing an interview for jobs that i have the skills and qualifications necessary to do, and my natural body language during that interview will not be taken to indicate incompetence, dishonesty or deliberate disrespect to the interviewer.If i do manage to get a job, i can be confident that i will not be required to wear clothes that are intolerable for someone with my sensory neurology to wear.If I make a mistake and blame it on my \"autism\" colleagues show acceptance and understanding and nobody tries to cure me.I can be present in public places frequented by many people (for example parks, city squares, shopping centres) without worrying that my facial expression or gaze will invoke hostility or violence from passers-by.I did not spend my entire childhood being accused of lying or exaggerating when i honestly described my sensory perceptions of things and how they were affecting me.- I can easily get the attention of workers in shops, bars, restaurants, etc to get served with what i want, and am never or very rarely ignored or refused service because of my direction of gaze or facial expression.If a sensory stimulus (eg. noise, lighting, temperature) is bothering me, i can reasonably assume that most or all the other people in the room are at least as bothered by it as i am, and that it will not be considered excessive to do something about it, or unreasonable for me to say i cannot tolerate it.I can assume that not only will other people agree with me when I say a certain thing is intolerable, but that they will not try to put me through \"exposure therapy\" by refusing to allow me to cover my ears at certain noises, force me to listen to them over and over or at certain volumes, forbid me to leave a room when something in it is intolerable, etc, and believe that this will cure me of my \"unreasonable sensitivity.\"I will never be forced to re-interpret all of my life experiences through a medicalized lens of neurotypicality.If, for some reason, I fail to maintain eye contact while chatting with someone, I won't be criticised for being deficient in social skills knowledge. Because of my neurology, I do not need to drink alcohol or take any kind of drug or herbal remedy to lessen the effects of sensory overload, since I don't have this problem in the first place.I am never called a savant by a teacher simply for having pronounced skills in math.I am never told that I have no right to complain about the injustice done to many of my neurotype because \"there are some NT people who have it worse than you do.If I talk about caring for my own autistic siblings, I am fortunate enough that most people are such dumbasses about autism that they assume that I am a saintly NT caretaker sibling who can do no wrong, regardless of my actual neurotype.I am not treated as a young child after disclosing my neurology, nor am I considered to be incapable of speaking for myself.The idea that people of my neurotype are not damaged for being who they are and are deserving of basic justice and respect is not considered \"enlightening.\" Just about everyone knows it.I am not told to disclose my neurology to my classmates and talk about how spending money on puzzle-piece junk will \"really help you.My deficits in school are not blamed on my neurology.If I have never been kissed, it is never assumed that no one wants to...If I make the choice to stay abstinent until marriage, I am not given a patronizing smile and told that that's good because I couldn't handle it anyway.If I tell people that I am NT, people don't blame it on my parents' lifestyle choices (such as smoking) or age.When I talk about parenting and family issues, people do not automatically assume I am not a parent. Nor do they tell me what a huge burden I must have been to my parents and how ungrateful I am for not appreciating that.When people tell me that anyone can be president, they actually mean me.Alert alarms are designed so that they do not make me collapse in pain.When I explain that a fire alarm loud enough to make me collapse in pain and render me unable to move is unsafe, I am not patronizingly told that this is only because I am \"one of those people.\"Nobody assumes that my cognitive abilities (or disabilities) are the way they are because of some emotional disturbance or trauma.People never tell me that some of my cognitive traits just don't exist and have been invented by psychiatrists in order to sell more drugs. Nobody has the right to deny my right to education because I refuse to take a neuro-enhancing drug. If I identify as glbt in some way, I will not be the only person of my neurotype in support groups or forums.I will never be told my sexuality is impossible, because people of my neurotype do not have sexualities.If I were neurotypical, I would not get a lecture about the dangers of \"recessive genes\" from a nutty relative, as the result of revealing that my spouse has the same neurotype as my own neurotype. If I were neurotypical, I would not have to wait till half of my life is over before finding out that there really are other people like us in the world, and that there is a name for our type, and that there are lots and lots of us all around the world, and then feel so shocked that it takes a year or two to get my head around the whole idea, and then feel completely p@##$% off that the name for our type is a clinical diagnosis.The communication systems in use by the society I live in are designed to be easily learnable and understandable by a person of my neurotype. I can expect that none of my parents, doctors, teachers, etc would ever believe that there is a \"real me\" locked somewhere inside of me waiting to be separated from my neurotypicality.If I behave in a way that is more like how they want me to behave, they will not decide that this is \"finally the real me\" who they've never seen before, and that the entire rest of my life, I've somehow not really been myself.My parents will not tell people that the real me was stolen and replaced with an empty shell, a monster, or a changeling.My parents will not tell people that they love the real me but hate my neurology.-I will not have to watch celebrities, including ones I may have previously admired, turn out en masse to support events or charities whose goal is to prevent people like me from being born. (Well, this applies to disability in general and not just autism in specific.)The people like me who are mentioned in newspaper and magazine articles, scientific journals, etc, are not all children.When I read articles about people like myself, I do not have to deal with a majority of the references to people like me being to \"neurotypical children\" or \"children with neurotypicality,\" as if adults like me didn't exist.I can stare at things which interest me for hours on end, such as television programs or pictures in an art gallery, and people will not decide that this is proof that I am an empty shell.I am assumed to be able to make my own choices about religion and spirituality, and not assumed to be either a special being who is innately more in touch with a higher power or to be incapable of really understanding religion and spirituality.If my primary gender identity is female, liking and doing things that are regarded as feminine in this society will not be seen as incompatible with my neurology. People will not try to prove that my interest in these things is actually underlain by cognitive patterns they regard as inherently masculine, and that therefore I am not really as feminine, or as female, as other women.I can bring up my neurology in any discussion, anywhere, without being told that I am not really NT, just doing this to be trendy, or looking for an excuse to be rude or a cop-out excuse for my failures.I will never be told I cannot really be neurotypical because I do not resemble a certain fictional character in a certain movie.When I am growing up, I meet enough adults with my neurology that I do not end up assuming that my neurology will either kill me or vanish by adulthood.I don't have \"staff\" living in my \"home\" who try to make me act more like them in my free time.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/07/ever-expanding-list-of-neurotypical.html", "title": "\nThe ever-expanding list of neurotypical privilege\n"},

I told the person who asked me that I didn't want my name associated with what usually goes by the name Autism Awareness. But I was told I could write this from my own perspective. I insisted I needed to have final control over any edits, and this was accepted. I wrote the piece. It took a day and a half of my life. Then I was told they wouldn\u2019t be using it. Although this was early in March, although the meeting in which this decision was made occurred on the very day I submitted the work, there simply wasn\u2019t going to be time to include it.

{"date": "Saturday, January 30, 2010", "body": "\nThough I made it through childhood without a formal diagnosis, there was never any doubt that something was wrong. I heard about it at home, at school, even from strangers who stared in stores and restaurants, somehow knowing. What I knew about the something, independent of the tellings and looks, was that while being alone was fine, loneliness grew in every attempt to join the others. I could not talk to people, and I did not like them looking at me, waiting.When I was 18, I found the cure. The cure came in bottles, 12 ounce amber ones and tall clear ones with Russian names. I found a voice, and I thought it was mine. For years I drank nearly every day. I went to parties, nightclubs, and the homes of people I knew and didn\u2019t know. I danced and sang. I talked to people. These were a few of the things I did which did not harm anyone. I could write volumes about the things that did.I was cured, for a time, of a certain form of communication deficit, and I learned to enjoy, for the first time ever, socializing with others. As far as the third part of the triad, the repetitive, obsessive part, well, not so much. Alcohol made the obsessions much more visible to others. I was not normal, not at all indistinguishable from my peers. Those obsessions, lasting anywhere from months to years, might have been manageable, might have passed for mere \u201cquirks\u201d to the casual observer before my cure, but these became the fuel for numerous conflicts, employment problems, threats of arrest, ludicrous piles of debt and falling from roofs onto wrought iron patio furniture. The details are not ones I care to discuss much here.Eventually, the cure I had sought became a clear threat to my life. I had to give it up; yet this seemed impossible. I needed a cure for the cure, so I went to Alcoholics Anonymous, where I was told there was none. However, I was guaranteed a \u201cdaily reprieve\u201d from alcohol if I became willing to follow a few simple rules. Because I could find no other option, I agreed to do this. Life improved, quickly in some areas, slowly in others.It should be noted here that the story repeats like this: Seven years of drinking, seven years sobriety, seven more years of drinking. Then on to the current recovery period, now in year eleven.What I am wanting to say here is twofold. Sometimes the cure is worse than what one is seeking to alleviate. Alcohol allowed more words to flow, but the words were not good ones. They no more represented my true self than my silence had. Likewise, the behaviors of children subjected to barbaric \"interventions\" at the Judge Rotenberg Center may seem improved to some, but at what cost?Beyond that, I often wonder, when people seek treatments for \u201cautism\u201d exactly what it is they are hoping to treat. Autism is not one thing. My understanding of how it looks in me includes things like difficulty with spoken language (sometimes very little language is available, sometimes the words don\u2019t match with what I mean to communicate); interests that differ in both type and intensity from most other people I know; repetitive movements and sounds; marked differences in information processing; problems with initiating and switching tasks; mild prosopagnosia; strong aversion to sounds most people don\u2019t even notice; a stiff bouncy walk that sometimes draws comments and stares; general clumsiness; severe problems with sleep (waking as many as 20 times during a night); debilitating fears of things like thunderstorms and ants; unusual postures; inability to use facial expressions consistent with my intent or meaning; significant difficulties with managing time, finances and household upkeep; mild self-injurious behaviors; echolalia, both immediate and delayed; and the need for keeping an animatronic parrot at my side. That just scratches the surface.How anyone can imagine that one drug, therapy, or other \u201cintervention\u201d might address all of these characteristics (and more!) is something that makes no sense to me. Indeed, it seems that most treatments for \u201cautism\u201d address at best a handful of items from a list far longer than the one provided here. For purposes of promoting particular treatments, \u201cautism\u201d can mean pretty much whatever a parent, therapist, doctor or business decides it means. Much like Humpty Dumpty[1] some people have decided that the word means \u201cjust what [they] choose it to mean, neither more, nor less.\u201d Of course it can never mean what I say it means. I lack certain credentials (either autism or the absence of it, depending on whom you ask). Yes, it would be so nice if something made sense for a change.In a future post, which I hope to deliver promptly, executive functioning skills permitting, I will discuss the AA experience, or at least some small parts of it, from the perspective of a (non-recovering) autistic recovering alcoholic.

{"date": "Friday, May 4, 2012", "body": "\nThis is Part 2 of a series on my participation in CUNY's ESA Conferece 2012. Part 1 is here. \n\nMy initial thought was to explore the meaning of \u201cautism scholar.\u201d What are the credentials? Does blogging count? Even if it does, I haven\u2019t done a lot of that in a while. Do I deserve the label based on my degree or the publication of a single paper? And if so, who is being left out? What can be done to create an atmosphere of learning and shared knowledge that would expand the notion of scholarship beyond academia? What types of knowledge and learning are currently ignored or discounted? I figured I'd riff on that in a short video and that would be my contribution. \n\nThen I found out a little more about the workshop. There was going to be a presentation on video games. There was going to be a presentation on manga. What do these topics have to do with what is usually thought of as autism studies? In corresponding with the other participants and reading a draft of one of their papers, I found my definitions expanding. I had previously viewed texts that are traditionally considered \u201cliterature\u201d through the lens of disability studies, but here were people taking formats usually snubbed as trivial and deconstructing them in terms of an autistic aesthetic. Cool!\n\nGiven this information, Squawkers McCaw occurred as a formidable subject. Based on the lack of comments this video has elicited, I deem it to be a failed project. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing. It was fun to work on and I learned some things. It got a few laughs and set an interesting tone for the workshop. Squawk.\n\nFollowing the Squawkers video, Julia Miele-Rodas presented Autistic Architecture in Digital Games: Narrative, Voice, Play. \n\nFrom Julia\u2019s paper:\n\n\nUltimately, the patterns of rhetoric established within these texts operate in ways that bring human experience and identity into relief, reclaiming these from the invisible and the intuitive. Videogames formalize narrative in ways that satisfy a greater autistic aesthetic\u2014abstraction, order, and formal symmetry. These are texts which are attentive to boundaries; they demonstrate a penchant for the categorical; they collect, collate, and enumerate; they discipline social exchange within a spatial matrix; they bind affective content into orderly relation with the material and the concrete; and they invite repetition and perseveration. (Rodas, 2012)\nChris Foss followed, reading his paper, Reading in Pictures: Re-visioning Autism and Literature through the Medium of Manga. \n\n\nWhat makes manga such an important form for helping to suggest more expansive possibilities where literary autism is concerned, however, is that it offers an entry point for the consideration of multiple aspects of autistic embodiment. Indeed, perhaps the most compelling argument for why manga seems so well suited for more fully expressing the lived experience of autism than traditional literary narratives stems from the fact that manga offers a decidedly multimodal reading experience, one which may engage multiple senses simultaneously and thereby encourage various forms of interaction with the text. (Foss, 2012)\nMelanie Yergeau, participating through video and Skype, then read That\u2019s just your autism talking (and other phrases that shouldn\u2019t appear in an autism essay. \n\n\nDuring my second week as a new faculty member, I was involuntarily committed to the psych ward at the university hospital. I would say that I make this statement against my better judgment, but such a sentiment presupposes that I have better judgment. (Which, according to my ex-doctors, I don\u2019t.)\nIf you have not yet read this post at Melanie\u2019s blog Aspie Rhetor,\u00a0please do so now. For me, this was the highlight of the workshop, the story of a disability scholar being abused, patronized, and regarded as unworthy of basic human rights. \n\nAfter that was another video in which I rambled on about autistic communication. \n\nWell, that should certainly have led to a lively and interesting discussion, right? Considering the educators and students in attendance, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but I knew it would be fun and different. \n\nThen came the time for questions. \n\nWhat did\u00a0participants want to talk about? The proposed changes to the DSM. What did we think about them? What would\u00a0this mean for services? There was no getting off this track once it started.\n\nGiven the excellent and varied content, the opportunity to explore new ways of looking at autism, and presumably the ideal audience, the medical model still managed to assert itself with force. \n\nAt the end of Julia\u2019s presentation, she quoted from Ender\u2019s Game by Orson Scott-Card: \n\nHe had lots of deaths, but that was OK, games were like that, you died a lot before you got the hang of it. \n\nAlternative ways of looking at autism have only started to take hold of the collective imagination. I believe that the medical model of disability will someday be seen as a quaint and inadequate construct. I hope that the day comes sooner rather than later, that autistic people will be respected as fully human rather than rhetorically erased and subject to involuntary committment for behavioral differences. For whatever role scholarship can play in this, I am grateful. We've died enough already. \n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://esaconference2012.wordpress.com/workshop-seminars/", "http://esaconference2012.wordpress.com/workshop-seminars/", "http://cuny.academia.edu/JuliaRodas/Talks/76505/Autistic_Architecture_in_Digital_Games_Narrative_Voice_Play", "http://dislit.umwblogs.org/", "http://aspierhetor.com/2011/12/27/thats-just-your-autism-talking-and-other-phrases-that-shouldnt-appear-in-an-autism-essay/", "http://aspierhetor.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO4T2QI4wnk&feature=youtu.be", "http://www.amazon.com/Enders-Game-Ender-Book-1/dp/0812550706"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2012/05/more-about-freaks.html", "title": "\nMore about Freaks\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, August 1, 2007", "body": "\nToday, Square 8 interviews a restaurant manager who is baffled by the behavior of a formerly stellar employee. The worker has always been dependable and efficient, and has missed only one day of work during her five years of employment. Though she has never fit in with other staff and has sometimes annoyed them greatly with \u201codd behaviors\u201d she is respected as a hard worker who is willing to help out others and often comes in on her day off to cover for someone who is absent.Several months ago, the employee began producing sub-par work. Tensions between her and the rest of the kitchen staff have increased greatly, and there have been complaints that she is not fulfilling some of her duties.Square 8: Thank you for agreeing to be interviewed here today. What can you tell me about the \u201codd behaviors\u201d you\u2019ve seen in your employee?Manager: The most obvious thing would be the noises she makes. A chirping or trilling sound while she\u2019s making the bread. She talks to herself and uses repetitive phrases. When she works the salad line, for example, she likes to say the word \u201cticket\u201d every time an order comes in. And, though I haven\u2019t witnessed it myself, there have been reports of howling in the walk-in cooler.Square 8: I see. How do her co-workers respond to this?Manager: Most of them have gotten used to it. There is one person who will yell at her when it gets to be a bit much. New people tend to ask her why she does it, but she just says she doesn\u2019t know or says nothing or something silly like it \u201crelaxes\u201d her.Square 8: I see. Any other odd behaviors?Manager: On breaks, she doesn\u2019t sit with the others. She goes off by herself and kind of paces around in circles. Or she gets out a little notebook and draws squares.Square 8: I see. Does she get along with her co-workers, or is there some hostility?Manager: No hostility. Like I said, one or two, well maybe three of the others will yell at her sometimes, but that\u2019s because she intentionally sets out to annoy them. It\u2019s like a game to her, I guess. She\u2019s obviously smart enough to do anything required, but she\u2019ll play dumb, like she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s supposed to do next. Like, there will be a lot of orders coming in on the salad line, and she\u2019ll be in the back chirping her head off, making bread, which could wait until after the lunch rush.Square8: I see. What time is she supposed to start working the salad line?Manager: No set time. She\u2019s an experienced kitchen worker, so she should be able to tell when the restaurant starts getting busy.Square 8: I see. Can she see the salad line from where she works in the back?Manager: Well, no. But she can easily see the rest of the kitchen is starting to get overwhelmed. There\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.Square 8: I see. The problem is that she doesn\u2019t stop one task when it\u2019s time to go to something else?Manager: Well, partly. The main problem is that she\u2019s stopped making the bread according to standards. She did a great job on it for four years. Every roll looked exactly like the last one, they were perfect parallelograms. We took pictures of them for the menu. Now she is making them too flat, or they come out in odd shapes or the wrong size.Square 8: I see. What do you think might have caused the change?Manager: There\u2019s absolutely no rhyme or reason to it. She just stopped doing the job right. We don\u2019t want to let her go, because she has a good history here, but I am at the end of my rope with this. The district manager is on my back about it constantly.Square 8: I see. What does the employee say about this?Manager: She always gives me the same stupid excuses. There were some slight changes in the procedures a few months back. Instead of using flour to keep the dough from sticking to the cutting board, the company now requires that we use oil. And they changed the kind of knife used to cut the rolls. None of the other bakers in the company have had a problem with this. For some reason, it\u2019s such a big deal to her. It\u2019s like she\u2019s never done the job before!Obviously this can\u2019t be the truth. I\u2019ve been doing my best to get to the bottom of it by watching over her shoulder at all times. But the situation keeps getting worse!Square 8: I see. And the problem with the salad line\u2026Did this start around the same time?Manager: It\u2019s hard to say. Her job was just making the bread for a long time, but she got so fast at it, we asked her to take on some extra responsibilities. One of those was working on the salad line during the lunch rush.Square 8: I see. Was that before or after the change in procedures?Manager: Around the same time, I think. Maybe a month or two earlier.Square 8: I see. I will get back to you in a few days with my recommendations.

She had strange interests which troubled friends and neighbors. When she had trouble finding steady work during the Depression, Madeline was referred to the Emergency Work Bureau. There she was declared unemployable (despite her education at Columbia and Hunter College, despite her history as a teacher of French Literature) and thus began the series of events which landed her at Willard Psychiatric Center. Though she declared, \u201cI want out of here immediately\u201d, Madeline was detained for forty-seven years.Madeline\u2019s story, along with many others, was recovered from a storage room hidden behind a panel in the Center\u2019s attic. This was where around 400 suitcases had been stored, filled with the belongings which were taken from inmates as they entered, apparently never to be seen by them again.Willard Psychiatric Center closed in 1995. Curators from the New York State Museum cataloged the items and used them to learn about the lives of the people who had been held at Willard, visiting their homes, talking with the people who had known them. The resulting exhibition, \u201cLost Cases, Recovered Lives: Suitcases from a State Hospital Attic\u201d was visited by more than 600,000 in 2004.Stories of the institution\u2019s inmates and The Lives They Left Behind can be found online at The Willard Suitcase Exhibit Online.

No, he is just rocking, and once in a while he raises his hand up high in the air, where it \u201cfreezes\u201d for a few seconds. He is just doing his work, living his life.

The man who had it built for himself and his family never moved in, and it has been on the market far more than it has been lived in during those years. The house angered neighborhood residents, who were not able to keep it from being constructed. Before it was even completed, bricks were thrown through the windows. The pattern of vandalizing continued, and for the first decade of its existence, I never saw this house without at least one broken window. The house is not located in a posh historic district where property values are protected against such \"eyesores\" as tree houses, lawn gnomes and columns inconsistent with the columns of neighboring houses. It is on a street where several other modern houses stand. This is a neighborhood where it is okay to be different. A little different. But not like this. This house is often referred to as \"the spaceship house\" and is just too weird, apparently, to be left alone. Over the years, I've heard lots of people say it should never have been built; I've heard a few, too, who \"understand\" just why others might see it as deserving of vandalism and defacement. After all, to be this different, and for no good reason, someone must be trying to prove something.Social norms, and sometimes architectural norms, are enforced through the use of sanctions. These consequences apply not only to the individual in question, but also to associates. In the case of odd houses, this means neighbors who might share in spillover victimization or at least see their property values decrease. In the case of odd people, sanctions can range from sideways looks all the way through murder. Potential friendships are discouraged by fear of declining \"cool\" values; everyone who has ever been 12 knows about this. Talking to somebody \"weird\" makes one an instant suspect, and few teens or pre-teens can afford the tax levied for such associations. For many, this fear of contagious stigma persists into adulthood, contributing to the myth of difference as a moral issue, and creating a society in which the few throw bricks and the many stand by quietly and \"understand\". \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RrOcfWxmQMI/AAAAAAAAAxw/ZWx9dyGsmOQ/s1600-h/spaceship+house.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/08/there-goes-neighborhood.html", "title": "\nThere goes the neighborhood\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2008", "body": "\nAlways a week or two into the school year, the question. \u201cHave you made any friends?\u201d Honestly! I had thought they were sending me to school to learn, something that mattered. I was never exactly sure what the question meant or why people found it important. When the teacher asked us to draw it, I made a ship, the S.S. Friend. Everyone else got the problem wrong. I saw their representations of smiling children in pairs or in larger groups. In the playground I saw them, too, the boys playing ball or roughhousing, the girls jumping rope or gossiping. I saw nothing there that I needed. I walked the edges of the property, collected rocks, touched the bark of a certain tree I\u2019d grown fond of. Yes, I felt the thing called loneliness, but it wasn\u2019t for what I saw of friendship. Something else I couldn\u2019t define.Until I was around twelve, the word \u201cfriend\u201d had no meaning to me. At that age, my parents were still arranging \u201cplay dates\u201d with the children of their own acquaintances (friends?) I didn\u2019t even suspect what they were up to until the day I was forbidden to take a book along while visiting. So that\u2019s it, I thought. Friends are to keep you from thinking. I worked out a theory for how that might make people happy. There was some logic to it, a way of staying busy while reinforcing one\u2019s own beliefs. This was not a thought much appreciated by my exasperated mother. \u201cWhen we get there,\u201d she said, \u201csay hello to Robby and Melody.\u201d \u201cHello to Robby and Melody,\u201d I repeated, laughing. And then what? Nobody ever explained.A big part of what was going on was that nobody knew me. I\u2019ve always defined myself mostly as my thoughts, which I\u2019ve never found a way to express very well or accurately, except through writing. I\u2019m still not sure how other people define the thing called \u201cself\u201d or if most people think about it much. Maybe it\u2019s one of those things like eye contact and small talk, assumed not to need thinking about, I don\u2019t know.From that bookless day in the car on the way to Robby and Melody\u2019s house (hello!) the meaning of friendship changed. Now it was not with indifference but with shame I viewed my aloneness. I started to notice that nobody sat next to me, that this was the case wherever I went. I\u2019d always been glad of it before, but now it meant something was wrong. Now I was broken.Then it was time for a new school and I found myself with a \u201cfriend\u201d or two, the others who didn\u2019t quite fit anywhere else. It didn\u2019t feel any different really, but it calmed down my parents and teachers, and that was good. I even talked on the phone with one of them. We were best friends for the next four years. I explained myself to her with books and with movies and songs. Read this, I would say; sometimes she would. Do you get it? Do you see me now?It was after high school when I made my first real friends, two of them, almost simultaneously. We talked, or they did anyway, but we also wrote letters. Finally, there were people who knew me. I started to understand friendship then, it began to make sense. It opened a place in my heart that had always been waiting. It turned out to be a Pandora\u2019s Box of need and anxiety that would take many years to settle down. Now instead of nothing, I wanted everything of friends. But that\u2019s another story.If I had to do grade school over, I might do it differently now. Knowing what I now know, I might arrive with a typed resume or brief statement of purpose. Approaching an unsuspecting peer at recess, I\u2019d offer it like a map to buried treasure. Patiently I would wait for the answer. Friends? Are we friends? Do you think we should be?

As\nthe meeting leader, I will introduce myself as someone with personal experience\nbecause I have a child who is Like You. I will tell you a little of my\nbackground, including my involvement in a Major Organization that has stated\nits goal of removing People Like You from the population. Before the meeting,\nbe sure to read the PowerPoint of my recent presentation, referring to People\nLike You as having a \u201cmulti-system disease.\u201d The disease is the Like You-ness\nitself. You will also see here that one in fifty people are now Like You, and\nthat this is very expensive to families and the general community. People Like\nYou cost a lot. You need a lot of therapy to become less Like You. Early\nIntervention is the key to becoming less Like You. \n\n\n\nThis meeting is to talk about future plans for \u201cserving\u201d\nPeople Like You and their families. \u201cVigorous training programs are needed.\u201d\nThis will be said a lot, but the content of these trainings will not be\ndiscussed. All the people and agencies around the state who are dealing with\nPeople Like You need to collaborate. Everyone needs to be on the same page and\nrecognize the evidence based treatments that will help you be less Like You.\nOnce all this information is connected, it will be more difficult for outsiders\n[People Like (in a much more specific sense) You] to propose or defend other\nways of looking at People Like You. \n\n\n\nSome reasonable things will be said here. I will acknowledge\nthat there are far more adults Like You than children Like You. Someone will\ndescribe as \u201ctragic\u201d the lack of good employment outcomes for People Like You.\nYou will hear things about the various ways People Like You communicate, that\nthese should be understood, maybe even respected. \n\n\n\nAs the meeting leader, I might nod in agreement, though the\nword \u201cdefect\u201d will slip from my mouth when discussing the communication styles\nof some People Like You. I may ask directly about the IQ scores of the People\nLike You served by your particular project. I want to know if they are higher\nfunctioning People Like You.

{"date": "Monday, May 3, 2010", "body": "\nLike many other parents around the world, mine warned me that I would be judged by the company I kept. I paid this little mind, believing that what they meant was something more like Stay Away From Those Who Are Different. People somehow less worthy. It took many years to begin to understand the concept of the guilty bystander. How standing next to a bully while saying nothing made me a bully too. It\u2019s a lesson I\u2019ve had to learn over and over. Now I\u2019m learning again.For three years now, this blog has been connected to the Autism Hub. About half of my traffic comes through the Hub. I have discussed the Hub and the benefits of participation in several conference presentations. I have met good friends through the Hub. It has been important to me.Here\u2019s the problem. Lately, I\u2019ve become aware that I don\u2019t know what Autism Hub is. I have thought of it in various ways. I have sometimes thought of it as \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cmutual support\u201d and \u201cstrength in numbers,\u201d when in reality it is probably no more than a collection of links. I no longer know how blogs are added to the Hub. When I joined, I was simply approved by the administrator. Later, I had the opportunity to vote on new admissions. I haven\u2019t had any of those requests for some time now. The email list for Hub members was discontinued a year ago. Several of the writers whose work originally attracted me to the Hub have left. At this point, I don\u2019t see myself as a stakeholder, but as one of many names on a powerful page of links.The Autism Hub is billed as \u201cThe Very Best in Autism Blogging.\u201d This is a statement with which I agreed at one time, but I no longer find it to be true. Maybe it\u2019s just my autistic black and white thinking, but to me this statement from the Hub\u2019s main page means something different from what I have been seeing: \"The Autism Hub promotes diversity and human rights, with ethics and reality as the core guiding principals.\" I think that diversity means more than whatever someone\u2019s diagnostic papers may say. I believe that the term human rights includes freedom from harassment. Ethics is another big idea: \u201cA theory or system of moral values\u201d is one way to define it.I no longer have any idea what values Autism Hub represents. This isn\u2019t about censorship. I don\u2019t want a list of links telling me what I can and cannot write, and I wouldn\u2019t want that for anyone else. But membership in the Hub is voluntary. It must mean something. A group chooses to link to me, and I agree. In the beginning, I sought it out. I am a part of this thing. That is different from linking done without my own endorsement, which means something only about what the person linking believes, nothing about what I think of that person's or group's ideas.This isn\u2019t about politics. There are writers on the Hub who strongly disagree with my opinions on some important matters. Some of these people are my friends. They don\u2019t call me names or make crude comments about me. We share at least one common goal, creating a better world for autistic people. I value these relationships I have with people whose values differ from mine. The people I consider my friends are not bullies.For anyone who has missed it, one or more Autism Hub members have expressed their ethics and support of human rights by defaming, bullying and harassing other autistics. While others have left the Hub or stopped blogging altogether because of this and similar incidents, the offenders remain. The most recent incident has been especially egregious.And where have I been? I have not written anything here for two months now. There are two main reasons for this. I have been struggling to keep up with my classes, job, and other responsibilities. There are times when I cannot do everything I need to do, and this has been the case for awhile. With summer approaching, I look forward to having more time to write. The second reason is related to conflict within the \u201ccommunity.\u201d I have seen things that have caused me to question my allegiance to groups I have supported in the past; this has been a time of reflection and refocusing. Perhaps this latest instance of bullying on the Hub is the second bookend flanking these volumes of thought.This is not the first time something like this has happened, and I should have taken a stand long ago. I hereby request that my blog be removed from Autism Hub. It\u2019s not a good fit for me anymore. While I believe in and support freedom of speech for all, I do not wish to have my name associated with statements which intentionally harm people. Sure, maybe, probably, it is just a page of links. But I cannot in good conscience remain there, knowing that my choice to do so might be seen to support one sort of bigotry in the pursuit of ending another. There are enough people out there claiming that all autistic self-advocates are hypocrites. If such accusations make me more vigilant against such failings, so much the better.To Kowalski, and to all others who have been victimized by similar behaviors in the past, I apologize for taking so long to say this. That was a sort of silence that wasn\u2019t okay.Readers: If you normally access this blog through Autism Hub, and would like to continue reading, please subscribe to the feed or bookmark me. It is my intention that there will be more things to read here in the near future. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.merriam-webster.com/netdict/ethics"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/05/company-i-keep.html", "title": "\nThe company I keep\n"},

This is an example of:a) censorshipb) freedom of associationc) discretiond) insistence on verification of possibly damaging information3. D now posts a comment to Z\u2019s blog stating that B is psychotic and should be killed if she does not stop talking. Z allows the comment to stand. Z is guilty of:a) nothing at allb) aiding and abetting a death threatc) supporting harassmentd) bullyinge) It depends on what country this happened in4. E posts graphic comments about F\u2019s body. When asked to retract the comment, E refuses. This could be considered:a) all in good funb) a valid expression of male sexualityc) sexual harassmentd) perfectly acceptable5. L wants fellow blogger M to link to his blog. M refuses because he does not wish to be associated with some of the posts L has written.

Which statement(s) represent(s) the values and ideals of neurodiversity:a) People with Asperger syndrome are valuable to society and should not be thought of in the same way as those with \u201cclassic\u201d autism.b) Autistic people are not mentally ill, so they should not be subjected to institutionalization.c) There are more autistic men than autistic women; therefore if an autistic advocacy group has more female than male members, men are being intentionally excluded and discriminated against.d) People require different types and levels of support, but all are of equal value to society, regardless of diagnosis, and all are deserving of ethical treatment and human rights.e) Presenting a united front is important to the cause; all autistic people should come to an agreement on what is best for autistics.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/05/defining-terms.html", "title": "\nDefining Terms\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 4, 2010", "body": "\n 1985-1992The back of the room is safe but the back of the room is forbidden. Isolating means fear and denial. Come to the front. Come to the table. At the table, I cannot function. The faces know. I cannot look. At the first opportunity, I will move to a corner. Lower my head so I don\u2019t see the looks.The hardest part of it all is staying in the room. Some meetings are harder than others. You never know when the person chairing is going to be of the controlling type. Today, we will go around the room and say how we are powerless or what we are grateful for. Or worse, she will call on people randomly. Going around the room is better because I would know when to leave. Leaving is wrong, but I have no choice. I don\u2019t yet have the tools for staying.Once in awhile someone will have a talk with me. People have followed me out. What are you afraid of? You are getting ready to drink. But I am not afraid of telling the truth. I am not able to speak.This had happened in school too. One of the things I did to frustrate my teachers was to say only \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when called on to answer a question. They knew this was a lie because I had already discussed the very topic in an essay or chosen it from a standardized test. Sometimes, I might even volunteer the answer, briefly, orally. But when called on, I never knew. It was common knowledge that I lied about these things because I was \u201cshy.\u201d I did not know why my mind went blank or filled with random pictures or graphs. Sometimes, I would try very hard to make a sentence out of it. People would stare back blankly because whatever I said seemed several topics removed from the question.During my early years in AA, I rarely stayed in the room for an entire meeting. People would try to engage me by asking me to do things. I could not chair a meeting, but I could make coffee. I could not stand up and tell my story to a group, but I could collect the trash and take it out. Eventually, it became clear to me that this was no longer enough.I went for nearly three years before drifting off.1999-presentThe hardest part of it all was staying in the room. I was older now, 39 as opposed to 25. I understood more about how to stay. This was viewed positively by the few who had known me before. It was framed as \u201cbeing ready this time,\u201d as being more willing. That was probably true, too, after seven more years of alcoholic drinking. The key for me was that I had acquired the ability to say the word \u201cpass\u201d or even \u201cI will just listen today\u201d when it was my turn to speak. I still found myself with an urgent need to use the restroom or take a walk at some point, but usually I came back.Conflict arose when the time came to receive my first token, representing one year of sobriety. I tried to refuse. The tradition is to say a few words and I hadn\u2019t yet said anything in any meeting beyond \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cI will just listen today.\u201d But I had bought into the idea so prevalent in AA that somehow displeasing one's sponsor and group is likely to lead to tragedy. I had accepted a lot of beliefs I knew were lacking in logic and reason. I had been told I would surely drink if I did not do this. For months, I had traded aspects of critical thinking for the approval that seemed somehow to play a role in keeping me alive.When I think about this now, I understand how easily reason can be set aside in favor of anecdotal evidence. I heard the stories over and over: Beth comes to meetings every day, and she has been sober for 10 years. Marie was sober for 10 years, too, but she stopped going to meetings a year ago and now she is drinking again. Rita did the same thing, and now she is dead. There was a seemingly endless supply of such stories. I was pretty sure that there were people who did not go to AA and still were sober, but eventually, I stopped asking questions because these questions, I was told, were a function of denial. Then there were those people who came around all the time and seemed to do everything recommended, but never seemed able to stay sober. There was an explanation for that. They were doing it wrong. One hears the same sorts of stories about autism causes and treatments. Joe was autistic, but now he's not since starting XYZ. If you question this, it is because your philosophy is flawed. \"My child is my evidence.\" That sort of thing.I negotiated the token situation with my sponsor. I could use a simple script when accepting the token; \u201cthank you\u201d would be enough. Reluctantly, I agreed, and found myself adding to the script so that when the time came, I had several short sentences to say. This might have been a mistake. People were amazed by the talking I did. Now they were sure I could say things at any time I wanted. I responded by memorizing brief scripts for various popular topics. They were coherent enough, having been written and memorized beforehand, that people started looking to me for advice, even asking me to sponsor them. The problem was that these new situations demanded far more ability to speak extemporaneously than I actually had. I had quickly risen to my level of incompetence.Demands continued to increase. I was berated by my sponsor for the misbehavior of not going out to dinner after meetings. Apparently I lacked the all important willingness to socialize with groups, which was necessary to the next step of my development. I made many attempts to meet this expectation, becoming more miserable and alienated with each try. I could not understand why these monumental efforts toward conformity were not sufficient to stop the accusations of unwillingness. I came to believe that there was something fundamentally wrong with me, something that would surely lead me back to drinking.During one argument with my sponsor over this and other crimes of autistic behavior, I stood in the middle of the street, doubled over, crying. \u201cThis is too much drama for me,\u201d she said. And she laughed. I didn\u2019t fire her; she fired me, a short while later. Her parting words were about how I had this tendency to see everything in black and white. This was probably the closest I came to drinking, and the best thing that could have happened. I found another sponsor who was flexible enough to accommodate, and even appreciate, my differences, one who did not find amusement in my pain. I still see her from time to time. Neither of us goes to the meetings anymore.Further reflectionsThere were things I liked about Alcoholics Anonymous. There was a comforting sameness about the meetings, an orderliness to the steps. Hearing the stories of others who had been in the same kinds of trouble I had reassured me that sobriety was possible. Many people were kind and went out of their way to help others who were suffering. In fact I have never encountered another group of people so willing to sacrifice time and energy for people in need. And there was always coffee.I never got over my uneasiness with the exhortations to \u201cstop thinking so much\u201d and just do what I was told, just as I never adjusted to social expectations that were entirely outside my understanding and abilities. But I did do (more or less) what I was told, and the fact that I took every step so very literally may have been helpful. I really don\u2019t know.There was one other thing that, in retrospect, I very much appreciate. Despite the many before-, during-, and after-meeting comparisons (this one\u2019s drinking was far worse than that one\u2019s) and the jockeying for status associated with long term sobriety, not one person ever questioned whether anyone, no matter how young or seemingly unscarred, met the DSM definition for substance dependence. All were considered qualified to know who they were, and with or without benefit of formal diagnosis, entitled to say so without rebuke.DisclaimerThis post is not meant to discourage anyone who needs help and thinks that AA might be the solution. This is one person\u2019s experience. I am sharing it with the hope that AA groups and members might consider the possibility that, despite the prevailing sarcasm toward people who \u201cthink they are different,\u201d and are therefore surely in denial, some of us may truly have different needs which could easily be respected and accommodated.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/S2uSX6NuS1I/AAAAAAAACho/WyUhpoZ88zg/s1600-h/bigbook.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/02/by-book-denial-of-difference-in.html", "title": "\nBy the book: The denial of difference in Alcoholics Anonymous\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, May 15, 2007", "body": "\nThree of my final exams this semester had similar questions. One (in Social Work Research)asked whether the terms male and female were both mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Two others (Sociology of Gender and Anthropology) asked if there were only two sexes. I know, this doesn't really sound like college level material, does it?Except that for the same questions, different answers were required. The first exam presumed the typically understood definitions of male and female. The sociology test question focused on differentiating gender from sex and further discussing the permutations of each. The exam in the anthropology class required mention of the Native American Berdache or another third gender identified in class materials. This dissonance doesn't suit my thinking style. Once I have learned something, I can't pretend I don't know it, so marking the answer to exam one's question \"true\" felt likes a lie.Last month I had a conversation with a therapist I know (NT) about a client (AS) and his difficulty letting things go. Specifically, when someone had offended him during an argument. I could relate to that, so I shared my own perspective and experience. I can't un-know what I know. If during a moment of anger, someone says, for example, that I am a selfish or thoughtless person, the cats are all out of the bag. They can apologize, I can forgive, but really, it's too late. I never suspected they thought this way and now I know it. Something has changed and it can't be undone. I won't trust this person again, not for a long time. How do people hide these negative thoughts for so long and then suddenly blurt them out? It seems like some kind of game I don't have the rule book for, and there is a set amount of time the receiver of the slight is allowed to be upset. It's all very confusing.Even more confusing is when they use words like never and always. I used to claim that these statements were false, based on these qualifiers alone, until it was explained to me that logic has its place and it is not everywhere. I still don't think I believe that.Context often becomes an issue in discussions of autism, too. This is partly because I have chosen to work in a related field and frequently find myself engaging with professionals who have very different views from my own. Most of these are not so ill informed as to use words like disease and cure, but then some do. More often the issue is ABA and other behavioral therapies. The distance between my views and those of most people I meet is disconcerting.Moreover, hardly a person outside this small and primarily online community even understands (or has heard of for that matter) the concept of neurodiversity. I can\u2019t begin to list the times I\u2019ve been asked if I don\u2019t think the Combating Autism Act is a godsend or heard Autism Speaks praised only to find that the speaker has no idea what types of \u201cassistance\u201d the organization promotes.Recently, I\u2019ve been encouraged to step more lightly into the fray. Some of the graphics and posters I make, some of the less controversial ones, have alarmed the director of an upcoming conference in my area, who cites the importance of not offending anyone. Well, I attended this conference last year, and believe me, I was offended more than a time or two. I had to stop every few minutes to remember the context of the event and consider what I could offer that might help a parent or professional better accept the autistic person(s) in their lives as worthy of respect and individual expression.The conference wasn't terrible, as these things can be. There was an excellent presentation on the ramifications of bullying for AS students. There was a lengthy session on topics in employment. There were a few other autistics present. The keynote speaker was autistic and all of his presentations were very popular. People were sitting in the aisles and standing in the halls to hear what he had to say. Then they went back to their bio-med sessions and talked among themselves about how to \"help\" their autistic children and clients become more like everybody else.At the information tables there were puzzle pieces everywhere. The autistic presenter stood alone, selling his self published book and CD of prior presentations. This year, I will be allowed to have a table of my own to seek out research participants. I've been told I can bring some information on neurodiversity and autistic civil rights. This is a coup, really. It's a lot more than they've ever had. I guess the context for my posters is here on this blog for now. Later, I may find another home for them. Right now, I have to learn how to meet people where they are, however little I may like it. I have to look around and remember where I am. Later, there may be an opportunity to move to someplace else.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/RkoO_Kz9o1I/AAAAAAAAAbw/XEUX2gkIAWU/s1600-h/AsperInn.jpg", "http://www.coreymondello.com/Berdache.html", "http://www.sover.net/~sharing/gender.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/location-is-everything-views-on.html", "title": "\nLocation is Everything: Views on the importance of context in autistic thought\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 18, 2010", "body": "\nIIncapable of returning love. In the Philippines, in Mandaluyong City, a party is held to celebrate the telling of the story. He is forty-four. The book was his mother\u2019s idea and she conveyed the story to its authors. A party is held in lieu of a wedding. This man will never be married, incapable as he is of returning love. The article telling the story of the party for the biography of the man who will never marry, who is incapable of returning love, is filled with references to unconditional acceptance. Unconditional love. The value of autistic people is mentioned. Someone is trying.I read the story. I read it again. I think about it for days, I can\u2019t let it go. Incapable of returning love. People have said things about me; more often, I have seen things. In their eyes, like a mix of confusion and anger, compassion and pity. There may be a word for this mix, but I don\u2019t know it. These looks happen far less often than they used to. After all, I have had 50 years to learn how to make myself understood.II\u201cAndrei paints, reads, plays a portable organ and xylophone. He has the comprehension of a second grader, but paints like a pro.\u201dThe story says so. What is music, what are painting and poetry made of? Not only talent, not just skill, but emotion and comprehension are components.Growing up, the arts saved my life, over and over. This is not hyperbole. While half of the bookshelves in my room filled with volumes on death and suicide, no one seemed to notice. Placing objects in a room is not considered standard communication. The other shelves contained books of modern and contemporary poetry and art. For years, these were my closest friends, quietly agreeing that nonstandard ways of communication held value. \u201cSo much depends /upon/ a red wheel/barrow/ glazed with rain/water/ beside the white/chickens.\u201d This poem was much like the way I talked, the way I thought, and this poem was important. Evocation of the Apparition of Lenin was important. Rothko\u2019s paintings meant something to me. Pollock\u2019s did. Not something translatable. I was not alone.IIII turned 50 last month. A party was held. I invited some of the people I care about, as many as I could afford to entertain, as many as would fit into the room. I designed invitations, shopped, prepared food, arranged activities and music. Other people helped too, assisting with the last minute food preparations, and designing an elaborate menu of mocktails to go along with the mid century theme I had chosen. Still others helped by keeping the party social, remembering the things I tend to forget, the introductions, the place to hang up the coats.Placement of objects in the room was intended to communicate. To explain in words what the styles of the late 1950\u2019s through early 1970\u2019s mean to me, I would risk being tedious and dull. Do you really want to hear why I think that Noguchi table represents the malleability of hope in the face of mortality? Or that the starburst clock, encompassing at once the tragedy of Hiroshima and the promise of space travel, makes an eloquent statement on humanity\u2019s relationship to technology? The party offered an opportunity to paint the picture wordlessly. To show it. To share something about myself with the people I care about, to have them enter a place in my imaginary world. By which I mean real.IV\u201cThe book talks about the ways in which an autistic child is accepted and nurtured with unconditional love despite the dam of a mental handicap separating him from others.\u201dThe separating/dam. What does it mean for a person who does not like being in large groups, who prefers even solitude, to host a party? This is not a rhetorical question. Because I worry that it might mean self-indulgence. In the dominant language. To invite people to try enjoying the things I enjoy, maybe this is not called \u201csharing\u201d but \u201cdemanding\u201d something of people. I worry that it is wrong to celebrate my survival. I worry that it is seen as wrong to communicate in my own language. In the past, I have seen things. I worry. Anything I say or do might be evidence.More goes on in the minds of others than can be demonstrated or seen. My mind. Andrei\u2019s mind. Your mind. There is a genetic agreement that smile means happy, that tears mean sad. When you don\u2019t see these signs, you may assume that emotions are also lacking. When an answer is not given to a question, you may assume the one questioned does not have the information. Or has the comprehension of a second grader. Or does not wish to communicate with you. The assumption is automatic, yet comes packaged with the opportunity to question. I might have assumed that my family, not reading my signals, wished I would kill myself. That would have been incorrect, though I had communicated and they had failed to respond in kind. We never did speak the same language. And love? I have had to accept over and over that it will not come in the ways I expect, but in the native language of the ones bestowing it. Like Andrei\u2019s parents, like anyone\u2019s parents, I must constantly adjust my expectations. This is not my hardship or your handicap, not a cause for self-congratulation. This is just the hard work love is made of. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=25217:in-lieu-of-a-wedding-a-book-on-autism&catid=32:life&Itemid=68", "http://www.philstar.com/ArticlePrinterFriendly.aspx?articleId=567993", "http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/wcw-red-wheel.html", "http://www.poster.net/dali-salvador/dali-salvador-hallucination-partielle-7700197.jpg", "http://www.philstar.com/ArticlePrinterFriendly.aspx?articleId=567993"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/05/incapable-man.html", "title": "\nThe Incapable Man\n"},

I categorize the list: Work Stuff (my job), Other Work Stuff (things I have promised to do that are also work, but I don\u2019t necessarily get paid for them), Home Stuff (chores and bills), and Phone. Phone goes at the top of the list, then the bottom. Get it over with? Put it off until I forget or find it doesn\u2019t matter anymore? Or just move it around? Phone goes to second on the list. There are a number of items under Phone and this is a problem. If I get to the first item under Phone today, I\u2019ll consider it a victory. I realize that one of the Phone calls will be of an automated nature. I make that one right away, but it doesn\u2019t count. I highlight it anyway, but I know better. I toy with the idea of sorting the rest of Phone into the three other categories, according to what the call is about. No, Phone deserves its own place in the Purgatory of the list, third place out of four.Not that the order makes the slightest bit of difference. Within categories it may, but then I may just pick the quickest item so I have the opportunity to use the highlighting tool at least twice today. I start with one of the two spreadsheets under Other Work, this is due first. Completing it will necessitate phone calls. I can\u2019t put them under Phone, they have to stay here.

This looks important, an email sent to my entire workplace!Uh-oh. This is not good. A local autism society is requesting that my workplace participate in some sort of autism walk. There is a puzzle piece on the page. There is a breezy suggestion about who should head up the efforts, and the person named is a friend of mine. I check the autism society\u2019s website to see how they have described the event. Although it has been publicized as a Missing Piece March, it seems that it will be more of a festival, with games for kids and information booths. I click through the site, and find no mentions of devastating diseases or burdens on society. Hmmm\u2026the event itself is described as a place where autistic kids can be themselves without being judged. Barely a mention of the existence of adults, and of course no questioning of why autistics can\u2019t be themselves everywhere, but I\u2019ve certainly seen worse. On to the links page.This is where I find problems. Big problems. Judge Rotenberg Center is listed as a \u201cresource.\u201d I start composing an email to my coworkers asking them not to support this organization's event. But then I start thinking that I should really be writing the autism society instead. Coworker email goes into drafts folder. While I am writing the autism society contact, I start to think that maybe I should ask for a booth at the event to promote\u2026okay, let\u2019s say in their language\u2026awareness\u2026of issues adults on the spectrum face. I know that this means things like being tasered for sitting alone outside a bar,  being excluded from jobs, facing all sorts of discrimination and harassment, etc., but maybe the way I am asking sounds less threatening. Is that honest? Is it honest enough? I don\u2019t know so I add a line about neurodiversity. But what will this person have heard about the word, so I add a definition: \"Neurodiversity is part of the general idea that human beings should have human rights.\"What am I thinking? A hot summer day spent in a field with noisy kids and exasperated adults to pass out brochures and display posters that will possibly just make people angry? More emails are arriving, possibly coworkers asking about the event. What do I think? Is this bad? Is it like Autism Speaks? and I don\u2019t yet know how to tell them and I still haven\u2019t sent the first email saying let\u2019s not do this thing and no I do not want to stand in the hot field all day to be vilified but should I? Should I? Another mail goes into the drafts folder and the spreadsheet is still waiting and it is noon here already and everyone knows I don't work as well after lunch, but Look! I have practically written a blog post which now needs editing and I might as well post it, since I will soon be too tired and frustrated to bother.One thing has to be done for sure.

How many kinds of wrong do you see?  Here, I\u2019ll get you started. 1. (Bigoted Busybody) Presuming to know what is best for a person with a disability.2.

What this usually means is something more like who has the right to speak up for autistic people. I wonder what Jasper has been taught to believe about himself and his rights as a human being. He is a man, not a child. Not a pet. Had I been in his place, I would not have been able to respond verbally. At his age, I most likely would have broken a few things. I would have howled in pain. I make animal sounds sometimes, but still, I am human. When autistic people are spoken about by charities, parent groups, spouse \u201csupport\u201d groups, television, movies, magazines, and newspapers daily as if we were a burden, behavior like this becomes more common.

{"date": "Sunday, January 27, 2008", "body": "\n1.The first thing I read this morning is Suzanne Wright\u2019s article in Parade magazine, Autism Changes Everything. It\u2019s less than 400 words, but what words they are: painful, devastating, mourned, disease. Grief and anger. Slipping away. The hoped for \u201csolution\u201d is ugliest of all: eradicate. In between, I see that \u201cadults with autism are failing to meet their potential.\u201d Failing. Am I failing? Possibly. I don\u2019t feel much like going out and meeting my responsibilities today. 2.Today\u2019s responsibilities include the bowling alley. I take a group of autistic teenagers on monthly outings. We practice being social together. We work at having fun. It\u2019s some of the hardest work I do. While the kids get reacquainted in the arcade, their parents ask me about the Hub presentation earlier this month. They are supportive, encouraging, encouraged. Maybe someday, people will ask their own children\u2019s thoughts on autism. They want to know more, and more and more. We talk until the there are no more tokens to feed the arcade machines.I am conscious of looking at them as I speak, looking from one to the next. This time I\u2019m not trying to act \u201cnormal\u201d or make anybody more comfortable. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll catch the \u201cSTOP\u201d signs in their eyes before it\u2019s too late. Did I just say \u201cadvocacy\u201d? I try to keep my politics understated when I\u2019m working with kids. It\u2019s subversive work, you have to sneak the acceptance in, or some parents pull their kids away. Not this group. They patiently wait for me to construct my sentences. Somehow \u201ceradicate\u201d makes it in. \u201cNo more like him?\u201d a mother asks, \u201cCan you imagine? I wouldn\u2019t want to see a world like that.\u201d3.\u201cNo barking,\u201d one of the other moms says to her daughter. They just want their children to be accepted. I don\u2019t blame them for that. I watch the man in the alley next to ours, staring. I am daring him, quietly, to say one word about the boy, as tall as I am, who is stomping his feet, screaming, insisting on having his name at the top of the list where it belongs. I have my \u201cSTOP\u201d lights turned on. He finally turns back to his own family, his own business.When I use the word \u201cadvocacy\u201d it spins in my head like a shiny coin, revealing one side, then the other, finally losing its balance, landing with a thud. Some people call themselves and others \u201cadvocates,\u201d when what they advocate is a world without kids like these in it. The word has become as tarnished as \u201cawareness\u201d has. \u201cAwareness\u201d of how tragic it is to have an autistic child.A smiling young man bounces up to me, shakes my hand. We are happy to see one another. School is going okay, he says, volunteering that \u201cmost people don\u2019t understand anything about autism, and the ones that do overreact, but that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d And then he is off to play with his younger friends.4.After the outing, I need a nap. Being social is draining, always. Always. Some of my non-autistic friends find this amusing, or worse. A grown-up person needing a nap? Nearly every day? It\u2019s no more considered appropriate than stomping your feet at the bowling alley. Less public, less confrontational, but certainly not normal. I know this. It\u2019s something I am expected to be ashamed of, some kind of failing. I dream about words. Letters falling, arranging themselves into words, always the wrong ones, unpronounceable, full of meaning, but not in a language I know. 5.Mike McCarron has posted a letter to all of us at Autism Hub. He thanks us for our support and for our words about Katie. It is a beautiful letter, full of quiet dignity, informed by understanding and true fellowship. Please read it if you haven't. Compare the words and the tone of Mr. McCarron's letter to Ms. Wright's story today. One of them knows what it is to have a child truly be \"no longer there.\" One has a reason to be bitter. Instead he offers thanks and encouragement. He asks that we carry on this work. The cover of this morning's Parade posed the question, \"Is There Hope for Autism?\" \"Is there hope?\" was what stuck with me. I carried it with me all day, \"Is there hope?\" The meaning of the word escaping like air from a failing balloon. The timing of Mr. McCarron's letter was good. Now I can answer, maybe. Maybe there is. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=698"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/01/autism-all-day.html", "title": "\nAutism All Day\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, February 13, 2010", "body": "\nSeriously. Michael John Carley says he is \"going to have a very hard time calling [him]self autistic,\" since some others with the same label may wear adult diapers and head-restraining devices. \"Hard to swallow,\" Mr. Carley? What I find difficult to digest is the idea that there are people out there promoting pride and dignity for people diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, while denying other disabled people the same. It makes an easy target of those of us who happen to share (well temporarily, until the new DSM V is completed) your label, but who stand for the basic human rights and dignity of all people. And, oh yeah, it's just plain wrong.I am autistic, Mr. Carley. I have always been autistic, and I have never been ashamed of having this in common with people whose needs are greater than my own. I worry, though, that people might think I'm like you. I'm not. I know that having a disability doesn't make anyone less of a person.Did you write this vision statement for GRASP, Mr. Carley?\"At GRASP we envision a world where all individuals on the autism spectrum are respected, valued, and fairly represented; where appropriate supports and services are readily available to those in need; and where people on the spectrum are empowered to participate in policy and personal decisions that affect their lives.\"And if so, what did you mean by \"respected\" and \"valued\" and \"all individuals?\" Because I'm not getting it. Another well known \"Aspie,\" Liane Holliday Willey, weighs in on the topic here. \" 'Grouping Aspies with people who have language delays, need more self-care and have lower IQs, how in the world are we going to rise to what we can do?' Willey said.\" If this \"rising\" means someone else needs to be pushed down, no thanks, I don't want any of it. I don't like to call out other autistics by name, and I rarely do that here. I'm making an exception for these two; this is too important to let go without comment. There are too many people out there claiming that \"neurodiversity\" means selfishly promoting the needs of the \"super high-functioning\" and \"barely autistic\" at the expense of people you have now publicly disrespected. Once the DSM has removed Asperger syndrome from its pages, there will still be plenty of \"autism advocates\" to tell me I'm not really autistic. Of course their opinions won't make any more or less difference than they did before. I'll still be what I am and they will still be what they are too. Why don't you guys over at GRASP just keep the \"Aspie\" label for yourselves then? I am already autistic, you see; I really have no use for it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/02/11/health/AP-US-MED-Aspergers-Diagnosis.html", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123527833", "http://www.grasp.org/about.htm", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35348917/ns/health-mental_health/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/02/angry-aspies-please-go-away.html", "title": "\nAngry Aspies, Please Go Away\n"},

He was reported as able to speak complete sentences and answer a few simple questions. He experienced a sudden regression in which he went from speaking normally to repeating a single word, then a single syllable over and over. Within minutes, he stopped producing speech, and began making a clicking sound with his mouth. Less than an hour later, he was unable to do even that. The subject was referred to a DUDE! (Docs Unapologetically Devoid of Ethics) doctor. The subject was chosen to receive an experimental lithium treatment. As oral and transdermal applications had failed to produce results in similar cases, four lithium devices were inserted surgically into the patients back. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d stated the subject\u2019s guardian, \u201ca full recovery from regressive autism in just minutes!\u201d She plans to make a series of YouTube videos promoting the revolutionary biomedical treatment, and sharing the news of the subject's recovery. \"Sure, he's still echolalic, he moves a little robotically, but he's clearly no longer autistic.\" The subject was asked to comment on the procedure. \u201cSquawk,\u201d he said, \u201cI love me, too!\u201d  \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1vPB2M2IMiI/R5bPDtSGQZI/AAAAAAAABM4/JsaoD3_2Wkc/s1600-h/DUDE!.jpg"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/01/case-of-regression-reversed.html", "title": "\nA case of regression reversed\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 26, 2008", "body": "\nThe room was full. The desks had been placed in a circle, and everyone\u2019s back was against the wall. A couple of people mentioned that there would be no way to fit in anyone else. Then, the next person arrived. Everyone laughed and moved the desks closer together. Somehow, a space had been created. Each person in the circle had given up an inch or so of protective space and no one, not even the autistic member of the group, found it too uncomfortable. Then it happened again. Corners were discovered to be more useful than assumed; some desks were angled differently. The third late arrival found her desk in the center of the room, but was able to edge a deskless chair into the circle. The lesson passed without comment as we moved on to the topic we\u2019d come to discuss\u2014empathy in autism.This is a full semester class on the subject of empathy. Autism gets one week, a three hour discussion period, and this is the second year I\u2019ve been invited to join the seminar, to offer a different perspective on the meaning of empathy. Last year, I wrote this post for the class, and then this one in response to it. This year was easier. I\u2019ve had a lot of experience talking about autism over the past 12 months. I\u2019ve become less defensive, more willing to believe that lack of knowledge is not equal to lack of compassion.Now when I speak to groups of people and encounter the same questions about mercury and Rain Man, epidemics and Autism Speaks, I am far less likely to become agitated. There are many things people just don\u2019t know, and I am privileged to share my views with them. Where else will they hear about Katie McCarron or about the Judge Rotenberg Center? Who will tell them about the Ransom Notes Campaign? These are not the things taught in classrooms. Most people don\u2019t know these stories. They know about Jenny McCarthy. They\u2019ve heard things.This year, there were several students in the class who have autistic family members. Each of these spoke of the nephew, the sister, the son with pride and respect. They seemed less afraid of me than last year\u2019s students had. One of them helped me find my way out of the building when I appeared to be lost. This was a pleasant experience, though as always I was frustrated by my inability to say the things I wanted to say.When I think of the differences between this experience and the previous one, it occurs to me that one of the things that has changed my perspective is writing this blog. I can relax a bit knowing that what I could not manage to say in class, I can write here, and invite others to read it. You see, I failed to talk about some of the things I\u2019ve mentioned in this post. And these are all very relevant to empathy and to the reciprocity reading we talked about in the class.When groups of people are devalued, objectified, treated as less than human, terrible consequences follow. This is why it is important to stop asking the question, \u201cDo autistic people lack empathy?\u201d A better question might be \u201cWhat are some ways autistic people express empathy?\u201d Or \u201cDo autistic people learn empathy in different ways than non-autistic people do?\u201d Otherwise, there is room for the creeping thought that maybe we are not quite human, or at least of lesser value to our communities.This is for the Empathy class. If you got the link to this post from your professor, did you take the time to read it, even though this is not required? Because this is what I came to tell you yesterday, on my own time. This is the point of it, really. If you are reading this, you are accommodating a difference. You are reciprocating, visiting me on your time, using the communication strategy that works best for me. This, I think, is empathy in action.Thank you for coming, then. It seems that just possibly, through minor adjustments, there may be room for everyone after all. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=371", "http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock_photo_essay_1.html", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=21", "http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Gernsbacher_reciprocity.pdf"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/03/empathy-class.html", "title": "\nEmpathy Class\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 15, 2008", "body": "\nWhen I first started writing this blog, I was still using the term \u201ccurebie.\u201d You can find it in the archives, it\u2019s a part of my history. As I began to write more and more of the need for respectful language in discussions of autism, I had to give this some thought. I considered the possibility that some people who had been assigned this label were at an early point in the process of acceptance, a process which would not be expedited or supported by my use of an objectionable term. I got to know some of the parents connected to Autism Hub. I realized that most of these folks, strong supporters of Autistic Rights, hadn\u2019t started out that way. For most of them, time and careful consideration were required before coming to acceptance.It seemed that the people I met in person who supported finding cures for autism had never even known that another point of view existed. All they had heard was that autism is tragic, that it steals children, leaving empty shells behind, that it ruins lives and families, that it costs society dearly.And then there were the hardcore seekers of cures who were never going to be swayed by my arguments. What would they do with a word like \u201ccurebie\u201d but hold it up as evidence of hypocrisy or take it as a badge of honor? If I am going to continually ask these folks to stop using words like toxic, disease, and damaged, maybe I should not use words myself which they\u2019ve asked me not to use.Yes, there is a power differential to be factored in. And I think that some of the people who would say, \u201cwell isn\u2019t this the same thing?\u201d understand the difference perfectly well. Others don\u2019t, and at some point in the journey toward understanding, there may be a window of opportunity, a reachable moment. I don\u2019t want to blow it by using a word some consider a slur.I think this is an example of what some have called Theory of Mind. Not only do I imagine the other\u2019s state of mind, I alter my behavior, if ever so slightly, due to this understanding.When someone persists in using insulting words, after having been told that these are not only hurtful, but damaging in terms of very real consequences, that person willfully disrespects his or her opponent. Such actions speak clearly about the values of people who see themselves as somehow more worthy of respect, more human, than the pitiable beings they would \"help.\" Sometimes this is done in a spiteful way, as when someone again compares autism to cancer, noting that it sure is going to upset the \u201cND.\u201d Usually, though, it just comes across as extreme self absorption and arrogance.The decision to change this one aspect of the way I talk wasn\u2019t made lightly. The reason isn\u2019t that I like hurling insults. It is that I have been asked to shut up a few too many times. I had to be sure that no one took the word from me, that I made the decision myself based on new information and logic. After all, I've considered abandoning perfectly good words like \"neurodiversity\" for reasons which in the end didn't hold up.I\u2019m not well equipped for games. I grow tired of games. Especially those like Ring Around the Straw Man, and Red Herring Roundup. Check out the first comment on this post, wherein a well known autism advocate engages in a disingenuous redefining of \u201cfreedom of speech.\u201d Despite his training as an attorney, he implies that his legal right to self-expression is somehow threatened by another person\u2019s stating of an opinion. Are we really meant to believe this? Or to think that he does? No, this is a shell game, an attention shifting tactic that has no place in a serious discussion.  It's all enough to make me want to say some very bad words (see Jenny on the Larry King show with the doctor). At least for today, though, I won't.  It's not worth my time and I've got all kinds of Neurodiversity work to be done. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://eds-autism-blog.blogspot.com/2008/06/agendas-matter.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/06/word-for-history-books.html", "title": "\nA word for the history books\n"},

Down.\u00a0\n\n\nSquare Talk: Processing originally posted here in 2009\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not autistic, work on including autistic people\nin your conversations, especially when you are talking in a group. This does\nnot mean trying to force anyone into conversing. Please don\u2019t do that. \u201cInterviewing\u201d\nis probably a bad approach unless you know the person likes that. What I am\nasking you to do is to slow down. Pause. Leave spaces between your sentences. Listen.\n\n\n\n\nPossibly, the conversation will feel somewhat unnatural to\nyou. There may be stretches of silence. Accept this as part of the\nconversation. Have some paper and pens nearby. Even Autistics who use speech to\ncommunicate may have more to express through writing, drawing, or other\nmethods. Maybe you will too. \n\n\n\nWhat if the autistic person in your life does not use speech\nto communicate? The same rules still apply. Slowing down your interactions\nallows everyone extra time to process. Learn the language in which the person communicates\nbest. Skype, IM, or email your conversation if that works better. Be open to the\nconversations that happen without words. \n\n\n\nAs you pause, if you are afraid you will forget what you wanted\nsay, jot down a note to say it later. I do this. Other autistic people I know\ndo this. Give it a try. Also, it is probably not going to hurt you to\naccidentally leave something unsaid. \n\n\n\nThe key to this is to be open, but non-intrusive. Your\nconversational partner may not respond in the ways you hope. Keep leaving\nspace, but don\u2019t fill it with expectations. \n\n\n\nWhat if the autistic person in your life talks a lot, and\nyou are thinking, well he or she is the one that needs to slow down! Slow\nyourself down anyway. Think about what the person is really saying to you. Even\nif you've heard all this before, don\u2019t tune the person out. Respond\nauthentically. \n\n\n\nLeave a comment here about slowing down. \n\n\n\nYou have the rest of April to complete this challenge. No\nrush.\n\n\n\nIf you are autistic, leave a comment about a time you were\nwell included in a group conversation. If this has never happened for you, forward\nthis post to someone who needs to know.

If you have been around for a while, you may remember when\nautistics.org was still being updated regularly. You may remember when it was\none of a very few places to find writing by and about autistic people. There were\nnot a lot of autistic bloggers in the early 2000\u2019s. There was no ASAN. There\nwere a couple of online communities where there was way too much talk of\nfunctioning labels and separatism for me to stomach. autistics.org was one of\nthe first places I could go to read the stories of like minded people. \n\n\n\nIn revisiting the site in preparation for this post, I\nexpected to find some outdated language and perhaps problematic ideas.

Tisoncik: \u201cThe experience of being\none of three autistics at a large conference dedicated to autism is somewhat\nlike that of being one of three mothers at a large conference dedicated to\nMotherhood.\u201d Have we made any progress in this arena? Enough? \n\n\n\nMel Baggs\u2019 How to Become an Autism Expert instructs would-be authorities to study their\nvocabulary words, including \u201cdivisive,\u201d \u201cinfighting,\u201d and \u201cunity.\u201d Didn't I\njust have this argument last week? Are we still fighting the same warped\ndefinitions of \u201ccommunity\u201d all these years later? \n\n\n\nJoel Smith reminds us that we do not need to discount the\nexperiences of others in order to have pride in ourselves and our community in Autistic Pride Day: Do We Celebrate it Right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom autistics.org\n\n\nautistics.org is just one of the places to start exploring the\nhistory of the autistic rights movement.

{"date": "Thursday, April 9, 2015", "body": "\n\nUse your network to find job openings. Get an interview.\nChoose what to wear that is appropriate to the workplace you want to be hired\ninto. Make sure your grooming is perfect. Get to the place. Wait until you are called\nin. Meet the interviewer (shake hands, look in the eye.) Figure out where you\nare supposed to sit during the interview. There will be a minute or two of\nsmall talk. Then answer open-ended questions about why you want the job and why\nthey should hire you. There will probably be a question that starts, \u201cTell me\nabout a time when\u2026\u201d or \u201cWhat would you do in this situation\u2026\u201d You will not know\nwhat the questions are, but try to prepare in advance. Try not to look at the\nwall/ceiling interface too much. \n\n\n\nIf you have made it this far, there may be an additional\ntest for you. This will be a personality inventory that is not designed for the\nway you think or process language. The first time I had to take one of these, I\nwas well into adulthood, and had had lots of years to figure things out. If the\ntest asks if you have ever stolen anything, say \u201cno\u201d even if this is not\nentirely true. You remember that toy elephant you took from the girl who sat in\nfront of you in second grade, but that doesn't count. I still managed to get a\nfew wrong, and had to account for my answers. One was something like, \u201cI\nbelieve that I sometimes know more about how to do my own specific job than my\nsupervisor does.\u201d Well, of course! Why would they need me if I were not a\nspecialist in what I do? Why would a supervisor need to know every detail of\nwhat each person does? This was the wrong answer. \n\n\n\nCHALLENGE:\n\n\n\nEverything in the first paragraph above is likely to be\nchallenging for the autistic job seeker, but the personality inventory is most\nodious to me. They are ethically suspect and not that great at identifying good employees. \n\nFor non-autistic readers: Whether or not you are\ncurrently employed, it is likely that you know someone who\nknows someone who is in a position of power. Someone who owns a small business. Someone who\nworks in HR for a company, someone who is in some way connected with the hiring\nprocess. For Challenge 6, identify one such person (or more\u2026more is good) and\ntalk to them about this. You might want to forward this post along with a\nrequest to consider whether such policies are 1) discriminatory, and/or 2)\nkeeping their companies from finding some well qualified workers. Or have a one\non one talk with the person or people you have identified. Ask if exceptions\ncan ever be made for people with disabilities, and what the requirements would\nbe for determining who qualifies.\n\nOkay, maybe you really can't think of anyone who knows anyone. You can still participate in this challenge by starting a conversation about barriers to employment for autistic people. Talk about it on Facebook, Twitter, or other social networking sites.\u00a0\n\n\n\nComment here on what you said and what response(s) you received.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are autistic, here is an opportunity to advertise\nyourself. In the comments, tell me what your skills are. What qualities make\nyou a good employee? What supports do you need to succeed in the workplace?\nWhat has your experience with job seeking been like? If you have an online\nresume, you may link to it here. \n\n\n\nFor my part, I will do my best to make sure your messages\nare seen. The first post in the Squawkers McCaw Autism Acceptance Challenge has had\nover 5000 views. For subsequent posts, the numbers have been lower, but still\nsubstantial. For this post, if I receive comments from autistic job seekers, I\nwill make an extra effort to promote and share the post so that the maximum\nnumber of potential employers will see your comments.\n\nIMPORTANT BONUS INFORMATION:\u00a0\u00a0Microsoft is specifically seeking autistic employees.\u00a0To apply, send your resume to msautism (at) microsoft (dot) com\n\n\n\n\n\nPoster from my 2010 post on Late Interventions with updated numbers.\"1 in 68 Adults may be autistic.

Nothing special: Living Zen. New York: HarperCollins. 168. \n\n\n\n\nI squawk to relieve stress or to stay in the conversation when words are scarce. This is sometimes seen as \u201cattention seeking behavior.\u201d I should be ignored until I behave \u201cappropriately.\u201d Appropriately means like the majority. I do not care for the kind of attention I am being accused of. \n\n\nAttention means knowing that I ended that last sentence with a preposition, attention means noticing the comma splice. Proper and consistent attention to these things tells me they are a part of my style, a representation of my thought processes, not errors. When I write a formal paper, I don\u2019t do this. I pay attention to where I am.\n\n\n\nSome people pay attention to their driving by listening to music, arguing with a passenger, talking on the phone, thinking about work or money problems. I am not able to do this, my kind of attention is different, focused, even when to most, the task at hand seems simple. You\u2019ve done this thousands of times, it\u2019s automatic. But lives are at stake. \n\n\n\nOften confused with attention is awareness. Today is the last day of April, and I am glad. Awareness will still be demanded by the puzzle pieces and ribbons and walks and undoubtedly some will remain lit up blue well into the summer months. \n\n\n\nAwareness in itself is neither good nor bad. But combine the word with \u201cautism\u201d and Google it. What you will find will have little to do with the concerns of autistic people and everything to do with fear. \n\n\n\nAutism Awareness is all about how many of us there are and what should be done about it, and to whom you can give your money. Attention to detail will show you where the money goes.\n\nThis April, some better, more important, forms of awareness have been in the air. At long last, attention from major media sources is being directed toward the horrors of the Judge Rotenberg Center in Massachusetts. People watch Fox News and read Time Magazine who do not read blogs by autistic adults. \n\n\n\nAttention: People are being tortured in the name of treatment. \n\n\n\nLives are at stake.\n\n\n\nIt is possible that the next time I talk to a group, when I ask who has heard of JRC, someone will raise a hand. That would represent progress. There is a lot of work that will need to be done to keep JRC in the public eye long enough for demand to grow to finally shut it down. This problem must not be pushed aside in the flurry of \u201cawareness.\u201d \n\n\n\nAttention is a strength for many autistic people. Only you call it preoccupation or obsession or something else slightly or very judgmental.\n\nSee that autistic child, turning in circles, going on about robots again?\n\nYou call it perseveration, you miss the point.\n\nThis is his way of being, not an error. \n\nAttention.\n\nThis is an opportunity.

For the last eight years of his employment there, he was made to wear a bright red helmet, lest golfers confuse him with some other, regular, you know, non-autistic green keeper. Eight years he endured this and other forms of workplace bullying that included physical assault, ridicule, and being denied adequate breaks from heavy physical labor. Finally, in 2007, he began missing work and was fired by the club.Now Andrew Beck, 44, has been awarded \u00a378,000 in damages. Mr. Beck\u2019s father, Arnold Beck, said that his son\u2019s employers \u201cnever made an effort to find out anything about autism disorders. If they had done that he would probably still be working there\u2026Hopefully it will make employers think twice about how they treat people.\u201d How do things like this happen? While Arnold Beck points out that golf clubs can be \u201cnotoriously stuffy and old-fashioned,\u201d Renee at Womanist Musings calls the situation a study in ableism, acknowledging also the complicity of coworkers who knew about the abuse, but remained silent.Over time, unchallenged abuse becomes the norm. The autistic employee, often someone who has faced bullying and exclusion for many years, may not be certain of his rights. He may not have a friend in the workplace to help him figure it out. He may have been advised not to rock the boat, when so few on the spectrum are fully employed. Bullying happens when some members of a society are viewed in some contexts as less than full citizens. With each press release declaring that autistic people are \u201csick,\u201d or \u201cdamaged,\u201d or \u201ccostly,\u201d exclusion grows. With each self-advocate threatened or harassed, abuse becomes somewhat less unthinkable, slightly more ordinary. I am happy that Andrew Beck has received compensation, some measure of justice for what he endured. Here\u2019s hoping his next employer is more deserving of the loyalty and perseverance he showed on the last job. Meanwhile, Nick Marner, the head green keeper responsible for the abuse, is still employed by the Davyhulme Park Golf Club. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5850313/Autistic-greenkeeper-wins-damages-after-boss-forced-him-to-wear-red-helmet.html", "http://www.womanist-musings.com/", "http://www.womanist-musings.com/2009/06/study-in-ableism.html"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/07/bright-red-helmet.html", "title": "\nA bright red helmet\n"},

Autistic people need and deserve to be fully included in society.S.E.: You are not autistic.Bev: I am autistic, but even if I were not, there are still autistic people who need support and accommodations that they are not getting, and who deserve lives free of abuse and exclusion.S.E.: Do you think that maybe vaccines are responsible for the increase in autism?Bev: No. I think that the Judge Rotenberg Center needs to be closed immediately.S.E.: Why do you reject all treatments for autism?Bev: I reject the idea that \u201cautism\u201d itself is something that can (or should) be eliminated. I reject treatments that are unethical, inhumane, or lacking in evidence, whatever they claim to treat. I support OT, speech therapy, physical therapy, etc. where appropriate. I support treatment of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and other medical conditions whether these occur in autistic or non-autistic people. I support special diets, supervised by real physicians, for people who have diagnosed food allergies.S.E.: So you are against a cure!Bev: There is no \u201ccure\u201d for autism. I am against the marketing of quackery. Unproven treatments like HBOT, chelation, Lupron, etc. do not cure autism and can harm autistic people (and also their families who go into debt to pay for these scams). What I am for is helping autistic people learn skills they need in ways that respect their unique learning styles.S.E.: So, according to you, all research into autism should be stopped!Bev: I would like to see some of the money that is spent researching possible causes of autism be put into developing alternate means of communication for those who need it. I\u2019d like to see AAC made available to all who might benefit. I'd like to see some of the money raised in the name of \"Autism Awareness\" go into training employers, teachers, first responders, police, doctors and others who will find themselves in positions of power, however momentarily, over autistic people. I\u2019d like to see major autism groups actually listening to the needs of autistic people rather than trying to prevent more autistic people being born.But back to what I was saying\u2026autistic people are routinely abused in institutions. Judge Rotenberg Center is not the only one, but closing it down would be a good place to start.S.E.: People bang their heads because they are autistic. They need to be institutionalized.Bev.: I have a history of hitting myself in the head. I can tell you that every single time I have done this, it was because I lacked a better way of saying what I needed to say.S.E.: This conversation is not about people like you.Bev: I know that. I am aware. I am more and more aware of this every day.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/AAC.htm"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/05/cross-purposes-composite-conversation.html", "title": "\nCross Purposes: A Composite Conversation\n"},

Whatever you believe, you have surely noted the recent media attention paid the sudden increase in the disorder called \u201cawareness.\u201d Not to be confused with its un-quotation-marked cousin, awareness, this is an insidious condition threatening to numb the minds and consciences of the multitudes through an endless parade of meaningless rhetoric. Worst of all, you may have this condition and not even know it! While \u201cawareness\u201d manifests in a variety of forms, for purposes of this article, we will focus on autism \u201cawareness,\u201d one of the most prevalent varieties. Here is a brief quiz to determine your \u201cawareness\u201d quotient.True or False:1) You have more than one (1) of the following \u201cawareness\u201d promoting items in your possession: ribbon; t-shirt; bumper sticker; button; clock; potholder; corkscrew; coat rack; exercise bicycle; cat litter scoop.2) You have heard that some autistic people find the awareness ribbon offensive. You don\u2019t understand why, so you continue to display the ribbon.3) You have been told directly that some autistic people find the awareness ribbon offensive. You understand exactly why, but you can name two or three autistics who disagree, so you continue to display the ribbon.4) You have been told that some autistic people find the awareness ribbon offensive, and you do understand why, but they are wrong, and you are right, so you continue to display the ribbon.5) Your own autistic child has expressed unhappiness about the ribbon, but you continue to display the ribbon. 6) You make every effort to sell or otherwise distribute the ribbons at community events, some of which have nothing to do with autism. 7) When asked to explain what \u201cawareness\u201d means to you, you mumble something about tragedy and \u201cneeding to find a cure.\u201d8) Your definition of \u201cautism\u201d has little to nothing in common with the recognized diagnostic criteria.It is important to remember that \u201cawareness\u201d is a spectrum disorder. To judge your own level of \u201cawareness,\u201d first answer questions listed above. For each item endorsed (true), add points according to this scale: Number 1 = 1 point; 2 = 2 points; 3 = 2 points; 4 = 3 points; 5 = 5 points; 6 = 2 points; 7 = 2 points; 8 = 3 points.Your score:1-3: Typically \"aware\"4-8: \u201cAwareness\u201d Not Otherwise Specified9-12: High functioning \u201cawareness\u201d13 and over: Severely \u201caware\u201dDo not despair! There is hope a clue will be found. Please use the new ribbon pictured below to let everyone know that you are now \u201caware\u201d of the \u201cawareness\u201d epidemic. And don\u2019t forget to do your \u201cresearch.\u201dThis public service announcement was made possible by ABFH, who pointed out the need for this new \"awareness\" ribbon, based on information about the (puzzling) ribbon culture found in this post at Autism Vox. Thank you ABFH, and Kristina Chew.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/all-they-really-to-know-they-learned-at-google-u/", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autismvox.com/the-puzzling-ribbon-culture/"], "link": "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2008/04/you-may-already-be-aware.html", "title": "\nYou may already be \"aware\"\n"}
